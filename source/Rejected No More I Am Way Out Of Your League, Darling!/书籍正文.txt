###Chapter 1 Murder



On the day the Bennett and Harper families united through marriage, the heavens seemed to unleash their fury,coloring the sky with the deep crimson of roaring flames.


Daniela Harper, clad in her wedding finery, watched in despair as her groom, Alexander Bennett, heroically swept Joyce Holt into his arms and navigated through the scorching heat, not once glancing back at her.


Trapped beneath a massive, fallen screen, Daniela was rendered immobile by its weight, her eyes brimming with tears of frustration and fear.



The air was thick with acrid smoke, and as Daniela struggled for breath, the encroaching shadows of unconsciousness began to cloud her vision, the grim thought of perishing in the blaze gnawing at her mind.


Yet, just as hope seemed to flicker out, a figure emerged through the smoke.


Strong arms lifted her effortlessly, and the steady,reassuring thud of her rescuer's heartbeat against her ear brought an odd solace amidst the chaos.


Suddenly, a piercing hiss cut through the muffled sounds of destruction.



The unmistakable, horrific odor of burning flesh assaulted her senses.



Heart pounding with a mix of fear and confusion,Daniela mustered the strength to pry her eyes open,only to be met with a suffocating veil of smoke that obscured her vision and deepened her terror.



As she fumbled blindly through the darkness,her fingers brushed against something sticky and unsettling. Instinctively, the man bearing her weight recoiled, yet he relaxed soon, permitting her hands to explore without restraint.



The wind screamed in her ears, relentless and chilling.


Gradually, the fierce warmth that had scorched her face began to dissipate.



Struggling against the heaviness of her eyelids, she strained to identify her rescuer.



Through the swirling smoke that clouded her vision,she glimpsed a distinctive mole near the man's eye-a mole that stirred a vague sense of recognition within her.



As the edges of her consciousness began to blur once more, Daniela heard a gentle voice cut through the howling wind. "Sir, the ambulance has arrived. The Harper family is already aboard. We must get moving right away. Your arm requires urgent care, and moreover, today marks Miss Harper's wedding. If people see her with another man, it'll become the talk of the town."







Daniela stirred from her uneasy slumber in the stark,frigid confines of a plain hospital ward.



The moon loomed large outside,bathing everything in its ghostly, somber light. The room lay shrouded in silence, devoid of the presence of her newlywed husband.



Her injuries were grievous: a cracked rib and a deep,ragged cut marred her left cheek. The doctor had cautioned that without meticulous care, the gash could etch a lasting scar on her face.


As dawn broke, the doctor returned to assess her condition.



Glancing around the empty room, he queried,"Where's your family?"


Daniela shook her head with a bitter smile. She had tried to reach Alexander many times, but he hadn't answered.


 
Exhaling a sigh, the doctor advised, "Try to keep still; moving too much could worsen your injuries. If there's no one to assist you, l'll arrange a caregiver for you."



At that moment, a young nurse chimed in, "Aren't you the bride from that fire incident that hit the headlines?Isn't your husband here with you?"



The conversation caught the attention of the head nurse, who coughed slightly, gesturing to silence her colleague. Leaning closer, she murmured, "He's actually upstairs, attending to someone else."


The young nurse's eyes widened in disbelief. "What?But the girl merely sustained a minor scratch on her hand!"



Daniela was the one desperately in need of care.



The head nurse shook her head. "There's an entire team upstairs fussing over her. It's so unjust, isn't it?"


In that instant, a wave of humiliation and despair crashed down upon Daniela. Perched on the edge of the hospital bed, she felt her blood turn to ice, her frame shivering subtly.


Leaning against the wall for support, she made her way upstairs to the exclusive, high-class ward.



Pausing at the doorway, she saw the man she had cherished for a decade feeding her stepsister,Joyce.Their gazes locked, and the connection was palpable.Her stepmother, Katrina Harper, clasped her hand over her mouth, tears sparklingin her eyes. "Caiden,could this be karma? Are my past mistakes haunting our daughter now?"



Caiden Harper, Daniela's biological father and Katrina's spouse, gently touched Katrina's shoulder to comfort her. "No, this was merely an unfortunate incident.None of this is your fault."


"Dad! This was no accident; it was murder! Daniela resents that you and Alexander show her less affection than me. She's malicious. We were the only ones there during the fire, and she pushed me. She wanted me gone."



After saying that, Joyce crumpled into Alexander's embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks as she wept uncontrollably.



Katrina gazed at her daughter's scratched hand before leaning closer to Caiden, seeking comfort in his arms.


"Caiden, Joyce might not share your blood, but she's embraced you as her true father. Who could have imagined such love would spell disaster for her? I've given up so much to keep Daniela content-I vowed to have no more children after marrying you. But it seems nothing will satisfy her. What else does she desire from me? She can take everything from me,even my life, if that's what she wants! But why does Joyce have to suffer? She's done nothing to deserve this."



Katrina's sobs were so intense, so filled with anguish,that an onlooker might have believed she was the one suffering a broken rib and a marred face.



Outside,hidden from view, Daniela overheard every venomous word aimed at her.



She watched, heartbroken, as the two men she cherished most-her father and her husband-lavished their attention on Joyce, neglecting to speak a word in her defense.



Her heart,already fragile, shattered into pieces.



Though her body screamed in protest, Daniela had fought to make it this far. Now, with her pain weighing her down, she turned back, each step slow and agonizing as she made her way back to her room.



After her mother's passing, she seemed to have lost her father as well.



Her husband, whom she had grown up with, had given his heart to another, leaving hers in tatters


Such a harsh betrayal of fate.


As darkness fell, Alexander reached her hospital room,holding a food container. He stopped abruptly at the door, his features carved with a sharp, cutting disdain, as though the very air inside disgusted him.



His eyes, cold and distant, pierced through her.



Summoning every ounce of strength, Daniela pushed herself upright, her voice heavy with a raw, aching despair. "I swear, I didn't push Joyce.She told me her wedding gift for me was in the storeroom. But as we entered, flames engulfed us, and the door was locked from the outside."



With a steely gaze and a hint of impatience,Alexander muttered, "Daniela, stop fooling yourself.There's no sense in pretending any longer. You've always resented Joyce for being everyone's favorite,but to sabotage our wedding day with such malice? |never thought you were capable of being this monstrous!"
###Chapter 2 Apologize To Joyce
With a calm and focused demeanor, Daniela explained the situation to Alexander, her voice ringing with clarity. "The warehouse had surveillance cameras.Even though the fire may have destroyed the cameras,there must be backups stored somewhere."



"Enough!" Alexander's eyes narrowed as he regarded Daniela, hs voice icy and tinged with anger. "Now you're just scrambling for excuses to get out of this.Surveillance footage can be manipulated. I can't trust a single word from you, you deceitful woman!"



Daniela locked eyes with Alexander.



His expression remained stoic, but his gaze was sharp and unwavering. Whenever he looked at someone, it seemed to pierce right through them.



For over a decade, Daniela had clung to the naive hope that she might thaw his icy heart. But she never anticipated it would end like this.



"Go and apologize to Joyce right now!"



His command cut through the air like a chill wind,leaving Daniela feeling as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped on her,her senses reeling.



"I'm your wife! Why won't you believe me?" she demanded, her words breaking with the weight of her vulnerability.



"Daniela,I've told you-apologize! If Joyce decides to take this to court, you'll be the one left in tears,begging for mercy."



His cutting words felt like a jagged knife, tearing through the fragile walls of her heart.



This marriage, these ten years of what she thought was love and devotion, had all been a cruel farce. 3



With a sharp tug on her collar, Alexander yanked her towards Joyce's ward.



A nurse sprinted behind them, desperation lacing her voice. "Her rib is fractured. She needs proper care and rest. What you're doing is downright abusive."


Yet,Alexander blatantly disregarded her pleas.


Daniela faltered, nearly stumbling as he hauled her through the pristine hallways and into the exclusive VIP ward.



The room exuded a warm, tranquil aura. Joyce lay in the bed as Katrina, seated beside her, offered her pieces of fruit. Upon Daniela's entrance, Katrina shot her a fleeting glance then averted her eyes, feigning ignorance of her presence.



Caiden's expression twisted into one of revulsion."You have the audacity to show your face here! Are you even aware of your sister's condition?"


At this point, Daniela felt an icy numbness engulf her heart.



She turned to Caiden and inquired, "Dad, have you forgotten that I'm your own flesh and blood? Do you recall your vow never to remarry after Mom leftus?You promised to look after me. Is this how you do that?"



Her father wasn't even willing to allow her the opportunity to clarify or defend herself.


Caiden's expression wavered momentarily, his brow furrowing in annoyance as he directed a sharp gaze at Daniela. "You're the one who screwed up! Why are you dragging me into it? You've grown quite audacious, haven't you? To think, now you'd even stand up to me!"



In the hospital bed, Joyce appeared robust despite her alleged frailty.


With an exaggerated gesture, she pressed her hands  to her chest as if overwhelmed by a sudden loss of breath. "Do you want Dad to grow old and live the rest of his life completely alone, Daniela? Have you considered how lonely he'll be once you're married?Sitting alone in that huge house, with no one to care for him when he's sick or even pour him a glass of water?"



After that, Joyce turned to Alexander. "Alexander, do you honestly believe I'd start a fire just to end my own life?"



Alexander remained silent, absorbing the weight of the conversation. His face darkened with each passing second,reflecting a growing storm within.



He fixed a cold, unforgiving stare on Daniela and commanded sternly, "Daniela, kneel and beg Joyce for forgiveness!"



Daniela turned to face Alexander, her expression defiant.Why would she do that?






Suddenly, Katrina leapt from her chair and stormed over. Without a moment's hesitation, her hand swung through the air, landing a sharp slap across Daniela's cheek.



Stunned, Daniela could barely register the sudden assault before Katrina collapsed into a heap of raw nerves and tears. Pointing her finger at Daniela, Katrina yelled, "Daniela!You tried to kill my daughter! How can you stand there,unapologetic and accusing her instead? Oh, my poor girl! I'm to blame for everything. I never should've become a stepmother to another's child.It's all on me!I've kept you from the man your heart belongs to and dragged you into danger. I can't forgive myself for this!"



Caiden felt a sharp pang in his chest at Katrina's torment.



Driven by a surge of anger, he approached Daniela and delivered a firm slap too.


The impact sent her reeling back, her body hitting the wall as she struggled to maintain her balance.


Dazed, Daniela stood against the wall, her mind swirling with thoughts as tears blurred her vision.


She fixed her gaze on Alexander, a gleam of hope still lingering in her heart. ①



She silently pleaded for him to defend her, to offer even a single sentence in her favor.



However, Alexander's response shattered her last hope as he said sternly, "Apologize now! Or I'll have to call the police. You're facing charges of attempted murder, Daniela. That could mean life in prison."
###Chapter 3 | Did Nothing Wrong
"Alexander..."



Although Daniela had steeled herself for Alexander's answer,it still cut deeply, like a keen-edged blade tearing through her heart.



How many decades did one get to live, only to have it mean nothing?


She had devoted ten years of her existence to loving this man, investing her soul into the relationship.


Yet, what she received in return was merely his staunch defense of another woman.



"Yes, call the police!" Katrina's voice erupted in the room as she frantically reached for her phone. "Leave this murderer to them to handle!"



Amidst the chaos, only Daniela caught the subtle way Joyce squeezed Katrina's hand following her explosive declaration.



Their eyes met in a fleeting, silent exchange.


Katrina paused, her resolve wavering. Joyce's voice was the epitome of consideration."Alexander, I know you care for me, but this is a matter for our family. Calling the police could lead to my sister's arrest and tarnish the Harper family's reputation. That's the last thing I desire. Perhaps it's best if we..."


She trailed off, her head bowing slightly, her delicate pose belying the cunning glimmer in her gaze."Perhaps it's best if we just let this go."


Her suggestion stirred Caiden and caused Alexander's brow to furrow in contemplation.


His cold eyes bore into Daniela as he spoke with chilling authority. "We can't just let this go! Apologize now! Kneel and beg for forgiveness!"


Despite the sharp agony emanating from her cracked rib,Daniela stood her ground,her spine rigid, unwilling to show any sign of defeat.


In that harrowing moment, a cruel truth crystallized in her mind: her anguish was merely amusement to someone who held no love for her.


"I've already told you, I did nothing wrong! I am innocent, and I refuse to kneel or apologize!"


She had just finished speaking when Caiden closed the distance between them and delivered another harsh  slap to her face.


Reeling from the blow, Daniela, already fragile,teetered dangerously, her form shaking like a leaf in a tempest. Before she could regain her footing, a brutal kick struck her in the back.


With a resonant "thud," she collapsed onto her knees.


The sound of her kneecaps crashing against the hard floor reverberated around the room, sending a jolt of excruciating pain that surged from her knees to her chest.


She braced herself with her palms against the floor.Blood started to ooze through the bandages wrapped around her chest, turning them a stark, vivid red. 2


At the doorway, the nurse could no longer stand to watch the scene unfold.



She rushed over to aid Daniela, then turned to Alexander with a look of stern condemnation. "I've seen the reports. You're Daniela's husband, aren't you?Once you're married, you're supposed to protect each other. How can you treat her with such cruelty? She's seriously hurt, and without proper care, this injury could haunt her for the rest of her life."



"I'd never accept someone so vicious as my wife."Alexander threw a frosty, scornful look at Daniela,who lay crumpled on the floor. His gaze was icy, seeingher as nothing more than a mere fleck of dust on his shoe. "Daniela, today's incident cannot simply be ignored. Joyce may be forgiving, but your actions were severe, and you need to face the consequences.You will kneel here until you acknowledge your mistake!"



He then addressed Caiden."Mr. Harper,you surely see the need for this,don't you?"


With a sharp nod, Caiden agreed, "Absolutely,she needs to reflect deeply. I'm all for it."


At that moment, a doctor summoned the family members, and the room quickly emptied, leaving behind only Daniela and Joyce.


Perched haughtily on the hospital bed, Joyce looked down at Daniela, who was still kneeling, her hands quivering as she supported herself. A derisive smirk played on Joyce's lips.


"Daniela, does it even matter that you're Dad's biological child? Look at yourself, kneeling before me.I like Alexander, and if he's not mine, he sure as hell won't be yours!"


Secretly, Daniela slid her left hand into her pocket and pressed the record button on her phone.


Her pallid complexion was drenched with sweat,each drop trailing down her damp and strained forehead. Holding Joyce's gaze, she demanded in a steady,clear voice, "So, it was you behind the fire all along,wasn't it?"
###Chapter 4 Let's Get A
Divorce



"Yes,I did it! The warehouse was drenched in gasoline,packed with explosives, all set to go up in flames the second you showed up." Joyce gloated triumphantly,her voice dripping with arrogance. "And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do, Daniela? NNo one's going to believe you. They'll think the footage is manipulated! Besides, I've already wiped it clean.Dad and Alexander made it painfully clear today-they think you're useless, not worth even a shred of trust."


With that, Joyce reclined on the hospital bed, a smirk playing across her face.


"Keep kneeling," she commanded smugly and crossed her legs. "Daniela, you're going to kneel before me like this forever!"



Daniela attempted to rise, her body straining against an invisible weight.


Beads of sweat pooled on the floor, dampening the tiles beneath her.



Her heart felt shattered, yet within the shards, a stubborn spark of hope flickered dimly. She had clung to the belief that Alexander, with his meticulous nature, would eventually see through the charade if he scrutinized the details more closely.


But reality was a cruel master. She had given Alexander too much credit.


The sound of Alexander's leather shoes echoed ominously as he approached. He towered over her,his gaze icy and unyielding. "Are you ready to apologize now?"



Pain overwhelmed Daniela, her consciousness wavering. She tilted her head to meet his eyes,her voice a faint whisper. "Have you considered every angle of this situation thoroughly?"


A scornful laugh echoed above her, chilling in its disdain.



His contempt was palpable, wrapping around her like an unrelenting frost.


"Daniela, stop being so pathetic. Just own up to what you've done already. Fine. Let's end this marriage. I'm done wasting my life on someone as malicious as you."


At his words, Daniela's rigid posture crumbled.Desolation engulfed her heart.


"For the last time, I'm innocent."Summoning the last remnants of her strength, Daniela leaned against the wall to pull herself upright.


Though her face was gaunt, her eyes glimmered with an indomitable spirit. She fixed her gaze on Alexander,articulating each word with precision. "Fine by me.I'll gladly take the divorce. Why would I want a husband too blind to see the truth?"



Daniela retreated to her shared ward.



Murmurs from a few patients fluttered around her.With her own phone inoperable, she borrowed one from a neighboring patient.


Instead of making a call, she simply sent a text message.


"Lillian, send people to Northpoint Hospital to come get me."


Without delay, Lillian replied, "Right away!"



Daniela's condition was deteriorating. By the time Lillian Dawson reached her, a severe fever had set in.



The persistent throb of her fractured rib was unrelenting, and her face was so severely swollen,it resembled an inflated balloon.



Lillian seethed with rage. "Have they lost their minds?
Choosing that worthless bitch over you? Let me handle this-I'll put an end to them!"



Without hesitation, she took out her phone and began to dial.



However,Daniela,despite her frailty, placed her hand over Lillian's, pressing the end call button.


Lillian clenched her fists, her voice heavy with desperation. "This is outright domestic abuse! You've been hurt! Are you seriously considering forgiving Alexander after everything he's done?"


Her eyes then caught the glimpse of fresh blood oozing through Daniela's bandages, and tears began streaming down her face.


With Lillian's support, Daniela pushed herself to stand."Let's get out of here for now. We'll deal with them when the timne is right."


Observing Daniela's weakened state, Lillian nodded,her tears mingling with a fierce resolve.


She vowed to tear that despicable pair apart piece by piece.


Lillian then went to take care of the hospital discharge forms. 


Outside, Daniela stood waiting, lifting her gaze towards the hospital's upper floors.


The opulent third-floor ward still glowed brightly.


Inside, Alexander was nestled under the soft lamp's light, peeling an apple. A warm smile played on his lips as he chatted with the woman beside him.



Daniela managed a strained, sorrowful smile.



Ten long years, and the warmth of that smile she desperately sought had never once been hers.


Joyce,however, had earned it effortlessly.


Daniela realized she had been wrong all this time.


She could no longer stand on her own.



Before she collapsed, she saw Lillian rushing towards her,her face etched with worry.


Before long, Daniela was hurried into the intensive care unit.	


The icy IV fluid seeped into her veins, lulling her into a profound slumber.


When she finally woke up, two days had slipped by.


"Daniela! Are you alright?" Lillian's eyes, swollen and red,betrayed her vigil by Daniela's side. Daniela slowly propped herself up, her voice raspy as she replied, "Don't worry. I'm fine."


Following breakfast, Daniela glanced at her phone.



The online frenzy over "the bride from the fire" was overwhelming.



Criticism rained down on Daniela in the comments section.



Lillian exclaimed through clenched jaw, "We can't just let Joyce get away with this! The internet is praising her as beautiful and kind-hearted, declaring that she deserves to be the rightful heiress to the Harper family."


Daniela remained unfazed, her eyes skimming over the hurtful words. They no longer had the power to wound her.


For the first time, she felt the fog lift, leaving her with a piercing sense of clarity.


From this moment forward, she resolved to reserve her heart for those who truly loved her.


The old Daniela had perished in the flamnes.


The naive and deceived Daniela was gone, once and for all.

###Chapter 5 I Don't Want His Damned Money
The rumors online were spreading rapidly, each update adding more fuel to the fire. It seemed as if unseen hands were stoking the gossip, making it burn even brighter.



"No wonder people say being a stepmother is a challenge. And even her biological daughter doesn't have it easy either. Daniela must be the mastermind behind the fire incident, trying to take Joyce out!"


"Exactly! Did you hear that Daniela is indulging in some fancy private hospital room that costs six grand a night? Her father and stepmother are at her beck and call, and her husband's there, peeling fruit for her like she's some queen. Meanwhile, poor Joyce is crammed into a room with five others, struggling even to get water!"



"No doubt about it-Daniela must have everything handed to her on a silver platter!"


"That's right. Daniela got out of the hospital already,but Joyce is still laid up there. I heard Joyce ended up with a broken rib and a scar on her face."



"Poor Joyce! Daniela's absolutely despicable! Justbecause she's the biological daughter, does she deserve royal treatment?"



Amidst the swirling vortex of distorted rumors, one comment in the online chaos stood out, shedding a different light on the situation. "I'm sharing a ward with five others at Northpoint Hospital, and Daniela was here with us. HHonestly, she's a genuinely nice person-beautiful, kind, and nothing like the spoiled heiress everyone makes her out to be. It's her husband who's the real piece of work!"



This comment was soon engulfed by a wave of dismissive responses, with critics sneeringly accusing Daniela of paying people to spread falsehoods.


The netizens jeered, dismissing the accusation as absurd.




Lillian, too, caught sight of the comment and huffed derisively, "Ridiculous! Daniela is a celebrated fashion titan, the visionary behind Elite Lux. If she hadn't thrown her future away on that scoundrel, she'd top the list of the world's wealthiest. What right do these nobodies have to judge?"


Meanwhile, Daniela remained unfazed by the online uproar, finding Lillian's indignant expression somewhat amusing.


"Are you seriously laughing, Daniela? You're going to let these keyboard warriors hired by Joyce defame you?"


Daniela held up her phone, the recording on full display, and smirked. "Definitely not."



Lillian's eyes popped wide open in surprise."What?"


Placing her phone back into her pocket, Daniela declared nonchalantly, "I've decided-it's time to file for a divorce."



She spoke with a chilling calmness, her voice devoid of any trace of emotion.


Lillian's mouth fell open in shock.


With a playful grin, Daniela nudged Lillian's chin up."Have the legal department prepare a divorce agreement for me."


A gleam of excitement flashed across Lillian's face."Are you for real? You're not joking,right?"


Daniela merely raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.



Lillian nearly leaped from her chair, her eyes wide with disbelief. "You've actually come to your senses? I was starting to think you'd let that piece of trash ruin you forever." Lillian put her hand over her heart in an exaggerated gesture, which elicited a burst of laughter from Daniela.



"Was I really that hopeless before?"


Lillian's expression turned earnest as she nodded vigorously. "Absolutely. You were lost."


Daniela let out a chuckle, reflecting on her past.


Indeed, she had been consumed by love for Alexander for ten long years, an entire decade lost in hopeless yearning.


For his slightest attention, she had repeatedly humbled herself, longing for even a sliver of his affection.1



Moved by Daniela's newfound realization, Lillian wiped away a tear and reached out to the company's legal team.



The lawyer, sleeves rolled up and ready for action,inquired seriously, "What compensation do you seek from Alexander?"



With a composed, icy gaze, Daniela replied firmly,"I don't want his damned money!"



"Exactly!" Lillian affirmed with a nod. Daniela had faced the world on her own terms since she lost her mother at the tender age of five. Over the years, she crafted a successful brand that catapulted her into a billionaire status long before she reached adulthood. The thought of needing anything from Alexander was almost comical to her.



Those who scorned Daniela were foolish, thinking she was cut from the same weak cloth as Joyce-a woman with no ambition, content to cling to her family and wait for marrying into a rich family.


How utterly ridiculous!


After departing from the hospital, Daniela promptly reached out to Alexander,her determination unshaken.



The phone rang several times before his secretary picked up with a sniff.



"Daniela? What is it this time?" the secretary asked,his voice dripping with condescension. He was well aware of Alexander's disregard for Daniela and didn't bother to mask his own contempt.


"I need to speak with Alexander," Daniela replied, her voice steady and accustomed to the dismissive attitudes of those employed by Bennett Group.



The secretary cast a glance towards Alexander, who was currently engaged in a close conversation with Joyce.


Joyce seemed to be almost attached to Alexander,her body leaning into his.


"Mr. Bennett is currently in a meeting," the secretary lied smoothly.


Without missing a beat, Daniela responded, "Tell him to meet me at the courthouse at eight tomorrow morning. We're finalizing the divorce."

###Chapter 6 Welcome Back



As Alexander entered, he noticed his secretary had just ended a phone call.


In a casual tone, he inquired, "Who was on the line?"


The secretary,seemingly indifferent, responded, "It was Daniela. She's demanding a divorce and has even scheduled a court session for tomorrow morning at eight."


As words hung in the air, Joyce couldn't help but sneer inwardly.


Given Daniela's deep affection for Alexander, could she truly be serious about a divorce?



Despite her skepticism, Joyce kept up her innocent act.



She clung to Alexander's arm, pressing herself against him, and spoke with a seductive lilt. "I'm to blame,aren't I? Daniela must be upset that you were so attentive to me while I was hospitalized. She's obviously jealous. Perhaps I should apologize to her."


Alexander's soothing touch comforted Joy ce. "Don't let this get to you. None of this is your fault. Daniela can be quite petty. She wants a divorce? Fine, I'll go to the courthouse tomorrow and see if she really means it!" -



With an exaggerated look of surprise, Joyce tilted her head and replied, "Alexander, don't act rashly. How could she really want to divorce you? She's just trying to intimidate you. If you really agreed to divorce her,she'd be embarrassed. Don't go, okay?"



Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark with irritation. "If I don't go, she'll keep using divorce to threaten me. Who the hell can stand that?Furthermore, the fire was entirely her doing. Joyce,you didn't deserve this, and I'll make sure Daniela owns up to it."


Joyce bowed her head, a picture of submission,choosing to remain silent.


Unbeknownst to those present, a chilling, sinister smirk briefly danced across her lips following Alexander's declaration.



That very day, Alexander's secretary laid out the freshly delivered divorce agreement on his desk.



Upon returning from his meeting, Alexander flicked his gaze over the document's cover and dismissed it with a cold, disdainful toss into the trash.



Daniela had taken things too far, and this was the final straw.



Meanwhile, having delivered the divorce agreement,Daniela retreated to her hotel, a smug sense of finality in her stride.



She had always imagined that parting ways wwith Alexander would shatter her,leaving her heart in ruins.


Yet, as the decisive moment unfolded, the only sensation that enveloped her was a profound,liberating relief.



She had held on to the hollow fantasy of loving Alexander for so long that she'd fooled herself into thinking he was all she had.


Yet, leaving him proved surprisingly simpler than anticipated.


With a sniffle, she was about to enter the hotel.



Raising her eyes, she stopped dead, struck by astonishment.



Gathered before her at the entrance stood the core members of Elite Lux's design team.


These were the very individuals who had placed their unwavering trust in Daniela, a minor, when the company was just blossoming. They had stood by her side, except when she had chosen to marry Alexander.



They had cautioned her then, adamant that Alexander was not the man for her, but she had dismissed their concerns outright.


She had clung to the belief that true love justified any sacrifice, crossing any distance, with no regrets. ②


Now, reflecting on those times, she recognized her naivety.



Facing her team, Daniela's lips twitched into a subtle smile, and her eyes shimmered with tears,overwhelmed by the flood of memories.


Standing before her, the group formed a perfect row,their joyful faces lighting up the space. "Welcome back!"


Within the confines of the hotel, Lillian approached Daniela after the others went to their own rooms."Daniela, when do we leave?"



Elite Lux had its headquarters situated far overseas.



"Get Ryan here," Daniela instructed briskly.



Lillian was confused.



"While this marriage has to end, I must clear my name too," Daniela explained.



Lillian strode across the hallway, pushed open the door opposite Daniela's, and called out, "Ryan,Daniela needs you."


Ryan Parker's brilliance lay in his obsession with technology, spending most of his time secluded in a server room. But today, he was here for one reason-to welcome Daniela.


Draped entirely in black, his hooded sweatshirt cast shadows over his face, leaving only his pale lips visible beneath the shroud. His complexion, stark and ghostly,gave him an unmistakable vampire-like aura.


"Daniela,what can I do for you?" Ryan's tone was calm,with a hint of curiosity.
###Chapter 7 Your Life Will Be Sailing Smoothly From H...
Daniela sent the recording to Ryan, declaring, "I want this recording and the surveillance footage broadcast across every media outlet for the entire week,starting tomorrow morning."



Ryan nodded and made an "OK" gesture.



As the sun began to rise, Daniela laced up for a morning jog, enjoying the calm solitude of the deserted streets. 8



Upon her return, she appeared rejuvenated, her skin glowing with the rush of her morning exercise.Meanwhile,Lillian emerged fromn her sleep, disheveled and bleary-eyed.


"Good morning, Daniela," she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.


Daniela changed into fresh attire. Stepping out, she caught sight of Lillian's groggy figure and advised,"Go back to bed. I'm heading out."



This roused Lillian fully, who called out energetically,"Your life will be sailing smoothly from here on."  Outside the courthouse, Daniela paused at the entrance, her presence undeniable in a stark white dress that highlighted her statuesque frame and accentuated her long legs. She commanded attention effortlessly, the bustling environment turning into a mere backdrop to her poise.



Bystanders,whether they were there to tie the knot or sever ties, found their gazes inadvertently drawn to her.



Across the street, parked under the sprawling shade of a large tree, Alexander sat in his car, observing the scene.



He couldn't help but scowl at the admiring looks Daniela received from passersby.


As Daniela waved off the tenth man asking for her number, Alexander flung open his car door and stepped out.



Watching him approach from afar, Daniela noted the familiar cold,detached expression etched across his face. Such indifference once pained her, but now,it barely registered.



In a nonchalant tone, she declared, "Let's get going."


However,before she could move forward, Alexander reached out, capturing her wrist in his firm grasp. 
A frown marred Daniela's features, and with a quick tug, she freed herself, taking a step back.


The corners of Alexander's mouth turned down, his face clouding over with a mixture of anger and disbelief. "Daniela, don't test my patience. It's wearing thin!"



With a scornful laugh, Daniela retorted, "Soon, you won't have to tolerate me anymore. I've been here over three hours. Let's expedite this, shall we?"


Alexander's face darkened further, his tone edged with a dire warning. "Are you certain you want to go through with this divorce? Remember, Daniela, not everything in life offers a second chance."



Daniela's patience snapped, her frustration evident."You're right! Let's finalize this divorce soon."


She briskly collected two forms from a nearby clerk and began filling them out, her movements sharp and determined.



Alexander stood rigid, his eyes narrowing as he towered over her. "I'm offering you one last chance.Admit you were responsible for the fire that day.Kneel and apologize to Joyce. If you do,I might consider letting this all slide."



His expression was stern, his attitude dripping with condescension and righteousness.


"Don't waste your time. My knees don't bend for anyone," she declared as she slid the completed documents across to Alexander. "Just sign here."


Alexander's eyes narrowed as he scanned the papers;everything was in order except for their signatures.


A storm cloud seemed to settle over his face as raw anger ignited in his piercing gaze. "Daniela! Do you think this will intimidate me? Let me make this clear -if you want a divorce, don't expect to walk away with a dime of my money."


Unperturbed, Daniela pointed to the line for his signature,her voice cool and detached. "Oh, please.That pitiful amount? Let Joyce have it-it might cover her hospital bills one day."


A crease formed on Alexander's forehead as he mulled over her words. The thought of Daniela leaving without a settlement seemed unbelievable.


Nevertheless, Daniela promptly signed her name.Raising her eyes to meet his, she wore a taunting smile.


"What's the matter? Getting cold feet? Or are you just realizing you're not ready to lose me after all?"she spat, her words slicing with sarcastic cruelty.


Alexander was about to reply when Daniela abruptly  cut him off,raising her hand with an air of finality. Her voice was sharp, laced with clear disdain. "Save your nonsense. The idea of sharing a man with another woman makes my skin crawl-it's pathetic."



This remark set Alexander's blood boiling. His eyes narrowed into a hard glare, and his voice turned frosty as he spoke. "Is this truly what you want?" ①



As Daniela's serene expression held steady,Alexander felt a surge of resolve. Clearly, she needed to learn her lesson.



If she thought she could leave him and come back like nothing happened, she was living in a fool's dream.



Once this divorce was finalized, her life wouldn't be so easy. Even crawling on her knees wouldn't fix the mess she's made.



With a firm grip, Alexander took hold of the pen and inked his name onto the agreement. The procedure unfolded with brisk efficiency, the staff wrapping up the formalities in a blink.



Moments later, their divorce was finalized.



Nearby, a group of onlookers voiced their astonishment.



"Can you believe it? Even a woman as breathtaking as her is getting divorced. Where's the fairness in that?" "I'd love to know which fool is wvilling to divorce her.He must have been out of his mind."



"Look at this guy-nothing out of the ordinary.Why do the most radiant women settle for such a man?"



"Such a shame!"



"Miss, thinking about another shot at marriage?I know a few top-tier CEOs. Trust me, they'd treat you way better than this joker!"


Daniela offered a gracious smile, her expression cloaked in politeness as she thanked him.


Turning away,her gaze fell upon Alexander. He was a little distance away, his features twisted into a severe frown.



Daniela dismissed his sullen mood with a mere glance.Just as she was about to step away, her wrist was seized once more.



Annoyance marred Daniela's features as she wrenched her wrist back.



Alexander's tone was icy, the chill in his words unmistakable. "Daniela, do you really think that throwing a fit and divorcing me will erase all our problems? Do you have any idea how much Joyce has been suffering? She's been haunted by nightmares from that fire for days. You should kneel before her and beg for forgiveness. It's time to own up to your mistakes!"



Daniela stood frozen, a shiver tracing her spine as his words sank in. For a heartbeat, the world seemed to pause,her blood running cold.



She met his gaze, the man she had known for over a decade,yet in that moment, he felt like a stranger.


A sigh escaped her lips, soft and weary, yet her eyes began to twinkle with a defiant spark.


"Alexander, I couldn't agree more. People should pay the price for their mistakes."






A slow, knowing smile curled the corners of her lips.Joyce couldn't escape the consequences that were coming her way.
###Chapter 8 Video Released



Elite Lux's aircraft soared into the sky an hour later,leaving the familiar landscapes of the country far below.



Daniela remained seated quietly in the opulent cabin,her eyes cast downward in contemplation.



By now, she surmised that the headlines and buzz in Olisvine were likely ablaze with the leaked audio and the footage of the fire.



She had delivered the response Alexander had been pressing for.



From that point forward, their connection was severed -no obligations, no bonds, absolutely nothing lingered between them.



Meanwhile,back at the headquarters of Phillips Group,the oppressive silence in the boardroom shattered with an unexpected knock.



The executives whipped their heads around, eyes wide with disbelief at the boldness of the secretary daring to disturb the solemnity.



After all, the memory was still fresh of the previous secretary who had interrupted Cedric Phillips' meeting,now enduring a bleak reassignment in Antarctica. 



While the executives silently sent their condolences to the unfortunate soul, the secretary confidently closed the distance to the stoic Cedric and whispered something.



"Really?" A flicker of relief passed over Cedric's usually rigid expression, a rare smile breaking through.


The room of executives fell into stunned silence,unable to utter a single word.



With a firm nod, the secretary confirmed,"Yes, Mr.Phillips. They've completed the divorce proceedings."



A ripple of curiosity surged through the room, stirring the appetites of the executives who thrived on company gossip.



Divorce? Who got divorced? What in the world was happening?



Cedric abruptly stood and declared, "That concludes today's meeting. Kevin, arrange the next flight out to Elite Lux for me."



The room fell silent, shock etching the faces of the executives.



After Cedric left, an executive, driven by a blend of confusion and curiosity, reached out and grasped Kevin's arm. "This is unprecedented! A five-minute meeting? Where is Mr. Phillips off to so urgently?"


With a sly grin, Kevin responded, "If everything goes as planned, Mr. Phillips will be walking down the aisle in no time."



His words hung in the air, leaving a trail of astonishment among the listeners.







"Yes,I love Alexander!"



"I was behind that fire! I instructed someone to douse the place with gasoline, and I was the one who set it ablaze. I intended to ruin your wedding to Alexander!"



"So what if you're Dad's biological daughter? Anything you own, I'll snatch it away!"



"Daniela, does it even matter that you're Dad's biological child? Look at yourself, kneelng before me.And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do,Daniela? No one's going to believe you anyway!"6


"Your wedding is just the start. By the time I'm done,your whole life will be in shambles!"



Suddenly, the hashtag #TruthOfTheBridelnFire skyrocketed to prominence on social media. Audio  clips mingled with visuals of a blazing inferno circulated rapidly across various platforms.



Joyce was in the midst of a high-stakes executive meeting between Bennett Group and Harper Group when the controversial video caught her eye.


In a flurry of panic, she inadvertently pressed the play button, and instantly, her harsh and biting voice echoed through the conference room.



Upon realizing her blunder, she looked up to see over a hundred executives from both corporations fixed on her, their faces etched with loaded glares.


Joyce's cheeks flushed a deep scarlet as she frantically waved her hands, exclaiming, "That wasn't my voice! This is slander! It's a setup by Daniela to destroy my reputation.You see now-how malevolent she is! I'm contacting the police immediately!"



Half an hour later, an in-depth professional analysis of the video and audio surfaced online. The findings confirmed that the audio and surveillance footage were indeed genuine, with no signs of alteration or manipulation.



This disclosure struck Joyce like a brutal reprimand.



At last, Alexander grasped the true implications of Daniela's earlier statement-people should pay the price for their mistakes. But the fallout was merciless-Joyce facedan online storm of hatred, her name dragged through the mud



"Unbelievable! I've never seen such audacity from a stepdaughter!"



"The audacity to make the real daughter kneel? I can't decide if it's cruel or just plain ridiculous."



"And really, what gave Joyce the nerve to start a fire at her stepsister's wedding? So Daniela was the bride caught in the fire? All that slander, all those accusations, and now it's clear she did nothing wrong.How embarrassing for them."



"It's truly sad. After her mother's passing, Daniela has lost her father too. And let's be honest, would Joyce have dared such boldness if Caiden hadn't spoiled her?"



"Don't forget Alexander! His own wife was unjustly blamed, yet he sided with the one who lit the fire.What's happening between Joyce and Alexander,anyway?"



"Despicable man!"



As the torrent of online vitriol continued, someone abruptly shared an image.


Displayed was the divorce certificate of Alexander and Daniela.Underneath the photo, the consensus in the comments was clear. "Justice is served!"


Alexander perused the trending topics on his smartphone, his expression turning thunderous.


With a forceful thud, he hurled the phone onto the table and barked at his secretary, "What is the PR team even up to? Why wasn't I alerted before this scandal broke? These headlines have just splashed across the globe, and no one intervened?"


The secretary, with a lowered gaze, responded tentatively, "Mr. Bennett, these topics surged unexpectedly. Our team is actively addressing it.It appears hackers instigated this, and we've yet to neutralize it. The tech team is on it, and we anticipate a resolution shortly."



Alexander scoffed bitterly. It would be resolved shortly? Not instantly, not immediately,but shortly?By that time, the whole nation had witnessed it.



"Daniela, you've truly cornered me this time," he sneered under his breath, his anger barely contained.


Since she dared to cross the line like this, forgiveness would be a luxury she'd never see from him. 


As for rejoining the Bennett family? She'd better forget it-that door was slammed shut for good.
His rage simmered to a boil.


He positioned himself by the panoramic window, his stare icy and piercing. His brows knit tightly together,his whole presence exuding a forbidding, frosty aura.



He was on the verge of telling his secretary to call Daniela when his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.



It was his father.



With a sense of foreboding, Alexander answered the call, only to be greeted by a barrage of anger."Alexander! Has Daniela gone absolutely insane?Everyone is badgering me about whether you've dumped Daniela to fool around with her stepsister!Where the hell is Daniela? I don't give a damn what you have to do-get those damn posts deleted now!"



Alexander's voice remained composed. "I understand."


His father, Richard Bennett, was far from pacified."Tell Daniela she's out of her goddamn mind if she thinks I'll ever forgive her for this!" 



The call terminated with an abrupt click, leaving a heavier frown on Alexander's face.



Now Daniela had truly incited Richard's wrath. It seemed she was courting disaster.
Alexander resolved then and there that she was on her own. No more would he be her protector-not now,not ever. 12



Today,Daniela had truly stirred up a storm


Alexander attempted to call her, but it went to voice mail.


Anger surged within him


What bullshit game was Daniela playing this time?



He thought to send her a message, only to realize he had been blocked.



As he contemplated his next move, his phone rang once more. It was none other than Caiden.


"Alexander! What the hell is wrong with Daniela?Joyce is at home sobbing like crazy now!" 
###Chapter 9 She Chose To Divorce Me

The comments online had grown so rampant that Caiden found himself unable to face the others.



People accused him of favoring his stepdaughter.Some questioned whether he derived some twisted pleasure from parenting another man's child.



Each biting comment sliced through Caiden's pride like a sharp blade. Some of them branded him a brazen social climber,suggesting he had ascended the societal ranks on the coattails of Daniela's deceased mother.Following her passing, he let her daughter bullied by his stepdaughter.  Critics mocked his so-called fragile masculinity,claiming he resorted to such demeaning tactics merely to uphold it



Caiden,seething with fury, shattered several cups at home and bellowed at Alexander, "Tell Daniela if she's not home by the end of the day, she's out of the family for good!"
Alexander responded, "I divorced Daniela today."
"What?" The room seemed to tilt around Caiden."Daniela divorced you? How dare she!" 
Alexander maintained his composure. Our divorce is all over the internet."



Staggered, Caiden clutched at his chest, his breath hitching as his legs folded beneath him.


Upon Alexander's arrival at the hospital, Katrina's loud sobs echoed down the hallway before he even stepped into the room.  As he entered, he noticed the pronounced veins throbbing on Caiden's forehead, a testament to his simmering rage.



The moment Caiden's eyes locked on Alexander, he lamented, "You have endured much. It is our disgrace that we raised such a ungrateful girl.Joyce has cleared up everything with us. The audio clip and footage are fabricated. She didn't say those things!" 



With tears streaming down her face, Katrina added,"Absolutely, they're nothing but lies! Alexander, don't fret over the divorce with Daniela. You and Joyce have grown up together. You two are a perfect match."



She then turned to Caiden, seeking confirmation."Isn't that right, dear?" Caiden nodded vigorously, his face a mask of firm agreement.



The intensity of his defense made it seem to any observer as though Joyce was his own flesh and blood.


"Indeed, it's well known that a marriage alliance exists between the Harper and Bennett families. Alexander,you could marry Joyce instead. That way, we'd still unite our families as intended."



Caiden nodded again, more eagerly this time. "Yes, I'm going to make a public declaration immediately,cutting ties with Daniela. From this moment forward,Joyceis my only daughter."



Overwhelmed, Joyce burst into tears and rushed into Caiden's embrace.



Between heavy sobs, she declared, "Dad, I will be a good daughter to you. I'll take care of you when you're old!"



Katrina dabbed at her eyes with a tissue in a theatrical display of emotion, and remarked to Alexander, "Look at the touching bond between father and daughter!"



Alexander stayed quiet throughout this exchange.



Joyce wiped away her feigned tears and turned to Alexander with a coy smile. "Alexander, when do you  think we should get married?"


Alexander's expression remained unreadable as he spoke in a flat tone. "I'll need to take this up with my family first."



Joyce's smile briefly wavered, revealing a flicker of disappointment before she recomposed herself,donning her charming mask once again.


With a soft, reassuring smile, she murmured,"Alexander, I'll do anything you ask-I'm here for you."


After Alexander stepped out of the hospital room,Joyce hurried after him, her posture meek, radiating a timid and vulnerable charm. Her eyes, reddened from emotion, conveyed a blend of sorrow and distress.



"Alexander, is it because I'm not my father's biological daughter that you hold back? Is that the real reason you won't marry me? Do you scorn me like the rest?" 



In her gestures and tone, Joyce mirrored Katrina,possessing an aura that seemed out of place among refined circles. Her eyebrows arched slightly in a manner that seemed contrived, her voice overly saccharine.



Alexander studied her face in contemplative silence for a long moment before he finally responded, "The audio and surveillance footage weren't tampered with.
I've had experts verify their authenticity."1


Joyce froze in place. She had not anticipated that Alexander would delve into the investigation himself.


She had assumed his unwavering support would shield her,never imagining that the erased footage might be restored.



She had underestimated Daniela.


Yet,with the truth now laid bare, denial was futile.


"Alexander, I'm begging you, please believe me-l had no other option!" Joyce implored, her hands concealing her tear-streaked face. Her voice quivered with desperation. "Daniela knew about my feelings for you and took delight in tormenting me behind the scenes. She branded me a misfit brought in by a stepmother, and mocked me for aiming too high,thinking I could ever aspire to be with someone like you.It drove me to the brink, and in a moment of sheer rage, I lashed out. I had no idea Daniela would stoop so low as to record everything. Alexander, I swear,I was driven to the edge." 2



Alexander's gaze fell on Joyce, her cheeks glistening with a cascade of tears.



He kept his thoughts to himself, his voice low and steady. "Now that you've seen Daniela's true colors,be more vigilant. You're already under scrutiny. Don't  make things harder for yourself." 


With that, he turned and walked away.



Joyce watched his departing figure, her eyes narrowing, a frosty expression settling over her face.


"Joyce, what's happening?" Katrina's voice broke through as she emerged from the hospital room.



"I had the perfect strategy lined up, but Daniela came up with evidence. I totally underestimated her. Never mind-she's out of Alexander's world, and my path to success is just starting to clear."


Joyce glanced briefly towards the hospital room, then leaned closer to Katrina, lowering her voice. "Mom,push Caiden to cut all ties with Daniela. Once he does,the Harper family will be within our reach."


Privately, Joyce never referred to Caiden as "Dad."


Her strategy was clear: claim the Harper family's wealth while Daniela was sidelined, thus preventing any future entanglements should she return.


As long as she wielded control over the Harper family fortune, the Bennett family would overlook her modest origins.



Then, securing a marriage with Alexander would be within reach. Katrina's smile held a hint of smug assurance."No need to worry. Caiden is fully wrapped around my finger."







The topic remained a hot issue online for over a week.



Ultimately, Harper Group had no choice but to enlist a third-party PR firm to handle the fallout.



However, merely an hour later, the controversy resurged, this time cementing its place in the public eye for a whole month.



Alexander, overwhelmed and exhausted, closed his eyes and demanded of the PR team, "What happened this time?"



It seemed these pesky trending topics simply refused to fade away.



The company staff responded with candid transparency, "Mr. Bennett, previously it was a technical glitch. This time, someone has deliberately brought it back."



Alexander's frustration boiled over, his voice piercing as he barked, "Who's behind it this time?"



The answer came back clear and direct. "My boss,  Cedric Phillips."



Consequently, the scandalous revelations about how Caiden had ousted his own daughter for a woman,and Alexander's affair with his wife's stepsister swept across the nation.



Within days, the stocks of both the two groups nosedived to an all-time low.



Driven to desperation, both families scoured for Daniela. Yet, she had disappeared, erased from the world as though she had never been part of it at all.



"Where the hell did she disappear to?" Caiden bellowed, his voice thick with rage. Harper Group had endured catastrophic losses recently, unlike anything before.



His eyes were bloodshot, a clear sign of his sleepless nights and boiling frustration.


The situation was dire. If things didn't turn around soon,he might have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.



Approaching Caiden cautiously, Joyce tried to soothe him. "Dad, try to stay calm. Daniela has always been stubborn. You know that."



Caiden's face flushed a deeper shade of red.



In a fit of fury, he sent Daniela a stern message, warning her that if she didn't address the chaos she'd caused online within three days, he would take the drastic step of disowning her publicly.



Meanwhile,Alexander had taken matters into his own hands by hiring a private investigator to track down Daniela. Yet, after two agonizing weeks, there was still no word from the investigator.



Katrina reached out to a lawyer.



On the same day,Harper Group made a bombshell announcement that rocked the internet. Caiden, acting as the president, officially disowned Daniela.



For Alexander, there was no familial bond with Daniela to sever, but the repercussions on the company's reputation were severe and undeniable.



He reached out to the investigator, his voice low and filled with dissatisfaction. "I've handed you a fortune,and you're telling me you can't track down a defenseless woman?"



The investigator was equally perplexed. "Mr. Bennett,our team ranks among the finest in the nation. If she's eluding us, she's out of reach for anyone. But I must ask-are you certain she is merely an ordinary woman?Could she perhaps be concealing a more formidable persona beneath her unassuming exterior? How else could she vanish without a trace?" With a deep sigh, Alexander squeezed his eyes shut,his mounting irritation finally breaking through.



Daniela was a woman everyone dismissed as a pathetic,lovesick fool. What secret could someone so pitiful possibly be hiding?



Over the last decade, the most extreme thing Daniela had ever done was love him fervently. What other feats could she have accomplished?



If it turned out Daniela did harbor some secret identity,he would swallow his arrogant claims whole. 8



"Mr. Bennett, should we consider engaging another private investigator?" Alexander's secretary offered."It's been quite some time. Maybe something has happened to her."



Positioned by the panoramic window, Alexander surveyed the teeming city streets below, his expression detached.



"Forget it. She's the one who wanted the divorce, so whatever mess she's in now is her own problem,not mine."
###Chapter 10 Did You Offend Mr.Phillips
Three months had passed when a stunning headline captured everyone's attention in Olisvine.



"Breaking News! Landmark of Olisvine Acquired by Mysterious Magnate!"



The elite of the city were abuzz, their conversations brimming with intrigue and wild guesses.


"Can you believe it? Someone is rich enough to snag Olisvine's iconic Luxor Tower!"



"Didn't the owner, Cyrus Bradley, say it would be a wedding gift for his daughter? Why would he part with it?"



"Money speaks volumes, and everything comes with a price tag," Lucian Chavez, the CEO of a major hardware firm,remarked with a smirk, illustrating with a hand gesture. "I've heard the offer was so staggering that Cyrus couldn't refuse. The property was in someone else's hands the very next day."



A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.



"| can't believe this!"

A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.



"| can't believe this!"
As he strode towards the door to take the call, it burst open unexpectedly.
A cold breeze swept past him, and the first thing he noticed was a dark, imposing figure entering the room.Looking up, Alexander realized the man was very tall.


Chairs clattered against the floor as others stood hastily, their voices a mixture of awe and excitement."Mr. Phillips! Oh, what a pleasure to have you grace us with your presence!"



Holding his phone with a firmer grip, Alexander stepped aside, yet his eyes remained momentarily fixed on the newcomer, whose chilling presence suggested a stern warning to those unacquainted.


Coming back to his senses, Alexander finally spoke into the phone. "Dad, what's going on?"


Richard's voice crackled with enthusiasm through the phone. "Did you hear? The Luxor Tower has been bought by Elite Lux's president!" His tone was low, as though he was wary of eavesdroppers.


"Have you ever heard of Elite Lux? It's the crown jewel among transnational design firms, with a valuation in the billions. Undeniably, they are the best of the best! Imagine the boundless opportunities if we could establish a connection with Elite Lux. Alexander,word has it that the president of Elite Lux will be visiting Luxor Tower tomorrow to review the renovations. I want you to bring our company's top-notch design portfolio and try to spark a partnership.
Even if it doesn't result in a collaboration, just catching the eye of Elite Lux's CEO could unlock a lot of opportunities for us in the future!"



Alexander promptly straightened his tie and inquired,"Any chance you could figure out what that CEO might like?"



Richard replied, "No, they keep a low profile. Nothing about them is publicly accessible. However, they might have a taste for exquisite liquors or high-end watches. An opulent gift should definitely leave the perfect impression."



Alexander nodded thoughtfully. "Understood."



Just as he was about to disconnect, Richard chimed in with an afterthought, "Oh, and if it fits into your schedule, take Joyce along with you. Her boutique was a fixture in the Luxury Tower, but with the recent sale, she's been forced to vacate. The building is a landmark, after all, and she's understandably reluctant to leave it behind. From what I've gathered, Caiden holds Joyce in high regard, almost as if she were his own kin. Should the Harper family's wealth indeed fall into her hands, I'd see no issue with you pursuing her.Daniela has lost her relevance. It's time to sever ties."



The words hung in the air as Alexander stood motionless, his expression blank and his gaze cast downward.
Richard's voice broke the silence. "Keep in mind, 8 a.m.sharp tomorrow-bring Joyce along. And make sure to remind her to dress appropriately. No over-the-top outfits!"



Deep down,Alexander understood that Richard's view of Joyce was far from flattering.


Her rural upbringing made her a stark contrast to those born with silver spoons in their mouths.



Once the call ended, Alexander's mind lingered on selecting a suitable and impressive gift for his secretary to handle.



By the time he arrived at the room, everyone was already clinking glasses with Cedric.



Moving closer, the man beside him spoke in a hused tone. "This guy's not one to mess with. Rumor has it,he just snagged the Skyline Tower right across from the Luxor Tower! Talk about a bold move. Looks like he's setting up to be neighbors with Elite Lux's CEO -what a powerhouse pairing!"



This revelation forced Alexander to proceed with measured steps.



He cast a quick, cautious glance at Cedric, who,sensing the attention, locked eyes with him in a cold,piercing stare.
Alexander acknowledged him with a glass raised high,toasting to the ambitious newcomer from a distance.



However,no sooner had he replaced his glass on the table than Cedric averted his eyes,ignoring Alexander for the remainder of the event.



The man beside Alexander leaned in and asked, "Have you somehow angered Mr. Phillips?"


Alexander shook his head in response, his expression unchanging.



The man continued, "You should tread carefully around him. He's not one to be trifled with-ruthless and decisive. The man possesses a remarkable shrewdness; crossing him could invite relentless retribution. Frightening thought,isn't it?"



Spurred by the comment, Alexander's eyes flicked back to Cedric, seated calmly across the table.



Within their industry, a veneer of politeness was typically upheld; outright antagonism was a rarity.



Yet,Cedric exuded an aura of authority that was hard to ignore.


Alexander's eyes lingered on Cedric, who checked his phone with practiced ease before standing with quiet authority.
Passing by Alexander, Cedric spoke quietly into the phone. "What time should I pick you up?"


His voice was casual, yet it carried a subtle undertone of affection.



Alexander's sharp curiosity was instantly stirred.


Who was this person that even the stoic man would make personal arrangements to fetch?


Moreover, the voice responding on the other end of the call struck a chord of recognition in him.


It was a voice he was certain he had heard before.
###Chapter 11 The Mysterious CEO Of Elite Lux
Alexander went to the luxury goods boutique to select a gift for the CEO of Elite Lux.


Joyce walked alongside him, her chatter bubbling with energy.



"See, Alexander? Bringing me along was the best decision you made. I asked my friend and was told the CEO of Elite Lux is a handsome man and a golf aficionado. It seems all these high-flying CEOs have a penchant for the game these days. Imagine gifting him a golf club-he'd be over the moon."


Alexander cast a skeptical glance her way, his brow furrowing slightly. "Are you certain about this?"


Joyce nodded emphatically, her eyes sparkling with certainty. "Absolutely! My friend is incredibly well-connected. This is advice you can count on."


Yet,Alexander's silence lingered, clouded by disbelief.


The CEO of Elite Lux was discreet, and tangible details about their personal likes were scarce. Alexander found himself questioning the credibility of Joyce's so -called "well-connected" source, especially given  that the last time he had acted on such advice, it had led to an embarrassing fiasco.



"Come on." Joyce looped her arm through his and tugged him towards a nearby golf store. "Trust me on this, Alexander. This enigmatic CEO is definitely into golf. My friend is tight with him, and he even promised to make introductions later. Let's just pick out a club."



Alexander's uncertainty lingered as he followed Joyce into the shop, his confidence buoyed by her evident assurance.



"What do you think of this one?" Joyce paused before a golf club, beckoning himn closer.


Peering at the price tag, Alexander saw the figure: eight thousand dollars. The amount struck him as too modest.


For the CEO of Elite Lux, such a modestly pricedgift might not even merit a second glance.


Yet Joyce, radiating satisfaction, countered his concerns. "Do you realize how tough it is to earn a buck these days? Besides, my friend is setting up this meeting. We don't need to splurge on a gift. The CEO of Elite Lux already has more than enough. It's our sincerity that will resonate with him, not the price tag."


Her words did little to assuage Alexander's discomfort.
The cost of the gift wasn't mnerely about the money -it was a testament to their regard for the recipient.


Despite his reservations, Joyce's optimism was infectious. "This is it. It's absolutely perfect!"


Her smile broadened, touched by a spark of anticipation. Recent events had cast a shadow over both their families, and Joyce was intent on mending fences and gaining Alexander's esteem. "Trust me on this, Alexander. My friend won't let you down. Once we meet, all you need to do is focus on your proposal.It'll go smoothly, I promise!"


Alexander gazed at Joyce's self-assured expression with a hint of uncertainty. "Are you sure?"


"Absolutely!" Joyce responded with a vigorous nod,her eyes gleaming with conviction.



As Alexander handled the payment, Joyce lingered by his side, her brow furrowed in mild frustration. "Why even go through with this, Alexander? It's simply throwing money away. In today's world, it's not what you know, but who you know. Having me by your side should suffice. Why lavish money on such trivialities?Just have the staff at the golf shop package it nicely.I'm not demanding like that spoiled Daniela."



With these words, Joyce's face lit uup with a smug triumph, her demeanor dripping with disdain. She radiated an air of superiority, as if she stood leagues above Daniela.



Joyce believed this demonstration of frugality would convince Alexander of her worthiness as a partner,perhaps even leading him to propose.



Alexander,meanwhile,brought the golf club home.


A look of stunned incredulity washed over Richard's face the instant he noticed the price tag.


He spun around, his gaze piercing Alexander as he pointed at the golf club. "You're not seriously thinking of gifting this to the CEO of Elite Lux, are you?"


Alexander tried to clarify his intentions, but Richard burst into scornful laughter.



"That cheap,penny-pinching mindset runs so deep in Joyce, it's pathetic. She's leagues behind Daniela.Remember the last golf club Daniela presented? It was leagues beyond this! And now you plan to offer this worthless stick to the CEO of Elite Lux?Alexander, you're not seriously trying to embarrass yourself,are you?"



Even Alexander had to admit the gift, Joyce's recommendation, came off as slightly unimpressive.



Just as he was about to instruct his secretary to exchange it for a superior golf club, his phone rang with an urgent update. "I've just heard from reliable sources-the CEO of Elite Lux's plane touched down ahead of schedule!They'll be at the Luxor Tower within the hour!"



Exhaling deeply,Richard strolled into the storage room and emerged with a gift box, elegantly wrapped.


"Take this instead-the golf club Daniela gave me before. It'll make a better gift for the CEO of Elite Lux."



Curiosity piqued, Alexander examined the club's intricate patterns and the label on the box. "Is this a custom design?"


Earlier that morning, a shop assistant had mentioned,"Anything custom-designed starts at a minimum of two million." Alexander was aware that Daniela frequently bestowed gifts upon Richard, yet the lavishness of this gesture was unexpected.


"Two million?" Richard gestured towards the inscriptions on the club. "This piece is the creation of a globally acclaimed golf club artisan. It's a singular masterpiece-not even four million could buy one."


Alexander clutched the golf club tighter, his eyes widening in disbelief.



Daniela...


When did she acquire such wealth? As far as he knew, ever since the death of her mother and with Katrina at the helm of the Harper famnily's finances, Daniela had been cut off from any family allowance. How, then, did she manage to fund such an extravagant gift?
###Chapter 12 Daniela And The CEO Of Elite Lux
As they approached their meeting with the CEO of Elite Lux, Joyce was bursting with excitement, eagerly sharing every bit of insider information she had gathered.


"The CEO of Elite Lux is a prodigy! By his teens, he was spearheading a team of young virtuosos, making a splash on the global stage. Against all odds, he turned a simple sketch into a sensational overnight success. He didn't just stop there. After banking his initial millions, he rapidly scaled up his operations. Now,he stands as the wealthiest individual globally.Despite his wealth, he's known for being down-to-earth and extraordinarily sharp."


Joyce's face was alight with admiration, her gaze locked onto an approaching stretch Lincoln, its rarity underscored by its sleek lines.


She nudged Alexander enthusiastically, barely containing her glee. "Look, Alexander! There's the car!It must be him-the CEO of Elite Lux!"


Minutes later, the car glided to a halt in front of Luxor Tower. As Lillian emerged first, the anticipation hung  heavy.



Then, the rear door opened slowly.



Joyce's eyes widened in suspense, her breath caught in her throat, ready to finally lay eyes on the fabled,dashing CEO of Elite Lux.


In the blink of an eye, her thrill morphed into sheer astonishment. Her mouth hung open, agape, as seconds stretched into what seemed like an eternity.



"Daniela!" Joyce's voice pierced the silence, high-pitched and incredulous. "What the hell are you doing here? And in the CEO of Elite Lux's car,no less?"



Her eyes narrowed as she scrutinized Daniela's impeccable appearance, her mind racing to piece together the scene before her. In a scornful tone dripping with malice, she hissed, "After leaving the Harper family and being dumped by Alexander, you seduced the CEO of Elite Lux, did you?"


Joyce's gaze burned with loathing and scorn as she stared at Daniela. "Have you no shred of dignity left?"


Catching sight of Joyce was the last thing Daniela expected upon her return. What back luck!


Blinded by jealousy, Joyce dashed towards the vehicle,peering inside with eager, searching eyes. Where was the CEO of Elite Lux? She would unveil Daniela's true  nature to the CEO. 


Daniela's divorce was still recent, but somehow she'd already landed herself a sugar daddy. The notion was unacceptable to Joyce. She couldn't stand idly by and watch this unfold.


Frantically, Joyce scoured the vehicle, but it was utterly empty-no one was there.


Daniela observed Joyce's wild gestures with evident disdain.


"Daniela!" Joyce jabbed a finger in Daniela, her voice sharp and accusing. "Where's the CEO of Elite Lux?Where did you hide him?"


Daniela summoned the security. "There's a delusional woman here causing a scene. Could you kindly take care of this?"



At this moment, the building manager hurried over with a broad smile. "Hello, Ms. Harper. Mr. Phillips had planned to greet you himself today, but he's been delayed due to his car breaking down. He should be here shortly. He's instructed us to extend every courtesy to you. The renovations on the upper floors,tailored to your specifications, are well underway.Furthermore, in response to your request, we've initiated the renaming of the Luxor Tower. The new signage is on the way and will be installed by this evening." 



Daniela acknowledged with a nod of appreciation.



Leading the way, the manager ushered Daniela through the grand entrance of the building.



He paused briefly, turning to address the security team."Stay vigilant at the doors. We are not to admit anyone without proper clearance. Remember, Ms.Harper is not only our esteemed guest but the new proprietor of this establishment. Should she express any dissatisfaction, prepare to vacate your positions immediately."



The security guards responded with quick, solemn nods, underscoring the gravity of the manager's directives.



Daniela and the manager continued into the heart of the building.



Outside, Alexander and Joyce remained momentarily paralyzed by the unfolding events.



It took Joyce several moments to find her voice as the newly minted sign arrived.


With "Harper" prominently displayed, replacing the old name on the iconic Olisvine landmark, her astonishment was palpable. Turning to Alexander, Joyce exclaimed, "Alexander,did you catch that? Daniela has not only secured ties with the CEO of Elite Lux but has convinced him to rename an entire building in her honor! It seems she has thoroughly enchanted the CEO!"
###Chapter 13 Live Stream



Alexander's expression clouded over.


Since she got out of the car, Daniela hadn't glanced at him even once.



Just a few months earlier, she had loved him deeply.But now, having become involved with the CEO of Elite Lux, she regarded him as if he were a mere stranger.	3



Joyce, observing Alexander's growing discontent,adjusted a loose lock of her hair and remarked,"Alexander, didn't I warn you? Women like Daniela-gorgeous and manipulative-always know how to use their beauty. You doubted me before, but now you see the truth. Freshly out of her marriage, and she's wasting no time seducing the CEO of EliteLux. Utterly disgraceful." 8



Her tone acquired a biting jealousy towards the end,seemingly without her own realization.



Alexander's features turned even more somber.



Next to him, Joyce's jaw tightened in frustration."Alexander, did you catch that? Daniela completely ignored you-acted as though you were invisible!

Remember how she used to pursue you relentlessly?Now, with her newfound status, she parades around,steeped in arrogance. I'd bet she hasn't ev/en informed the CEO of Elite Lux about her divorce. The moment the CEO appears, I'll expose Daniela for the cunning,scheming liar she's always been!"


Joyce was haunted by the humiliation from the audio and surveillance footage. Now, seeing Daniela not only escape any fallout but also cozy up to someone as influential as the CEO of Elite Lux was unbearable to her.1



Joyce's fury simmered, building with each ticking second. Daniela's fortunate streak couldn't possibly last forever.



There was no way she would let this slide. This was her time to expose Daniela's deceit, rip away her mask,and revel in her downfall. Daniela's fall would be her opportunity to rise, using it as the foundation for her own ascent.


Alexander stood there, his face a mask of neutrality,eyes locked on a faraway point.


After waiting for an hour, Joyce could no longer bear the cold silence. She shuddered, wrapping her arms around herself and huffing warm breath into her hands for warmth. She turned to Alexander with a shiver, her voice tinged with impatience. "Alexander, do you think the CEO of Elite Lux will show up? Renovating a building is no small affair. Surely he wouldn't entrust such a task to Daniela. What does she even know about it?"



While speaking, Joyce took out her phone from her coat pocket and dialed a number.


The call connected almost immediately, and her friend's voice came through, laced with surprise and disbelief. "What the heck are you talking about?You've got to be kidding me. My friend in security just confirmed the CEO of Elite Lux is in the building.Why are you still waiting out there?"



Joyce caught Alexander's hand and hurried him inside.



They were halted by a vigilant security guard, but she quickly adapted, finding a hidden path through a cramped corridor used for discarding kitchen waste from the cafeteria.	1



The pungent aroma of her perfume mingled with the acrid smell of rotting garbage, creating a nauseating mix that was almost overwhelming.



With clenched fists and gritted teeth, she muttered bitterly to Alexander, "Get through the worst, and you'll outshine them all!"



She was fiercely committed to unmasking Daniela's sly manipulations before the CEO of Elite Lux. The sting of humiliation still burned brightly in her memory-the ridicule she had faced when the audio and surveillance footage were made public.



But today, she was set to turn the tables.



Daniela had sold her dignity to become Elite Lux's CEO's mistress! Joyce was ready to broadcast this scandal to all of Olisvine, cementing her place as the true heiress of the Harper family.


Driven by her vengeful plan, Joyce logged into her livestream account.



As the elevator glided upwards to the top floor,she activated the live feed. Turning to the camera, she flashed a disarmingly sweet smile.


"Hello, everyone! This is Joyce speaking. Today,something unbelievable happened-I got a call to meet up with my sister, who has been out of touch for three months. Throughout these months, the ache of missing her was unbearable for my parents and me.Despite the silence from her end,our affection for her only intensified. Now, hearing that she's back in the country, I'm bursting with curiosity to find out what she's been up to. Join me on this journey as we catch up with my beloved sister!" 

Joyce expertly angled her phone to capture the intensity of her emotions.
In a clever twist, Joyce discreetly texted Katrina,nudging her to ensure Caiden ended up watching the livestream by accident.



With a practiced, sweet grin plastered on her face,Joyce exited the elevator.



Daniela was by the window, her eyes locked on the sprawling urban landscape below.


As Joyce confidently approached, phone aloft and recording, Daniela remained her focus.



Nearby,Lillian stepped forward, intent on intervening.


However,Daniela reached out, placing a reassuring hand on Lillian's arm to stop her.



Lillian glanced over at Daniela, who told her, "Now that she's here, let's not waste the opportunity. We might as well harness her little spectacle to drum up some free publicity for my comeback and Elite Lux."



With a chuckle, Lillian nodded, giving Daniela a silent thumbs-up in agreement.


Joyce burst in, unaware of the undercurrents swirling in the room.



Her camera was already rolling as she captured the grandeur of the opulent office, her voice bubbling with excitement. "Wow, look at this, everyone! Can you believe my sister? Only three months out on her own, completely cut off financially by our family, and she's already made it into one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. And here she is, being personally hosted by the manager! Isn't my sister just remarkable?"



Her tone, though seemingly admiring, was heavy with sarcasm and insinuations, suggesting that Daniela might have ascended the social ladder through less-than-reputable means.


Continuing her broadcast, Joyce turned her critical gaze on the manager and quipped sharply, "You should watch out. Some people just can't help but lie.I'd bet Daniela doesn't even have a hundred bucks in her pocket right now."



The manager took a step forward,intending to clarify the situation, but a glance from Daniela stopped him



Daniela's signal was clear to the manager-let the idiot put on their pathetic little show.
###Chapter 14 A Joke!



Joyce spotted Daniela stopping the manager,which affirmed her suspicions. A self-satisfied grin crept across her face.



With a raised eyebrow, she taunted, "I got it right,didn'tl?" 3



Clad in her flowing, elegant gown, Daniela returned a serene smile. "Indeed, I don't have a hundred bucks on me right now."



At Daniela's admission,Joyce could barely contain her glee. Her eyes sparkled with a victorious gleam.Daniela was on the brink of public embarrassment.



"Listen up, everyone! She just confessed. She doesn't even have a hundred bucks, but here she is,putting on a show like she's a millionaire. So, Daniela, are you actually the Elite Lux's CEO's mistress, or is this just another one of your pathetic lies? Did you deceive the manager to gain entry to this esteemed establishment?I once thought you were merely superficial and materialistic, but now it's clear you're a complete charlatan. Are you aware that such deceit could land you behind bars?"



Joyce was thoroughly convinced of Daniela's duplicity Yet,Daniela observed with a calm demeanor as Joyce embarrassed herself.



Meanwhile, Joyce's theatrical tirade was already causing a stir online.


Caiden was the first to comment, his words laden with indignation.


"Daniela! Will you stop at nothing to tarnish the Harper name? Joyce, inform Daniela that I have cut all ties with her. From this moment forward, her actions and her words are her own. She is no longer my daughter."



Following his outburst, the internet buzzed with reactions from the public.



"Oh my, is her father really casting her aside so publicly?"



"What did Joyce just announce? Daniela is linked with the CEO of Elite Lux? Are we talking about the same Elite Lux? The one that's a titan in the international design industry?"



"It must be! Didn't you catch the location in the background? That's the iconic tower in Olisvine! Who else but the CEO of Elite Lux could be involved with such a landmark?"
"Daniela certainly moves in impressive circles if she's acquainted with someone like the CEO of Elite Lux!"



"Daniela looks breathtaking today. Did anyone else see her ensemble? It's thenewest limited edition from Elite Lux. Absolutely stunning, though the price tag is astronomical."



"Indeed, does anyone know how much it costs? I'm tempted myself!"



"I do! The whole outfit runs over a million-not even counting the heels Daniela was sporting. But, let's be honest, the exquisite craftsmanship and design of Elite Lux are worth every penny."



"They're entering the domestic market soon. With some luck, the prices will become far more accessible.I'm thrilled at the thought of finally wearing a luxury label myself!"



The conversation shifted away from Joyce's allegations, centering instead on Daniela's stunning beauty and grace.	



Fuming with vexation as her conspiracy crumbled,Joyce barked at the camera, "Listen-don't be swayed by such twisted values! Daniela's just a climber,hanging on the coattails of the influential! She's even been forsaken by her own father!"
Daniela, however, remained beside the expansive window, her demeanor composed. A beam of sunlight sliced through the gloom, spotlighting her and casting an ethereal glow.



A torrent of eager, heartfelt comments overflowed across the screen.



"Wow! She looks simply divine!"



Joyce's gaze landed on Daniela, and for a moment,she was transfixed by her luminous presence.



Regaining her composure, she marched up and spat out accusatorily, "Daniela! What filthy schemes did you pull to sink your claws into the CEO of Elite Lux?You're just a gutter rat dressed in stolen silk!" 2


Daniela's laughter was light but resonant. Gazing into Joyce's twisted, angry face, she replied with a calm,mocking smile, "Why not gaze into a mirror and see who truly resembles an ugly gutter rat?"



She accentuated "ugly" in a biting tone, her words slicing through the tension.



Joyce's face flushed a fiery red.



From the moment Katrina introduced her into the Harper family, endless comparisons to Daniela shadowed her every move. Over and over, they deemed her no match for Daniela's charm.


It was intolerable for her.


Yet the stark truth was unavoidable. Her protests only underscored her desperation.



Her appearance, a tender sore spot that haunted her endlessly, became Daniela's cruel weapon, viciously twisted to publicly disgrace her and deepen the wounds she already carried.



Engulfed by fury,Joyce was on the brink of exploding.



Right when she was about to retaliate, the elevator doors parted with a whoosh.



Spotting someone through the opening, Joyce turned to Alexander, her voice filled with anticipation "Alexander, look! There's Joshua Dennis-the one I've been talking about. He's connected to the CEO of Elite Lux. He's about to uncover Daniela as the imposter she truly is."



Joyce then confidently pointed her livestream camera towards Joshua, waving at him with a radiant smile."Joshua..."



However, Joshua blatantly ignored her and walked straight to Daniela.


Flashing a polite smile, he gave a slight bow."Ms. Harper, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Joshua Dennis from Dennis Electronics. We met briefly at an international gala. It's a genuine pleasure to see you again. My father intended to be here, but unfortunately, his car broke down. I've taken the liberty of arranging a dinner. I'd be honored if you joined us."



Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her face etched with disbelief. She gazed at Joshua-typically so haughty and domineering, yet now, he stood before them,subdued and hardly able to meet Daniela's gaze.


Her incredulity quickly morphed into a sharp, derisive laugh. Clutching Joshua's arm, she gestured wildly towards Daniela. "Are you freaking insane, Joshua?Did I hear you right? You're telling me that Daniela-of all people-is the CEO of Elite Lux?"



Spinning towards her livestream camera, Joyce couldn't contain her amusement, and her laughter boomed,echoing in the air.


Tugging at Alexander's sleeve, she amplified her tone for dramatic effect. "Alexander, did you hear that?He's claiming Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux! Can you believe that? It's the grandest joke l've heard in years!"
###Chapter 15 Identity
Revealed



Joyce burst into uncontrollable laughter, her body shaking as she nearly folded over from the sheer hilarity.



Alexander extended a hand to steady her.



Joyce faced the camera and exclaimed, "Guys, if Daniela's really the CEO of Elite Lux, I'll eat a fresh pile of crap for dessert."



Joshua stood to the side, his jaw dropping.


Inviting Joyce had been his call, but now unease crept in, the thought of upsetting Daniela making his heart race.



With a storm in his stride, Joshua marched up to Joyce and delivered a stinging slap across her face. "Have you lost your fucking mind?" s



The laughter vanished from Joyce's face,replaced by a stunned silence. She touched her swelling cheek,staring at Joshua in utter disbelief. "Why did you hit me?"



With a fiery glare and a low growl, Joshua spat, "What the hell is wrong with you? She's the freaking CEO of Elite Lux, and you're sitting here spouting nonsense about eating crap? Where is your sense of decorum?I told you to bring a gift, not insults. Where is the gift?"


His gaze flickered towards the two boxes Alexander clutched in his hands.



Joyce pointed to the less expensive of the two,priced at eight thousand dollars. "That one."


Without hesitation, Joshua yanked the box, gripped Joyce's arm, and went straight for Daniela.



With a strained smile plastered on his face, he began,"Ms. Harper, please accept my apologies for the disruption. This is my friend, Joyce Holt. We crossed paths overseas a few years back." He tapped his temple lightly, his expression awkward as he went on,"She's a bit out of sorts today. Nevertheless,she's one of your ardent admirers and even brought a present for you."



As he lifted the lid of the box, an eight-thousand-dollar golf club was revealed.



With one glance at the contents, Joshua's expression grew grim. He shot a quick, piercing look at Joyce,then at Alexander.



Daniela, on the other hand, let out a chuckle as she picked up the golf club. "An admirer, you say? This club..."



She glanced at the price tag, a wy smile creeping across her features. "Eight thousand dollars..."



Red-faced and clearly flustered, Joshua shoved the golf club into the box. "I'm so terribly sorry, MMs.Harper. These two, well, their judgment can be a bit off at times!" ①



He then spun around to confront Joyce, his voice thick with frustration.2



"Joyce! Are you seriously this clueless? This is Ms.Harper, the CEO of Elite Lux! Her empire includes golf courses that stretch over thousands of acres, and here you are offering her a golf club worth a mere 8,000dollars. Are you out of your damn mind? This is simply outrageous!"



In a fluster, Joshua scrambled for the other box.


Upon opening it, his features relaxed, a look of relief washing over him. Now, this was a gift befitting the occasion.


With both hands, he presented the box to Daniela.


Daniela, who had so far seemed unimpressed, now raised an eyebrow, her eyes glinting with a touch of irony as she inspected the box. She reached into the box and drew out a stunning,custom-tailored golf club, its flawless finish radiating sophistication. Joshua added, "Ms. Harper, please consider the first one just a small extra token. This right here is the true gift meant for you."


As a golf enthusiast, Joshua immediately recognized its value-it was worth at least ten million dollars.


A smile tugged subtly at the corners of Daniela's mouth as she studied the club. "Is this golf club really for me?"



The second she saw the club, recognition washed over her-it was the very gift she had bestowed upon Richard.



Alexander's face clouded over. He remained silent,choosing not to answer Daniela's query.
To him, a golf club was merely a piece of sports equipment. Surely,Daniela couldn't actually recognize this specific one,could she?



Daniela pointed at the grip of the club, where the surname "Bennett" was elegantly engraved. "I didn't know the Bennett family was involved in making golf clubs."
Upon hearing that, Joshua suddenly stiffened, his smile faltering completely. He peered down at the golf club, and a crimson flush spread across his face.Seriously, even the dumbest person alive would know this club was custom-made.


"Re-gifting, huh?" Daniela pressed, her voice even but laced with unmistakable sarcasm. "Mr. Bennett,you certainly have a talent for business."



Joshua was taken aback. Having just returned from overseas, he was utterly baffled by Daniela's insinuation.



At that moment, Lillian stepped in, her fingers wrapping around the club's handle. "If Mr. Bennett is going to treat our boss's generosity like trash, then we're more than entitled to take it back." She brought the golf club back.



The atmosphere turned excruciatingly tense, the silence bearing down like a merciless weight,suffocating any chance of recovery.



The only disruption was Joyce, muttering incredulously to herself, "What the hell? How on earth could this even be possible?" 



She couldn't accept the revelation that Daniela, of all people,was the CEO of Elite Lux.
Daniela was disowned and discarded by her own father,Caiden. How on earth had she ascended to such heights?



Joyce's mind reeled from the shock. With a brittle chuckle, she turned to Joshua, desperation coloring her tone. "Joshua, come on, cut the act. How much did Daniela pay you to concoct this elaborate prank?It's not amusing in the slightest."


Joshua's cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson,his discomfort palpable.


Alexander's gaze was dark and inscrutable.


Meanwhile, on the internet, the announcement about Elite Lux set off a frenzy, with everyone buzzing in excitement and speculation.


"Everyone, look at this! Elite Lux just dropped a bombshell on their official site!"


"Elite Lux is branching out! They're penetrating the domestic scene, spearheaded by none other than their CEO, Daniela Harper. She's leading the charge into Olisvine. The company is all praises and is rooting for her success!"



A chilling quiet enveloped the room, the air so heavy it seemed to stifle even the faintest sound. Every gaze was fixed on Elite Lux's official announcement, expressions ranging from shock to disbelief-everyone except Joyce, who seemed oddly unaffected.



"Ha! Daniela, look at you,all high and mighty! You even went so far as to hack Elite Lux's official site to spread your fake news. Just wait till they catch on and hit you with a lawsuit!"①


Joyce's laughter rang out, bordering on maniacal.


As her laughter echoed, she caught the sober stare of everyone around her.
###Chapter 16 Daniela's Triumphant Return
The echo of Joyce's laughter was gone,replaced by stillness.



She approached Alexander, pulling on his sleeve."Alexander,surely you don't believe this nonsense, do you? This is Daniela we're discussing-the same woman who has adored you for over a decade! How can she suddenly be the CEO of Elite Lux? Does she even possess the resources or the capacity to achieve something like this? Take a good look! We're standing in the iconic building of Olisvine-a genuine landmark!How could Daniela, of all people, manage to own such a place? Alexander, it's impossible that she's the CEO of Elite Lux. Don't be deceived by her!" Daniela had spent more than twenty years playing the flawless role of the Harper family's heiress.



For the samne duration, Joyce had existed under her shadow.



Daniela was renowned for her beauty, grace, and intellect-attributes that allowed her to shine in whatever she pursued.


But now? She was supposed to have tumbled from grace, shamed by the Bennett family. Yet here she stood, bathed in the illustrious aura of Elite Lux.



How could Joyce ever come to terms with this?


Alexander faced Daniela. Unlike Joyce, he maintained his composure.



Although the revelation had stirred him, he couldn't ignore the undeniable reality before him.


Had reality been different, Daniela wouldn't have been able to set foot inside this establishment,let alone receive a cordial welcome from Joshua and the building manager.



A subtle smile graced Daniela's lipsas she stood there,and Alexander found the expression rather disconcerting.



He gazed at her, his voice tinged with confusion and a hint of accusation. "If you're really the CEO of Elite Lux, why keep that a secret until now? Did you find amusement in this charade?"



Was her pretense of vulnerability merely a ploy to garner his compassion?



Such a sly schemer she was.	~ As these thoughts swirled in his mind, an old memory bubbled up to the surface. Richard had mentioned that the CEO of Elite Lux had first become a prominent figure while still a teenager.


Following the release of her lauded final work,"Unrequited Love," she had abruptly receded from the limelight. The whispers at the time had been tantalizing; many believed this young visionary had been struck by a real-life romance, choosing love over her career.



And now, if Daniela indeed was that CEO, had she relinquished her role at Elite Lux for the sake of a heartfelt affection? And more intriguingly, who was the person that swayed her heart?



Standing apart, Alexander observed Daniela with a bewildering sense of estrangement cloaking him. For the first time, it dawned on him that perhaps he had never truly known her.1



Unruffled by Alexander's intense scrutiny, Daniela offered a slight, enigmatic smile and responded, "It appears you've forgotten. You've always been too engrossed in your own affairs to allow me a moment to clarify, haven't you?"


Initially, Daniela had intended to unveil all her secrets to Alexander before their impending nuptials.



However,Alexander had told her that he had no interest in her and all he wanted was for her to behave herself after their marriage.


In simpler terms, he held no real expectations of her.


To the public, Alexander's father had even stated that the union was simply a long-standing commitment made between the two families years earlier.



Yet, beneath this facade lay a more strategic calculation. The Bennett family had consented to the marriage solely due to the considerable influence wielded by the Harper family.


Daniela,being Caiden's only biological daughter, stood to inherit a substantial portion of the Harper family's fortune, despite Caiden having remarried and having a stepdaughter. Given these prospects, the Bennett family welcomed her into their family.


Upon discovering the true motives behind their acceptance, Daniela's eagerness to disclose her true self dwindled.



Alexander's expression darkened dramatically, his jaw tightening as his eyes became turbulent with frustration. Underneath lay a palpable fury,fueled by the bitter realization that he had been deceived.



With a steely glare at Joyce, he declared in a frosty tone, "We're leaving."



Remaining would only tarnish the honor of their  families further.


Just as they neared the exit, Lillian's commanding voice stopped them in their tracks. "Hold on a moment!"



Reluctantly, Alexander paused, his body tensed as Lillian strode forward, a golf club in hand. "Here,take your $8,000 golf club. I doubt even our caddies would bother with such an inferior piece."



Her mocking words cut deep, visibly embarrassing Joshua,who turned a deep shade of red.


He hurriedly pressed the elevator button and ushered Alexander and Joyce out.


With that, Daniela made her triumphant return to Olisvine.



As the CEO of Elite Lux, she now presided majestically over Olisvine's most famous landmark.



Recovering from her astonishment, Joyce was already weaving new plots. She leaned towards Caiden, her voice oozing sugary charm. "Dad, Daniela's now the CEO of Elite Lux and she owns Olisvine's top landmark building. Do you think you could convince her to spare one floor for me?"
###Chapter 17 Shameless



Caiden paused, uncertainty clouding his expression.


It wasn't fear of Daniela's defiance-she wouldn't dare cross him. 



Rather,his reluctance stemmed from a recent public declaration he had made, cutting all ties with her. To seek her out now, after such a proclamation, would surely raise eyebrows.



What would everyone say about this?


Surely, they would label him as a conceited, self-centered man, desperate to maintain his grip on wealth and status.



His pristine reputation meant everything to him; the very idea of becoming fodder for idle gossip was utterly unbearable.



Throughout his life, Caiden had lingered in the shadow of Daniela's influential mother. Now, having finally liberated himself and taken command of his destiny,he was determined to steer clear of any further familial entanglements.



Nearby, Katrina observed his indecision with a keen  eye, understanding that Caiden had no desire to comply with Joyce's demand.



The room fell silent for a long beat before Katrina's eyes brimmed with tears.


"This mess is entirely on me. When you took me as your wife, it was right after Daniela's mother had passed. All these years, Daniela has harbored resentment towards me, and rightfully so. I can't blame her-it's my fault for falling so deeply in love with you. I am to blame for everything. Joyce had no part in this, but Daniela's hatred for me has dragged her into the crossfire. Now, her business has been damaged. It's all my fault-every single problem stems from me. I'll face Daniela and apologize. If she won't accept it, I'll kneel and beg for her forgiveness.Sisters shouldn't be divided because of their parents 'sins." 3



Her face was streaked with tears as she rose to her feet.



Caiden grasped her hand, his own heart twisting at the sight of her distress. "Why apologize for the past? As her father, do I really need Daniela's approval to choose who I spend my life with?"



Caiden locked eyes with Joyce. "Joyce, you've always been the sensible one. Your sister's the one stirring up all the drama. Don't worry, I'll have a word with Daniela. Just give me a little time. Now, remind me,which floor were you considering for your new office?"



With a delighted grin, Joyce clapped her hands together. "Dad, I consulted a fortune-teller who recommended the 18th floor. It offers an incredible view and it's said to be lucky."



It was common knowledge in Olisvine that the 18th floor of the landmark building was the prime spot.


Yet Katrina's ambitions for Joyce stretched further.Snuggling closer to Caiden, she coaxed,"Joyce is no longer a little girl. She truly deserves her own space.I considered a villa for her, yet with Daniela yet to acquire one, it seems only fair that Joyce waits her turn.However, now that Daniela owns an entire building, why don't we gift Joyce the 18th,19th,and 20th floors? It would give her a suitable home of her own. Surely, we don't want rumors floating around that she is still nesting at home in her twenties,right?"


Joyce's eyes lit up with excitement, her jaw dropping slightly as Katrina's bold proposal sank in.



The Luxor Tower stood as Olisvine's pinnacle of luxury,with each floor valued immensely.



The floors from the 18th to the 20th were especially prized, each valued at over a hundred million dollars Acquiring these would not just mnean a lavish residence;it would be akin to receiving a windfall of three hundred million dollars.



Such wealth could catapult her into the upper echelons of society.


Quietly applauding her mother's strategy with a discreet thumbs-up, Joyce then turned to Caiden,her voice oozing with honeyed charm.


"Dad, considering Daniela's immense wealth,parting with just three floors should hardly dent her resources,right? Plus, I am your daughter as well. If I ascend socially, wouldn't that reflect gloriously on the Harper family?"


With a subtle tilt of her head, Katrina moved closer,her words soft yet deliberate. "Caiden, the girls are all grown up now. It's not sensible to keep them cooped up at home. Plus, Daniela is flush with cash and could really benefit from having a sharp sister like Joyce by her side. It's beneficial for both of them. Moreover,isn't it within your power to make such decisions for your daughter?"



These words startled Caiden into action. He stood abruptly, his voice filled with incredulity. "As her father, am I not entitled to the ultimate decision?Would Daniela actually challenge my authority? She wouldn't dare oppose me. Just wait-I'm calling her this very moment." He glanced towards Joyce, seeking confirmation."18th, 19th, and 20th floors, correct?"  Joyce's eyes gleamed with anticipation, and she nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, Dad! Just those floors!"


The sheer intensity of her excitement was impossible to miss.



The moment Caiden stepped away to make the call,Joyce wrapped Katrina in a heartfelt hug,her face lit up with an exuberant smnile. "Mom! We're about to be filthy rich. Three entire floors are going to be mine.I never in my life thought this could happen. And the moment I move in, I'll make Daniela's life a living hell every single day."



Katrina, with her arms folded and exuding authority,observed Caiden's silhouette in the garden. "Don't worry, my dear. I have everything in hand. You're the crown jewel of the Harper family.Whatever you desire,I'll ensure Caiden provides it for you."
Joyce, overflowing with happiness and pride,embraced Katrina firmly. "Thank you, Mom!"
###Chapter 18 Caiden's Confidence
As Katrina and Joyce reveled in their laughter in the living room, the door burst open abruptly.


Caiden marched in, his cheeks tinged with the redness of anger.


Upon seeing him, Katrina rose quickly from her seat."Did Daniela agree?"


Caiden threw up his hands in exasperation, his words cutting through the air. "That ungrateful girl blocked my number!"



He extended a demanding hand towards Katrina."Hand me your phone!"


Without hesitation, Katrina passed her phone to him.Caiden hastily dialed Daniela's number, only to realize Katrina's number had been blocked too.


Caiden fumed, his frustration mounting. He grabbed Joyce's phone and attempted the call once more,only to face the same result.


Joyce,aware that all their numbers had been blocked,kept up her facade of innocence. She approached Caiden and spoke in a soothing tone."Dad, calm down. This must be a misunderstanding Daniela might have blocked us, but she'd never block you. You're her father-she wouldn't be so cruel."


Caiden responded with a derisive sneer. He understood Daniela's nature all too well. That ungrateful girl,much like her mother, showed little regard for family ties.


Without hesitation, Caiden snatched a phone from a servant and redialed Daniela's number. This time, the call connected instantly.


His features twisted into a scowl, his simmering rage rolling off him like an ominous storm.


"This is Ms. Harper's office. She's currently in a meeting and can't come to the phone. May I know who I'm speaking with?" a poised and professional voice responded.


Caiden roared, "I'm Daniela's father! You tell her to give me an explanation! Blocking me, her mom, and her sister? Why would she do something like that? Is this what money does to people? Does she think she can just erase her family from her life? What, am I invisible to her now? Would she even come if I were on my last breath? What kind of father ends up with a daughter this ungrateful?" 
On the other side of the line, Lillian was not about to let anyone cast aspersions on Daniela, not even her own father. "If I'm not mistaken, you declared publicly just five days ago that you were disowning Ms. Harper.Following your own words, you are no longer recognized as her father. Why, then, do you expect her to answer your calls now?"


Caiden's complexion deepened to a furious shade of crimson, and he nearly spluttered with indignation."What the hell did you just say? Aren't I her biological father? I'm the one who brought her into this world.Without my care and the sacrifices I made, she wouldn't have made it this far. Even if we've severed ties, shouldn't she be the one to mend them? All she's ever been to me is a bitter disappointment!"



Lillian was left utterly speechless.How could someone like this even dare to call himself a father? He was always playing the martyr, hiding behind a mask of fake righteousness.


"Ms. Harper is unavailable at the moment as she's in a meeting.Would you like me to relay a message for you?" Lillian answered smoothly, her voice calm and professional, embodying poise under pressure.


After all, he was Daniela's father, and showing basic courtesy was the least she could do.


Caiden's voice turned icy, slicing through the air with increased sharpness. "You make sure Daniela calls me back within the hour. And she owns Luxor Tower,correct? I want the 18th to 20th floors."



Lillian blinked, taken aback. "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"



"Don't act like you didn't hear me!" Caiden growled,his tone sharp and impatient. "The building's being renovated, isn't it? Ensure those three floors are included. I'll forward my own blueprints later, and you will adhere to those designs. Understood?"


Caiden ended the call abruptly, slamming the phone down with a triumphant expression, his smugness practically dripping off him.


Almost fifty minutes later, Daniela strode out of the conference room.



The moment she appeared,Lillian promptly delivered Caiden's directives.



"Your father mentioned he would send someone with the blueprints for the renovation. Also,he insists you return his call within the hour."
###Chapter 19 A Fool For Love
Daniela took her time signing the pile of documents resting on her desk.



Still focused on her paperwork, she asked casually,"Has an hour passed already?"



Lillian quickly checked her watch and replied, "Just a minute past the hour."


Daniela gave a small nod. "Perfect. No reason to call back now."



Lillian paused, momentarily startled by Daniela's easy dismissal. After a second, she asked hesitantly, "And the blueprints?"



Daniela shot her a look, and Lillian quickly nodded,catching the unspoken message. "Understood."



When the blueprints finally arrived, curiosity got the better of Lillian, and she couldn't resist peeking at them.2



Her jaw nearly hit the floor.



Unbelievable.



Seriously,how shameless could someone be? The design looked like it belonged in a royal palace -over-the-top and dripping with extravagance.



"Easy to splurge when it's not your own money, huh?"


Lillian passed the blueprints over to Daniela, who took one quick look and threw them into the trash can without a second thought.


Meanwhile, Caiden had been sitting around for over two hours,growing increasingly restless.



He kept his eyes glued to the phone,staring so hard it made them ache, but Daniela never returned his call.


His expression turned stormy and intense.



Katrina let out an exaggerated sigh from her seat on the sofa. "Well, it's obvious Daniela isn't calling back.They say once a daughter gets married, she stops being part of the family. She's clearly not close to you anymore, dear. Maybe it's time to accept it.Relationships require mutual respect, you know.Pushing it won't lead anywhere good."



Caiden remained silent, his piercing eyes locked on the phone like he could will it to ring.



Joyce's eyes welled up with tears. "Dad, Daniela's not going to give me the three floors, is she? Does she hate me that much? Is she still angry about what happened before? I already apologized. I was young and made a stupid mistake. I'd even get on my knees and beg if that's what it takes. But even after all that,she still won't forgive me?" 9


Joyce leaned against Katrina, the two clinging to each other as they sobbed dramatically.



The endless sound of their crying gnawed at Caiden's patience. With a sharp crash, he smashed his favorite cup against the floor and marched upstairs in afury.


As soon as he was out of view, Joyce stopped crying instantly. She turned to her mother and murmured in a low voice, "Mom, what's the next move?"


Katrina stopped to think for a moment before saying,"Get Alexander to talk to her. Daniela's always been the type to let her heart rule her head. She'll believe anything he says. If he steps in, she won't say no.Those three floors are worth a fortune. You have to make sure you get them."


Joyce nodded firmly, her eyes gleaming with resolve."Got it."



Meanwhile, Richard paced in the living room, chain-smoking cigarette after cigarette.



At last, the sound of a car in the driveway made him stop and turn to the front door. "Alexander, you're here." Richard crushed his cigarette into the ashtray and glanced at his son as he stepped inside.



Alexander didn't fit the mold of a traditional heartthrob, but his icy demeanor and quiet arrogance gave him a magnetic presence that was impossible to ignore.


Richard hadn't thought much of Daniela in the past.



But ever since it came to light that she was the CEO of Elite Lux, Richard had started to see her in a new light. 3



Alexander raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised to find his father still up at this hour.



Richard settled into his chair and motioned to the one across from him with a commanding gesture."Take a seat."



Alexander stayed where he was, refusing to move.


Richard didn't press the issue; he knew better than to push the boundaries of their strained relationship.



"Did you see Daniela today?" Richard asked,breaking the silence.



Alexander nodded in response. "I had someone dig into it," Richard went on. "It's confirmed-she's the CEO of Elite Lux. What's your opinion on that?"



Alexander hesitated briefly, then asked, "What exactly are you getting at?"


Richard leaned back in his chair and spoke in a calm,deliberate tone. "I know Caiden wanted you to marry Joyce, but that was before we learned who Daniela really is. Now that we know she's the CEO of Elite LuX,everything has changed. Her status isn't just higher than the Harper family's-it's higher than ours. She's barely been back in Olisvine, and already, people are lining up to court her favor. You've heard about this,haven't you? But here's where you have an edge-Daniela has always been in love with you. Blindly so.Between Joyce and Daniela, there's no competition.If you marry Daniela,our family would instantly climb to the top of Olisvine's social ladder. It'll save you years of hard work. For the family, this is the smartest move you could make."



Richard was brimming with confidence about the situation.



In his mind, Daniela's deep love for Alexander was undeniable.



He was convinced that if Alexander so much as lifted a finger,Daniela would come rushing back, more than ready to rejoin the Bennett family as his wife.


To Richard, Daniela's unwavering love for Alexander was an unshakable truth, something he believed would never fade.



Alexander, on the other hand, remained completely still, his expression unreadable and distant.



There was a time when he might have agreed with Richard's certainty.



But after seeing Daniela earlier that day, his confidence wavered. Her attitude towards him was nothing like it used to be.



She had hardly even looked at him, as though he were invisible.



Not a single word had passed between them.



Her indifference towards him was impossible to miss.



Richard caught Alexander's silence and let out a scoff."Some things never change, do they? A fool for love then, still a fool for love now. You honestly think Daniela's any different? She's just sulking because you left her for Joyce. This is nothing more than a tantrum.Now that she's running Elite Lux, all you need to do is play along with her for a bit. She'll fall back into line."


His voice carried the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.
###Chapter 20 The 18th Floor -Heaven or Hell
Richard, upon noticing Alexander's silence, resumed speaking, his voice tinged with his customary self-assuredness. "Joyce called today. She's set her sights on the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. I've given her your nod. Spin this as your chance to engage Daniela. She'll feel jealous, no doubt, so take advantage of that to reconcile. As for the Harper family, save yourself the trouble of mediating.Daniela's fortune outshines theirs by far. With her backing Bennett Group, we've no need for the Harper family's leftovers. Caiden's declaration of cutting ties with Daniela publicly was his most foolish move yet.He's become the laughingstock. If I were in his position, I would make every effort to win back her favor." 



Richard rose from his seat, laying down his strategy for Alexander with a sagely nod. "In the past, Daniela was merely one of many smitten with you, relentlessly pursuing your attention. Now, her circumstances have changed dramatically. It's imperative you take her seriously now. Yet, tread lightly; no one admires a sycophant-it's disgraceful and fruitless. Entice her-offer just enough to keep her intrigued, but withhold enough to keep her yearning. The essence of desire is to chase what remains elusive."



Richard's advice was delivered with the weight of a seasoned strategist.



Alexander remained stoic, his face an unreadable mask. 5







Joyce, buoyed by Richard's assurance, was already acting as if the three floors of the Luxor Tower were hers by right.


Long before any official announcement, she gathered her friends for a tour of what she already viewed as her future property.



The security guard, taken aback by the commanding presence of her group, hesitated only momentarily before allowing them passage.  Joyce's smugness blossomed further as she faced her circle of friends. With a triumphant air, she declared,"See? There's nothing beyond my reach!"



Alma Herrera lingered by the window, her eyes wide with admiration for the panoramic view from the 18th floor.



"Joyce, you're amazing. This is the most sought-after building in Olisvine. You requested these floors, and Daniela just gave them to you?"


Puffing up her chest, Joyce flashed a confident smirk."Naturally! I'm pampered by everyone-no one dares defy me!"



Her words ignited a wave of supportive cheers from her group, each member flashing her an enthusiastic thumbs-up.



Basking in their admiration, Joyce gestured to the nearby security guard, her voice smooth and commanding as she asked him to bring them some water. She then swept her hand grandly towards the seating area, inviting them to find themselves comfortable spots.



"But Joyce, didn't your stepfather cut all ties with Daniela? How on earth is she still bending over backwards to grant you such a prime spot? They say even piles of cash can't open doors here."



"Truly, Joyce, you outshine even the most privileged heirs of the wealthy families!"



"Does this mean the Harper family's entire fortune will be yours one day? And didn't you mention the Bennett family was the one who made this possible?So does that mean Alexander's father has a soft spot for you too?"



Joyce tilted her chin slightly, her lips curling into a self-satisfied smile.


"Oh, absolutely! Do you even know how incredible Joyce is? She's not just some heiress-she's the heiress! The epitome of class and power!" Alma gestured dramatically, her voice rising with each word as though proclaiming the arrival of royalty.


The flattery washed over Joyce like a warm wave,her ego swelling visibly as she soaked up the praise.


She leaned back slightly, a hand casually brushing her hair, preparing to deliver a smug remark to keep the admiration flowing. But then, the soft chime of the elevator arriving pierced through the chatter, silencing the group instantly.


The air grew heavy with anticipation as the doors glided open.


Daniela stepped into view, her figure draped in an exquisite, limited-edition Elite Lux autumn outfit that hugged her with flawless precision. Her heels clicked against the polished floor, each step deliberate,exuding a regal confidence that turned every head in her direction.



She was like a flower blooming in the wild-breathtakingly beautiful but undeniably distant, an untouchable force of nature.



Daniela was holding the building's design draft as she stepped out.


She halted in her tracks, her eyes widening as she took in the group of people gathered on the 18th floor.


The cheerful expression slowly drained from her face.



Turning to the security guard, who had just emerged from the elevator with a tray laden with beverages,Daniela inquired, "How did they manage to come up here?"



The group that had followed Joyce upstairs was keen to use her as a bridge to Daniela.


After all, Daniela had ascended to the position of CEO of Elite Lux and was rapidly becoming a prominent figure in the national business arena. Many were eager to forge ties with her.



Despite her unwelcoming demeanor, they huddled around Joyce, offering Daniela their most ingratiating smiles."Hello,Daniela!"



Daniela's face remained stoic; she was not one to lash out at those who approached her with a grin.



Yet,she recognized every single one of them-these were the very women who had scorned her in the past, mocking her for being overlooked by Alexander.Their derisive laughter and scornful glances were etched in her mind. Now,they acted as if they were good friends.


"What are you doing up here?" Daniela demanded,cutting straight to the chase, dispensing with any semblance of cordiality.
###Chapter 21 Shameless



Daniela's eyes narrowed, casting a frosty silence over the group that had been eagerly vying for her attention.



Nearby,even the security guard fidgeted nervously."Ms. Harper, I deeply apologize. I saw them arriving together and assumed they were associated with the design firm. So I didn't confirm their identities before allowing them in." 


A shadow of irritation passed over Daniela's face as her brow furrowed.



Given that the building was still undergoing renovations, such mix-ups were somewhat understandable. She couldn't blame the security guard.However, it did serve as a warning for her.


Without hesitation, Daniela dialed Ryan. "Install a facial recognition system throughout the building.From now on, entry is restricted exclusively to those registered in the system."


Ryan's reply was swift and affirmative. "UJnderstood!"


At that moment, realization dawned on the group standing before her. One of them leaned in, whispering to Joyce, "What's the deal here, Joyce? So your sister didn't give you these floors. How could you bring us up here like this?"



Discomfort spread among them, their voices tinged with unease.



"Joyce, let's not get wrapped up in trouble. We don't want to stir up any drama for our families. Our folks made it clear we should show utmost respect to Daniela. What were you thinking,bringing us here to cross her?" 


Joyce fixed her spineless friends with a piercing gaze,her eyes blazing with reproach.


She whirled towards Daniela, her voice slicing through the air like a knife. "Daniela, what's this about tightening the building's security? Aren't I your sister?"


Daniela returned her look with a scornful smile."You?My sister? I'd rather not. The very idea that I would call you my sister is absurd."


"What are you implying? You reject me as your sister?You reject Dad too? Just because you've come into some money, you think you can discard your own family like that?" Joyce didn't hesitate to bring up Caiden.



Daniela let out a sly smirk, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Am I even still family? If my memory serves me correctly, wasn't it you who urged them to sever all ties with me? Or is my memory failing me?"


Joyce stood her ground, undeterred. "Yes, they disowned you. That means the Harper family's wealth is none of your concern anymore. However, after Dad brought you up, it's only right that you take care of him!"


With a bitter chuckle, Daniela crossed her arms. "Sure,I'll take care of him-that's the right thing to do. But you? I don't owe you a damn thing. I don't have time for this. Grab your people and get out of my building."

 Joyce's hands clenched into fists, her eyes blazing with indignation. "Really? You refuse to even acknowledge Dad? What about Richard? He's Alexander's father! He sent me here today to inspect this place!"



Sure of her advantage, Joyce smirked inwardly.



Richard wasn't just anyone-he was Alexander's father and Daniela's former in-law.



It seemed inconceivable to Joyce that Daniela would dare to cross Richard.



Convinced of her victory, Joyce raised her head high,expecting Daniela to relent and relinquish control of the three floors.
Daniela, however,looked at her with utter disbelief."Feeling a little unhinged, are we? Perhaps it's time to get yourself checked out. Trying to use Caiden didn't work, and now you're dragging Richard into this,who,by the way, has nothing to do with me anymore.Joyce,do you even use that brain of yours, or is it just there for show?" 



Color drained from Joyce's face as she processed the rebuke. She glared at Daniela, her voice trembling with fury. "You dare defy Dad and Richard? I'll make sure they disown you for this!"  


Daniela merely shrugged, her indifference palpable."Go ahead.Tell them."



Infuriated beyond words, Joyce stamped her foot like a spoiled brat, but Daniela, ever composed,had already called the guards to escort her and her friends out.



The term "escort" was used loosely here.



The guards forcefully removed Joyce, who was gripping the doorframe with a desperate tenacity,from the premises.  



This scene unfolded under the watchful eyes of numerous passersby, some of whom promptly began to record the incident, quickly catapulting it to viral status online.
"Is that Joyce? The one who tarnished Daniela's reputation all over social media? She's bold to even step out in public after that."


"Absolutely shameless. Now she wants a piece of Daniela's success? Impressive. I didn't think it was possible to top the nonsense I've already witnessed.She destroyed Daniela and Alexander's marriage, and now she has the audacity to suck up to Daniela? The hypocrisy is astounding."  


"Typical stepfamily soap opera-no sense of limits or decorum."



"Get this. Joyce was brazen enough to demand control over the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. She had the gall to use Daniela's father to press Daniela, not just to relinquish her rights but also to cover the expenses for the renovations!"



The netizens were abuzz with reactions.



"Daniela, need a sister? I swear I won't steal your husband, sabotage your wedding, or stir up trouble.I'll just be the quiet, compliant sibling you never had.How about it?"  
###Chapter 22 Don't Wrestle With Pigs
That evening, an auction was being held at a hotel.


Lillian, ever persuasive, had managed to coax Daniela into accompanying her.



As they took their places in the front row, the event yet to commence, Daniela casually browsed through online comments, a slight smile touching her lips.


Lillian nudged her, murmuring under her breath, "Look who decided to show up-trouble herself,with her endless baggage of bullshit."



Lifting her eyes, Daniela's smile lingered just a moment as she caught sight of Alexander and Joyce making their way to the front. 

Joyce's posture tensed noticeably as she clung closer to Alexander, her voice low and strained. "Alexander,have you noticed? Daniela is still obsessed with you.The moment you walked in, she smiled at you.How utterly shameless!"



Alexander, his expression stoic and authoritative,settled into his seat, disregarding the murmurs around him. As the auction commenced, the auctioneer took his position at the center, his gaze momentarily meeting Daniela's. Acknowledging her presence, he offered a courteous nod.


Daniela, maintaining her composure, responded with a restrained smile, which did not go unnoticed.



Joyce, watching like a hawk, leaned towards Alexander, her voice dripping with disdain. "Look at her, flirting with the auctioneer now! And him,old enough to be her father. How scandalous and disgraceful!" Joyce, overwhelmed by the unyielding barrage of online critiques, lamented to Alexander, "Alexander,Daniela is inciting those netizens against me! You must intervene!"  



Alexander stayed quiet, his stoic demeanor betraying nothing.  



As the room's lights faded and the auction commenced, he turned his gaze towards Daniela.


Daniela possessed an undeniable allure, her large,expressive eyes and gently waving hair drawing attention effortlessly. Her smile turned her eyes into mesmerizing crescents, effortlessly captivating those around her. She was the kind of woman who made a lasting impact, stunning at first sight and increasingly enchanting upon further observation.



Tonight, she donned a bespoke gown from Elite Lux,quickly becoming the center of whispered awe among the socialites.



Without intending, Daniela had turned into a living showcase for Elite Lux.



As the auction unfolded, Joyce, driven by a need to assert her presence, enthusiastically lifted her bidding paddle time and again.


She was clearly in no position to fund anything herself -most of the money came from Caiden's pockets.



Daniela gazed at the stage, her expression one of detached disinterest, while Lillian seethed next to her."This is an outrage! That money was your mother's She was the cornerstone of the Harper family's company. And now, this woman has the audacity to squander it? Daniela, how can you remain so composed? I'm livid!"



Years ago, Caiden had used his charm and striking good looks to win over Daniela's mother, a billionaire heiress.Despite her vast wealth and strong personality,she had fallen hopelessly in love with him, her judgment clouded by affection. Her love for Caiden was fervent, yet she maintained her iron will,compelling Caiden to adopt the role of a docile spouse while he quietly nurtured his bitterness.	 



Merely days after the tragic death of Daniela's mother,Caiden hastily married Katrina.


The once obedient husband changed overnight,parading around as if he owned the world, reveling in his emancipation and shamelessly flaunting his elevated status.



He had discarded his earlier facade of servility and flattery towards Daniela's mother.


It seemed he had even convinced himself of his fabricated narrative-that he was the sole architect behind the success of Harper Group.



"There's no reason to be distressed," Daniela replied aloofly,fidgeting absentmindedly with a small trinket in her hand. "Since my mother chose to marry Caiden,he rightfully inherited a portion of her fortune.Whatever he does with it is beyond my concern."



Lillian exhaled a weary sigh.



Daniela had a knack for amassing wealth, yet she remained indifferent to its allure.



She effortlessly generated an abundance of income,a sum she regarded as trivial, and she never found herself flustered over mere pennies.


The auction progressed smoothly.


When a jade tiger was presented, Lillian's eyes sparkled with excitement. She turned to Daniela, her expression filled with earnest hope, imploring her to purchase the striking artifact.


Lillian, a founding pillar of Elite Lux, had accumulated a fortune in the billions. Money wasn't an issue for her;she just wanted Daniela to spoil her.


Daniela took immense joy in keeping her people happy.



Owning the auction house, she felt it appropriate to enhance the event wih a little bit of fun by joining in the bidding.


With a flourish,Daniela lifted her paddle to place a bid.


At that moment, Joyce,spotting Daniela's bid,quickly raised her paddle too, keen on a challenge.


The bidding for the diminutive jade tiger escalated from eight million to fifteen million.


Joyce faltered,her mind racing against the constraints of the budget Caiden had set for her.

 
In contrast, Daniela sat poised and assured, her manner as she bid radiating a commanding presence of autonomy and influence.



Many spectators, particularly the women, admired her tranquil yet assertive demeanor, coveting her financial independence and confidence.



Overwhelmed by envy, Joyce could barely contain herself as whispers of admiration for Daniela echoed from the socialites gathered behind her. Steeling her resolve, she raised her bidding paddle with a determined hand.



"Fifteen million, one hundred thousand!" Joyce declared,her voice tight with tension.


Daniela,poised and composed, effortlessly raised her own paddle. "Sixteen million."



"Sixteen million, one hundred thousand..."


Without missing a beat, Daniela countered smoothly,"Seventeen million."


At that moment, Joyce felt the collective gaze of the room converge upon her.


She tugged at the fabric of her dress, her thoughts whirling in turmoil.Bidding any higher would devour her entire allowance from Caiden for the next six months.	
"Ms. Holt, will you continue?" the auctioneer inquired,his smile coaxing. "This piece is truly a heart's desire.Do you wish to bid further?"



Joyce's cheeks flushed a deep shade of red.



Continue?



How could he suggest such a thing? Unlike Daniela,who wielded her own fortune with independence,Joyce was keenly aware that every dollar she spent was at the discretion of Caiden.



Joyce's heart seethed with envy, yet her expression showcased only a delicate vulnerability. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she grasped Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander, Daniela is trying to disgrace me in front of everyone."



Before Daniela could mount a defense, Lillian burst forth,her finger pointed accusingly at Joyce. "Enough!How much more slander will you hurl at Daniela? This is a respectable auction! If it's beyond your means,just own up to it. Why blame others because you didn't win? Enough with your theatrics!"


Joyce's tears cascaded down her cheeks, punctuating her sorrow with theatrical flair.



Alexander stood abruptly, his icy stare ensnaring Lillian.
As he prepared to interject, Daniela also rose, stepping in and drawing Lillian back. Her warm eyes hardened.



"Enough, Daniela!" Alexander interjected smoothly.



Despite her efforts to extinguish the old flames, his words sliced through her, painfully sharp. After all, he was the one she had cherished for so long.


Pressing her lips tightly, Daniela fought back the quiver that threatened to betray her emotions.


On the verge of speaking, she felt a shadow fall over her. A hand enclosed her wrist and pulled her back in one smooth, protective motion.



"Cut the nonsense, Mr. Bennett. Who's actually crossing the damn line here?" The words, tinged with authority, sliced through the thick silence enveloping the room. His piercing gaze roved over the gathered onlookers, finally anchoring on Alexander. "So,Daniela was once blind to your machinations, and now you presume to push her around at your whim? Cut the shit. This nonsense stops right now."



The atmosphere in the room turned icy.



Every gaze swiveled toward the speaker. It took a moment for the crowd to recognize him. Cedric Phillips, a titan of industry, renowned for his unyielding tactics and strategic genius.
Commanding every bit of the room's energy, Cedric nonetheless appeared aloof to the stares fixated on him. His eyes met Daniela's, his voice low andsteady "Don't bother fighting with pigs-they love the mud,and you'll just end up covered in their filth."


A murmur of laughter rippled through the audience,amusement flickering in their eyes as they turned their attention back to Alexander, whose reaction to Cedric's bold confrontation was keenly anticipated.
###Chapter 23 You've Crossed The Line







Alexander didn't say a word and simply pulled Joyce back into her seat.


The crowd,expecting more drama, let out a unified sigh of disappointment.


In the end, Daniela secured the jade tiger for a whopping $19 million and handed it over to Lillian as a gift.



Lillian, her face alight with glee, shot a smug look at Joyce,whose face was twisted with barely concealed fury. She then said in a loud voice, "Thanks,Daniela!"


Joyce was so enraged that veins popped from her forehead,her anger barely contained.


Daniela had once been nothing but a lovesick fool.Alexander had never wanted her. And now,just because she'd become a high-powered CEO,she thought she could act superior? 
As the auction wrapped up, Daniela lingered to chat with the event organizer.


Taking advantage of the situation, Joyce quickly lifted her phone and took a picture of Daniela. Turning to Alexander, she said, "Alexander, look at her! Daniela has no shame. First, she was flirting with Cedric, and now she's all over the organizer, who's old enough to be her father. She's making a fool of the Harper family. And don't forget-she was your wife. Just think about the damage she's doing to your reputation."


Of course, Joyce had angled the photo just right to make it look much worse than it was.



In reality, Daniela was just having a friendly chat.


As she spoke, Joyce quickly posted the photo in the Harper family group chat.


"Dad, take a look at Daniela! The organizer is practically her father's age! How shameless is she? I don't care about her reputation, but mine is at stake.I've never been so humiliated. How am I supposed to show my face in public now?"



As she had hoped, her dramatics hit their mark.



Caiden's anger flared up, and he smashed another of his precious porcelain cups.



After sending the message, Joyce looked over at Alexander.



His expression was as stoic as ever, unreadable.Joyce couldn't tell if he was angry or just indifferent. "Alexander, let's go," she said in a sugary tone, though her eyes quickly followed Daniela, who was walking to the restroom.



Just then a sneaky idea flashed through her mind.After a brief pause, she added, "Actually, Alexander,would you mind coming with me to the resroom?I'm not feeling well."



In the restroom, Daniela was in the middle of freshening up her makeup when Joyce entered.


"Well,well, Daniela. What a coincidence!"


Without even sparing her a glance, Daniela continued applying powder to her face, her voice calm and detached. "You came in here on purpose. No need to play games, my dear sister."


The last three words sliced through the air, sharp and piercing.


Daniela had no time for Joyce's dramatics-it made her stomach churn.



"Alright, yes, I followed you. But what's so special about you,Daniela? So what if you've got money now?"


Daniela stopped for a moment, a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth. She turned to Joyce,her voice calm as she corrected her. "It's not just some money. It's a lot of money. And it's the kind of money you'd never be able to earn in ten lifetimes. So go ahead and let yourself be jealous."


Joyce's fury nearly made her choke."You-"


"What about me?" Daniela cut in, her voice cold,her eyes sharp. "You still think I'm that same easy target?Well, here's a tip-don't push me, or I'll have you out of the Harper family faster than you can blink!"


Joyce's eyes filled with tears as she pointed at Daniela."How could you! Dad says I'm his daughter! You can't just kick me out! Daniela, you hate me, don't you?You're just jealous because Alexander likes me. But I'm your sister. Why would I hurt you?" ①


As she spoke, she staggered back, almost as if shoved,crashing dramatically against the restroom door.


Outside, Alexander stood leaning against the wall,a cigarette between his fingers. He observed as Joyce stumbled out of the restroom, her body collapsing onto the floor in a heap.



Joyce tilted her head back, her teary eyes wide with false innocence. She knew Alexander could see her like this, looking as pitiful as possible.


She looked up at Daniela, her voice thick with complaint. "Daniela, why are you doing this to me? I know you like Alexander, but he's my true love, too!Am I not allowed to love someone? Fine, it's all my fault. I'll kneel and beg if that's what you want!" Her voice cracked, and her body shook as if she might collapse at any second.


Daniela watched Joyce's over-the-top performance with a calm, almost entertained look on her face.



Her eyes briefly moved to the doorway, where Alexander stood silently watching.


Daniela chuckled and crossed her arms. "Go on,kneel."


Joyce froze in place, her cries suddenly trailing off.She was thrown off, unsure of how to react to Daniela's unexpected response. "What?" she stammered, staring at Daniela in shock.



Daniela tilted her head slightly, her gaze sharp. "You said you'd kneel, didn't you? So go ahead, kneel.What's the hold-up? Can't follow through? Was all that talk just for show?"



Joyce's face turned red with embarrassment, her confidence slipping away.


Alexander started to speak, but before he could say anything, Daniela's cold stare landed on him. "She said she'd kneel. You heard her, didn't you? I didn't make her say it."
Her voice was steady and unwavering. It was nothing like the gentle tone she used to have. "This is a private matter between Joyce and me. You've crossed the line, Mr. Bennett."

###Chapter 24 Joyce,Remember This Lesson!
Daniela let out a mocking laugh, her piercing eyes locked onto Alexander. "So, what now, Mr. Bennett?Will you continue to defend Joyce after all this?"


Alexander's brow furrowed deeply as he faced her.It had been merely three months since their divorce, yet here she was, confronting him with such boldness.


Did being CEO of Elite Lux make her think she was untouchable?



His features grew stormier, and he was on the verge of retorting when Daniela added sharply, "Don't test my patience. Push me one more time, and I'll make damn sure both of you pay for it."


Without waiting for his response, Daniela slammed her heel down on Joyce's foot.


Joyce gasped, a sharp pain shooting through her as her complexion turned ghostly white. Before she could let out a cry, Daniela's icy voice descended upon her. "Consider this a lesson, Joyce."


With those words, Daniela spun on her heel and strode away, leaving a trail of tension in her wake. Behind her, Joyce crumpled to the floor, clutching her foot as she sobbed uncontrollably.


She wouldn't tolerate this, not for a second. She was the Harper family's crown jewel. How could she sit back and allow Daniela to disgrace her like this? 3


She attempted to rise and confront Daniela, but Alexander intervened, holding up his hand as a signal for her to stay put.


Tears gathered in Joyce's eyes as she spun around to face him."Alexander, are you siding with Daniela now?"



With his expression unreadable, Alexander replied,"Attend to your injury first."



Yet Joyce was not prepared to drop the issue so easily.


She was not merely an addition to the Harper family through her mother. Caiden cherished her deeply.Katrina lavished her with affection. Even the Bennett family had once held her in high regard. All her life,she had enjoyed a privileged status, always a step ahead of Daniela.



The humiliation Daniela had inflicted upon her was something she could not simply ignore.


She longed to chase down Daniela, yet Alexander's indifferent, icy demeanor gave her pause. With a slight pout, Joyce lamented, "Alexander,haven't I warned you before? Daniela is nothing but a schemer. She faked the whole innocent act just to rope you into being her husband. Now, with the divorce finalized, she doesn't even bother to conceal her true nature. She's always been a heartless,calculating woman!" 2


While Alexander's hand remained on Joyce's arm, his gaze drifted in the direction Daniela had taken.


It had been only three months, but Joyce had become utterly unrecognizable.	

She carried an unshakable defiance, paired with a heart that refused to forgive.



As Daniela stepped out, she found Lillian already seated in the car, waiting. Naturally, she had heard Joyce's dramatic wailing from earlier.


As Daniela got in, Lillian glanced at her, noticing the trace of frustration on her face.



She called out, "Daniela."


Daniela snapped out of her thoughts and turned to look at Lillian. "Yes? What's wrong?"


Lillian paused, her lips parting slightly as if to choose her words carefully. "You know, the domestic sector of Elite Lux doesn't need to stay in Olisvine. This bet with the board-it's ridiculous. With your talent, you are the pillar of this company. Those old executives back at the headquarters are just setting you up to fail."



Choosing love over her role at Elite Lux, Daniela had left behind a team of ingenius yet inept technicians.These individuals, brilliant in their own right, lacked the pragmatic touch needed to steer a corporation.


Under her absence, Elite Lux had floundered with internal discord, leaving its vital members sidelined and its shares vulnerable to predatory investors. On the outside, the company maintained its grand facade,but internally, it was crumbling.



Daniela had made her return and laid down a daring challenge to the old board members of Elite Lux.



She had vowed that within three years, she would not only launch a domestic branch but also elevate its annual revenue to the legendary trillion-dollar mark.


If she were to succeed, those veteran board members agreed to resign and hand over their shares.


"They're counting on your failure. They see this as a chance to push you out and sell Elite Lux for a lucrative profit. But you don't have to prove anything.You built Elite Lux from the ground up-it's inherently yours!"

Lillian's words radiated genuine concern,yet Daniela couldn't miss the quiet tremors of fear beneath her words.


She offered a soft, reassuring smile and responded,"You're not really concerned about the company,are you? You're worried that I'll lose focus because of Alexander,right?"


Lillian couldn't mask her apprehension and admitted,"Yes, that's exactly it. You haven't been back long,and already they've thrown so many obstacles your way. It's concerning." 2


Her worries were not unfounded. Years ago, when Elite Lux was flourishing, Daniela had abandoned everything in pursuit of love, leaving her empire behind without a second thought.


Now, with her return to the public eye,there would be a slew of opportunists eager to capitalize on her regained prominence.


Moreover,if Alexander were to reappear, weaving his charming deceits and hollow vows, Lillian dreaded that Daniela might once again succumb to his allure.
###Chapter 25 No One Can Stop Her
Lillian couldn't get rid of the nagging worry about Daniela falling for Alexander again.


When Daniela fell for someone, it was like an illness -impossible to stop and completely irrational.


The fear still lingered in Lillian's mind.


She'd rather give up Elite Lux than watch Daniela go through another painful ordeal.


Daniela, sensing Lillian's worry, turned to her loyal friend, the one who'd stood by her through everything.With a gentle smile, she reassured, "Don't worry.I don't make the same mistake twice."



There was a time when she was head over heels for Alexander,hanging on to every word he said.


But that love was gone. Alexander didn't mean a thing to her anymore.







Joyce was seething with embarrassment. Not only had she fallen, but Daniela had made sure to step on her foot for good measure.


Her swollen, bruised foot throbbed with pain as Alexander helped her home. By the time they reached the door, she was already crying out.


"Mom, hurry, I'm going to die from all this bullying!"


Katrina was excitedly telling her friends all about Joyce's upcoming engagement to Alexander when she suddenly heard Joyce's cries.


Without hesitation, she rushed out. The moment she saw Joyce's swollen foot, her reaction was dramatic,as if everything was falling apart. "Caiden! Caiden!Come down here! Our baby girl is hurt."


Caiden hurried down the stairs so fast that one of his slippers fell off.


When he caught sight of Joyce's injured foot, his expression contorted with a mix of anger and concern.


"What happened?" he snapped, his voice tense.


Joyce quickly began to explain, "It was Daniela! I went to the auction with Alexander today, and as soon as she saw me, she got furious. I went to the restroom,and she followed me in. She shoved me and then stepped right on my foot. Dad, it hurts so much!"
Caiden frowned sharply. "Really? Daniela's completely losing it!"



Joyce added fuel to the fire. "Dad, I just went to the auction to apologize. I know l've been careless and hurt her, so I wanted to make it right. But she called me greedy. She accused me of wanting the three floors of the Luxor Tower. Dad, I didn't mean anything by it-I just wanted us to get along as sisters. But she got so angry and attacked me. Do you think she's mad because I asked her for something?"



Caiden's face darkened with rage. "She's gone way too far! What does she mean by 'her things' or 'your things'? It's all part of the family. If you want three floors, they should be yours! If you want five or ten,you should get them too! You're her sister, her family.How can she be so selfish and ungrateful?"


He stood there with his hands on his hips, his frustration growing. It was then that he noticed Alexander standing quietly to the side.


"Alexander, did you hear that? Daniela's totally out of line! You need to do something about her!"



Alexander stayed calm, his tone distant. "We're divorced." 



"So what if you're divorced? Everyone knows Daniela always took your word seriously. You were her husband, and even though you're no longer together,you still have a responsibility to guide her. Just look at what she's done-posting things online that brought shame to the family, and now at the auction,getting involved with the organizer. What kind of message does that send?"



Joyce kept her head lowered, but a smug smile tugged at her lips. Caiden's unshakable support was exactly what she had hoped for.


She glanced at Alexander, expecting him to back her up and stand against Daniela.


But Alexander's words crushed her hopes.


"Daniela is the boss behind the auction, not the organizer," he said flatly.



Caiden and Katrina froze, staring at him, stunned.


Alexander pressed on, "As we were leaving, the organizer told someone that Daniela, CEO of Elite Lux,owns the auction house."



His words landed like a bomb. Turning to the shocked Caiden and Katrina, Alexander added, "I've brought Joyce home safely. I'll be leaving now." 

Katrina stood frozen, taking a few seconds to process Alexander's words.

Without waiting for a reply, Alexander headed towards his car.



Katrina snapped out of her daze and hurried after him."Alexander! Ask your grandfather when he's available so our families can talk about your engagement to Joyce!"



Alexander got in his car, started the engine, and drove off into the night without saying a word.


Back inside, Caiden grabbed his phone and called a friend to check if Daniela's influence had really expanded this far.



If that were the case, then he'd have something to proudly boast about.


Meanwhile, Katrina stood by the window, her eyes following Alexander's car as it faded from view.



Joyce,still resting against her mother, glanced up at her with a puzzled look and tilted her head. "Mom,what's got your attention?"


"Joyce,how did Daniela behave towards Alexander at the auction today?" Katrina asked.


Joyce let out a dismissive snort. "She's playing hard to get now. Instead of chasing him like she used to, she's acting like she doesn't care at all."

Katrina's chest tightened at her words. "And how did Alexander react to her?"



Joyce lifted her chin, a proud smile tugging at her lips."Well, of course, he still looks down on her, just like before! Alexander only has eyes for me. Mom, just wait-once I marry into the Bennett family, Daniela will be so jealous."


Katrina helped Joyce inside. After walking for a bit,she turned her head, glancing back.


The sleek black car had already blended into the traffic, its taillights disappearing into the darkness.


Katrina murmured, "Nothing and no one will stop my daughter from finding her happiness. Not a soul."

###Chapter 26 Is She Really That Same Daniela
As Alexander was heading home, his phone vibrated.It was a call from his father.



"Hey,Dad."


"There's a concert tonight. I've given your secretary the ticket. You should go."


Alexander was caught off guard. His father had always brushed off anything that didn't help the family business, calling it a waste of time.


And now, out of nowhere, he was offering a ticket to a concert?



However, the things Alexander had once found exciting in his younger years no longer seemed to hold much appeal.


He gave a half-hearted agreement, though he had no real intention of going.


That was until Richard added, "I've just heard that Daniela will be there too. Every rich bachelor will be attending tonight. Alexander, I know you're too proud to approach Daniela, but tonight could be your perfect chance. Of course, the choice is yours. If you don't seize it, someone else surely will."



Before Alexander could say anything,Richard hung up.


Alexander gazed at the glowing city lights, his father's words echoing in his head.


As he reached the next intersection, he turned the steering wheel.






Olisvine was famous for its impressive skyline,from its opulent skyscrapers to its famnous landmarks.


However, the most distinguished of them all was its concert hall, the largest in the nation.


The concert hall drew the country's top musicians and stood as a symbol of elegance and artistry.


Daniela had planned to head home after the auction,but Lillian insisted on taking her to the concert hall.


"The maestros have been eager to meet you.You own this place, but other than skimming the year-end reports, you've completely ignored it. Don't you feel a little guilty as the boss?"


Despite Daniela's objections, Lillian managed to pull her along.
The cello had been Daniela's mother's favorite instrument. Her mother's biggest wish was for her to pursue music.



But when the family fell apart, so did that dream.


For more than ten years, Daniela had pursued Alexander relentlessly, and throughout all that time,she had never once stepped foot in the concert hall again.


Now, as she entered through its familiar doors, a rush of memories and nostalgia hit her.


At the entrance, the senior maestros stood waiting. As soon as they spotted Daniela, they bowed in unison,greeting her respectfully.


These were people who had known her since she was a child, some who had even cradled her in their arms.Now, seeing her as an adult, they couldn't help but sigh at how quickly time had flown.


After exchanging pleasantries, the maestros politely excused themselves to get ready for the performance.


The hall's director remained behind to stay with Daniela.


Waving at a young man who had been closely following them, the director introduced, "This is my grandson. He just returned from abroad. You two will have plenty to chat about. He'll be your guide for the evening while I take care of things backstage."


Daniela smiled politely and nodded. "That sounds fine."


The young man had a warm, friendly smile. When Daniela smiled at him, his face turned bright red.


Lillian chuckled, leaning in to nudge Daniela's arm.


"Knock it off," Daniela muttered under her breath.


But Lillian turned to the young man and asked loudly,"Hey, handsome, up for some fun?"


The young man's face turned even redder, but he answered sincerely, "Sure," then slowly looked up to meet Daniela's eyes.


Lillian gave his shoulder an encouraging pat. "You've got potential!"


By the time the concert started, Alexander had finally shown up.


Richard had gotten him a prime front-row seat. As soon as he stepped into the hall, all eyes were on him,and the hall felt like it shifted with the tension.


The stares weren't exactly discreet. Everyone was looking at him-the ex-husband-wondering what on earth he was doing there.


Was he here trying to win her back?



Suddenly,all the gazes turned cautious and on guard.


Alexander ignored the stares and sat down. A guy next to him pulled at his sleeve, and Alexander turned to find his friend, Keith Clayton, grinning at him.①


"Well,well, what brings you here?" Keith asked with that familiar grin of his.


Alexander glanced over at Daniela. She was sitting a few rows away,completely lost in the performance,not even noticing he was there.


It was so different from before. In the past,no matter how crowded it was, she'd always spot him right away


A weird frustration bubbled up inside him. He instinctively went to loosen his tie but stopped himself when he remembered where he was.



Keith, always the talker, wasn't too interested in the classical music. He scanned the hall, looking at all the young heirs, and couldn't help but chuckle under his breath.



He leaned in and whispered to Alexander, "Hey, did you notice? Half of Olisvine's golden boys are here tonight, and I'm willing to bet that they're all here for Daniela. I bet most of them don't even know what's happening on stage."


Keith smirked and shook his head. "Crazy, right? Back in the day, Daniela was always ignored, stuck under her stepmother's control. And now? She's a CEO.I even told her once that she wasn't good enough for you. Funny how life has a way of proving you wrong,huh?" 



He added with a grin, "But enough about that. You've got to admit, she looks amazing tonight. That gown?It's from Elite Lux, custom-made. I heard it's worth five million and still rising. She's really turning heads."


Alexander stayed silent. His gaze turned from the stage to Daniela.


Since leaving the auction, she had changed into a breathtaking gown.


The soft, tranquil shade of blue reminded him of a peaceful lake, its beauty drawing the eye of anyone nearby.


Her hair was elegantly styled in an updo, and her posture was flawless, with her long,graceful neck held high like that of a regal swan.


She sat there quietly, completely absorbed in the performance, oblivious to the chatter swirling around her.
Keith let out another laugh. "So, what do you think?Does Daniela even get the music, or is she just playing along to fit in with the fancy crowd?"


Alexander's gaze flickered back to the stage,his voice calm and distant. "She doesn't get it."


Keith grinned knowingly. "I figured as much. People with money love to act like they're all about the fine arts. It's more about looking cultured than actually understanding it. And honestly..."


Before he could finish his sentence, the performance ended, and the crowd burst into applause.


The director of the concert hall walked onto the stage,microphone in hand, his expression warm and welcoming.



"Good evening, everyone. I have the honor of being the director here, and tonight, it's my privilege to introduce a very special guest, Daniela Harper,the owner of this venue. She's been an accomplished musician since childhood, particularly with the cello.It's been many years since I've had the pleasure of hearing her play, and I must ask-are we fortunate enough to hear her perform for us tonight?"


His words rang out, leaving the audience stunned into silence.
Those who had been distracted by their phones,making calls, or thinking about leaving suddenly stopped. Some quickly tucked their phones away,while others cut off their conversations mid-sentence.A few even straightened up, shifting in their seats as
they fully focused on Daniela.


Every person turned their attention to her, disbelief and curiosity written all over their faces.


Did Daniela own this concert hall? She could play the cello? Wasn't she just here for a quick appearance?What else had she been keeping under wraps?


Even the young heirs who had been dragged here by their families settled in and looked at Daniela, their boredom giving way to curiosity.


The same thought buzzed through everyone's mind.Could Daniela-the woman everyone had written off as just a pretty face-actually play?

###Chapter 27 Could This Really Be Daniela
Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a teasing smile creeping onto his face. "Daniela can't really play,right?"


"She can't," Alexander answered coolly, his voice steady but sure.  


He glanced at his watch and adjusted it with careful precision. "You know how these things go. Daniela's in charge of Elite Lux now, and everyone wants to get on her good side. She owns this concert hall as well, SO it's only natural that her people will be showering her with compliments."


A hint of disdain flickered in his eyes. Playing the cello wasn't something one could just fake. Without at least ten years of solid practice, what could she really be capable of? It would be a joke, plain and simple.This kind of mindless flattery was totally out of place for the occasion.  



Keith laughed, clearly entertained by everything happening around him. He wasn't all that into the concert-he just loved the spectacle.


Turning to Alexander, he asked, "Looks like everyone's kissing upto Daniela these days. What about you,Alexander? Here to join in?"


Laughing, Keith slapped Alexander on the shoulder."What's it like? The girl who used to run after you is now the one you're after. Must sting a little,huh? But hey, no judgment, man. We all do what we gotta do for money and power."



Alexander's face went cold, his jaw clenched as he shook off Keith's hand.



His already icy expression grew even darker with Keith's blunt words.



When Daniela stepped onto the stage, Alexander's face stayed as cold as ever.


Most people assumed this was a performance they'd have to sit through just out of politeness.


There were quiet whispers as Daniela walked gracefully toward the stage.


She sat down in front of the cello, adjusting it with care. After testing the strings quickly, she began to play, no flashy introduction, just starting in silence.


The first note sounded-rich and full-cutting through the soft murmurs in the room, instantly quieting everyone.


The crowd, which had just moments ago been filled with quiet doubt, now sat utterly silent. Every single eye was locked on Daniela.


Bathed in the soft glow of the stage lights, shesat with an air of elegance, her posture perfect and her hands moving with effortless grace. Her long hair gleamed in the spotlight, and her calm, serene expression gave her an almost otherworldly presence.


She seemed like an angel who had descended from the heavens, exuding both peace and authority.


Her fingers danced over the strings, and the music flowed-deep, emotional, and hauntingly beautiful.The melody filled the hall, surrounding the audience and drawing them in completely.


The hall was utterly quiet, except for the sound of her cello.


The audience, spellbound, couldn't look away. All the whispers, doubts, and judgments faded. Nothing mattered now except the music and the woman behind it.



Could this really be Daniela? The same woman they had dismissed as a shallow,love-struck fool?



When the last note dissolved into silence, Daniela rose from her chair, turned to the audience and offered a graceful,deep bow. "It's been a while since I last played. I hope it wasn't too disappointing. Thank you all for listening."


The hall exploded into applause, so loud and intense that it caught her off guard for a moment.


Her lips curled into a smile, her eyes softening with warmth. With elegance, she said, "Thank you."


Keith clapped so energetically that his hands turned red. He turned to Alexander, eyes wide with excitement and disbelief. "Did you hear that? Daniela actually played the cello! And not just played it-she crushed it! Can you believe this? Alexander, how did you not know she was this talented? How could you have been such a clueless ex-husband?"-	4



Alexander's dark eyes stayed locked on the stage, his face betraying a mix of emotions he couldn't quite process.



He had genuinely never known this side of her. All this time, he had believed she was naive, obedient, and shallow-just another woman obsessed with status and appearances.



But the woman he had seen just moments ago was nothing like the person he had imagined. She had sat there with a quiet, commanding presence, her confidence shining through in every movement.



Was this really Daniela? The audience erupted into whispers that quickly grew louder.



The first to speak were the young elites, their voices full of disbelief.



"That's Daniela?"



"Whoever called her a fool-come say it again."


"I'm in love with Daniela! I'll woo her!"



"Whoa, take it easy. What makes you think you'll be the only one? Let's be fair here. Everyone's in this!"



Even the general crowd couldn't hold back their chatter.





"Hold on, isn't that the CEO of Elite Lux?"



"Her performance was amazing. I've heard so many cello pieces, but this one spoke to my heart. It was perfect."


"I recorded the whole thing and posted it online just now. My notifications are exploding-hundreds of likes and comments already."



A wave of admiration and praise surged through the concert hall, sweeping over everyone.



Keith turned to Alexander, still clapping excitedly "Hey, Alexander, if you're not planning to win her back,I'm stepping in. Daniela is too amazing to just let go!"


Alexander sat quietly, a growing irritation gnawing at him as he listened to the constant stream of praise.


After a moment, he lifted his gaze. "Amazing? I don't understand what all the excitement is about." 
###Chapter 28 Daniela Became Smarter
Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a mischievous grin creeping onto his face. "Oh really? Well, in that case, I guess I'll go after Daniela."


For reasons Alexander couldn't fully explain, his frustration-already bubbling just below the surface -flared up at Keith's words.



Meanwhile,Daniela glided off the stage,lifting the hem of her gown with effortless elegance.


Cedric stepped forward and handed her a bouquet of flowers. His usually stiff demeanor softened, and a faint, almost proud smile tugged at his lips.



"Thank you," Daniela said with a polite smile and accepted the flowers.


She hadn't played the cello in years, but being back on stage again stirred up the same lighthearted joy she had experienced as a child.



As she scanned the crowd, her eyes landed on Alexander sitting among them.



Her expression changed in an instant, as if she'd just spotted an irritating fly buzzing around her.


Alexander immediately caught her glance and, almost without thinking, straightened up, his chest expanding a little.



However, Daniela's eyes barely lingered on him,passing over him with an icy indifference, as if he were just another face in the crowd.



Alexander's lips tightened into a thin line.


So she'd become a CEO and now thought she was above him?  



As the event came to an end,Daniela stayed behind to chat with the maestros. Meanwhile, the audience began to trickle out of the hall, but many couldn't help casting lingering glances her way.


Keith gave Alexander's arm a nudge. "So, are you going to go say hi?"



Alexander stole a glance at Daniela. She stood with graceful composure, her floor-length gown flowing elegantly, the pearls in her earrings catching the light and shimmering faintly. She appeared breathtaking,drawing everyone's gaze.



Keith chuckled when he saw Alexander pause. "I see what's going on. You're too proud to make the first move. Back in the day, it was always Daniela running after you, and now you don't know what to do,huh?Plus, with so many people around, maybe she didn't even catch sight of you. Otherwise,she would come to you. Everyone knows that she only has eyes for you."


With a grin, Keith waved his hand,calling out excitedly,"Daniela! Over here!"



As soon as she heard her name, Daniela turned her head towards them.



Keith flashed a big smile and pointed at Alexander."Daniela, look who's here-Alexander came to support you tonight."


Keith's message was clear-if Alexander wasn't going to approach Daniela, then she could come to him instead.



But to their surprise, Daniela simply cast them a cold,detached look. Then, she turned back to the person she had been chatting with and resumed her conversation.



Keith opened his mouth to speak again, but before he could, a man stepped in front of Daniela,blocking his view. It was Cedric. His face was stern, and the warning in his eyes made Keith pause.


Keith blinked, hesitated, and muttered, "Okay then."


By the time Daniela finished talking with the maestros and left the concert hal, it was already late into the night.



She hadn't anticipated findng Keith and Alexander hanging around by the entrance.


As lively as ever, Keith quickly called out, "Daniela!"


Daniela looked up briefly, and Keith and Alexander started heading towards her.



Before he could even approach, Keith was already grinning, his voice overflowing with praise. "Daniela,you were incredible tonight! I had no idea you hadthis kind of skill."



Daniela's smile was brief and polite, but it didn't reach her eyes. It was obvious she wasn't interested in chatting. "Thank you," she said flatly, then turned to leave.


Realizing she was about to walk off, Keith quickly added, "By the way, Alexander watched your performance too. He thought it was amazing."


At this, Daniela stopped in her tracks. Slowly, she turned her head, and her eyes locked onto Alexander.


Keith, noticing this, quickly lowered his gaze. He couldn't help but think that Daniela still had feelings for Alexander.


However, Daniela said, "Mr. Bennett, you were unusually attentive tonight. That's a first."


The way she emphasized "that's a first" was laced with obvious sarcasm, leaving no doubt about her meaning.


The moment felt charged. Her words were a sharp reminder of the fire incident from their marriage.



Keith stood frozen, his eyes locked on Daniela as if he were seeing her in an entirely new light.


She wasn't like the one he remembered. She was sharp, composed, like she had become smarter.
###Chapter 29 We Can't Be Friends
With a scowl, Alexander turned to leave, but Keith stopped him by grabbing his arm.


Keith flashed a grin and pulled out a business card,handing it over to Daniela. "Ms. Harper, we've crossed paths before-at your wedding with Alexander. I'm one of his close friends, Keith Clayton. Just call me Keith."



Daniela might've taken the card if he hadn't brought up Alexander. But when she heard the name, she didn't bother to take it. "I'm off the clock. I don't mix business with personal time. If you need something,just talk to my secretary."



Keith's grin wavered a little, his cheerful act dropping for a second. "It's not business. I just thought we could be friends."



Lillian frowned at his words and started to step in, but Daniela held up a hand, stopping her. "I'm no longer married to Alexander. His friends won't be mine. If there's nothing else, please excuse me."



Without waiting for an answer, she turned and started walking off.
As she neared her car, Keith saw the concert hall director's grandson excitedly holding the door open for her.



Unlike the cold indifference she'd shown to both Keith and Alexander, Daniela smiled warmly at the young man."Thank you."


Under the glow of the neon lights, the young man's ears flushed bright red. "Goodbye, Ms. Harper."


Keith watched with interest as the scene unfolded, his eyes fixed on the young man. He nudged Alexander and said, "You know, Daniela's always been stunning -guys have always been drawn to her. But now, with her being the CEO of Elite Lux, she's on an entirely different level. Just look at that boy-he's all nervous and trying so hard to impress her. And she's being so sweet with him."



Alexander walked to the parking lot without saying anything.


Keith continued, "You know, Alexander, if I had realized that Daniela was completely done with you,l wouldn't have dragged you with me earlier. Do you think I came off badly? I mean, she shut me down pretty quickly back there."


As Keith kept talking, he caught something odd.Alexander's hand seemed to hesitate,gripping the car door handle a little tighter, right at the moment he mentioned Daniela being over him.


Keith blinked, his instincts kicking in. Alexander was not as unaffected by her as he was trying to make everyone believe.


Keith saw his chance and leaned in. "Alexander,women like Daniela are one of a kind, and they deserve to be treated well. She's beautiful, successful,and getting attention from all sides. If you don't make a move,someone else will. And Joyce? She's a ticking time bomb, and her mother isn't any better. If you go through with marrying her, you'll regret it every single day. Just think about it-three months ago, Daniela was going out of her way to make you happy. Even now,despite how distant she's acting, there's still a bit of warmth in her. If you just let go of your pride and apologize, I'm sure she'll forgive you. So, why keep acting like you couldn't care less?"



Alexander's face tightened, his frustration obvious. He wrenched the car door open and, before slamming it shut, he snapped, "Does everything havè to be about her now?"



The door banged shut, and his car roared to life,tearing into the night and blending into the rush of traffic.



Keith stayed behind, watching the taillights disappear. With a deep sigh, he shook his head and muttered under his breath, "If the day ever comes when she really doesn't love you anymore, you'll be left begging and pleading."  







Alexander didn't hear a thing Keith said. He sped down the road,his mind elsewhere.


When he got home, the living room lights were still on.Richard was there, clearly eager to know how things went with Daniela.


Before Alexander could even make it all the way through the door, Richard jumped in with a grin."Well?How'd it go? I heard that half of Olisvine's bachelors were at the concert hall tonight. You had a prime spot.Did Daniela notice you?"


"She did," Alexander replied flatly.


Richard's face brightened with hope. Grinning like the result was already decided, he asked, "And? Did you actually talk to her? Did you bring up the idea of getting back together?"



Alexander's expression turned cold. "No."


Richard's smile dropped, frowning."Why not?"


Alexander didn't want to get into it. "I'm tired,"he said sharply, then turned and went upstairs, ending the conversation.



Once he was in his room, he didn't rush to shower or change. He loosened his tie and dropped into a chair.


His eyes, dark and unfocused, stared at the empty room as his mind spiraled.



He couldn't stand the feeling that the world was trying to force him and Daniela back together. The thought of chasing someone who didn't care for him was something he hated.


Love had always seemed like a concept he didn't buy into.


For ten years, Daniela had pursued him-ten years of relentless loyalty.


She had been such a constant part of his life that her sudden absence now left a noticeable void. He tried to convince himself that this unease was simply the result of withdrawal.


He kept repeating the same reasoning in his mind.Their marriage had never been anything but a practical,business-driven arrangement.


It hadn't been about feelings or love.


When things clicked, they stayed.

When they didn't, they went their separate ways.



It was as simple as that.


Yet, despite all his attempts to rationalize it,Alexander couldn't shake the image of Cedric standing in front of Daniela earlier that evening. The memory stirred something strange and unsettling inside him.


He repeated in his mind-this was just withdrawal.


If he kept a dog for years, it was only natural to get attached.



And Daniela was human.


Alexander told himself that he was just not used to it.







Daniela had gotten home from the concert, only to end up drinking a pricey bottle of wine with Lillian.


Lillian spent the night ranting about Alexander.When Daniela finally woke up, her head was cloudy, and the events from the night before felt distant and hazy.①


At that moment, a gentle knock echoed at the door.The housekeeper's unsure voice came through. "Ms.Harper?"



"What is it?" Daniela mumbled, still half-dazed.
The housekeeper paused for a moment, clearly unsure,before speaking in a hesitant, nervous tone. "There's a man downstairs, claiming to be your father. He's been waiting for over an hour. He's with two women -one named Katrina and the other Joyce. They said they're your family."



Daniela blinked, the words slowly sinking in. Her gaze turned to the phone on her nightstand, now lighting up with an incoming call.


She answered the phone, put it on speaker, and walked into the bathroom to freshen up.



"Awake?" Cedric's voice came through, low and smooth.



"Hmm," Daniela murmured.



"I had some top-tier food brought in today. Care to join me for lunch?”



Daniela patted her face dry with a towel before responding, "Not today. I've got something to handle."


"What's going on?"


Daniela set the towel down and clipped her earrings on. Her tone remained calm and light as she said,"Looks like it's time to confront my family."
###Chapter 30 Empty The House

Ten minutes later, in the downstairs living room,Joyce reclined on the couch, her tone overly sweet as she bossed the housekeeper around.



"These fruits are exquisite. Pack up a box for me to take home. And the fruit platter-it's stunning. I need to know where you found it. I'll take that too. Oh, and see that little table over there? It's just perfect for late -night snacks. Fold it up for me,will you?"


While she issued her orders, Joyce drifted over to the large fish tank.



The housekeeper, visibly stressed, hurried over with a forced smile. "Ms. HHolt, these fish are a special gift from Mr. Phillips. I've heard each one is valued at over twenty thousand dollars."



Joyce's interest piqued, she glanced at Katrina, who understood her intentions immediately.



Leaning on Caiden's arm, Katrina remarked, "Just look at Daniela's lavish setup here. This tank alone must be worth a fortune. She really indulges herself, doesn't she?"
Caiden scoffed, "She doesn't know the first thing about living sensibly. Joyce, if you fancy it, we can have someone come and collect the entire tank later."


Joyce's smile widened, clearly pleased. She had to acknowledge,Daniela was not only wealthy but had an exceptional eye for style. Everythingin the house was curated with elegance. 2


Eyeing a nearby cabinet, Joyce's smile turned cunning."Dad, I'd like that cabinet as well. It would be perfect in our place." ①



The housekeeper's heart dropped. "This cabinet is another gift from Mr. Phillips. It's crafted from rare rosewood and was acquired at an auction. It's not really something we can just give away."


Katrina chuckled lightly, turning to Caiden. "Daniela may be thriving in her career, but it seems her staff doesn't quite understand. We're all family here.Why should there be such boundaries among us?"



Caiden's expression hardened as he faced the housekeeper, his voice dropping to an icy,authoritative timbre. "I'm her father.Whatever I desire,she should be willing to provide. Even if I demanded this entire building, she'd have no choice but to comply-let alone a mere cabinet."



The housekeeper bowed her head submissively. "Yes,  sir."



Emboldened by Caiden's declaration, Joyce's demeanor swelled with conceit. She swept her hand across the room, pointing at the lavish furnishings as though compiling a wish list on an extravagant shopping spree.



Turning to Caiden with a gleeful grin, she said, "Dad,I'll arrange for movers to collect these items. And while we're at it, could you convince Daniela to refurbish the 18th to 20th floors for me? I want them styled just like this."



The housekeeper's eyes bulged, her mind reeling at the audacity. These people were beyond belief.



Her eyes darted towards the staircase, hoping Daniela would appear soon.


Anxiety tightened her chest. If Daniela didn't intervene quickly, they'd empty the entire house.


Just as panic threatened to overwhelm her, a firm knock resounded through the room.


A flicker of hope sparked across the housekeeper's face, half-expecting it to be Lillian, whose gutsy demeanor might defuse the escalating situation.


However, the door swung open to reveal not Lillian,but a team of professional movers, clad in their work uniforms.



"Hello, did someone here request a moving service?"one mover inquired.


The housekeeper peeked outside, her heart sinking as she saw over ten robust men, poised as though ready to gut the house.


She waved her hands fretfully. "My employer is still resting. Could you perhaps wait a little longer? Just until-"



"Wait for what?" Before she could finish, Joyce barged past her and barked at the movers, "Come in!What are you waiting for? We've been expecting you."


The mover apologized promptly, "Sorry, ma'am. The traffic downtown was horrendous."



Joyce dismissed their excuse with an irritated wave of her hand. "Spare me the details. Just get in here." She led them into the living room, her gestures grand and commanding as she pointed out her selections."Take that. And this. Oh, and that one over there too.The fish tank-yes, the whole thing, fish included.Move it all!"



The movers examined the items carefully before providing a quote. "Since there are live animals involved,the fee will be slightly higher. If that's alright, we can begin immediately."


Joyce waved them off dismissively, her tone dripping with entitlement. "Go ahead and start. Bill the owner of the house for it later."


The movers, methodical and professional, began unpacking their equipment, ready to pack up the requested items.



The housekeeper, now frantic, stepped forward in a last-ditch effort to intervene. "No, no! This can't happen! Miss Harper still asleep. Please, at least wait until she wakes up so you can ask her first. If she consents, then fine, take what you like. But I'm just the housekeeper-I don't have the authority to let this happen. If she comes downstairs to find her house stripped bare,what explanation am I supposed to give?Please,I beg you!"



Caiden claimed to be Daniela's father,Katrina asserted herself as the stepmother, and Joyce proclaimed as the stepsister.



Confused by the family dynamics, the housekeeper felt utterly helpless.



"What did you just say?" Joyce snapped, her tone sharp and cutting as her glare bore into the housekeeper. "I said, move these things. Didn't you hear me?"
The housekeeper, though visibly trembling, planted herself in front of the fish tank, resolutely blocking their path.



Joyce's frustration reached its boiling point.Without a second thought, she raised her hand and struck the housekeeper hard across the face.



The housekeeper, a woman in her fifties, stumbled under the force of the slap. Her eyes brimmed with tears, but she stood her ground, too terrified to speak.


Joyce seized her arm roughly, shoving her aside with a dismissive sneer. Turning back to the movers, she barked, "Move it, now!" 

###Chapter 31 Even I Have to Respect Him
The movers nodded and bent down, working together to lift the massive fish tank.


At that moment, the doorbell rang again.


With a piercing look, Joyce directed her fiery gaze at the housekeeper, her voice thick with exasperation."Have you lost your hearing? Open the door, now!" ①


Tears brimming in her eyes, the housekeeper went towards the door. "Just how many more people do they intend to bring in?" she muttered to herself,frustrated.



Katrina reclined against Caiden, her fingers teasingly caressing his chest in slow, deliberate circles."Daniela's servant is just too careless. Next time, let me bring in someone more dependable to take care of her. It's the least we can do to ensure she doesn't have to deal with such incompetence."


At her words, Caiden's expression melted into one of tender affection. He gazed down at her, his admiration palpable, and tenderly pressed a kiss to her forehead.


"Katrina,your heart is just so expansive. You've woven  yourself into the fabric of this family, yet Daniela hasn't once called you 'Mom.' Still, you think only of her welfare. Truly, making you my wife was the finest decision of my life."  


Katrina's gaze fluttered downwards, a rosy blush coloring her cheeks. "I'm simply reflecting the goodness you shower upon me,honey."


Caiden, observing her demure smile, felt a surge of warmth flood his chest.


Their eyes locked, brimming with a silent, electric charge.


This was the tableau that greeted Cedric as he arrived.The house buzzed with activity, movers weaving through rooms, while the housekeeper,her cheek puffed and reddened, tear stains marking her eyes,stood at the threshold.



She edged closer to Cedric, her voice quivering."They're clearing out the house. Miss Harper is still sleeping."


Cedric's piercing gaze grew stormy, his features setting into a stern mask. Silently, he stepped inside.


The first spectacle to catch his eye was Caiden and Katrina, entwined in an intimate embrace,seemingly unaware of the world around them.

This wasn't even their house-it belonged to Daniela.Yet there they were, shamelessly engaging in flirtatious banter amidst the bustling movers. Had he not arrived when he did, one could only speculate on the extent of their indiscretions.


Cedric's eyebrows knitted together, a spark of annoyance flashing across his countenance.


The instant Joyce spotted Cedric, her expression erupted in sheer joy. Overcome with excitement,she blurted out, "Mr.Phillips!"



Cedric Phillips!


For someone like her, who seldom encountered individuals of Cedric's renowned status, the reality of meeting him was nothing short of mesmerizing.


Rooted to the spot, she could do nothing but stare at him,her eyes wide with admiration as time seemed to slow down around her.


"He's absolutely stunning," she muttered to herself in awe, the thought echoing loudly in her mind.


His appearance was striking-those sharp features,those piercing eyes, flawless in every conceivable way.


Her overt awe didn't escape Katrina's notice. Standing a few feet away, she observed her daughter's lack of  subtlety with a frown. With a pointed cough, she attempted to snap Joyce out of her reverie.


Jolted back to the present, Joyce quickly dabboed at her lips and ran her fingers through her hair to compose herself. She approached Cedric with a tentative step, offering a hand and a bashful smile."Hi there, I'm Joyce, Daniela's sister. It's a pleasure to meet you."


Cedric remained motionless, his hands tucked into his pockets, radiating a chilling aloofness. He gave Joyce a quick, indifferent look, treating her as if she were merely an inconsequential blur in his field of vision.


A wave of embarrassment washed over Joyce at his dismissive gaze, yet her fascination only grew stronger. Despite his cold dismissal, her enthusiasm for him remained undiminished.


Katrina was discreetly studying Cedric from across the room. Though their paths had never crossed before,the tales she had heard painted a vivid picture of him.


Cedric stood out dramatically-his height imposing,his features strikingly handsome, and his demeanor radiated an undeniable power that seemed to silently command respect from everyone around him.


If Joyce could marry Cedric...


Katrina turned her attention to Caiden, lightly  squeezing his hand to garner his focus. "Between Cedric and Alexander, whom do you favor more?"


Caiden grasped the essence of Katrina's inquiry immediately-she was appraising Cedric as a potential match for Joyce. He replied, "Cedric, without any doubt. Alexander might have Richard's support, but that's precisely his weak point-Richard's influence is too pervasive, and Alexander can't seem to step out from under his shadow. Cedric is a different story He's self-taught, self-made. His achievements are solely his own, which even I must commend."



He paused, considering the familial implications. "Plus,his personal life is uncomplicated-only his elderly grandmother requires his care. If Joyce marries him,she'd practically run the show,with no one to second -guess her decisions. His prowess in business is unmatched, a stark contrast to the Bennett family,who are constantly currying favor and clinching deals.There's absolutely no contest-Cedric is in a class by himself."



Katrina's eyes shimmered with excitement and anticipation. "Do you, someone of your insight,truly respect him?"



Caiden nodded affirmatively, his face breaking into a thoughtful smile. "In business, certainly. But should Joyce succeed in intertwining their fates through marriage, no matter his capabilities, Cedric will have to defer to me, regardless."
###Chapter 32 She Had No Home Long Ago
Katrina radiated excitement, practically glowing. She let go of Caiden's hand and stepped towards Joyce,positioning herself confidently before turning to address Cedric.



"Cedric Phillips, Daniela's close friend, right? I'm Daniela's stepmother. Please, feel free to call me Katrina." She extended her hand towards him,her face adorned with a polished, almost-too-perfect smile.



But Cedric didn't budge. His hands stayed buried in his pockets, his sharp eyes surveying the room with a frigid intensity. He didn't so much as glance at her offered hand.



The atmosphere tensed with Cedric's arrival. His sheer presence was enough to command the room,halting the movers mid-task.



"Starting a move this early in the morning?" Cedric asked, his lips curling into a faint, sardonic smile.



Katrina's hand hung in the air awkwardly for a moment,but her polished demeanor didn't falter. She recovered, letting out a light, breezy laugh and adopting an effortless tone. "No, not moving! Daniela  still lives here. It's just that Joyce felt some of the furniture and decorations didn't quite align with Daniela's style. We were discussing some upgrades to better suit her taste. As parents, it's only natural we want her to have the best. She lives alone, after all,and we want her to feel comfortable and well taken care of."



Katrina's ability to twist the narrative to her favor was nearly flawless.
Stating the truth-that they were pillaging the home -would paint her as selfish and cold.



But framing it as an effort to enhance Daniela's living situation made her sound thoughtful,even selfless.



She had mastered this technique over the years,crafting the image of a loving, supportive stepmother everyone admired.



The housekeeper could only stare in stunned silence,knowing the stark contrast between Katrina's words and her actions.



What was she even saying now? Just moments ago,this woman had been barking orders and laying claim to anything she fancied.



The housekeeper's anxiety surged as she glanced at Cedric, silently praying he wouldn't be fooled by Katrina's sudden change in demeanor.

Cedric remained unmoved, his expression cold and unreadable as he pulled a chair ov/er and settled into it with deliberate calm.



His sharp gaze flicked briefly towards the movers handling the fish tank.


"So, the fish tank and the fish that I gifted aren't good enough? Is that it? Are you saying my gift doesn't suit this house?"



His words cut through the room like a blade, the underlying warning impossible to miss.



Caiden sprang to his feet, his face draining of color."No! Of course not! How could we ever think that?Your gift is, naturally, the best of the best!"



He knew all too well that Cedric, despite his youth,was infamous for his ruthless business acumen.



One snap decision from him could dismantle entire empires or obliterate competitors.



He wasn't someone to provoke lightly.


Standing there with an awkward, forced smile,Caiden tried to salvage the situation. But Cedric didn't even glance at him, his attention fixed coolly on his phone.



The atmosphere in the room was suffocating. Caiden  and Katrina stood rigid, while the movers exchanged uneasy glances, unsure whether to proceed or abandon the task.



The silence stretched unbearably, thick with tension,until one of the movers hesitantly broke it. "Should we keep moving?"



The question shattered the stillness, but instead of diffusing the tension, it seemed to amplify it.


Caiden's gaze darted nervously towards Cedric,whose finger had paused mid-swipe on his phone screen.That small motion alone made Caiden's throat tighten as he swallowed hard.



"Of course,we'll leave the fish tank exactly where it is,"Katrina chimed in with a saccharine smile, desperate to defuse thesituation. "But perhaps we could take a few of the other items? Just the ones that don't quite fit the decor here?"



Her greed peeked through her polished facade, unable to suppress her true intentions.


Daniela's furniture was a testament to impeccable taste. The sofa, made of solid rosewood and adorned with buttery-soft leather cushions, far surpassed anything Katrina could boast of at home.



It was only natural that she wanted to take the best pieces back with her.
As for the fish tank and Cedric's other gifts? Those could wait. Once Cedric left, she'd return to claim them.



Her plan was already clear in her mind.


"Mr. Phillips, would that be alright?" Caiden's voice was tentative, measured with caution.

Cedric,however, didn't even lift his head. His attention stayed fixed on his phone, his finger scrolling as if oblivious to the tension around him.



He neither agreed nor refused, leaving Caiden in a painfully awkward limbo.


The oppressive silence in the room grew thicker.


Then,the faint creak of a door opening upstairs broke the stillness.



Everyone except Cedric exhaled in relief.


Daniela was finally coming downstairs.



Caiden, shaken from his uneasy trance, felt a cold sweat drench his back.


For the first time, he found himself actually eager to see his biological daughter.



"Daniela," he called out, his voice uncharacteristically soft as he watched her descend the stairs. "You're finally awake!"



His tone, unusually gentle and warm, carried the practiced air of a caring father.



Years ago, Daniela had longed for even a moment like this-for her father to speak to her with such kindness.



But Caiden's tenderness had always been reserved for Joyce.Never her.


That fragile hope had withered and died long ago,buried beneath years of neglect and indifference.


Daniela descended the stairs, her expression composed and unreadable. Her gaze drifted over the scene in the living room, pausing on the movers standing uncertainly amid the disarrayed furniture.



Their uniforms, a deep green, bore the company's slogan in bold letters.



"We bring happiness back home."


The word "home" struck Daniela with a wave of bitter irony.


She hadn't known the meaning of that word in years.


Daniela's eyes roved across the room, finally settling on Cedric, whose calm demeanor stood in stark  contrast to the tense atmosphere. Then her attention shifted to the housekeeper,her swollen, tear-streaked face speaking volumes.



Her eyes gradually hardened, a shadow darkening their depths.

###Chapter 33 Daylight Robbery


The moment Daniela descended the stairs, her icy,aloof demeanor extinguished Caiden's tentative smile.


For a fleeting second, he contemplated chastising her,yet his attention diverted to Cedric, who was firmly planted in his chair.


No longer engrossed in his phone, Cedric nonetheless seemed rooted to the spot, exhibiting no signs of departure.


Concealing his iritation, Caiden managed a polite smile and turned to Cedric. "Mr. Phillips, now that Daniela has joined us, was there something particular you wished to discuss with her? Perhaps you could have a word with her first?"


With a lazy stretch, Cedric settled deeper into his seat his voice smooth and unhurried. "We're set for lunch later. There's no need to rush. You two chat-I'll stay out of the way. When you're finished, I'll take her along."


His insinuation was unmistakable: he wasn't leaving anytime soon.

Caiden,suppressing his annoyance, shot Cedric a wary glance before facing Daniela again.


A subtle yet undeniable edge of criticism colored his voice this time.


"Unbelievable, Daniela. Getting up this late? With your pathetic work ethic, it's a joke that you're even running a business."


Daniela delayed her response, instead strolling into the kitchen and serving herself a glass of milk.


With a brief glance at Katrina and then Joyce,a smile danced on her lips.


Caiden's jaw tightened. "What's so funny?"


Dressed to perfection and carrying an air of unshakable authority, Daniela returned to the living room and settled elegantly into the cushions.


"I'm laughing because I'm dying to know-what bullshit plan are you cooking up this time?" Her tone dripped with sarcasm, a subtle smirk on her lips accentuating her clear disdain.


"Daniela!" Caiden's voice hardened, his eyes narrowing with a warning edge. "Mind your words!"

 
Unfazed, Daniela retorted, "If my memory serves me right, you were the one who publicly declared our father-daughter ties cut. It was in the newspapers,wasn't it?Perhaps you've forgotten.  It's understandable,given your lovely new wife and darling daughter are now in the picture. Don't worry-I saved a screenshot of that announcement. Would you like to see it?"



Caiden's expression tensed visibly.


Undeterred, Daniela pressed on. "Since we're nothing to each other anymore,let me ask-what twisted logic made you think bringing your pathetic family into my home was okay?"


Her gaze briefly swept over to the housekeeper and then to the movers. "You've hit my staff and started seizing my possessions. So, I must ask-what is this,if not daylight robbery?"


Stepping up,Joyce interjected sharply, "Daniela, don't twist it into something terrible! We're taking your stuff because you actually matter to us!" 2


Daniela's frosty expression didn't waver as she fixed her piercing eyes on Joyce. "Oh, really? Should I applaud you for that?"


For a moment, Joyce stumbled, her composure cracking like fragile glass.


Stepping in, Katrina coaxed, "Daniela, you're being overly harsh. I understand you're hurt because your father declared he's cutting ties with you,but consider his age-he can be rash at times. Do you truly want to cling to resentment? Bonds between father and daughter aren't so easily dissolved by a mere public statement. You've been part of the Harper family for over twenty years-don't pretend you made it all on your own. Let's not ruin family ties with needless stubbornness."



Katrina was the epitome of hypocrisy-sweet on the surface,venomous underneath.


Unaware of her duplicity, Caiden absorbed only the words that suited his narrative.



He truly thought Katrina was the peacemaker of the family.


His expression hardened further, his eyes locking on Daniela with a freezing intensity.


In his eyes, she was nothing more than a spoiled brat who didn't know how to appreciate a damn thing.


Daniela, however, was no stranger to Katrina's manipulations. She lifted her hand, signaling an end to the discussion. "Stop pretending this was all some impulsive mistake. Let's face it,Dad-you couldn't wait to cut me loose, could you?"


Caiden was obsessed with his image, and the idea of eating his words, especially with Cedric watching,was utterly humiliating.



To concede a mistake in such a scenario was unthinkable.



His expression grew darker, a storm brewing in his eyes. As he parted his lips to protest, Katrina slid gracefully into the seat next to him, her fingers lightly pressing his, and whispered, "If we upset Daniela, how will we convince her to give those floors to Joyce?She's your daughter. What's the point of holding a grudge against her? After all these years of raising her,would you really want to see all your efforts go to waste?"



Caiden's jaw tightened, a visible tremor of frustration rippling through him. "Are you suggesting I should just submit to her demands now?"



With a serene smile, Katrina embodied both innocence and empathy. "She's your daughter. Is it really that demeaning to yield a little for her? But if the thought is too bitter for you, allow me to be the peacemaker."



Rising with deliberate grace, Katrina bent forward into a deep, respectful bow. "Daniela, I accept the blame for everything that has transpired. As your stepmother,I've let you down. Please, don't punish your father for my mistakes. I see youI're upset, and I want to apologize. I'm sorry. Can we move past this and focus on what's ahead?"



Her voice, soft and pleading, was laden with feigned self-abnegation. She assumed the guise of a benevolent,loving stepmother with flawless precision.


Caiden, observing this, was overwhelmed with a rush of pride and tenderness for Katrina. His heart swelled with appreciation for her display of "kindness," and he made a silent promise to himself to provide even greater support for her and Joyce in the coming days.


How could they, so innocent and righteous, livein this dangerous world without him watching over them?

###Chapter 34 Keep Dreaming
Daniela let out a sharp,icy laugh. "So, you came here to apologize? You showed up uninvited, assaulted my staff,and then,without permission, tried to strip my house bare. Is this a new kind of apology I've yet to learn about?"



Katrina opened her mouth to respond.



Turning to the movers with a cool smile, Daniela said,"I'm sorry for all the trouble you've gone through,but nothing here is leaving. Thank you for your time."


The movers exchanged uneasy glances. One of them finally stepped forward hesitantly. "We still need to cover the transportation costs. We brought a lot of people out here, so someone needs to pay for the service."



Daniela chuckled, nodding. "Of course. That's reasonable."



Her gaze snapped to Katrina, sharp and cutting. "Go on; this one's on you."



Katrina's lips twitched as she battled the surge of anger rising within her. Forcing a tight smile, she reached into her purse, pulled out a wad of cash, and  handed over ten thousand dollars. "Thank you for your time. I apologize for this little family misunderstanding. Have a safe trip back."



The movers, now satisfied, quickly packed up their equipment and left, leaving the room quiet once again.


Katrina glanced at Caiden,her expression unreadable but loaded with intent. Her eyes spoke volumes.



The furniture could wait. She needed to secure the bigger prize.



Caiden straightened. "Luxor Tower is enormous.There's no way you need all this space, Daniela. Hand over the 18th to 20th floors to your sister. And one more thing-Joyce is running a clothing store. She wants a collaboration with Elite Lux for a joint collection. Take care of it."



Before Daniela could respond, Joyce jumped in with eager enthusiasm. "Dad, I don't know much about design. Maybe Daniela could handle that part for me?"



Caiden nodded, pleased with the suggestion."Excellent idea. Daniela, take care of it. And while you're at it, renovate the floors. I stopped by your office earlier-it's impressive. Use that as inspiration.Make it just as grand. After all, you're sisters. Now that you're successful, it's your duty to look out for her."


His tone hardened, disappointment dripping from every word. "Frankly, I shouldn't have to spell this out for you. You're so inconsiderate sometimes. I can't imagine what kind of man would even want to marry you. And if anyone does, it'll only be for your money.Daniela, this is all because your mother raised you so poorly!"



Caiden's words grew increasingly cutting, his voice rising with unchecked arrogance.



Daniela remained calm, her expression serene, as though his insults barely registered. She had long since grown accustomed to her father's harsh words.



But across the room, Cedric's eyes narrowed, a dark shadow clouding his face.



When Daniela glanced at him, she noticed the storm brewing in his expression. She offered him a faint,reassuring smile.



Turning back to Caiden, Daniela spoke evenly, her voice controlled and almost gentle. "The floors? Of course. And the renovations? Why not? You're absolutely right. Now that I've done well, it's only fair to help my sister."


The moment she said this, Caiden, Katrina,and Joyce visibly relaxed. Relief washed over their faces, quickly replaced by smug satisfaction.


Daniela was still the same meek, pliable girl, too weak  to stand up for herself.


Katrina and Joyce exchanged a fleeting look of regret,realizing they could've demanded much more.



Ten floors, perhaps even more thanthat-Daniela would've agreed without a fight.


"Good," Caiden said curtly, rising to his feet, his discomfort with Cedric's oppressive presence evident.


Straightening his jacket, he turned to Daniela with his usual commanding tone.



"Start the paperwork. Transfer those floors to Joyce.And make sure the renovations use the best materials.No cutting corners-anything less will only cause problems for her down the line."


He turned to the door, ready to leave.


"Joyce?" Daniela's voice rang out, calm yet deliberate,halting him mid-step. "Dad, what exactly are you saying? You expect me to hand over the floors to Joyce and pay for her renovations? Are you joking?"


Caiden froze, his expression darkening as his face tightened. "But you just said-"


"I said I had no issue helping my sister. But you meant Joyce?Well, that's an issue. You see, I hold blood ties in the highest regard. And Joyce? She doesn't share my mother's blood. So no, I don't see her as my sister.And you want me to hand over my property to her?"



Her smile widened, though her gaze was razor-sharp."If I did that, my mother would surely curse me from her grave for being so stupid. Do you even remember my mother, Dad? When she died, she was drenched in blood. Just last night, I thought I heard her voice.She told me she had only one daughter. When you started talking about helping a sister, for a moment, I thought maybe you and my mom had another child somewhere I didn't know about. What a pity."



Caiden's face flushed with anger, his balance faltering as he staggered slightly, his fury barely contained."Your mom and I only had you! I married your stepmother, and Joyce is your sister!"


Daniela remained unruffled, her faint smile still in place. "Oh, I see now. You mean the baggage that the woman you chose brought into the family. And now you expect me to take care of it? Keep dreaming."


"Daniela!" Caiden roared, his face turning a deep,furious red. "Watch your mouth!"


His anger boiled over, his hand flying into the air,ready to strike.

 ###Chapter 35 Joyce Saw Cedric
The slap was just about to land.


Daniela frowned, ready to react, when suddenly someone stepped in front of her.


There stood Cedric, shielding her decisively



Towering and formidable,his presence sliced through the tension, exuding an undeniable command that seemed to stabilize the chaos around him.



Daniela, perplexed yet oddly reassured, remained motionless, her eyes drifting downward to notice Cedric's other hand, balled into a firm fist at his side.


Caiden's fury escalated, his hand frozen in the air,quivering with wrath as he shot a venomous look towards Cedric. "What do you think you're doing?"



Cedric returned his gaze, his eyes cold and unwavering."And what do you think you're doing?"


Caiden's voice soared in volume, tinged with defiance."I'm disciplining my own daughter. Must you meddle in this?"

At that moment, Daniela stepped from behind Cedric,her fingers lightly grasping his sleeve. She nodded towards the security camera perched above them and spoke to Caiden.



"If you're eager to make headlines tomorrow, feel free to take a swing. But I'm curious-what do you suppose the news will declare? Will it be-Elite Lux's CEO's Estranged Father Makes a Violent Entrance,Tries to Steal from His Own Daughter? Or maybe-Disgraced Father Strikes His Own Flesh and Blood in Defense of His Second Wife? And with the recent news about that fire, Dad, don't you believe this whole ordeal would be a hot topic for the media?"



Caiden felt as if he were teetering on the brink of insanity. His entire frame trembled as a raw, anguished roar escaped him. "Daniela!"


Daniela remained upright,her smile sugary and teasing."Yes,Dad?"



Caiden sensed that if he didn't exit soon,he would just burst from unrestrained anger.


"Enough! Daniela, if you choose to be this cold, this cruel, clutching at your precious wealth, then don't bother seeking my aid when you find yourself desperate one day."



Daniela waved her hand. "Of course, Dad. Be careful as you leave."



Caiden, cheeks aflame with anger, stormed out without a backward glance.



Katrina stole a quick glance at Cedric, who remained silent,standing loyally by Daniela's side.



Katrina, ever the embodiment of a graceful stepmother when others were present, softened her voice. "Daniela, such youthful innocence. You haven't yet felt the profound burdens of parenthood. With time, when you have kids, you'll see that preserving family unity is the ultimate endeavor. Riches,celebrity,and authority-they vanish like morning mist. I dearly hope you won't live to regret today's choices."



Daniela let out a playful snort, her lipscurling into an amused smile. "The prospect of motherhood isn't on my agenda this lifetime. And trust me, if I ever ventured down that path, I wouldn't follow in Caiden's footsteps. Yes, I confess-fame and power do catch my fancy. Just a heads-up, steer clear of myfinances."


Katrina's mask of composure cracked. Realizing her soft-spoken manipulations were ineffective, her face momentarily tightened in frustration before she regained her poise. After a lingering,poignant glance at Cedric, she let out a resigned sigh, turned gracefully,and made her exit.


Daniela, arms folded in mock defiance, turned her attention to Joyce, who was still planted in the same spot, obviously torn about leaving. Daniela's eyes twinkled mischievously as she teased, "Hanging around, Joyce? Not ready to make your exit? Do you fancy yourself as royalty, perhaps expecting a grand procession?"



Joyce felt the urge to walk away from Daniela's taunts,yet hesitation kept her standing still.


Cedric was still here. Leaving now could just give this woman the perfect opportunity to steal Cedric's attention. Daniela was well-versed in the art of seduction,after all.



Furthermore, Cedric had just said he had a lunch appointment with Daniela. This could also serve as an opportune moment to deepen her connections with him. She couldn't help but imagine marrying him one day.



Joyce glanced at Cedric with renewed interest. "Mr.Phillips, are you planning to head to lunch soon?Could I perhaps accompany you?"


Joyce angled her head, giving her eyelashes a flirtatious flutter, hoping to charm.


Her lips curved into a playful pout, and she implored in a sweet, coaxing tone, "Please? Can I join you for

###Chapter 36 Things Left Unsaid

Daniela shivered, a wave of goose bumps spreading across her skin.



Cedric's forehead creased, and in a sharp, icy tone,he replied,"No."


Joyce opened her mouth to argue, but before she could, Cedric's face hardened. "I have germaphobia,"he stated plainly.


Joyce stood stock-still.Her eyes immediately began to fill withtears. What was he trying to say? Was he suggesting she was dirty?


Just as Joyce was about to speak, Daniela raised her hand and pointed to the door. "Alright, time to leave.Your parents have already gone.How about you hurry up and catch up with them?"


Joyce scowled,glaring at Daniela like her eyes could scorch her.



With an angry stomp, she marched out.


As she walked away, two tears slipped down her face -tears so raw and vulnerable they would have softened the heart of any ordinary man.


But Cedric barely reacted. His frown deepened, and his attention turned back to Daniela.


Daniela looked up, locking eyes with Cedric's intense,thoughtful gaze. She smiled. "What's thematter?"


Cedric just stared at her, saying nothing. She looked as lively and glowing as she had the day they first met,but now there was something different-something that caused a faint ache in his chest.



"It's nothing, let's go," he replied.


They had lunch at an upscale restaurant. Through the whole meal, Cedric barely spoke.


His attention never strayed from Daniela.


He peeled shrimp, cracked crabs, and even cut the salmon sashimi for her.


Daniela savored the food but couldn't shake the feeling that Cedric's quietness was unusual. Something seemed to be bothering him.


After the meal, Cedric passed Daniela a plate of fruit.Smiling,she asked,"Is something bothering you today?"


Cedric handed her a slice of juicy watermelon and answered simply, "No."
Daniela nodded, choosing not to press him further.


Then, Cedric set down the damp towel, his eyes lowering for a moment.


After a brief pause, he said, "Daniela."



She turned to him, seeing the seriousness in his eyes,and hesitated.



A heavy silence hung between them.



Eventually, Daniela broke the silence. She looked away, took another bite of the watermelon, and gave a small smile. "What's going on?"



Just as Cedric opened his mouth, Daniela set her napkin down, stood up, and flashed a casual smile. "I'm full. I'll be right back," she said, heading towards the restroom.



Cedric watched her walk away, the spark in his eyes fading with each step she took.


Daniela was surprised to see Alexander waiting for her when she came out of the restroom.



She meant to walk past him without a word, but Alexander held up his hand, stopping her.


"He likes you," he said, his voice firm and certain. He was talking about Cedric.
It seemed Alexander had caught wind of something-maybe from the half-open door or the thin walls.



"If the timing had been different," he continued,"you'd know exactly what Cedric was going to say."


Daniela let out a small laugh, though her face showed a flash of irritation.



The Harper family had already stirred enough trouble,and she wasn't in the mood to deal with Alexander now.



She stopped in the hallway, standing tall in her sleek high heels, and locked eyes with Alexander.



Her voice was flat as she asked, "So what? Mr.Bennett,why does it concern you?"


Alexander's face turned serious. "It's none of my business. But I'll tell you this-Cedric has big plans.He has a reason for coming after you."



Daniela couldn't hold back another laugh at his words Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Oh really? Cedric has an agenda? And what about you? What's your plan?What makes you think you're in a position to give me advice? What part are you playing in this? Are you saying you don't have a plan?"



Without looking at him again, Daniela spun around and walked off.



Alexander stood still, his eyes cold and full of dark intent.



Fine, he thought with a bitter edge. If she couldn't see his good intentions, then she'd face the consequences when the time came. 


When Daniela stepped back into the private room,her eyes instantly found Cedric. One glance told her he had regained his usual calm demeanor.


She smiled as she approached him. "Ready to go?lf you are,let's head back."



Cedric nodded in response.



He drove Daniela home in his car, pulling up in front of her building. She thanked him before getting out of the car.


Just as she was about to walk away, Cedric called out to her.



Daniela sighed quietly to herself before turning around slowly.


By the time she did, Cedric had already gotten out of the car.



He was standing by the car, his expression more serious than usual.


"Daniela, you're smart. You must have some idea of what I want to say. I know now isn't the right moment or the right situation to say it. So for now,just think of me as an old classmate, a friend, or whatever label works for you."


He took a deep breath, his eyes steady and sincere."I just want you to know, if you ever need help-anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out to me."



After a brief pause, he continued, "And one more thing. You're a good person, Daniela. The problem isn't you-it's them. Don't be upset because of someone who doesn't deserve you."


A cold breeze swept through the street, carrying a hint of chill.


Daniela stood motionless, her long hair flowing gently in the breeze. A faint smile graced her lips-subtle,yet captivating in its charm.


It wasn't often that Cedric-the ever-composed and calculating man,renowned for his sharp strategies and icy demeanor-opened up like this. Yet here he was,speaking so openly, his words carrying genuine emotion.



"Thank you," Daniela said, her voice warm with sincerity.


"You really don't need to thank me," Cedric said almost instantly, his gaze resting on her with a hint of uncertainty. There were so many things he wanted to say,so much he wanted to do for her, but he held back, fearing he might push too far and scare her off.Finally, he just said, "If your housekeeper decides to leave, don't worry about it. I know an excellent housekeeper who's currently looking for work. I could introduce her to you tomorrow if that works for you."



Before Daniela could say anything, Cedric quickly added, "She's already searching for a job, so honestly,you'd be doing her a favor. What do you think?"



Daniela's eyes settled on the man standing opposite her.



His chiseled features and commanding presence radiated confidence and strength. But in his eyes,there was a soft hesitation, almost a fragility, as if he was bracing himself for rejection.


Daniela offered a soft, reassuring smile. "You don't need to do that." It had only been three months since her divorce, and her focus had remained firmly on her own priorities. If it had been someone else, she likely would've dismissed them without a second thought.But this was Cedric-her old classmate, the one who had always been there for her with quiet,unwavering support. How could she bring herself to hurt him?"Lillian already mentioned she has someone lined up.I'm heading upstairs now. You should head home.Drive safely,okay?"


Rejection as an adult didn't always need to be spoken.It lived in the subtle exchanges, in the silence where words didn't need to fill the space.


Daniela was certain Cedric got the message.

###Chapter 37 A Tailor-Made Housekeeper‘
Cedric braced against the biting wind, his eyes narrowing as each gust whipped across his face.


He observed Daniela gracefully advancing towards Luxor Tower,her long gown billowing at her side. The fierce wind sculpted her figure into an image of fragile elegance,isolated against the urban backdrop.


In that moment, a sharp pang of discomfort seized Cedric's heart-an acute, undeniable twinge that demanded his attention.



Pulling his phone from his pocket, he hastily dialed a number. "Ryan, it's Cedric. I need you down here."


Ryan, who had been entrenched in his efforts to overhaul the building's security system, had been deprived of sleep for several days.


Clad in his worn hoodie, he trudged downstairs,his appearance haggard under the faint lighting, his lips pale.


"What's up, Cedric?" Ryan queried,his voice weary and raspy. Cedric's eyes remained fixed on the 25th floor,illuminated by the light in Daniela's room.


Catching Cedric's concerned look, Ryan retrieved a lollipop from his pocket, unwrapping it and placing it in his mouth. "Didn't you just see her off to her room?What's the worry now?"


Cedric replied, "She's not happy."


Ryan swiveled towards him, his expression etched with confusion."Really?"


To Ryan, understanding human emotions was a puzzle with no clear solution, endlessly complex.


Pressing his lips tightly, Cedric made a request. "I have a housekeeper to look after Daniela. Help me with the arrangement."


Ryan opened his mouth to respond, but Cedric quickly added,"She's refused me."


A crease formed on Ryan's brow. "Why?"


Cedric replied, "She told me Lillian would handle it.I need you to hack into Lillian's computer and ensure the right person is chosen. I'll take care of everything else."



Cedric envisioned a future encounter with the Harper family, where the housekeeper would not merely stand there, tear-stricken and defenseless.



The mere thought stirred a wave of discomfort within him. He knew he wouldn't findpeace until the matter was settled.



With a confident nod, Ryan replied, "Understood.Don't worry, Cedric. I'll handle it to perfection."


After exchanging a few more remarks, Ryan made his way back upstairs. Meanwhile, Cedric leaned back to gaze once more at the 25th floor, catching the moment Daniela's lights dimmed.


Daniela felt no urgency to employ a housekeeper.


Over the decade dedicated to winning Alexander's heart,she had honed her self-reliance to an art form.Her domestic prowess was unmatched, maintaining her home in impeccable order.


Alexander, ever particular about his meals, had prompted Daniela to seek culinary skills from various esteemed chefs.



Eventually, Alexander found her cooking beyond reproach.Although he was sparing with his praises, he would occasionally let slip a rare word of appreciation.


Consequently, Daniela saw no immediate need to recruit additional help. She had delegated the task to Lillian but stressed that there was no need to hurry.


After all, Joyce's disruptive antics weren't going to cease any time soon. Hiring someone too soft-spoken or gentle might only lead them to be overwhelmed by bullying.


Yet, Daniela hadn't anticipated the rapid pace at which events would unfold.



The next morning, as the sunlight peeked through her curtains, Daniela's first sight was Lillian, standing beside her bed with a wide, infectious smile. "l've found you a housekeeper!"



Daniela's eyes flickered open, a fog of sleep clouding her thoughts.



That fast?



It hadn't even been...


She cast a quick glance at the clock on her bedside table.



Not even ten hours had passed.



With a smirk, Lillian added, "I hopped online early this morning to scout for a housekeeper, and guess what?The perfect candidate was just there, waiting to be found. She's exceptional-skilled in all aspects of housework. She can whip up specialty dishes from across the globe. And that's not all-she's fluent in five languages and has a knack for childcare. Should you decide to have children one day, she's fully equipped to manage it all!"



Daniela couldn't help but be impressed; the woman sounded almost too good to be true.



Beaming with enthusiasm, Lillian added, "I've already invited her over for a trial run-she's actually waiting for us downstairs."



With a mix of curiosity and intrigue, Daniela followed Lillian down the staircase.



"Hello, Ms. Harper. My name is Josie Maynard,but please,call me Josie. I'm here to look after all your household needs. Should you have any specific requests, feel free to let me know," Josie Maynard stated with a warm, welcoming smile.


Daniela gazed at Josie-a middle-aged woman,slightly rounded with a welcoming, kind air that made her seem instantly familiar.


"Have we met before?" Daniela asked.



Josie, her hands clasped before her, maintained her gentle smile. "You can't be serious! I simply possess an ordinary face. What are the chances someone like me would ever cross paths with you?"

As the words left her lips, Josie's eyes flickered towards Daniela, her smile deepening with a subtle but undeniable reverence.



Truly, Daniela was a sight to behold. A vision, almost ethereal, that could easily captivate anyone's attention, including Cedric's.



"Miss Harper, I've prepared some sandwiches for you this morning and squeezed some fresh juice. I had to make do since my arrival was rather rushed, but I plan to shop later. Please, tell me your preferences for tomorrow's meals, and I'll ensure everythingis to your liking."


Daniela wasn't usually one for breakfast, her appetite seldom stirring in the early hours, but Josie's culinary skills were irresistible.



The sandwiches looked delicious, and the juice was fresh.



Once Daniela had finished her breakfast, Josie placed a shawl around her shoulders. "The mornings carry a bit of a chill. Don't forget to look after yourself."


With her characteristic smile beaming, Josie then seized a compact shopping cart and set off to purchase groceries.  


From the doorway, Lillian observed her departure, her  expression radiant with pride.


Josie was a remarkably considerate soul, seemingly crafted perfectly to complement Daniela's needs.
###Chapter 38 A Perfect Match
As Josie headed off, Daniela felt a strange sense of recognition, like she'd seen Josie in another time or place but couldn't quite pin it down.



After Josie was out of sight, Daniela turned to Lillian with a thoughtful look. "She's really sweet, but I have this feeling things could get messy later. When she returns, let her know-if anyone from the Harper family shows up, she needs to stay out of it. I don't want her caught up in their trouble or getting hurt."



Even though Daniela had paid the former housekeeper $10, 000 to cover medical costs,the whole incident still lingered heavily on her mind.


The idea of an elderly woman being slapped by Joyce was something she just couldn't come to terms with.



The mere thought of it left Daniela feeling uneasy and weighed down by guilt.


Lillian still couldn't erase the image of the old housekeeper's face,puffed up like a balloon when she walked out. She had cursed Joyce under her breath for what she had done. After her pointless visit to Daniela, Joyce was seething with frustration.



She stormed off to Caiden, tears streaming as she vented about how badly Daniela had treated her. But Caiden brushed her off with a careless wave. "Don't waste your time on that crazy woman. So what if she's got some money now? Do you really think she can break away from her family? Let's see if she dares to get married without me, her father, escorting her down the aisle!"  



Without her family backing her up, people would surely look down on her.


Sooner or later, she'd have to swallow her pride and come running back to him for help.



Caiden's self-assurance didn't waver. Joyce sulked and turned to Katrina, silently asking for her take on the matter.



Katrina just shook her head slightly, saying nothing.


Later, when it was just the two of them, Joyce couldn't keep her frustration bottled up. "Mom, why can't I ask him to defend me? Did you see how arrogant Daniela was yesterday? I was so mad l thought I'd explode!"



Katrina, ever calm, sat on the patio and poured herself a cup of coffee. "Honey, you're grown up now. You've got to think beyond just the moment. Do you see what I mean?"



Joyce stared at Katrina, her expression a mix of confusion and curiosity.



"Let me tell you two important things today. First,remember this: in every family, the man is the anchor.If you can win over the man in charge, the whole house will fall in line. At the moment, Caiden has no influence over Daniela. If you force him to confront her now, it'll just blow up in our faces. Be patient.When the timing is right, we'll make sure their father -daughter bond is broken beyond repair."



Joyce hung on to every word, nodding intently."And what's the second thing?" she asked curiously.


"Second, no matter how far a woman climbs in her career, she'll always find her way back to her family.Take Daniela, for instance-she looks all tough and self-reliant now, but let's not forget how she used to hang on Alexander's every word."



Joyce blinked,puzzled."And what about that?"



Katrina gave a warm smile and patted Joyce on the head. "Have you decided wwhat you really want? Is it Alexander or Cedric this time?"

Joyce's cheeks flushed pink, and she ducked her head with a shy smile. "Before, it was Alexander."



Katrina's smile deepened, understanding instantly."Your ambition is admirable, and that's a great thing.Cedric is a catch-l'd love to see him as my son-in-law. But listen, don't toss Alexander aside just yet. Life is unpredictable, and you should always keep a safety net. If things go south, you'll still have choices. Do you get what I'm saying?"


Joyce's face lit up, and she nodded eagerly.


Katrina carried on, her tone calm but decisive. "And another thing-don't waste your energy fretting over those few floors in Luxor Tower. If Daniela won't hand them over,who cares? Once you have Cedric, you'll have everything you could ever need. When you were born, I had your fortune read, remember? My love,you're fated to marry into wealth. Your life is meant to be dripping in luxury."



Joyce's spirits soared at her mother's words, and she threw her arms around Katrina. "But, Mom, what am l supposed to do? Cedric barely notices me."


Katrina smiled indulgently, tucking a stray strand of hair behind Joyce's ear. "I've kept your father under my thumb for years. All you need is the right move,and I guarantee Cedric won't be able to say no."


Katrina leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper as she shared a few secretive words.


Joyce's eyes went wide with surprise, and her cheeks turned a deep shade of pink.



Once her chat with Joyce was done, Katrina wandered into the living room and lounged against Caiden's chest.


"Caiden, I was just having a chat with Joyce. I told her that if Daniela doesn't want to hand over those floors,it's okay. At the end of the day, we're family,and it's not worth upsetting the peace over something so small."



Caiden,his eyes glued to the financial news on the TV,absentmindedly ran his hand over Katrina's cheek."You're the reasonable one. Not like that worthless brat,Daniela."



Katrina's lips curved into a smug smile, hidden from Caiden's view. Resting her hand lightly on his chest,she spoke in a soft, affectionate voice. "Joyce is a grown woman now. Don't you think it's about time we found her a suitable match? If she marries soon, she could start growing our family right away."


Caiden looked down at Katrina when he heard this.



She tilted her head a bit, her eyes shining with love and care.

Swayed by her gentle words and devoted look, Caiden pulled her closer into his embrace.



Katrina's lips curled into a slow, victorious smile.Winning over men came as naturally to her as breathing.


As Caiden leaned in, Katrina's voice broke the moment. "Cedric would be a perfect match for Joyce."


Caiden stopped in his tracks, his lips barely a breath away from hers. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 39 Rather Daniela Than Joyce
As soon as Katrina spoke Cedric's name, a chill ran down Caiden's spine, his body stiffening instinctively.


The familiar wave of dread and pressure flooded him,quickly sweeping away any thoughts or desires he'd felt just moments ago.


"Who did you just say?" Caiden's voice was full of disbelief as he stared at Katrina.



Katrina frowned, her confusion clear. "Cedric," she said again.


Caiden stared at her as if she had lost her mind."Cedric? You want him as your son-in-law? Are you kidding? Do you even know who he is?"


"What do you mean?" Katrina asked, still bewildered."Isn't he the CEO of Phillips Group? The golden bachelor, one of the brightest new stars in the business world?"



She gestured towards the TV, where Cedric's face appeared on the financial news. "See, even the news says it-he's a standout among his peers. Handsome,decisive, a real up-and-comer."

Caiden closed his eyes for a moment, trying to steady himself. "Yes, all of that's true."


Katrina smiled, her gaze expectant as she waited for his response.



"But did you know he's only 25?" Caiden asked.


Katrina blinked, her confusion deepening. "What's wrong with being 25?"



"What's wrong? He's 25 and already a powerhouse.His personal fortune is worth tens of millions. Tell me,how many 25-year-olds in this country have done that? Most of his peers, the kids from rich families, are still wasting their parents' money, racing cars, partying,and living aimlessly!"



"Exactly," Katrina exclaimed,gaining more confidence."It just proves how driven and capable he is."


Caiden slapped his forehead in frustration. "Yes, he's driven and skilled. But do you really think that's enough to make it in the ruthless business world?Cedric has no family to back him up or safety net to fall on. Everything he has, he fought hard for, enduring endless challenges. The business world is full of predators, yet he's not just surviving-he's thriving. Do you think he's someone who lets emotions affect his decisions? Joyce is sweet, but so incredibly naive. Her greatest pleasure is competing with Daniela over trivial nonsense. Do you think someone like that is cut out to be Cedric's wife? Just look at how cold he was to her yesterday. Cedric doesn't waste his time on people who lack substance or intelligence."


Katrina was stunned by Caiden's words. "What are you suggesting then? Are you saying Joyce is stupid?"


Not only did Caiden think Joyce was lacking, but he didn't think much of Katrina either.



His first wife, Daniela's mother, had been too sharp,too calculating, and it had made him feel trapped.After her death, he had intentionally chosen someone like Katrina-a woman who knew how to flatter him and lean on him completely.


His difficult relationship with Daniela? That was because she was just like her mother-too intelligent for her own good.


And now, he believed he had been right all along.


Daniela's success now was proof of how smart she truly was.



"Joyce doesn't have a chance with Cedric. Even when it comes to looks, she's no competition for Daniela.If we're truly thinking of pairing one of our daughters with Cedric, Daniela would be the better choice."



Daniela at least had the intelligence to match Cedric's ambitions.



Caiden's words were blunt, but they struck Katrina like a lightning bolt. So this was his true opinion of her and her daughter.



Katrina walked out of the room, feeling stunned and her thoughts racing. When she stepped outside,she saw Joyce standing there, tears running down her cheeks.She had heard everything.


"Sweetheart, don't cry. If your father won't help, we'll fight for our own happiness. We don't need anyone else. But don't forget about Alexander. He even left Daniela for you. He might be a good backup if things don't work out with Cedric."


Joyce,hearing this, only felt more frustrated."Really?But it seems like the Bennett family isn't as interested in me anymore. The last fewN times I saw Richard, he was distant and cold. It felt like he didn't want me to be his future daughter-in-law anymore."


Her hands tightened into fists, and her eyes burned with anger. "This is all Daniela's fault. If it weren't for her,I'd be the one Alexander is crazy about. Cedric would pay attention to me too. It's all because of that horrible woman!"

###Chapter 40 Get Your Sister Out
Joyce stepped out, and Caiden caught a glimpse of her swollen, red eyes, though he didn't utter a single word.


As soon as the door clicked shut, he whipped around to face Katrina, a frown twisting his face.


"Just look at her! She's got her emotions all over her face for everyone to see. How is she even supposed to deal with someone like Cedric? He's arrogant,cold,and ruthless. He needs someone sharp, someone who can match him. Not Joyce-she's too simple-minded.You're her mother. You should know her better than anyone. Tell her to let go of this ridiculous idea before she embarrasses herself."



Katrina felt a spark of anger flare inside her, but all she could do was let out a soft whimper in reply.


Joyce hadn't walked far. She stood still, hearing every word Caiden had said. Her face hardened with fury,and her resentment for Daniela grew even stronger.







Daniela was about to sign a contract when her phone buzzed,pulling her attention away.



"Miss Harper, there's been some trouble at the concert hall. A group of disruptive people came in,bought tickets, but didn't even bother to watch the show. Instead, they caused a scene, shouting and disturbing everyone. We were about to call the authorities, but the leader said she was your sister.We didn't want to stir things up, so we let them go."


Daniela froze, her pen hovering mid-air above the contract. "Was there any damage to the hall?"


The manager hesitated, clearly unsure how to approach it.





"Send me a list of what's broken, and I'll take care of it," Daniela added.






A few minutes later, her phone buzzed with a message detailing the damages.





It was a long list: fifty broken chairs, three damaged cellos, two ruined microphones, and six shredded music scores.


Daniela skimmed the list, only to receive another message from the hall manager. "Miss Harper, I hate to trouble you, but I checked the reservations for tonight.The same group has booked seats again. They say they're your family, and I'm not sure how to handle it." The hall manager was no rookie when it came to dealing with trouble. With his connections on both sides of the law, a rowdy crowd wouldn't usually faze him. But since they were supposedly linked to Daniela,he'd held off on taking action.



"Refund their tickets," Daniela instructed. "Close the hall for tonight. I'll take care of this myself."


"Got it," the manager replied without hesitation.



With Elite Lux freshly relocated back to the country,Daniela had been swamped with work. She'd planned to take care of the concert hall situation in a few days.


That evening, however, Daniela received another call,this time from the auction house.



"Miss Harper, Joyce Holt attended the auction today,and she made outrageous bids on almost everything.But when it came time to pay, she refused. We were on the verge of calling the police, but she claimed to be your sister. We're unsure how to proceed. What do you want us to do?"



Daniela's brow furrowed as frustration took over.Without a second thought, she replied, "Call the police."


That evening, Daniela had just gotten home and was on her way upstairs to relax when loud, angry knocking on the door broke the silence.


Josie moved towards the door to open it.


Before she had a chance to even speak, Katrina barged in, her hand held high as she charged past Josie.



"Daniela! How could you be so cruel and heartless? Is it really necessary to ruin Joyce's life like this?"


Daniela, worried her new housekeeper might get dragged into the chaos, shot Josie a quick glance,silently urging her to stay behind her. It was only then that she finally turned her attention to the uninvited visitors.



Katrina was at the front,with Caiden right behind her,and Alexander lingering at the back.


Before steppinng into the room, Caiden scanned the space, only relaxing once he was sure Daniela was alone.


He straightened up, adopting a forced air of authority."Daniela, how long do you plan to drag this out?"



Daniela's face remained impassive as her eyes scanned the group. A small, bitter laugh escaped her lips, laced with sarcasm. "So, you storm into my house,stand here in my space, and then question me about how long I'm going to keep this up? Don't you think that's a bit much?"


Katrina broke down into tears, wailing with exaggerated sorrow. "Daniela, the police called us.They said it was your people who reported Joyce.That's your sister! How could you be so heartless?"


Through her sobs, Katrina turned to Alexander."Alexander, do you see it now? Do you see how cruel Daniela is? Thank God you divorced her! Can you imagine the kind of chaos she would've caused your family if you'd stayed with her?"


Daniela spoke in a steady, measured tone, her face showing no emotion. "She showed up at the auction,placed bids on just about everything, and then refused to pay for any of it. She's the one who caused this whole situation. So tell me, how is that my problem?"


"This is your domain! So what if your sister wanted to get a few things? Isn't it just natural for sisters to share every now and then? You're being ridiculous,Daniela!Calling the cops on your own sister? Do you have any shame at all?" Katrina shot back, her voice growing louder with anger.



Daniela let out a mocking laugh. "Share a few things?Joyce didn't bid on just a few items. She went for over 20 high-end pieces. The total was $230 million.If that's what she expects from me, I simply can't do it.But since you're so willing to help, why don't you cover it? As her mother, isn't it your job to take care of her?"



Her words, a quick comeback that mirrored Katrina's,left her completely at a loss for words.


Katrina stiffened, her face flushing as she searched for something to say.


Caiden's frown deepened further. He wasn't interested in the back-and-forth or the details of who was right.


He interrupted the tension in a sharp,commanding voice. "Daniela, it's late. Enough of this! Call the police and get your sister out."


Daniela responded flatly, "I won't."


Caiden's eyes went wide with shock. "What did you say? You ungrateful little brat!"


His anger flared up, and, like usual when he couldn't win an argument, his hand shot up, poised to hit her.


Daniela had dealt with this enough times. She instinctively stepped back, bracing herself to dodge the blow.



But just before his hand could land, another hand reached out from behind her, gripping Caiden's wrist with a vice-like hold.

"Ah!" Caiden screamed, his face twisting in agony as a sharp, burning pain shot up his wrist. "Let go! Let go!Let me go!" 
###Chapter 41 A Gold Digger





Daniela was taken aback. The new housekeeper,Josie, had an unexpectedly firm hold.


In a single fluid motion, Josie yanked Daniela behind her. She placed one hand on her hip and pointed at Caiden with the other. "You call yourself a father?How can you be so unreasonable? Joyce is your daughter, but Daniela isn't? Where's your sense of logic? Joyce misbehaved, so why are you taking it out on Daniela? Look at you, always trying to play the peacemaker but doing it in the worst way possible. Is this what being a father is all about? No wonder kids are so ungrateful these days. After all, it's parents like you who create them!"



As soon as Josie began speaking, Caiden stepped back, his fists clenched tightly.


Katrina moved forward, but Josie shot her a sharp,accusing look. "And you must be the stepmother, right? You brought Joyce into the Harper family,didn't you?"


Katrina stood frozen, her gaze fixed in disbelief on Josie's pointing finger. Still in a daze, she nodded, as though she were swept away by the force of Josie's words.


"So you're actually agreeing with me? Let me set the record straight. This is the true daughter of the Harper family. And yet, you've moved into her home and act like you own the place? Who do you think you are? The Harper family fortune isn't just Caiden's to claim. It was his first wife who single-handedly kept their business thriving. Everyone knows that.Now that Daniela's mother is gone, you're here to cash in? Do you have no shame? And as if reaping the rewards wasn't enough, you have the gall to push your luck?"



Katrina had been married to Caiden for years, and in all those years, no one had ever spoken to her like that. Today, being confronted so boldly left her completely stunned and without words. 
For what felt like an eternity, she simply stood there,staring at Josie, whose imposing figure stood guard in front of Daniela.


"You're bullying Daniela like this. Aren't you scared her mother will come back to haunt you in your dreams?" Josie's voice dropped to a chilling tone as her wide eyes gleamed with a dangerous light.


Just hearing Daniela's mother's name, whose tragic death still lingered in Katrina's memory, made a cold shiver run down her back.



Without sparing them another look, Josie stormed over to the door and threw it wide open. "Out! If you don't leave immediately, I'll call the cops. Let's see how you handle the humiliation!"


Grabbing a broom, she began pushing them towards the door. By the time Lillian stepped off the elevator,she was met with the sight of Katrina's face,streaked with tears.


Alexander hesitated for a moment, and just as the door was closing, he turned back to face Daniela. "Daniela, now that you've got the upper hand,it's time to show some forgiveness. You've gone too far today." 


Daniela let out a bitter laugh. "Really? Now that things have flipped, you're all about mercy? Where was your mercy when I was in the hospital with a broken rib, wrongly accused by everyone? Back then,not a single person stood up for me."


Alexander's brow furrowed. "That's all behind us now." 


Daniela nodded in agreement. "Exactly, it's all in the past. And tonight will be just another part of that.What's the matter? Can't handle it wvhen it's turned on you? Mr. Bennett, stop being such a hypocrite."


With that, she slammed the door shut, the sound echoing through the hallway.


The three of them standing outside flinched as one,their eyes wide with disbelief as they stared at the closed door. After being thrown out of Daniela's home, Caiden had no option but to settle the bill for the auctioned items.


Tens of millions vanished in the blink of an eye.


On the drive back, Caiden's face was clouded with anger.


In the car, Joyce cried uncontrollably, her voice thick with emotion. "It's all Daniela's fault! She actually had the police called on me! Mom, you have no idea how scary it was in there. I was locked in that room all by myself. My legs won't stop shaking, and my hands are still ice cold!"


Katrina's heart shattered for her daughter.


When they arrived home, Katrina comforted Joyce and helped her to her room. Once Joyce was settled,Katrina crawled into bed, burying her face in the covers as she cried.


Caiden, on the other hand, was seething with frustration.


Daniela's mother had been a sharp businesswoman,amassing a fortune that she left behind. But now that she was gone, all that was left was her inheritance.


Caiden, on the other hand, had never been good with money-he'd lost a lot in failed investments early on and was barely managing to keep things going. If they kept spending like they were, what would they have left to live on down the road?



Dropping tens of millions today felt like a sharp blow to his chest.


In frustration, he snapped at Katrina, "Tell Joyce to stop provoking Daniela!"


Katrina stiffened, taken aback by the harshness in his voice. A moment later, she curled up tighter in the bed, burying her face in the sheets as her sobs grew louder.


"It's all my fault! Everyone always says being a stepmother is tough, and now I truly understand just how hard it is. When I married you,I promised myself I'd treat Daniela like my own daughter. I even swore l wouldn't have kids of my own just to make her happy.And now, look at me! I'm getting older, I can't have children anymore, and Daniela still treats me like I'm nothing. Did you hear what her staff said today?She called Daniela the true daughter of the Harper family and accused me of being a gold digger! What have I done to deserve this? I loved you, trusted you, and chose to marry you. I don't care about the pain l've gone through, but now my daughter, Joyce, has to suffer too. People are judging her because of me!Maybe I should just disappear!"


Caiden's heart softened the moment he heard her words. He pulled Katrina into an embrace and kissed her gently as he soothed her.


"I can't let our daughter go through this. Get Daniela to give those floors of the Luxor Tower to you. How could I ever face Joyce otherwise?" Katrina wiped her eyes, then moved closer, leaning against his chest, which lit a spark in Caiden.

He kissed her passionately, completely caught up in the intensity of the moment. "Okay, I'lI handle it.".


It was only then that Katrina used her charm, making sure Caiden was completely satisfied.


###Chapter 42 Why Did You Divorce Daniela For Joyce
Caiden rested against the headboard, a wave of regret washing over him.


He couldn't understand how Daniela had become so strong-willed and unbending.


More and more, her personality reminded him of her late mother.

Every time he laid eyes on Daniela, it felt like he was face-to-face with her mother.

The sweet, gentle girl who once followed Alexander around was nowhere to be found now.


He was aware that Katrina wouldn't let it go unless Daniela gave him the three floors of the Luxor Tower.


Caiden lit a cigarette, stepped out onto the balcony,and dialed Alexander's number.  "Hey, Alexander. Are you free tomorrow?"


Alexander, still at work, responded, "What's up?"


"There's a charity gala tomorrow night. Do you have time to attend? I'd like you to take Joyce along to help her expand her horizons."


There was a brief pause on the other end of the line before Alexander answered, "Sure."②


Just as Alexander was about to hang up, Caiden added, "You and Daniela were married. I noticed her name on the guest list for tomorrow night. Joyce is being stubborn about those floors in Luxor Tower.You remember how Daniela used to listen to you,right? Maybe you could talk to her."


Alexander paused, his grip tightening on the phone."She doesn't listen to me anymore."


Caiden chuckled softly. "She used to listen to you,didn't she? I know things were a bit rocky between you two, but let's be real-you're planning on marrying Joyce, right? That makes me your future father-in-law. We're practically family now, so how about doing me this small favor? It won't take much,just a few words, really. I'm counting on you here."


Before Alexander could get a word in, Caiden hung up the phone.


Richard, sitting in Alexander's office, sneered. "That old fox is too clever for his own good."


Alexander recalled Daniela's cold, indifferent expression from the night before. "She won't agree,"he muttered to Richard.


Richard waved it off. "Let Caiden handle it. Don't offend Daniela because of Katrina. By the way, have you heard? Daniela just got her hands on that biggest piece of land in the North District-the one nobody else dared to go after."


Alexander looked up, his eyes wide with surprise.


Richard gave a thumbs-up. "I'll give her credit. That land is a goldmine, but the seller wats full payment upfront. Everyone was eyeing it, but no one had the nerve or resources to take it on. And Daniela just swooped in and grabbed it like it was nothing.Alexander, our family's in the renovation and construction business. You're going to the gala tomorrow, right? Make sure you land the renovation contract for that property. First, it'll help rebuild a connection with Daniela. Second, it's a huge project that could bring in a fortune for us. And third, it'll relieve some of the pressure on our company next year."



Alexander was reluctant. The idea of trying to win Daniela over for money didn't sit right with him.He had tried to talk to her a few times lately,but each time, she ignored him completely.


He was proud, and begging was never on his list of things to do.


Just last night, he had tried to offer her some advice,only for her to snap at him and shut him out entirely.


Where was the Daniela who once cared for him?


Even if she was playing hard to get, this was crossing  the line.



But with his father pushing him, he figured he'd give her one last chance.



With a cold look, Alexander responded to Richard,"Fine."







The next day, Alexander stepped out in a sharp new suit that looked like it was made just for him.



When Joyce arrived, her eyes widened, and she couldn't hold back a gasp. "Wow! Alexander, you look absolutely stunning today!"


The tailored suit made a real impact. Her eyes were drawn to his broad chest, and admiration lit up her face.


In that moment, she couldn't help but think that Alexander was everything she could ever want.


As for Cedric? She decided he could stay with Daniela, that cold, toxic woman. Joyce rode with Alexander to the gala. On the way there, she leaned in and spoke softly. "Alexander,thank you for bringing me tonight. I know it's tough for you. Daniela is such a difficuIt person. To thank you for your kindness, I'm willing to marry..."


Her words trailed off suddenly as the car came to a stop at the entrance of the gala.


Her gaze landed on a man standing near the door,and her breath caught in her throat.



He was a real catch!



Her eyes lit up, practically glowing with excitement.


Cedric looked nothing like the man she remembered.


Tonight, he was a vision of sophistication in a custom-tailored dark blue suit, with a refined sapphire brooch pinned to his chest and matching gemstone cufflinks gleaming at his wrists. The entire outfit seemed made just for him, enhancing his already tall, striking figure and radiating an air of elegance and class that made him look even more impressive.


Callum was always handsome. 


Incredibly handsome.


Unlike most men, he had a royal quality about him-a natural, commanding presence that made him stand out effortlessly. Every mnove he made seemed to capture attention, as if he were the center of everything.


Whatever Joyce had planned to say to Alexander was quickly forgotten. Without saying another word, she swung open the car door, grabbed her dress,and nearly ran towards Cedric.


The driver, observing everything unfold, couldn't help but glance at Alexander and mnutter, "Sir,honestly, Joyce isn't worth you giving up Daniela for."


At least Daniela wouldn't fall for another the moment a better option came along.


She wouldn't fawn over other men. It was painfully clear what had just happened. Only moments earlier, Joyce had been hinting that she wanted to marry Alexander. But the second she saw Cedric, she completely forgot the idea and rushed towards him.



Her shallow, opportunistic nature mirrored Katrina's all too well.


Like mother, like daughter.


Alexander's voice was steady, almost indifferent."I never liked Joyce."


The driver, surprised by his response, turned to him in disbelief and asked, "Then why did you divorce Daniela for her?"

###Chapter 43 Daniela Ignored Him




"So, why'd you divorce Daniela for Joyce?" Keith,who was also at the gala, couldn't help but ask Alexander the same burning question.


Alexander's face remained icy as he scanned the room, his eyes briefly glancing over the elegant women chatting and laughing. iN a calm but distant  tone, he said, "I never meant to divorce her." 


"What?" Keith turned to face him, clearly stunned.


"It was her choice," Alexander explained. "She sent me the divorce agreement. She pushed to have everything finalized. From beginning to end, I never once brought up the idea of getting a divorce.But since that's what she wanted, I just gave her what she asked for." 


Keith stood there, stunned into silence for a moment before finally blurting out, "Wait! So you're saying you were the one who got dumped?"
The words caused Alexander's face to darken further.


Keith pressed on, "Honestly, with your temper,I'm not surprised she couldn't take it anymore."


Alexander let out a bitter snort.


He had always been this way when Daniela first met him. If she couldn't handle him now, it just meant she didn't love him enough.



The issue wasn't with him-it was Daniela. She needed to look at herself and figure out what went wrong. 


Keith seemed ready to speak again, but suddenly a commotion erupted near the entrance, capturing everyone's attention.


Alexander raised his gaze, but the crowd near the door was too thick for him to see anything.


Instead, all he could hear were excited voices echoing through the room.
"Wow! She's breathtaking!"



"Is that another limited-edition Elite Lux gown? It's absolutely stunning!"


"Daniela sure knows how to make an entrance-every time, it's something different."


"With a body like hers, who wouldn't look incredible?"


"She's got all the right curves-perfect waist, long legs! The guy who dates her is the luckiest man on earth."



"Seriously, is Alexander blind? He chose Joyce over Daniela? That's just funny!"



Alexander's expression darkened even more. In a quiet, almost bitter tone, he muttered, "How amazing could she really/be? Elite Lux couture is just..."


Before he could finish his sentence, the crowd parted, and Daniela appeared at the entrance.


Alexander's eyes went wide in disbelief.

Was that Daniela? It was the same face, but something was unmistakably different.


She was draped in an elegant, flowing gown of deep blue that clung to her curves perfectly. One shoulder was exposed, her flawless skin glowing under the soft lighting. Standing tall in dazzling crystal heels,she radiated an undeniable confidence, embodying the very essence of the evening's queen.


Daniela had always been stunning, but tonight, she was absolutely mesmerizing. Her eyes, naturally entrancing, carried a hint of allure. When she smiled,the dimples at the corners of her mouth deepened,making her all the more enchanting.


For a brief moment, it felt like the room dimmed. All the noise and color seemed to fade away,leaving only Daniela, who dominated the spotlight.


She glowed with elegance, her pearl earrings swaying delicately as she moved through the crowd with effortless grace.


Alexander's gaze followed her every step as she made her way towards him.


Keith, full of excitement, nudged Alexander's elbow and whispered with enthusiasm, "Here she comes!See? I told you she still has feelings for you.Alexander, your charm is unmatched."


Alexander kept his expression unreadable, but inside,his heart was racing in a way he hadn't felt in years.


He had already thought it over. If Daniela showed even a hint of remorse, he'd consider forgiving her.


But then, Daniela spoke. "Lillian."


That one word shattered all the hope Alexander had been clinging to.


Keith froze, momentarily taken aback, before glancing at Alexander. His face had darkened so intensely that it seemed like a storm was on the verge of erupting.


Keith couldn't hold back his laughter. "Alexander,don't tell me you thought she was coming over here for you? This is too funny!"

Keith was practically shaking with amusement. 


Alexander, who was usually so composed and confident, was now being completely disregarded by the same woman who once chased after him.



When Daniela had been obsessed with him,constantly accommodating his every whim, people mocked her for being desperate, but secretly, many envied Alexander.



He had soaked in that admiration, his confidence reaching new heights.


Now, watching him so blatantly ignored, Keith felt a sense of smug satisfaction.


Alexander, however, paid no attention to Keith's laughter. He relaxed in his chair, grabbed his phone,and started scrolling, his face blank and hard to read.


The night went on, but Daniela never once glanced in his direction, let alone made an effort to approach him. Alexander, on his part, wasn't about to go to her either.
As the gala neared its end, his pent-up anger was at a breaking point.


But with no way to release it, he simply sat there in silence until the event finally came to an end.
###Chapter 44 How Rude




Joyce couldn't keep her frustration in check any longer.


The gala was almost over, and Alexander still hadn't made a move to talk to Daniela.


Although she didn't care much for Daniela, she was very interested in the building Daniela owned.


She sat next to Alexander, her voice filled with jealousy. "Alexander, look at Daniela acting so superior, just because she has money. She's strutting around like she's the queen of the world with all those men around her."


Joyce meant to mock Daniela, but her words sounded incredibly bitter instead.


Even Keith, who was nearby, couldn't hold back a laugh. "If you had the talent, you could act just as confident."
Joyce pouted, her face flushed with anger, but the truth of his words left her momentarily speechless.Swallowing her irritation, she silently directed all the blame at Daniela for the embarrassment she felt.


Ignoring Keith, she turned to Alexander and pleaded,"When are you going to talk to Daniela? My boutique's been shut down for weeks now. The stock's going bad in storage! I'm losing a fortune.I need that prime spot to open up again."


Keith stared at Joyce in disbelief. "Are you serious?You've got the audacity to ask her for that? Forget everything else for a moment-didn't you already ruin Daniela andAlexander's wedding? And now, you're asking her for a shop space? I never realized you could be this shameless."
Joyce's face turned bright red with fury. She put her hands on her hips and shot back, "What's it to you?Get out of here!" Her voice was cutting, and she glared at Keith like she could tear him apart.


Keith rolled his eyes and stood up, shaking his head in disbelief. Before walking away, he leaned down close to Alexander and muttered, "Alexander,your taste in women is awful. You gave up Daniela for this?You've really made a huge mistake."


With that, he turned and walked off, leaving Alexander sitting there, his expression dark and full of frustration.


"Alexander," Joyce said, her voice softening as she put on a pleading look. "I know Daniela can't stand me, but I really need this space. Can you talk to her?She always listens to you. If you ask, she'll definitely say yes.Please!"


Alexander's eyes drifted to Daniela, standing off to the side, surrounded by admirers. After a long moment of hesitation, he said coldly, "Fine."


Just as the gala was wrapping up and Daniela was about to leave, a voice suddenly called out to her.


She turned around to see Alexander and Joyce approaching her.


Alexander wore a serious look, while Joyce walked with her head held high. To anyone watching, it would almost look like Daniela owed them everything.


Without a word, Alexander led Joyce forward.


Daniela stayed calm, saying nothing as she locked her eyes on them.


For some reason, the cold indifference in her expression sparked an immediate irritation in Alexander.


There was a time when Daniela had followed him around, hanging on every word, always eager to please. But now, the roles had reversed, and she couldn't even be bothered to mask her impatience with him.


Joyce, unable to stay quiet any longer, spoke up."Daniela, Alexander wants to talk to you."

Daniela stood tall with an air of grace. Even with her aloof exp ression, her beauty was impossible to ignore. She raised her hand, signaling him. "Go ahead."


Alexander's face grew even more tense.


This was the new Daniela-distant and unreachable.Her attitude was beginning to wear on him.


If she was going to act like this, he wasn't about to make things easier for her.


He definitely wasn't going to put himself out to help her with the city redevelopment project his father had spoken about.


No construction company in Olisvine could rival the Bennett family's level of expertise.


Without their involvement, the land Daniela had recently acquired would remain unused.


These thoughts only added to his irritation, and his voice became more pointed. "I need to talk to you.You choose the location."


Daniela almost burst out laughing at his words.


Was this really how he approached someone for a conversation?


Without sayinga thing, she turned and walked away,leaving Alexander and Joyce standing there,completely stunned.


"You..." Joyce couldn't hold back her frustration as Daniela's car pulled away, the exhaust fumes sweeping over them. Turning to Alexander, she demanded, "Alexander, did I just see that right? Did 1hear you correctly? You literally told Daniela you wanted to talk, and that's how she responded? She just walked away without even looking back. How could she be so rude?"
###Chapter 45 ldiot




The initial shock on Alexander's face quickly morphed into a simmering rage as he pulled himself together.

His hands curled into tight fists, and he made a vow to himself.


From now on, for the rest of his life, he would act as though Daniela didn't exist. 


Joyce was just as dumbfounded by Daniela's blatant brush-off. When they got back home, Katrina was there, standing impatiently by the door.


"So? What happened? Did Daniela agree? How many floors did she hand over?" Katrina asked, her voice brimming with anticipation.


Joyce let out an irritated sigh, shaking her head.She launched into a detailed recounting of the gala, every humiliating moment and cold dismissal included.
Katrina's face twisted in shock as she listened."What? That's her way of handling men? What an absurd strategy! I've never heard of anything so ridiculous. But based on what you're saying, it sounds like her little scheme blew up in her face.She's completely destroyed her chances with Alexander now."


Her lips curled into a smug smile as a satisfied laugh escaped her.


"Perfect. That's exactly what we need."


If the Bennett family was still aiming for a marriage alliance,Joyce would be their one and only option.


But unlike Katrina, Joyce wasn't one to scheme with such precision. After catching wind of Daniela's business meeting scheduled for later that afternoon,she thought she'd take matters into her own hands.She made plans to meet Alexander earlier, setting up what she hoped would look like an "accidental" run-in with Daniela in the lobby.


The moment Alexander caught sight of Daniela in the Joyce gave Daniela a cheerful wave, but Daniela didn't even blink in response. Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly amazed. "Unbelievable! After everything that happened yesterday, they still have the audacity to wave at you?"


Daniela's lips tightened, clearly annoyed. "What's a little pride when she wants a shop space from me?"


After all, she was all too familiar with Joyce's true nature.


Daniela paused mid-step, her sharp eyes locking onto Joyce, who was making her way over with Alexander following close behind.


Standing nearby, Lillian couldn't resist the opportunity to throw in a quick jab. "Well, well, Mr.Bennett,Ms. Holt, have you finally decided to hold a proper discussion? Or should we just cancel these meetings altogether if civility is too much to ask?"


Joyce's expression stiffened for a moment, but she plastered on a forced laugh, unwilling to let her irritation ruin her chances at the shop space.


She vowed that once she got the shop space, she would not be polite to Daniela anymore.


"Absolutely! Let's find a spot to sit and chat. My treat," Joyce said through clenched teeth. Inside,frustration churned like a storm, her forced smile stretched so thin it felt more like a grimace than genuine cheer.


Lillian couIdn't hide her amusement at Joyce's clear discomfort. "Daniela, why don't we take a seat for a bit?" she suggested, her tone dripping with playful mischief.


Daniela, ever tolerant of her friends' antics, noticed Lillian's teasing mood and gave her a slight nod."Sure," she agreed.


Joyce stretched her smile even widder, though it felt like her face might crack, and gestured for Daniela and Lillian to follow her to a table.
Once they were seated, Daniela didn't even glance at Alexander or Joyce. Instead, she pulled a contract from her bag and began skimming through it, as though they weren't even there.


Joyce's lips twitched in a barely concealed sneer.What a performance. Who was she trying to impress with that contract? As if she was drowning in work or something.


Alexander's eyes flicked towards Daniela, quickly scanning the bold title of the document in her hands:Clayton Renovation.


For a moment, his expression tightened before easing again. Clayton Renovation-so that was it.A competitor to Bennett Group, sure, but still far away from their level of expertise and legacy in the industry.


If Daniela had even a shred of common sense, she'd know the smart move was to hire Bennett Group for her project. The thought sent a wave of smug satisfaction through him.
"Go ahead, speak up," Lillian said, leaning forward with her chin resting on one hand, her playful gaze bouncing between Joyce and Alexander. "Hey, eyes this way! Why are you staring at Daniela? She's not in charge here. I'm the one running the show now."


Joyce paused, her eyes flicking back to Daniela.


Daniela's attention was fixed on the contract in her hands, her gaze lowered slightly. A ray of sunlight streamed through the window, gently illuminating her, making her already stunning looks seem even more glowing and graceful.


Joyce inhaled sharply, her chest tightening with a bitter sting.


Without looking up, Daniela spoke in a detached tone. "The decisions are Lillian's responsibility."


Joyce's eyes brightened. "Ah, I get it! Okay, I'll talk to Lillian about it then."


Lillian's expression tightened. She tapped her nails against the table with a smirk. "Is that really how you speak? Didn't anyone teach you some manners?"


Joyce's brow furrowed. "What's that supposed to mean?" Her voice was thick with annoyance.


"You came here for a favor, right? Then act like it.Show some respect. Look at this-my water glass is empty.How do you expect to have a conversation without a drink?"


Joyce stood to pour the water, but Lillian cut her off."Hold on. Are we really going to talk business over just plain water?"



Lillian raised her hand and gestured for the restaurant manager. "You remember that red wine we discussed earlier? The one worth ten million? Go ahead and open it and add it to their bill."


"What?" Joyce gasped, her eyes going wide."Ten million?" With that kind of money, she could buy a whole collection of designer handbags.


"What? Got a problem with that?" Lillian teased, her smile sly. Joyce's face flushed deep red.


"can't you afford it? That can't be right, can it? aren't you the precious daughter of the Harper family?Surely ten million is nothing for someone like you.Or maybe being 'precious' doesn't mean much after all."


It finally clicked for Joyce-Lillian was intentionally humiliating her.


The worst part was Joyce genuinely couldn't afford it. The Harper family wasn't wealthy enough to throw money around so recklessly.


Feeling powerless, she turned to Lillian, arms crossed and eyes cold, then glanced at Alexander.Her voice dropped to a soft, pleading tone."Alexander."


Alexander gave a short nod towards the manager."Go ahead."


The manager's eyes gleamed, and he hurried off to bring the wine.


Lillian clapped her hands, nodding with exaggerated 
glee. "Ah, just as I expected from Mr. Bennett. Ten million spent for the sake of love-how heartwarming!"


Alexander's expression grew even more grim.


But Joyce couldn't stop the rush of sweetness that filled her chest.


Alexander had done so much for her today, more than she could have ever imagined. She decided that if Cedric didn't treat her better, she would choose Alexander. 


A smug smile slowly spread across Joyce's face as she thought about it.


Meanwhile, Lillian couldn't help but let out a faint,mocking smile.She couldn't believe how naive Joyce was being.

###Chapter 46 Are You Making Fun Of Me
The wine was served.


Joyce extended her hand to pour Lillian some wine,but Lillian quickly covered her glass, stopping her.Joyce stared at her in confusion.


"Since you're the host, you should be drinking,"Lillian said, stretching out the sentence as she glanced at Alexander. "Or maybe Mr. Bennett will handle this for you?"


Alexander was about to reply, but Lillian interrupted with a laugh.


"This is between women. If a man steps in, things could get tricky. My family has enough people who can handle their drinks. Should I bring a few over?"


Alexander froze, his hand pausing in mid-air. The wine was on the table, and the money was already spent.


Joyce gritted her teeth, clearly irritated, but then lowered her head and downed three glasses in quick succession. "There! Happy now? Can we get to the business?"


Lillian watched her, a smirk spreading across her face. She was still seething over the fire video-just the thought of it made her blood boil.


Did Joyce actually think three glasses would fix everything? No way!


"Alright, we'll discuss business, but only when I feel like it," Lillian replied, her grin growing. "Go ahead and continue drinking."


Joyce had been protected her whole life. Her mother never let her drink, and even in situations where pushy elders insisted, it was always Daniela who stepped in to drink for her.


Now, after only three glasses, Joyce's vision was starting to blur. Her head was spinning, and her temper flared with every ounce of discomfort.Slamming her hand on the table, she snapped, "Are you making fun of me?"


Lillian crossed her arms and laughed. "Yes,I am.What are you going to do about it?"


Joyce's face turned bright red with a mix of rage and embarrassment. She tried to get up from her seat,but the alcohol had already taken control. Her legs buckled, and she stumbled back, collapsing heavily into her chair and leaning against the table for support.


Lillian scoffed dismissively before turning her attention to Alexander, subtly tilting her chin in his direction. "Mr. Bennett, it's your turn."


As she reached for her glass to pour herself wine,Daniela, still focused on the contract in her hands,extended her arm and covered Lillian's glass. "You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach."


Though her words were soft, the meaning was clear 
Lillian had a sensitive stomach when it came to alcohol. Daniela knew Lillian was teaching Joyce a lesson and wasn't actually planning to drink, so she'd allowed her to enjoy herself a bit.


However, seeing that Lillian was beginning to overdo it, Daniela decided it was time to step in.


There was no reason for her to let Lillian hurt herself for someone who didn't matter.



From Alexander's point of view, though, things looked a lot different. To him, Daniela's intervention felt familiar, as though she was looking out for him once again, just like she used to.


He recalled those times when he'd gotten so drunk that he passed out, and Daniela would drive al the way out to pick him up. She'd carefully carry him,taking one slow step after another, all the way home.


The memory brought a subtle softness to Alexander's expression. His usually sharp eyes grew gentler, a hint of tenderness appearing as he glanced at Daniela.


Daniela looked at him for a second before turning away. "No more drinking. If you've got something to say, say it now." She checked the time on her watch and added, "I've got another meeting soon, so you've got five minutes."


Alexander nodded, surprisingly cooperative this time."Joyce wants the floors in your building-the ones she mentioned earlier."



Lillian snorted derisively, clearly unimpressed.


Daniela, on the other hand, stayed completely calm and unaffected. "They've already been given to someone else."



Alexander paused for a second, clearly caught off guard."What? To whom?"


Daniela responded flatly, "Phillips Group."


Alexander's brow furrowed. "Cedric Phillips?"Daniela gave a small nod. "Yes. Anything else?"


Alexander looked at Joyce, who was drunkenly slouched in her seat, and asked, "What about the other floors?"


Daniela considered briefly before answering,"There's still one spot available. It's in the basement,right by the restroom. Are you interested?" 


Alexander's expression soured. "This is insane. The wine's here, Joyce is wasted, and all you're offering is a spot near the restroom? She's running a clothing store.Who in their right mind would want to shop next to a restroom? That's completely ridiculous!"


Daniela grabbed her contract and stood up. "Well,if that's the case, there's nothing else to talk about.That's the last available space. It's at market price-15, 000 dollars per square meter-and the lease is only for one year. If you want it again next year,you'll have to bid for it like anyone else. And Mr. Bennett,don't make such a fuss over one bottle of wine.Mentioning it is just going to make you look petty and small."
With that, she spun around and walked away.


Lillian, practically beaming with satisfaction,chuckled to herself.


After years of watching Daniela go out of her way for him, this moment brought Lillian a deep sense of enjoyment.


Alexander remained seated, his eyes following Lillian as she trailed after Daniela, even throwing her a thumbs-up in admiration.



His gaze then turned to Daniela, who was chatting with someone from Clayton Renovation.


A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.


"Sure, keep talking, Daniela. It won't change anything. Clayton Renovation doesn't have the resources for a project like this. Eventually, you'll have to come crawling back to me. Huh!"


Alexander settled the bill for the wine before driving Joyce back to her place.


 Katrina was already waiting by the door.


Caiden was out in the garden, pretending to water the plants.


As Alexander stepped out of the car with the thoroughly drunk Joyce, Katrina rushed over.When she saw her daughter's intoxicated condition, her face contorted with both shock and fury. "How on earth did she end up this drunk? It's got to be Daniela! She's never let go of her grudge against us,and now she's making Joyce pay for it!"


Alexander handed Joyce over to Katrina, his mind flashing back to when Daniela had stopped Lillian from drinking. His voice remained calm as he corrected, "It wasn't Daniela. It was someone else."


Katrina was beside herself. "Who would do this?Alexander, what about the shop? Did you manage to work things out?"


Just as she finished asking, Alexander's phone rang.He nodded and answered vaguely, "Yes." Had meant to suggest they go check the location and see if it
worked for their needs, but for some reason, he didn't go further and just left it at that one word.


The instant he said it, Katrina's face lit up with happiness.


Even Calden, who had been pretending to water the plants, dropped the act and quickly walked over.


Both of them stared at Alexander, their eyes full of expectation."Really?"

###Chapter 47 No One To Rely On




Alexander nodded, but before he could respond,Katrina leapt in with eager enthusiasm. "I knew it!Only Alexander could handle this! See? This is where you're lacking, Caiden. Look at Alexander-he genuinely cares about Joyce! Even such a difficult matter has been resolved, all thanks to him.Alexander, dealing with someone like Daniela, who never gives an inch, must be exhausting!"


Caiden chimed in, grinning broadly, "Exactly! That ungrateful brat is getting harder and harder to deal with. But you're reliable as always, Alexander. Daniela still listens to you. No matter what we say, it's useless. Joyce is lucky to have you. Alright, Joyce is drunk tonight, so we won't keep you any longer, but we'll definitely need your help again in the future.Thank you."


Katrina carefully propped up Joyce, while Caiden hurried off to fetch a cold towel, wiping Joyce's 
forehead.


Alexander stood silently at the doorway, his gaze taking in the scene.


His thoughts drifted back to a memory from years ago-when Daniela had just turned eighteen. She had drunk far too much, not for her own indulgence,but for him.


He had carried her home just like this.


Katrina, instead of showing even a shred of concern,had greeted Daniela with venomous scolding,her voice harsh as she spat out accusations of impropriety.


Caiden had been no better, hurling insults with reckless abandon, calling Daniela an "ungrateful brat."


In the end, he and Katrina had ordered the maids to drag Daniela to the bathroom so that she wouldn't stink up the sofa with that smell.


It was at that moment that Alexander realized Daniela had no one to rely on.


Perhaps it was in that very moment that his treatment of her had worsened. 


Because he understood all too well the cracks in human nature.



He knew Daniela was utterly alone-no family to support her, no safety net to catch her. She had sacrificed everything, even her dignity, to stand by him.


Alexander let out a quiet, mocking laugh.


In the end, people could only depend on themselves.No one else would ever truly prioritize their well-being.


The cold indifference Daniela had faced? He felt no regret. Not even a flicker of guilt.

Alexander lowered his gaze, turned on his heel, and walked away.


He had things to discuss with his father. If Daniela decided to negotiate a deal, he needed to determine just how steep a price they could extract from her.







By the time Joyce stirred awake, the sky had already darkened, cloaking the world in twilight.


She stomped furiously around her room, her frustration spilling out in shrill curses.


She told Caiden, "Daniela made me drink! And she even let Alexander pay for a bottle of wine worth ten million! She is nothing but a greedy, heartless leech!She has no sisterly bonds at all! Someone like her is bound to get struck by lightning one day!"


Caiden,lounging on the couch as he scrolled through the news on his phone, nodded absently. "Yes, yes,struck by lightning."


Joyce, somewhat pacified, sniffled and wiped her tears. Her indignation still simmering, she muttered bitterly, "Let me make this clear-this shop space isn't something Daniela gave me. It's something Alexander gave me! It has nothing to do with her!"


Caiden, uninterested in the finer points of her tantrum, shrugged without looking up.


As long as Joyce got what she wanted, he didn't care how the matter was resolved or who had to be involved.



Joyce didn't care either. She had claimed her prize:the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. Tomorrow,she would make her mark.



In her mind's eye, she envisioned herself striding confidently into the Luxor Tower, her empire taking shape.


Her business would thrive beyond anyone's expectations.


And best of all, Daniela would burn with jealousy,powerless to stop her!


Joyce was over the moon with excitement.


That night, she rallied her friends and headed to a bar.


Fueled by alcohol and euphoria, Joyce climbed unsteadily onto the stage, snatching up a microphone. "Listen up, everyone! Starting tomorrow, I'll be moving into Luxor Tower's 18th floor to launch my empire! The 19th and 20th floors are mine too! Every single person here tonight is my friend, and from now on, those two floors will be our exclusive gathering spot! To celebrate, the entire bar's drinks are on me! Everything's on me tonight!"



The music surged louder as the crowd erupted into a frenzy of celebration.


That night, Joyce's extravagant gesture cleared out the bar's entire stock of alcohol.


By morning, word of her wild proclamation had spread like wildfire across Olisvine.


By morning, everyone was buzzing about Joyce, who was supposedly opening her boutique on the 18th floor of the Luxor Tower. The news spread so quickly that it even hit the trending headlines.


At that moment, Lillian and Josie were lounging on the couch, engrossed in a mobile game.


When the article popped up on Lillian's phone, she laughed so hard she nearly rolled off the cushions.


Just then, Daniela entered the room. She paused,noticing Josie rubbing Lillian's stomach, trying to help her catch her breath from laughing too much.


Daniela tilted her head, smiling with curiosity."What's so funny?"


Lillian, still gasping for air, waved her phone at Daniela, motioning for her to take a look.


Daniela took the phone and skimmed the screen,her expression shifting to one of incredulity.


Lillian asked, "Has Joyce completely lost her mind?Didn't you tell her the only available space was the basement by the restroom? How on earth did it turn into the 18th to 20th floors? And the space was not even renovated. Now she's out there announcing the grand opening is tomorrow! What's she planning to do? Host guests in the storage room? Or better yet-the restroom? I have to share this with the Elite Lux group chat. They're going to die laughing!"


She grabbed her phone, typing rapidly between giggles.


Meanwhile, Josie walked over to Daniela, gesturing towards the table where some food had been set out for her. Daniela nodded and sat down, picking up her fork.



As Josie passed behind her, she caught a glimpse of Daniela typing out a message on her phone.


Daniela was drafting a text to Caiden, reminding him to inform Joyce of the truth-that the space was the basement restroom, hadn't been renovated, and required a deposit to secure.


Daniela hit send, setting her phone down as she began eating.


When she glanced up, she noticed Josie staring at her with a concerned expression.


Daniela asked with a smile, "What's wronng?"

###Chapter 48 A Reminder





Josie's heart ached as she watched Daniela. Here was a young woman who had grown up without anyone truly caring for her, yet she had emerged so strong, so compassionate.


Caiden had forced his own daughter to fend for herself, while lavishing affection on a spoiled, self-centered brat like Joyce. It was beyond comprehension.


"Here, eat this," Josie said gently, pushing a dish closer to Daniela. "You're so young, yet you've had to bear so much already. You're truly remarkable. If your mother were here, she would be incredibly proud of you. But, my dear, a girl can't rely on herself all the time. Being strong is admirable, but it's also exhausting. I can't do much to ease your burdens,but I can cook. If there's ever anything you want to eat, just tell me. You've been staying up so late recently; you should go to bed early. Young women

need to take care of their health, especially if they want a happy future and to find the right partner someday."


Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile.


She had walked a long, solitary road, carrying her burdens without complaint. She didn't think of herself as remarkable-she had simply done what needed to be done.



But now, here was someone, a woman her mother's age, showing her genuine care. The warmth of Josie's words touched her deeply. Her smile grew as she met Josie's kind gaze. "Thank you, Josie."


Josie's face brightened, her smile wide and affectionate as she looked at Daniela.


Daniela was in her twenties-the prime of her youth-vibrant, radiant, and brimming with untapped potential.


A girl like her, with such a kind heart, deserved someone who would truly cherish her.
"Miss Harper, do you have a boyfriend?"


Daniela shook her head.


"I know a young man. He's handsome, well-mannered, and such a gentleman. Maybe I could introduce him to you sometime?"


Daniela let out a chuckle, shaking her head again."Thank you, Josie, but I'm not ready for that right now. I just got out of a marriage, and honestly,I think I'm a little afraid of the idea of marriage for now."


Josie's expression turned thoughtful, her head nodding. "You're right. Marriage is a big decision. It should never be taken lightly."


With that, Josie turned back to the kitchen. A moment later, Lillian wandered in from the living room with a chuckle. "Josie wants to set you up with someone? Who could she possibly know?"


Daniela glanced at her and replied, "Her intentions are kind. Don't make fun of her."



From the kitchen, Josie overheard their exchange.A
small smile spread across her lips.


She pulled out her phone and typed a message."Mr.Phillips, the person you chose is truly wonderful. But she said she's single right now and isn't considering a relationship at the moment."


The reply came almost instantly-a frustrated emoji,its expression a perfect representation of disappointment.






Caiden,as usual, sat glued to the television.


When his phone lit up with a notification, he didn't even spare it a glance. Without bothering to see who it was from, he lazily flipped the device over, leaving the screen facedown on the table.



Katrina complained, "Why don't you ever check your phone? What if Joyce has something important to tell you? How is she supposed to reach you if you're always ignoring your phone?"


She reached over, snatched up his phone, and
unlocked it.



It was a message from Daniela.


Katrina's expression soured in an instant.


Without even bothering to open the message, she swiped left and deleted it.


Caiden, still engrossed in his show, didn't notice a thing. His tone remained casual as he asked, "Is it Joyce?"


Katrina's lips curled into a sly smile as she scrolled to his contacts list and blocked Daniela's number entirely.


Finally satisfied, she let out a deep breath and smiled."Nope."







Daniela had wrapped up her tasks for the day.Fresh from the shower, she reached for her phone on the nightstand and glanced at the screen.


There was still no response from Caiden.
With a subtle frown, she opened her news app, only to find the same trending topic dominating the headlines. Curious, she tapped on the link, and a video loaded almost instantly.

The scene unfolded. Joyce, perched on a table at a bar, dancing with wild abandon to the pulsing beat of the music. Behind her hung a banner.


"Congratulations to Joyce Holt for Obtaining Floors 18th-20th of Luxor Tower!"


Daniela stared at the video, momentarily speechless.After a deep breath, she forwarded the video to Caiden, intending to remind him once again.


But just as she hit send, a small notification appeared on her screen, reminding her that she had been blocked.


Daniela froze for a moment, her gaze fixed on the notification.


Then, she placed the phone back on the bedside table, turned off the light, and slipped into bed.
###Chapter 49 The True Heiress




A party was full swing in the bar. The booming music vibrated through the walls.


A crowd encircled Joyce, lavishing her with praise.


"Joyce, you're incredible! Please, look out for me in the future! If you could just let me use a little corner of your studio to sell some essential oils, I'd be set for life!"


"Hey, who said you could call dibs first? Joyce, we're friends, right? Don't forget about me! You've got three whole floors. Let me open a shop on one! When I hit it big, I'll split the profits with you!"


"Truly, Joyce is something else! Just her presence outshines girls from half the wealthy families here!"


"Exactly! You guys don't even know how much Caiden cares for her. He spoils her rotten!"

"Yeah, so what if she disrupted Daniela's wedding and snagged her man? Even though Daniela heads Elite Lux now, she still has to cede those floors to you. And we're not talking about just any floors-these are premium, top-tier spots! Joyce, you're living the dream!"


With that, Joyce flashed a smug grin. "Of course. My family adores me the most. And Daniela? She's irrelevant. All of the Harper family's assets will end up with me eventually. Even the projects Daniela's pouring her heart into now-those will be mine, too.Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She's nothing compared to me!"



The crowd erupted in cheers, raising their glasses in a toast.



"A toast to Joyce! The future head of the Harper family!"


Joyce raised her glass high, her laughter booming through the room. "Cheers!"


This raucous moment was caught on video and quickly went viral online.


That night, Joyce racked up over four million dollars in charges at the bar.


When Caiden saw the credit card alert, he was astounded,leaping from his bed in disbelief.


Convinced the card had been stolen, he immediately phoned the police.


Meanwhile, Joyce was slowly coming to, groggily trying to sit up from the couch.


She felt something cold and wet beneath her and looked down-her body stiffened instantly.


A glaring red stain marred the sofa, jolting her fully awake.


In a panic, she scrambled into her skirt. As she looked up, she caught a glimpse of someone darting past the doorway.


"Stop right there!" she yelled.


But the figure was gone. Fuzzy memories from the night before flickered through her mind-she remembered clinging to a man in the dim light of the bar, kissing him, and noticing a small birthmark on the back of his neck.


Joyce rushed out of the private room, her heart pounding. Outside, her so-called friends lingered,equally disheveled and hungover.

They hadn't left. They were all hanging around,hoping to capitalize on her newfound status related to the Luxor Tower-a chance none wanted to miss.


Joyce quickly tried to compose herself and left the bar, only to find herself facing a group of police officers at the door.


Behind them, an irate Caiden and a distressed Katrina approached rapidly.
"Officer, there's been a mistake!" Caiden exclaimed,desperation in his voice. "My card must have been stolen! My daughter doesn't drink-she's never had alcohol in her life-" 


His protest halted abruptly as he caught sight of Joyce.


There she stood, disheveled and comical in appearance, with her hair a mess, eyelid stickers dangling precariously, and the family credit card dangling from her fingers.


The words froze in his throat.


Instead, his mind churned with a single thought."What a disgrace!"


Still, he forced himself to swallow the insult,holding back his simmering anger. Today was her big store opening. Four million? It was nothing.


Caiden clenched his fists tightly, the tension in his jaw betraying his struggle to maintain composure.


Katrina went to great lengths to ensure Joyce's store opening looked grand, including renting several luxury cars to form an impressive convoy to the Luxor Tower.


During the ride, she placed a reassuring hand on Caiden's chest, patting it lightly to calm him. "Honey,don't let it get to you. It's nothing to stress over. We'll earn it all back in no time. Think about it-business is all about connections. Sometimes, you have to spend a little to make friends!"



Caiden exhaled heavily, attempting to let her words soothe him. Then his gaze shifted to the back row,where two of Joyce's self-proclaimed "best friends"sat.



Their appearances were jarring.


One wore mismatched,ripped clothing that gave the impression she'd stumbled out of a haunted house.


The other sported multiple lip piercings that made Caiden wince.



These were her connections?
The two began chattering obnoxiously. "Joyce,remember last night? You promised I could have space on the 18th floor to sell my essential oils!"


Caiden squeezed his eyes shut, the dull throb of a headache starting to build.


When they finally arrived at the Luxor Tower,Caiden stepped out of the car, his irritation barely hidden.But then his eyes landed on Daniela.



She stood there, draped in an elegant Elite Lux early-spring couture outfit, radiating refinement with every movement. Though it was not yet 10 o'clock in the morning, she had already finalized a major deal. Her poised, professional smile shone as she saw her client off with a courteous goodbye.



Her assistant approached with a pile of documents,which she signed with practiced ease, her grace and composure unwavering.


Her every action exuded calm authority, the undeniable presence of someone destined to lead.
For a brief moment, Caiden straightened his posture,puffing out his chest. This was the epitome of a Harper heiress!


The shame he'd carried earlier began to ease,replaced by a faint sense of pride.


Joyce's friends got out of the car to see Daniela speaking with her client, her poise and polished demeanor shining like a flawless diamond.


"Wow! Joyce, your sister's really stepped it up. She's so classy now!"


"Of course! She's the CEO of Elite Lux. It doesn't get any classier than that!"


"No, no, no. That outfit only works because Daniela is the real deal-a genuine heiress. Put it on a fake heiress, and it'd just look tacky and completely out of place."
###Chapter 50 Did You Use Protection





At the sound of that, both Katrina and Joyce spun around, their eyes narrowing at the person who spoke.


Both of them sensed they were being singled out.


Katrina's eyes darted to Joyce, and her expression changed instantly, going from contempt to pure shock.



Katrina yanked Joyce's arm and gestured to the group behind them. "Let's use the side entrance.It's much wider and quieter."



She made sure to steer clear of Daniela.



Once they were out of sight, Katrina's patience snapped. She grabbed the hem of Joyce's skirt and tugged it harshly.


"Mom! Ouch, what are you doing?" Joyce winced, pulling back.


Katrina's voice lowered to a fierce whisper, her words dripping with fury. "What did you do last night?"


Joyce blinked in confusion. "What? Nothing! I just went out to enjoy myself."


"Enjoy, huh?" Katrina's voice shook with rage. "Did you even bother to shower? Look at your legs!"


Joyce looked down, and her expression stiffened in shock.


Katrina fumed with anger, her mind racing back to the wild group from the car, the heavy drinking, and now this. A sharp headache started to throb as she realized the gravity of the situation.


All the years of raising Joyce-wasted in an instant!


She should have intervened last night. She should have seen this coming!


"Who was it? Did you even use protection?" Katrina asked.
Joyce turned to her mother, her eyes wide with panic, her mind going blank.


Katrina removed her jacket and wrapped it around Joyce's waist, hiding the marks of last night's mistake. She leaned in, her voice dripping with fury as she whispered, "I didn't raise you to fall for someone like that. Whatever happened last night? It didn't happen. Do you hear me? Not a word of it! If J ever catch you with someone like that again, I swear I'll make you regret it!"


Joyce, visibly shaken, nodded quickly. She was too terrified to speak up.


Seeing her daughter's fearful reaction, Katrina continued, "This stays between us. No one can know.You were drunk, and so was everyone else. No one remembers anything, and you need to make sure it stays that way. If anyone asks, deny it. Got it? If anyone else hears about this, it's over. Your reputation will be shattered, and no decent family will want you."


Trembling, Joyce nodded once more, her fear evident in the way her body shook.


At last, Katrina let out a deep sigh, standing upright and briefly calming herself.


When they got back into the elevator with the others,her face remained tight with tension, and she kept murmuring sharp, cautionary words to Joyce.


Caiden, completely unaware of all this,was watching the elevator numbers climb with wide eyes. Excited,he grinned and said, "What's with all the whispering?Hurry up and get us to the top! I can't wait to see the view. It must be amazing from up there."


His face practically radiated excitement, his pride evident in the way he spoke.


Katrina, however, couldn't muster a bit of enthusiasm, no matter how hard she tried. Her lips barely curled into a smile, and the expression that appeared on her face was stiff, almost forced.


But as the scene unfolded, her mood began to lift, if only slightly-and for good reason.
Behind her, the group gasped in awe, their voices filled with wonder.


Even Caiden, usually composed and restrained,couldn't help himself and let out a genuine "Wow!"


The 18th floor was the best of the entire building. It was truly a sight to marvel at.


The view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was nothing short of spectacular, offering an uninterrupted 360-degree panorama of the sprawling city below.


The floor had already been completely remodeled,with every detail radiating luxury.


Antique vases decorated every corner, and a magnificent table, threaded with gold, took center stage in the room.


A stunning water feature greeted them at the entrance, a clear symbol of wealth and success,filling the space with an aura of prosperity.


And the real showstopper? A world-famous painting proudly showcased at the doorway.


This wasn't aplace where luxury was simply suggested-it was unmistakably present in every inch of the space.


"I recognize this painting!" Katrina cried, almost jumping with excitement. "It was auctioned off for fifty million not long ago. Can you believe that? It's pure opulence! With this hanging here, making money will be a piece of cake."


Joyce smiled brightly, a feeling of immense pride swelling in her chest. Finally, Daniela had done something that actually mattered.


At the same time, Caiden was soaking up the praise being showered on him.


Just as the moment seemed to peak, the elevator doors chimed softly and then slid open.


Cedric stepped out, dressed in a sharp, tailored suit that radiated authority and sophistication.


He and the building manager beside him appeared momentarily thrown off by the strange mix of people in front of him. The other group was just as surprised.


For a second, both groups just stood there, staring at each other in silence.


Joyce hesitated before taking a small, nervous step forward, her hands twisting nervously in front of her.Katrina gave a subtle pull on her skirt, a silent nudge of encouragement.


Taking a breath, Joyce forced a shy smile and spoke in a soft, almost teasing tone. "Mr. Phillips, are you here to congratulate me on my new office? Thank you so much for being here. It really means a lot. The space is still a work in progress, though."


Katrina couldn't have looked happier. With a proud smile, she added, "Cedric, welcome! What a wonderful surprise to have you here!"


Caiden felt his pride grow as he watched Cedric.Having him there, with all his influence and status,was like a badge of honor for Caiden, giving him a sense of validation and boosting his confidence tenfold.


At the same time, Joyce's friends were gathered at the back, staring at Cedric in awe.


"That's Cedric?" one of them whispered, her voice shaky with astonishment.


"You're talking about Cedric Phillips? The business mogul who's always in the news?"


"He's so put together, totally unlike us. He has this presence so polished, so sophisticated."


"Yeah, but isn't Cedric known for staying away from social events? Why would he come here, of all places? And on Joyce's office opening day, no less.What's happening?"


"Isn't it clear? Cedric must have a thing for Joyce! I mean, why else would he be here? Joyce is basically set for life now-landing someone like Cedric? She's hit the jackpot."


"Living the dream. But why would Cedric go for someone like Joyce? She doesn't really seem all that sharp."


That last remark wasn't as quiet as the rest-it was loud enough for everyone to catch.


The room went still. Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce turned in sync, their glares sharp and cold.


On the other hand, the building manager couldn't help but stifle a laugh.
###Chapter 51 Self-respect




From the moment Katrina's gaze fell upon Cedric,her smile was unwavering. She regarded him as an exemplary choice for a son-in-law.


Leaning towards Caiden, she murmured, "Cedric really is something else, isn't he? Look how polite and considerate he is. We haven't even officially started, and here he is, already bearing a gift."


Caiden, watching Cedric's poised and respectful manner, nodded in acknowledgment.


Katrina's grin broadened with pride. "You see,honey? This is all my doing. Had I not nurtured Joyce so well, she might have ended up like Daniela. Think about it-when we're old, who will we depend on?Certainly not Daniela."


With an eager nod, Caiden responded, "You're absolutely right. Joyce is all we've got. Daniela?She's a lost cause, utterly unreliable for the rest of her pathetic life."


Katrina felt a surge of elation, her beaming smile proof of her delight.


She advanced a few paces towards Cedric, her focus turning to the vase the building manager held.A glimmer of recognition danced in her eyes. "Hang on... Isn't that from last night's auction?"


Curiosity flickered in Katrina's eyes as she leaned toward the vase. Yet, as she approached, the manager recoiled instinctively, clutching the vase closer to his chest.


Katrina's expression hardened with irritation, but she smoothed it over with an overly sweet smile as she pivoted towards Cedric.


"Oh, Cedric! How incredibly thoughtful of you! This vase is the one from last night's auction,right?remember it fetching a million. How lavish of you! Tell me, is this splendid piece meant to celebrate Joyce's store opening? Your generosity knows no bounds!Yet, how can we justify accepting such a prized treasure?"


Despite her words, Katrina closed the distance once more, her hands seizing the vase from the flustered manager, who found himself helplessly cornered.


With the vase pressed to her chest, she flashed a radiant smile, her face glowing with a sense of triumph.


The building manager stood frozen, a look of utter disbelief painting his face as he gazed at his now-empty palms, then turned to Cedric.


Cedric's features turned stormy. His eyebrows drew together, casting his face into an icy, uninviting expression.


The manager, overwhelmed by the moment,exclaimed, "Seriously? Are you out of your mind?What on earth are you doing? This isn't just reckless -it's outright robbery!"


He was in complete shock, questioning whether this was typical behavior for women of affluent backgrounds.


But Katrina couldn't care less. To her, the vase was already hers. She believed Cedric was going to be her son-in-law. Why couldn't she take that vase.


She felt not just justified, but determined, having already selected the perfect spot for the vase-in the living room of their home. This was more than decoration; it was a declaration. Her daughter was now Cedric's cherished.


Approaching, Caiden lightly grasped Joyce's elbow,his expression full of quiet approval. "This is such a wonderful gesture. Thank you so much!"


"Thank you, Cedric," Joyce chimed in with a shy smile.


Maintaining his composure by a thread, Cedric resisted the urge to roll his eyes.


His patience wearing thin, he turned to Katrina with a cold stare. "Who gave you permission to be here?"His tone cut through the air, sharp and unforgiving.
Caiden, taken aback, blinked in confusion. After a moment, he chuckled awkwardly. "What do you mean by that? The entire floor is ours now. Actually,not just this one, but the two above it too. Daniela handed over all three floors to us."


At the mention of Daniela's name, Cedric's demeanor turned to one of solemnity, and he turned sharply to confront the building manager.


The manager, his forehead slick with sweat,hastened to clarify, "No, Mr. Phillips, their shop isn't located on this level."


Katrina, her brow furrowed in bewilderment,interjected sharply, "Our shop isn't here? Then where on earth is it supposed to be?"


Exhaling a deep, weary sigh, the building manager tapped his phone with a sense of urgency. "Jerry,come upstairs and escort them to their designated space," he instructed, before turning to Katrina with a stern gaze. "I must urge you to be careful as you exit. Every item here is a valuable antique, with each piece carrying a significant price tag."

He stepped towards Katrina, his hands extended,ready to ease the vase from her desperate grip. "Mr.Phillips, I'll ensure this vase is delivered to Ms.Harper's office."


Cedric watched the exchange, his eyes darkening as he viewed the vase. "It's already dirty," he declared,his disdain palpable.


The manager paused, his bewilderment plain on his face."Sorry.What did you say?"


Cedric offered no further explanation. "Just get rid of it," he stated dismissively.


In his eyes, anything Katrina defiled with her touch was as good as garbage, a disgrace to Daniela's name.


He entered the elevator without another word,his expression unreadable, yet his revulsion was clear.Katrina made a half-hearted attempt to reach out, to halt his departure, but the elevator doors sealed shut before she could utter a single plea.
The building manager exhaled a deep, tired sigh and ambled over to the trash can. With a resonant clang,he dumped the vase into it without a second thought.


Katrina's eyes stretched wide in shock. Casting aside any semblance of composure, she dashed to the trash can and leaned over, her arms plunging in to rescue the vase.


Cradling it protectively, she muttered in disbelief,"How could anyone toss away such a stunning vase?It's worth a fortune! Oh, no-look, there's a chip on the rim!"


Caiden and Joyce stood by, utterly mortified, their cheeks burning with embarrassment as they observed Katrina's frantic actions.



Behind them, Joyce's friends exchanged glances,their eyes wide with shock, their whispers intensifying as they struggled to mask their astonishment.



"This is utterly disgraceful."
 
"She has completely tarnished the image of every dignified lady! Can you believe Cedric refused the vase just because she handled it, and now she's scavenging it from the garbage? Did you see the desperation in her actions?"


"Truly, though, it's hardly shocking. I heard that Katrina only secured her place in the Harper family after Daniela's mother passed away. Before that,she was merely a humble villager, busying herself with pickling vegetables. It seems she employed every cunning tactic available to seduce Daniela's father."


"All that money, and she still can't shake off the pitiful aura of someone who'll grovel for scraps."


"Indeed, coming from modest means is no fault of her own. But where is her sense of pride? Has she no self-respect at all?"


"Self-respect? Please. It's doubtful Katrina even understands the concept. I heard that right after Daniela's mother died, Katrina moved in. Driven by fear of missing her chance at wealth, she disregarded how blatantly disgraceful it appeared. A woman of her sort-do you really think< she possesses any self-respect?"

###Chapter 52 Humiliation





As Jerry Oliver took the lead with the group in tow,their footsteps reverberated through the corridor,accompanied by a low murmur of whispers that filled the air with a sense of unease.②


Katrina, gripping the vase, struggled to maintain her composure. A pulsing headache exacerbated her growing irritation, yet she managed to suppress the rising storm within her.


She glanced back to check on her daughter, only to see her engaged in light-hearted conversation with a friend, seemingly oblivious to the tension around them.


With a deep breath, Katrina tightened her eyes shut,mentally coaxing herself to remain calm and not to succumb to the provocation of the youngsters'carefree disregard.


As the elevator moved down through the floors,
Caiden's previously easy smile slowly dissolved into a look of concern. A troubling premonition gnawed at him, prompting him to finally break the silence.


"Jerry, just where on earth are we headed now?"


They had exited the elevator and continued their lengthy trek.


It seemed as if they were about to leave the confines of Luxor Tower altogether.


Jerry, clutching a hefty ring of keys, was visibly annoyed. The murmurs and snickers from the group had not escaped his notice and had left him simmering with resentment.



He was keenly aware of Daniela's true character-her beauty was matched by her compassion and generosity.


She had discreetly funded his wife's surgery when they were desperate and unsupported. Whenever a crisis struck a staff member's family, she was there to offer aid. Her genuine kindness had earned her the  deep respect of everyone within Elite Lux.


Yet, here was her own family, disparaging her with a haughty air.


Jerry rolled his eyes, his voice sharp and dismissive as he retorted, "Why bombard me with questions?Just come along and all will be revealed in due time!"


His brusque tone took Caiden aback. It had been a long while since someone had addressed him with such unfiltered disdain.


"Do you not know who the hell I am?" Caiden challenged, his brow furrowed in irritation. "I'm Daniela's father-your boss's father! With a snap of my fingers, I could own this entire building!"


Jerry halted in his tracks, his grip on the keys tightening, his knuckles whitening as he fought to control his rising fury.


Caiden, seemingly unaware of the growing storm,pressed on. "Don't forget, it's my family's money keeping your ass employed."

 Katrina, quick to capitalize on the moment, chimed in sharply, "Precisely! Would you even have a job if it weren't for us? People who run their damn mouths like you don't deserve to stay employed!"


Jerry exhaled sharply, his voice laced with a mix of defiance and disbelief. "Go ahead, fire me! But I have to ask, do you actually hold the power to do so?Caiden, is it? Let me make something clear. Having you as a father is the worst curse that could've befallen Ms. Harper! Weren't you the one who declared to the world that you were severing all ties with her? And yet, now that she's found success, you suddenly claim ownership over this entire building?Why not take it further? Perhaps proclaim that the entire nation belongs to you? You're supposed to be an elder-perhaps it's time to start behaving like one and exhibit a bit of dignity!"


Katrina's face flushed a deep crimson, and she shook with fury. "How dare you speak to us in such a manner! Get your manager on the phone this instant!"

Jerry, utterly unfazed by the escalating tension,retrieved his phone and dialed his manager,putting the call on speaker. The manager's voice crackled through, tinged with irritation. "What now? What's the problem with Joyce Holt? She's already stirred up enough trouble. You know what? Forget it-if they're that much of a nuisance, just stop leasing to them. Are we really so desperate that we can't do without the rent from a basement-level unit?"


The phrase "basement-level unit" struck a nerve.


Caiden and Katrina, who had been simmering with rage only seconds before, came to a sudden halt.


Joyce's brow furrowed as her voice dripped with fury. "What the hell do you mean by that?"


Jerry folded his arms, his voice laced with a flat,impatient tone. "Areyou coming to check it out or not? If you're not interested, I can just go."


Reluctantly, the trio stifled their objections and trailed after him.

As they moved deeper, an unsettling feeling crept up on them.


Joyce edged closer to Katrina, her voice a nervous whisper. "Mom, what is this place? Why are we wandering through a parking garage?"


Katrina's face grew troubled, her anxiety palpable.


They were supposed to be shown the 18th to 20th floors, yet here they were, in the basement.


As they progressed, Caiden's prior cockiness had vanished entirely, his face clouding over with each step they took.


Suddenly, Joyce perked up, her voice slicing through the tension. "Mom, look! There are shops over there!"


Their gazes collectively turned to where Joyce directed, and sure enough, a series of storefronts came into view.



Joyce gestured towards a shop in the middle. "If it's a spot like that, I could definitely see us there."

However, Katrina's response was less than enthusiastic. Her experience of the opulent upper levels had set a high bar that this basement level couldn't meet.


Disdainfully, she waved a dismissive hand, her nose wrinkling at the pervasive, musty odor that filled the air.


Undeterred, Jerry maintained his brisk pace, guiding them deeper into the busier part of the basement.They navigated a corner and halted abruptly at the end of the corridor.


Joyce looked around, bewildered. "Seriously? You brought us to a damn restroom? We don't need to use it!"


Jerry pointed to a dimly lit area near the bathroom and announced, "Over there is the space for your shop." He then proceeded to unlock the door.


Once opened, the room was engulfed in darkness, an eerie silence pervading the air. Joyce paused,reluctant, before finally using her phone's flashlight
to pierce the gloom.


The sight that greeted her elicited a shriek of terror."Mom! It's full of rats!"


Chaos exploded, their screams and yells bouncing off the waIls of the tight hallway.


Jerry, unimpressed, merely rolled his eyes. "This area was once used for storing restroom supplies. It's been out of use for quite some time, hence the dust and, unfortunately, the current residents. The space is roughly 100 square meters, priced at $11,000 per square meter. That's the final offer, and you'll have to handle any renovations yourself. Make your decision today, or it's no longer available."


They were left dumbfounded, struggling to comprehend his proposition.


Katrina's forced smile faded as she turned to Caiden,her expression one of sheer outrage. "Don't you see it? Daniela's doing this on purpose to make us look like fools, isn't she?"


She broke down, tears streaming down her face, her hands covering her eyes as she sobbed uncontrollably.


Joyce's friends had discreetly vanished, leaving only a few behind who observed the unfolding drama with a mix of amusement and disbelief.


Joyce's lips trembled as she clutched Caiden's arm,her tear-filled eyes wide with despair. "Dad, I've never been so humiliated in my life! How can l possibly face my friends after this? Daniela set the whole thing up. She's obsessed with tearing me down and making me a joke!"


Around them, some bystanders discreetly extracted their phones to capture the family's distress,quickly taking pictures before vanishing into the crowd.


Jerry, apparently oblivious to the unfolding drama,picked up an incoming call. He spoke in a booming voice, not bothering to lower his tone, ensuring that Caiden and Katrina caught every word.


"Hello? Yes, I'm terribly sorry about the holdup.
understand we agreed to reserve the space next to the restroom for your cleaning supplies store, but there's been a bit of a scene here. You know how Ms.Harper is always kind-hearted. She insisted we let them have a look first. But I wouldn't worry-they're notoriously fussy. Give me half an hour.If they pass on it, I'll ring you straight back and we can finalize the paperwork. Alright, appreciate your patience."


After ending the call, Jerry swiveled back to face the group, his voice edged with impatience. "Are you interested in the space or not? If you're not,there are plenty of others waiting in line for it."


Joyce, her face streaked with tears, looked imploringly at Caiden and Katrina.


The air hung heavy for a brief moment before Joyce's emotions spilled over in a heart-wrenching wail.

###Chapter 53 I'm On Board




Joyce was crying uncontrollably. Katrina, unable to bear seeing her daughter like this, felt as though her heart was breaking into pieces.


Without caring about her pride, she dropped to the floor,her body trembling.


Throwing her head back, she let out a loud, heart-wrenching wail.

"Caiden, after all these years of marriage, do you have any idea how many people have laughed at me behind my back? How many have pointed fingers and whispered about me? I put up with all of it-because l love you! I loved you so deeply that I endured the pain. You have no idea how proud I once was. But for you, I surrendered it all-my pride, my dignity, my sense of self-worth. You said that if I married you,you would take care of everything outside the home,while I would be in charge of everything inside. And I trusted you. Throughout the years, I've treated Daniela like my own daughter. I gave her more love and attention than I ever gave Joyce! Tell me,how many stepmothers would sacrifice so much for their stepchild? When I decided to marry you, everyone told me it would bring nothing but trouble, that being a stepmother would be nothing but heartache. But l turned a deaf ear to them, all because I love you. And what about Joyce? Hasn't she treated you well? From the moment she became part of this family, she called you 'Dad.! She's always been respectful and kind to you, year after year! And Daniela? Has she ever called me 'Mom' even once? Not a single time!I let it slide, convincing myself it wasn't important. But today,Daniela crossed the line! She humiliated both Joyce and me in front of everyone. I'm too old to endure this kind of shame. I feel like I might as well just disappear!"

She tilted her head back dramatically, as though she intended to smash it against the vase she was holding in her hands.


Just before she could act, she shot a meaningful glance at Joyce. Without hesitation, Joyce flung herself against a nearby pillar, wailing dramatically. "I might as well die too!"


Caiden, visibly shaken by the drama, stormed out in frustration. He grabbed a phone from a passerby, his mind racing with anger. Once the call connected, his voice thundered through the receiver. "Daniela! If you want to avoid your father dropping dead in your posh building today, you better get down here now! You've got five minutes!"


Meanwhile, Daniela had just put pen to paper on a long-term deal for an incredibly lucrative contract.


Her mood was cool and composed, unaffected by the chaos unfolding below.


Once the call ended, she opened the message she had sent to Caiden the day before.


Just as she was about to head downstairs, Cedric arrived at her office. She asked him to wait a little while inside.
However, her secretary, arriving late, carelessly mentioned something about Katrina and Caiden being downstairs. Without wasting a second,Cedric turned and quickly took another elevator, heading straight for the basement.


Lillian, ever close behind, followed Daniela every step of the way.


As the elevator descended, the chaotic scene in the basement came into view. Katrina was seated on the floor, crying uncontrollably, while Joyce clung to a pillar, her sobs just as theatrical.


Caiden stood nearby, hands firmly on his hips, his head lowered as though he were fighting to keep his fury in check.


The sharp click of Daniela's heels on the floor immediately caught Caiden's attention. His gaze shot up, his cold, furious eyes locking onto her face.


That face-so eerily similar to the one that had tormented him for years. The face of the woman who had once made him feel insignificant and weak.
His chest swelled with rage. Without a second thought, he stormed towards her and slapped her in the face.


The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the entire basement, bouncing off the cold walls.


Everything stopped.


The chatter of shopkeepers, the footsteps of passersby, and the hum of the crowd all vanished as people froze, their attention now drawn to the sudden noise.


Lillian stood rooted to the spot, her eyes wide with shock, unable to process what had just happened.


Cedric, stepping out of the elevator just as the slap echoed, felt a tightness in his chest. Without thinking, he sprang into action and rushed towards the scene.


In the heavy silence that followed, one person remained composed. It was Daniela.


She stood firm, her eyes steady and unwavering.Her hands had initially balled into fists, but she slowly relaxed them, choosing calm over reaction.


The sound of hurried footsteps echoed behind her,and before Daniela could fully grasp the situation,she was enveloped in a warm embrace.


For a brief moment, the burden in her chest lightened. She looked up, her eyes catching the man's collarbone, his strong Adam's apple, and the familiar scent of his cologne.


The scent stirred something in her, as if she had smelled it before. Yet, she couldn't quite place where.


"Daniela! You ungrateful bitch! You're just as cruel as your mother!"


Regaining her composure, Daniela pulled away from the embrace. Noticing it was Cedric, she whispered quietly,"Thank you."


She then turned to face Caiden-the man who claimed to be her father.

His face contorted with fury, his hand shaking as he pointed an accusatory finger at her.


"I always wanted you to be nothing like your mother.I dreamed of you being obedient and compassionate.I imagined you as gentle, kind, and pure-not corrupted by the murky manipulations of the business world. When you were after Alexander, you were so innocent, so soft, like a helpless little lamb!How did you turn into someone so heartless, so driven by nothing but greed and power?"


He pointed fiercely at Katrina. "This is your mother!"His finger then swept over to Joyce. "And this is your sister! And yet, you've turned on both of them! Yes,you're the CEO of Elite Lux now, but does that mean you have the right to crush your family's dignity?To disgrace us in front of the world? Daniela! Do you have any idea how much you've hurt them?"


Daniela stood there, silent, her eyes fixed on the man before her-the man who had just slapped her, right in front of everyone.


She longed to ask him if he realized the pain he had caused her, if she was unworthy of his affection and care, or if he only valued the manipulated, lesser version of her from before.


These questions had haunted her ever since her mother's death, since Katrina brought Joyce into the Harper family and took control, and since the countless meals Daniela spent with the servants while her father enjoyed his dinners with his new family.


She had asked herself time and again. Was she not also a Harper?


But today, Daniela didn't ask-not because she couldn't, but because she didn't want to.


The slap had already spoken volumes.


Asking would only deepen her humiliation.


Besides, she had grown accustomed to living without her father's affection or care and standing alone,bearing the weight of blame and criticism.


Fine, if this was her fate, then so be it.
She lifted her chin, standing tall. Her cheek burned,swollen and red from the slap, but her stance was unshaken, and her movements flowed with elegance.


Daniela met Caiden's gaze, her voice steady and frosty. "I never said the 18th to 20th floors were for Joyce. From the start, I told Alexander it was the basement level. I even informed you about this yesterday. If things got out of hand, it's because you allowed it to happen. Why didn't you ask Joyce why she made those bold claims before checking the facts? Why didn't you question Katrina for not teaching her daughter to be self-aware? My money doesn't come easily, so why should I give away valuable real estate? You've always shown favoritism.I've spent so many years trying to earn your approval, trying to be the daughter you wanted-obedient,well-behaved.But now..."



She paused, her eyes bloodshot and filled with a mixture of deep sorrow and overwhelming fatigue.


Caiden's stomach twisted. He couldn't understand why, but an unfamiliar dread crept over him, a sensation he hadn't felt in years. It reminded him of the time Daniela's mother had almost rejected him-the time when he feared losing the only chance to improve his life.


His voice wavered as he asked, "What now?"


Daniela's lips curled into a fragile smile. Her usual radiant beauty now seemed shattered. "Now I realize you're no different from Alexander. No matter what 1do, no matter how much I give, I'll never get the one thing I truly want from you. And if that's the reality,then I don't see why I should keep making the effort.You wanted to sever ties with me. Fine. I'm on board.Starting today,immediately."


She straightened, her posture resolute. "For me, this is a matter of finality. I'lI have my lawyers prepare the documents and send them over. After that, there's no need for us to meet again."


She held Caiden's gaze for a brief moment before turning and walking away without saying another word.
###Chapter 54 Confident





Caiden's irritation simmered just beneath the surface, growing with each step Daniela took away from him.


Unable to contain his frustration, he bellowed, "You think you can just cut ties with me? I'll make damn sure that doesn't happen!"


Daniela had turned from a nondescript girl to a golden goose. Severing ties with her was unthinkable, an option only conceivable if he were six feet under.



Katrina jumped to her feet, worried Caiden would act on impulse and actually cut ties with Daniela.


"You're absolutely right, Caiden! She doesn't get to walk away from us like we're nothing! She's stuck being your daughter, and that means when we're old,she has to take care of us!"
Standing up with fiery determination, Joyce exclaimed, "Exactly!"


Overhearing the conversation, Cedric balled his hands into fists, the knuckles whitening as he struggled to restrain his mounting anger.


Meanwhile, Jerry, who had been quietly observing the chaos, rolled his eyes in exasperation.He moved briskly towards the door, locking it with a definitive,echoing click.


Katrina, noticing his actions, seized his arm urgently."What the hell are you doing locking that? We're not done here!"



Jerry paused, taking a deep breath as he fought to maintain his calm. "Are you serious? Do you even grasp the gravity of your actions? You slapped Ms.Harper in her own building! And yet, you dare to ask about running a shop? Can you even hear yourself talk?"

His expression contorted with rage, and for a fleeting second, it seemed like he was ready to break someone's jaw.


Jerry's devotion to Daniela was unwavering. During his family's darkest times, Daniela had been his beacon of support, and he vowed to remain indebted to her forever.


Witnessing someone as kind-hearted as Daniela endure a public humiliation at the hands of her own father was more than he could bear.


Jerry's rage simmered beneath the surface.


The issue wasn't that the elderly were deteriorating into malevolence. Rather, it was the wicked who aged without mending their ways.


Seething with anger, Jerry marched away from the scene. Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her gaze fixed on the locked door of the shop.


Despite being tucked away in the basement, the space was far superior to any other she could have dreamt of securing.


Joyce pulled at her mother's sleeve and murmured,
"Mom, maybe this place isn't all that bad?"


Katrina, still visibly distraught and mortified by the day's events, felt a pang of bitterness towards Caiden. She had never imagined he would lose his composure and strike Daniela.

When he was supposed to act, he held back. And when it was better to stay quiet, he ran his mouth like an idiot and ruined it all.


The words slipped from her lips before she realized it.


Caiden whirled around, his expression a mix of shock and disbelief. "What did you just say? After all this mess, you're pointing the finger at me? Do you even get who I was risking everything for?"


With that, he turned around and stormed away, not once glancing back.


Katrina, jolted back to reality by her own blunder,stood frozen, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. Beside her, Joyce shifted uncomfortably, her eyes darting between the closed shop door and Caiden's receding figure.


Memories of her lost virginity flooded back, and she suddenly burst into tears.


The news that the CEO of Elite Luix had been publicly humiliated was rapidly spreading across social media.



The moment Alexander exited the meeting, the scandal's details began to unravel before him.



He slammed the contract down on the table with a resounding thud and dialed Katrina's number.



The phone barely rang before she answered, her voice laced with accusation. "Alexander! How could you let this happen? You never mentioned that Daniela's offer was just for the basement spot! Now look at the mess you've caused. Caiden actually hit Daniela, right there in front of everyone, and now she's refusing to let us lease any space at all. What are we supposed to do now?"
Alexander opened his mouth to protest, but Katrina crushed his attempt, her words slicing through him like a blade. "I don't give a damn how you fix it,but you better clean up this disaster for us."


Stunned into silence, Alexander could only listen.


No sooner had Katrina ended the call than Joyce's name flashed on his screen. Her voice, shaky and tear-streaked, filled his ear. "Alexander, please,you have to convince Daniela to reconsider. I'll take the basement if that's what it takes. Just make sure everything is crystal clear next time, okay? My dad's absolutely furious. Just fix this and let me know when it's done. I really have to go."


Without waiting for a response, she disconnected the call, leaving Alexander grappling with the chaos that unfolded.


Alexander shut his eyes, his chilling presence sending shivers down his secretary's spine.


At that moment, his phone buzzed-a call from Richard. "I've heard Daniela has been in close contact with Clayton Renovation recently. Take advantage of her recent ordeal with that slap to dig for information. We can't afford to let this lucrative opportunity slip through our fingers."


The project was worth billions, and Richard's concern was palpable, especially since Daniela's team had yet to reach out to Bennett Group for a collaboration.



"You should invite Daniela over for dinner," Richard urged, convinced they needed to act rather than wait passively. "She's a young woman, and after today's events, she's undoubtedly shaken. A comforting visit from you, a few compassionate words-she might just be moved. And with the residual affection she harbors for you, who knows? Sparks might fly again.Alexander, stop messing around and get serious about it. Let's arrange a family dinner tonight. I've had my disagreements with Daniela, but this evening is an ideal moment to mend fences. Whether it's forging a business alliance or considering a union,both parties stand to gain."
Richard's words were so meticulously/ crafted that even Alexander's secretary sensed the deliberate nature of his manipulation.


When the call was disconnected, the secretary turned to Alexander. "This time, it might be harder than you think."


Alexander shot a dismissive glance at his secretary and responded with a cold snort, "Perhaps for others, but not when Daniela is involved.I know I can handle her."



Richard's ongoing disputes with Daniela were hardly a secret. He had previously belittled her, consistently ridiculing her capabilities and dismissing her as inconsequential with his sharp, disdainful comments.


However, Richard's current strategy involved winning her over with displays of warmth and apparent sincerity. Daniela had always yearned for the familial bonds and affection that had eluded her during her upbringing, and Richard's wvell-rehearsed charm and courteous demeanor were likely to thaw her resolve.
Turning back to his secretary, Alexander commanded, "Fetch the navy-blue suit from my wardrobe."


It was Daniela's favorite suit on him, yet he had deliberately shunned wearing it before.


Likely, it had been neglected and gathering dust in his closet for some time now.
###Chapter 55 I No Longer Have A Father

Daniela had been slapped by her father.


The entire staff at Elite Lux was very angry.


Daniela, however, quietly went to her office, sat in her chair, and stared at a video.


The video showed Joyce at a bar, standing on a table with a glass in her hand. Her carefree and bold attitude was on full display as she loudly announced to the crowd, "Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She's nothing compared to me!"



Daniela's hand shook ever so slightly as she clutched 
her phone.


So, this was the truth.Growing up, she always had this nagging feeling that her father didn't love her.


When her mother was alive, he made an effort to pretend.


Once her mother died, he completely distanced himself, and Daniela naively believed it was because he was drowning in grief over her death.


Yet, before her mother's funeral had even ended, he had already remarried.


Daniela was left stunned and utterly confused.


She tried to rationalize it in every way she could.Maybe he needed someone to help him cope, or perhaps he was so lost in missing her mother that he couldn't express it. After all, love didn't always have to be spoken; maybe he carried it silently.


She knew her father was still young, and it wasn't entirely fair to expect him to live alone for the rest of his life.

 But everything changed on one blistering afternoon when the central air conditioning broke down,jolting her awake from the suffocating heat.


Wanting to find out if there was a power outage, she stepped out of her room.


But as soon as she entered the living room, she froze in her tracks.


There, in the middle of the room, was Katrina.She was wearing her mother's clothes, sitting on Caiden's lap. The sound of their labored breathing filled the room, like an unbearable echo.


She overheard Caiden telling Katrina, "Katrina,I love you and only you. That awful woman is finally gone.She used her money to control me, but what man would tolerate being treated like a servant? All she ever did was earn money-she was useless for anything else. A woman who can't even make a man happy...What kind of woman is that? Katrina, it's only after meeting you that I've learned what it feels like to be a real man. You are the wife I've chosen to spend my life with."
It was a scorching summer day, and as Daniela stood at the top of the stairs, everything in her life seemed to fall apart.


She saw them in the living room, locked in a sweaty embrace, their faces flushed and dazed. Without a second thought, she ran to her room, leaned over the toilet, and retched uncontrollably.


To everyone else, Caidenappeared to be the ideal husband and a loving father.


No one could have imagined that behind his respectable front hid a heart so twisted and depraved it was impossible to see.


Lost in her thoughts, Daniela didn't notice when the office door creaked open.



Joyce's harsh words-"He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed"-played on an endless loop in her mind.



She clung to every word like a punishment, as though engraving Caiden's cruelty into her memory,hurting herself over and over.


Then, a hand took the phone from her fingers.


Daniela blinked, snapping out of her daze, looking up in confusion.


Before she could process what was happening,someone knelt down in front of her, wrapping her in a comforting embrace.


Cedric's steady, low voice filled the quiet room.


"Daniela! You're not alone. Don't be scared. I'll always be by your side."


In that instant, Daniela let her guard down,surrendering her strength as she leaned into his shoulder.


She wasn't one to cry.


Since that summer, she hadn't shed a tear.


Caiden hitting her wasn't new; she never cried.


But now, as Cedric held her close, his voice trembling more than hers, whispering that she didn't need to be afraid, her eyes began to fill.


It felt like walking alone for ages down a dark,desolate path. She could pretend it didn't hurt,and saying it aloud seemed unnecessary. Yet, the moment someone stood up for her, the floodgates opened, and the emotions she'd buried for so long spilled out uncontrollably.


Cedric's heart broke into pieces. The woman he had cherished for so many years cried quietly against his shoulder.His chest tightened with so much pain that it felt like he couldn't breathe.



The night gradually settled in.


Daniela stared into the darkened sky and murmured,"Cedric, from this moment on, I no longer have a father."
###Chapter 56 Just Try lt




Cedric's heart clenched with pain.


Daniela rested against his shoulder, her exhaustion finally overcoming her as she drifted into a deep sleep.


Cedric carefully lifted her into the office's lounge.Outside, Lillian, sensing the quiet that had settled in,hesitated before quietly peeking through the door.


Her voice was soft and cautious as she asked, "ls she doing any better?"


Cedric gently tucked a blanket around Daniela before quietly stepping out of the room.


As soon as they were outside the office, Lillian couldn't contain her anger any longer and exploded in the hallway.


"I'll kill Caiden! I'll make him pay! What kind of monster does that? He's her father! How could he hurt her like that? And now these rumors online,saying she's not Caiden's daughter? Otherwise,why would he treat her like this? I want answers too,damn it!"


As she trailed behind Cedric, she couldn't hold back her frustration and shot him a barrage of questions."Where are you going?"


With a grim look, Cedric didn't respond and made his way upstairs.


Once there, he asked Josie for some ice cubes,then wrapped them carefully in a towel before heading back downstairs.



Lillian slowly picked up on the dangerous vibe coming from Cedric.


It hit her in that moment. While her words about killing Caiden were just heated talk, Cedric was a man of quiet action.


He stepped into Daniela's lounge, carefully pressing the ice against her swollen cheek.


His brow tightened in sympathy, as though he were the one who had been hurt.


Lillian stood there and was about to speak when the secretary quietly entered the room.


He took a quick look at Daniela, who was asleep,before turning his attention to Lillian. "Alexander Bennett wants to discuss something with Ms.Harper."


Lillian furrowed her brow in response. What could that bastard possibly want to talk about now, of all times? Was he trying to take advantage of Daniela's vulnerability?


Seething, Lillian turned and snapped, "Did he say what he wants?"


The secretary noticed Cedric's stern expression and hesitated, unsure if speaking would provoke a harsh glare from him.


He paused,trying to gather his thoughts. Cedric, sensing the delay, turned his head sharply and demanded, "What does he want to discuss?"


The secretary stuttered, "He said...he came to settle Joyce's store rent, and then..."


Before the secretary could continue, a sudden chill swept through the air, affecting both Lillian and him.


As they pieced it together, Cedric had already stormed out.



His departing figure exuded a chilling, threatening energy, like someone consumed by rage.


Alexander was taken aback as Cedric appeared from Daniela's office.


Cedric advanced, his expression dark and full of menace."What do you want?"


Alexander hesitated and briefly looked towards Daniela's office, but Cedric moved to block his line of sight.


"I have some matters to discuss with Daniela. Didn't the secretary inform you?"


Cedric's voice was icy. "She's not available right now."



Despite his many grievances and doubts, Alexander hesitated under Cedric's intense stare. "Then I'll wait for her."


Cedric's eyes narrowed as he spoke, his tone laden with authority. "She isn't meeting with anyone today."


Alexander was aware of why she was unavailable and responded calmly, "I understand. That's why my father has invited her to dinner at our house today.I'll wait outside until she's free." He glanced at the time and added, "There's still two hours left in the workday,so no need to rush."


Cedric's secretary knew that in these situations,Cedric typically didn't say much. But today, things were different.


In a low, commanding tone, Cedric repeated,"I told you, Daniela isn't seeing anyone today!"
Alexander's expression tightened, and he squared his shoulders, meeting Cedric's gaze with a defiant stance. "Do you think Daniela is your property?How can you make decisions for her without even consulting her? Sure, you might have influence now,but that doesn't mean everyone has to bow to your will. Daniela deserves the freedom to make her own choices. And just so you know, I'm not here with any ulterior motives. I'm just trying to offer some kindness. Her family dynamics aren't great, so I'm doing what I can to help. I'llpay for Joyce's rent.Daniela's upset, and I've even had my family prepare a meal for her. What's wrong with that?"



His words rang with a sense of self-righteousness.


Just as Lillian was about to respond, a flash of cold fury crossed Cedric's face, followed by the sharp crack of a fist striking something hard. The impact was deafening.


Alexander stumbled backward, losing his balance before crashing to the floor in a clumsy heap. 
The entire room stood frozen in shock.


Even Alexander seemed dazed by what had just happened. Wiping blood from the corner of his mouth, he rose to his feet, preparing to confront Cedric.


At that moment, Ryan stepped out of the elevator,deliberately tripping Alexander, sending him crashing to the floor again, this time face down.


Determined, Alexander tried to get up once more,but Cedric quickly stepped in front of Ryan, blocking his path.


With a pointed finger aimed at Alexander, Cedric growled, "Try it, and you'll regret it!"


Alexander's hand curled into a tight fist at his side,his fury evident.
###Chapter 57 Do Whatever It Takes





Alexander hesitated and didn't dare to take another step.


He knew all too well that his family's businesses were deeply tied to Phillips Group.


Acting on impulse might feel satisfying in the moment, but the consequences would be disastrous.How could he face his family afterward?


Alexander wiped the blood from his lips with the back of his hand, his face flushed with humiliation.Without saying another word, he began to walk away.


Just as he made his first move, Cedric's icy voice rang out, stopping him in his tracks. "Wait."


Alexander spun around, his expression cold.


Cedric's gaze locked onto him, and his voice was sharp. "Earlier, you questioned whether Daniela was my property and why I had any say in her life. Let me set you straight. Daniela is not my property. But from this moment on, anyone who dares to harm her will have to answer to me first. Don't even thnk about dragging the Harper family back into her life. I couldn't care less who they are-every one of them will deal with me. And as for you-don't come here acting like you suddenly care about her.You had your chance when she was your wife. Now? It's too late for any of that."


Cedric tilted his head, his eyes briefly turning upward to the security camera overhead. Without breaking his intense stare, he turned to Ryan and gave a firm command. "Upload the footage to every platform and make it the hottest topic everywhere. I want the world to hear this. Daniela has someone who cares for her, someone who will fight for her. From now on,she'll have the life she deserves. Every tear she sheds will be one of happiness, not from putting up with scum like this."



As soon as he finished speaking, Ryan and the rest of the group erupted into applause.
Alexander's expression contorted in embarrassment as he turned and hobbled off.


That evening, social media went wild. The servers nearly crashed from the overwhelming surge of traffic.


The leading headline, clear and direct, declared,"Daniela Has Someone Who Cares About Her!"


Those words were enough to set off a worldwide storm, accumulating billions of views and a flood of comments.


"This could be right out of a romance novel. His protectiveness is off the charts-total CEO-in-love energy."


"Did Cedric just declare his love for Daniela to the world? This has to be a confession, right? Please tell me I'm not imagining tis!"


"Don't try to tell me this is just a 'friendship' thing-l won't buy it!"


"This has to be love! OMG, I'm melting. I believe in love again because of this!"


"I'm in tears. Daniela's been through so much, but now, finally, she has someone by her side. Cedric and Daniela are my new favorite couple!"


"Daniela truly deserves this. Her father never loved her, her mother passed away, her ex-husband was cruel, and her stepsister stabbed her in the back,but now she has Cedric. Every ounce of suffering she endured brought her to this point. It was all worth it!"


"Wasn't Cedric supposed to be the 'cold,untouchable CEO'? The 'stone-faced, allergic-to-women' type? Seems like he was just waiting for Daniela all along!"


"OMG, where is Daniela? Why hasn't she said anything yet? I need some updates now!"


As the comments flooded in, the hashtag took over every platform.


Yet,Daniela stayed quiet and offered no reply.


Meanwhile, the Bennett family became the target of public mockery, their reputation being dragged through the dirt.


Richard spent the whole night compulsively checking the second trending topic.


"Alexander Takes a Hit and Does Nothing?"


The comments were harsh, ripping into both Alexander and the Bennett family.


"Ugh, this guy is revolting! Alexander, was it? What does the Bennett family even do? Whatever it is, I'm done with them for good!"


"What a joke! Daniela literally told him the shop was on basement level one. But instead of clearing things up with Joyce, this spineless guy let the whole misunderstanding blow up. Now Daniela's been slapped, cut off from her family, and here comes Alexander, acting like some big shot, offering to pay for Joyce's shop rent. Where was this 'generosity'when it actually counted?"


"I watched the surveillance footage and almost lost my lunch. Alexander, are you seriously this shameless? You completely overlooked Daniela when she was just a regular woman. But now that she's the CEO of Elite Lux, you're suddenly crawling out of the woodwork? And offering to take her to dinner? What,you think she needs your charity?"


"Oh my God, check this out-I just found a clip where Richard straight up says Daniela wasn't 'good enough' to marry into the Bennett family. And he said it in public! Richard's been dismissing her for years,acting like she'd only ever be some pretty, useless trophy wife!"


"It all makes sense now. Elite Lux just bought the largest plot of land in the Northern District to develop a commercial center. The Bennetts are in construction and renovation. Now they're clearly desperate to collaborate with her That's why they're back, offering dinner invites!"


Underneath all these furious comments, one word kept popping up, bold and loud. "Scumbag!"

 
Richard stood by the tall windows in his study, his back straight, fists tightly clenched behind him.


He took a deep breath,trying to steady the growing storm of anger inside him.


He spun around to face Alexander, his tone hard and unforgiving. "I don't care what it takes. You will fix your relationship with Daniela. You'll make sure we secure that partnership with Phillips Group. Do you understand? The North District project is vital,and we can't afford to lose it! And what's going on with those trending topics? They've been live for hours,making this family look like fools! Are you so incompetent that you can't even get them taken down?"1


Alexander closed his eyes briefly. "I've tried.The trending topics were pinned by a hacker. Even the admins can't take them down."



The sharp sound of a slap rang out through the room.


"Idiot!" Richard spat. "You better listen carefully. Do whatever it takes. Meet with Daniela. Clean up this mess. Lock in that partnership."
###Chapter 58 Not A Single Word




Alexander clenched his jaw, his face clouded with frustration. "Got it."


As he stepped out of the house, he checked his phone. There was nothing-no calls, no messages from the Harper family.


Not a single word of reassurance.


It felt as though they hadn't noticed the storm brewing.


But Alexander knew better. The trending topics were everywhere, the entire city was calling him a scumbag-there was no way the Harper family hadn't seen it.


He'd tried to help Joyce, even offering to cover her shop rent, and this was how things turned out. He'd been publicly humiliated, made to look like a fool,and yet, the Harper family hadn't said a word. Not a single person came to his defense.


All those warm, loving "Alexander" greetings they used to throw his way? They were nothing but empty words.


The realization hit him hard, and a cold,uncomfortable feeling settled deep in his chest.


He looked at his secretary. "Get me information on what Daniela's been up to lately. I need to meet with her."


The secretary gave a nod. "Got it, sir."


Meanwhile, Caiden sat in the living room, unruffled,while Joyce cried loudly beside him.


"It's all my fault! Alexander only got tangled in this because of me!" Joyce wailed. "He was helping me with that shop, and now everyone's attacking him.Dad, you have to get Harper Group's PR team to step in and help him. They're destroying him online!"


Caiden kept watering his plants, his face showing no emotion. "Is that so?" he muttered without looking up.


"Yes!" Joyce's frustration spiked. "Dad, haven't you seen what's trending?"


Caiden didn't even glance up. He casually snipped away at a leaf with his pruning scissors, taking his time, completely unbothered. The truth was, he couldn't care less. He was Daniela's father, and nothing could change that, no matter what was happening around him. And honestly, he wasn't keen on jumping into the chaos. Some people online had already started calling him a "terrible father." If he spoke up to defend Alexander now, wouldn't that only open the door for even more criticism?


Caiden sighed deeply, then finally turned to face Joyce."Getting roasted online happens to everyone.Alexander's still young. A bit of criticism won't kill him."


Joyce's frustration boiled over. "Dad! You're just scared, aren't you? Scared of Daniela! Scared of what people are saying online!" Caiden's eyes shot towards her, but Joyce wasn't backing down. "And I bet you're scared of Cedric too,right?"


For a brief moment, something flashed in Caiden's eyes, but he quickly hid it behind a stoic expression.However, Joyce didn't miss it, and with a sharp gesture, she pointed at him. "I knew it! You're afraid of Cedric!"


Caiden let out a small sigh, pursing his lips as he stood there for a mnoment. "Yeah, I'm scared. Now what? Who isn't terrified of Cedric in Olisvine? If Alexander wasn't afraid, why didn't he fight back when Cedric hit him? And now you wvant me, with my old, fragile body, to step in and fight for him? You should be ashamed!"


Caiden dismissed her with a wave, clearly fed up with her complaining.


As he turned back to his plants, a strange thought slowly crept into his mind.


Daniela had never been like this. She never cried for hours or threw tantrums. In fact, she reminded him so much of her mother-strong, unshakable, like wild grass that stood firm even in the harshest storms.



Caiden stopped, his pruning scissors frozen in mid-air.


Maybe he had overstepped with that slap. It had been more forceful than he had meant it to be.


Katrina had been sitting nearby, watching the whole thing unfold. That morning, Bennett Group's stock had taken a dive, trading was halted, and the online boycott showed no sign of slowing down.


She blinked, her mind working. She noticed the brief flicker of regret in Caiden's eyes and made up her mind.



Slowly walking towards him, she spoke in a calm,reassuring voice. "Caiden, that slap was a bit too much."


Caiden turned to look at her, a mix of annoyance and regret on his face. "You're right. Why didn't you step in and stop me?"


He sighed deeply, massaging the back of his neck."I'm not even sure if Daniela will really go through with cutting ties. She's running Elite Lux now,and if she turns her back on us, it'll be a huge loss for me!"


Katrina nodded with understanding. "Exactly! And Jerry's the one to blame. He kept fueling the fire,making everything worse. If it hadn't been for him, it wouldn't have escalated so badly. You know how Daniela lost her mother young, and I've always treated her like my own. Seeing you hit her yesterday really hurt. Let's not make this worse. How about we go over today, bring her a gift, and apologize? At the end of the day, we're family. There's no need to let other people see us fighting and give them something to talk about."


Caiden paused, his brow furrowing in thought. "But I'm her father. If I apologize, won't everyone laugh at me? It'll be a disaster if people find out."


Katrina gave him a comforting smile. "Not at all.People will look at you and think, 'Wow, Mr. Harper is such a loving parent-so forgiving, so kind-hearted,not holding any grudges against his daughter.'"


Caiden's scowl eased just a bit.


Sensing she was getting through to him,Katrina pressed on, a playful edge to her voice. "Daniela has always been so understanding. If she doesn't forgive us, I'll get down on my knees and beg her for it."


Caiden's eyes widened, his voice turning sharp and cold once more. "She wouldn't dare! Who does she think she is? Just us showing up to apologize is already a huge honor to her! If she expects anything more, she's completely out of her mind. You know what? Forget the apology. We'll just send a fruit basket instead. That should be more than enough.It's just Daniela-we're not dealing with royalty here!"



As he spoke, his anger bubbled up, spilling over into muttered curses.



A faint smile crossed Katrina's lips, pleased that she had guided him exactly where she wanted.
Joyce, who had been silently watching the entire exchange, stared wide-eyed. Then, she gave Katrina a thumbs-up.



That was impressive!


Daniela sank into a deep slumber, yet peace seemed out of reach.



Her dreams pulled her back to that unforgettable summer afternoon.


She was just five years old, her small hands tightly gripping a doll. The sun blazed overhead, and the thick summer heat filled the air. The sharp sound of something heavy crashing to the ground rang out behind her.


Daniela, still holding her doll, turned around in curiosity. As she glanced over her shoulder, her gaze locked onto the horrifying sight of her mother's lifeless body. Blood was streaming from her mother's eyes, and her form lay twisted on the ground.


The sunlight reflected off the fresh blood, turning the ground a bright shade of red. It spead out like a strange,unsettling field of roses.


Daniela remained still, silent, unable to comprehend.Medics arrived, followed by the police.


She remembered Caiden sitting nearby, histears flowing as he played the part of the heartbroken husband. Then the rain began to fall, soaking the pavement. The blood mingled with the water,spreading out like roses in full bloom, only this time with a violent, unsettling force.


Her mother was gone, without so much as a word,not even a note or a farewell.


For years, Daniela had been tormented by that day.Why had her mother jumped?


Why? Why had she left nothing behind?


Was it because she was just as unworthy in her mother's eyes as she had always been in Caiden's?
###Chapter 59 Heartache





Tears slipped quietly down Daniela's face,her eyes shut tightly against whatever torment was chasing her in her dreams.



Cedric stood motionless beside the bed, his brows knit together in concern.


Josie walked in, looked over at Daniela, then turned to Cedric. "It looks like Ms. Harper is having a nightmare."


Cedric froze, his body tense, a sudden wave of shock rushing through him. He turned to Josie, his voice cutting through the air like ice. "What did you just say?"


"It never crossed my mind before, but now l've come to understand that Ms. Harper has a habit of sleepwalking. It doesn't follow any predictable pattern, but it always occurs in enclosed areas. One night, her bedroom door was left slightly open. I woke up and found her just sitting there in the dark living room. I tried calling her name, but she didn't even flinch, so I decided to sit down with her. After nearly an hour, she got up, walked back to her room,and lay down like nothing had happened. I followed behind, just to be sure everything was fine,but she showed no signs of being aware during the entire ordeal. The following morning, I brought it up, but she had no memory of having sleepwalked the night before. She said it's been a thing since she was just five years old. She told me, 'If you ever see me sleepwalking, don't freak out. Just make sure the doors and windows are locked. I usually stop when l bump into something.' I asked her if she'd ever gone to a doctor about it, but she just laughed and brushed it off. She mentioned that her childhood had been chaotic, and even her mother knew about it but didn't bother doing anything. Eventually, she just learned to deal with it and didn't think much of it anymore."


Josie paused for a moment, then spoke again."Afterwards, I made it a habit to check on her. Some nights, I'd wake up and feel the need to look in.There was one night I heard her crying softly. It was faint and restrained, as though she was trying to keep it hidden. When I looked in, she was still asleep.But she was crying. It was gut-wrenching to witness."


She shifted her gaze from Daniela to Cedric."The same thing is happening again."


Cedric's hands curled into tight fists, and his entire frame was shaking uncontrollably.


Caiden had known all along, but he had turned a blind eye.


She had cried so painfully in her sleep before, just like she was now.


Her words struck him like a punch to the gut, each syllable driving the blade of guilt further into his chest. It felt like his chest might cave in fromn the sheer intensity of his feelings, his breathing ragged,as though he was drowning in it all.

Noticing his pain, Josie offered quiet reassurance. "Maybe it's just the aftermath of yesterday. Facing such cold treatment from her own family-it's more than anyone should endure. But things will improve.She's awvay from the Harpers now. She has Elite Lux,and, most importantly, she has you. Give it time, and she'll heal.Her future will shine."


She then slipped out of the room.


Lillian shifted slightly at the faint sound of the door closing. She opened her eyes briefly, glanced at Daniela, still sleeping soundly, and sank back into the couch. It wasn't long before her light snores resumed.



Cedric's focus turned back to Daniela. He observed the way the crease in her brow, which had been so tense moments earlier, was beginning to relax.


The gentle rhythm of Lillian's snores seemed to calm her, as if a quiet part of her mind registered Lillian's comforting presence.


Cedric hesitated for a second, then grabbed his phone and dialed his friend, Shaun Rodney. "Hey,
Shaun, quick question-do you know how someone can make themselves snore?"


Shaun asked, "What's this about? Did yourgirlfriend say you snore? But didn't you have that sleep test done ages ago? You're not even a snorer!"


"I'm aware I don't snore. But I want to figure out how to do it. Any suggestions?"


"Is this some kind of snoring kink? Does your girlfriend actually like snoring? Look, I'm a doctor, not some snore expert. Oh, and by the way, you were trending yesterday. Is this about Daniela? Is she the one who's into snoring?"


Cedric didn't waste time reading the rest. He exited the chat, opened his browser, and typed "how to snore" into the search bar. Just as he was about to press enter, a quiet knock came from the door.His secretary stepped in carefully, sparing a quick look at Daniela, who was still sound asleep in the bed,before speaking in a hushed tone. "Mr. Phillips, the Harpers have arrived."


Cedric's expression darkened, and he got to his feet.


The secretary paused, her discomfort clearly showing. "There's a group of reporters with them.After what happened yesterday, it looks like they're trying to do damage control, saying they came to apologize. Katrina's really laying it on thick-crying her eyes out, tears and snot all over the place. If Ms.Harper doesn't make an appearance, the media might twist it to make her look haughty or ungrateful.Elite Lux is still patching up its reputation domestically. Sir, it might be best toask Ms. Harper how she wants to deal with this."



It was clear Caiden and his group were aiming to put on a show.


A misstep in handling this could spiral into a public relations nightmare.


Earlier that morning, the Bennett family's stock had hit rock bottom, erasing tens of millions in value.During a media interview, Richard's face betrayed his growing anger and disappointment.

The secretary, ever the careful observer, could feel the gravity of the moment hanging over them.


He stole a quick glance at Cedric, who was not officially part of Daniela's life yet.


When Daniela's eyes fluttered open, the first thing she noticed was Cedric's slightly exasperated expression. Under his eyes, there was a trace of weariness,like he hadn't gotten much rest.


She propped herself up on one elbow and flashed him a small smile. "You're not heading to work today?"


She didn't bother questioning his presence.


Cedric's stern look eased a bit."Iam."


Daniela glanced at the clock on the wall, raising an eyebrow in surprise. "You're running late. It's already past nine."


"Hmm," Cedric replied with indifference.


Daniela didn't think much of his short reply and went to the bathroom to freshen up. A few minutes later,she came out and saw Cedric still sitting inthe chair.


After a brief pause, she asked, "Would you like to have breakfast with me?"


Without a second thought, Cedric said,"Sure."


Daniela stared at him, surprised. "I didn't mean it-1was just being polite."


Unbothered, Cedric shrugged and replied, "Perfect.I'm starving. Let's eat."
###Chapter 60 His Protection





Daniela's lips curved into a smile, and she was nearly out the door when the secretary darted forward, his gesture filled with urgency as though he was bursting to speak-only for Cedric's icy glare to silence him instantly.


He dropped his gaze and clamped his lips shut without a word.



Cedric turned to Daniela, his demeanor composed yet assertive. "Forget everything else; breakfast first."



At the dining table, Cedric and Daniela had breakfast silently. Nearby, the secretary lingered, his expression contorted with worry and indecision.


Shifting her gaze between Cedric and the secretary,Daniela probed, "Is there something I should know?"


The secretary glanced at Cedric, his eyes pleading 
for permission to disclose.


It wasn't until Daniela placed her utensils down that the secretary gathered enough courage to speak,his words spilling out in a hurried flood. "Ms. Harper,your father, along with Katrina, Joyce, and reporters from eight media companies, are waiting downstairs.They are adamant about meeting with you."



As this news settled, Daniela's smile waned ever so slightly. She reached for a napkin, dabbing at her lips thoughtfully, then turned to Cedric with a mischievous grin. "Is this what's been troubling you all morning? You really do care too much. Rest assured,I can handle them."


A barely audible hum rippled through Cedric's throat.


As the elevator carried them downwards, Daniela assumed Cedric would make his way back to his office.



The first floor lobby was swarming with reporters,while the manager struggled valiantly to impose some semblance of order. Cedric took a decisive step forward. His countenance was shadowy and intense, mnirroring the ominous clouds of a gathering storm, and the loud hubbub promptly hushed to a whispoer.


Even the Harper family appeared to diminish in his imposing presence. Heads dipped. The murmur of voices tapered off.


Cedric remained utterly wordless. The quiet he held spoke volumes on its own.


Poised protectively close to Daniela, with his hands relaxed in his pockets, his gaze sharply swept the crowd. His eyes, icy and penetrating, sliced through the crowd, challenging anyone bold enough to hold his stare.



His silent stance broadcast a stark warning-challenge her, and face the consequences.


Although Cedric's commitment to safeguard Daniela was public knowledge, witnessing his assertive protection firsthand was quite the spectacle.

It radiated a fierce protectiveness laced with unshakable dominance-unyielding and dangerous.


A palpable tension choked the air, causing everyone in his line of sight to gulp with apprehension.


Caiden felt a surge of panic. When the hell would Cedric stop clinging to Daniela like a damn parasite?His constant vigilance over her was throwing a wrench into their plans.


Katrina stepped back too. She was all too familiar with Cedric's persona-an untouchable tyrant with an ego to match, and absolutely no room for compromise.


Cedric stood his ground, a picture of tranquility yet undeniably commanding, his gaze downcast, his face a mask of inscrutability.


The dark circles under his eyes hinted at a lack of sleep, lending a sharpness to his features. Breaking the tense quiet, he finally spoke. "You've got something to say? Well, I'm right here-spit it out already."
His voice was smooth, almost deceptively soft, as if he were consciously tempering his words to keep the peace. Yet, beneath his calm exterior, signs of fatigue and underlying irritation were palpable,straining the nerves of everyone present.


The group opposite him paused, their anxious glances flickering from one face to another,none daring to break the silence.


Feeling the tension build, Katrina leaned closer to Caiden and discreetly nudged his arm, her gesture a silent plea for him to speak up.


Caiden cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Phillips, I noticed that today is Monday, and the financial news mentioned you're to finalize next year's contract with one of the world's top multinational corporations.You..."


What he really meant to ask-but couldn't muster the boldness to state outright-was if Cedric was supposed to be on his way already.


Instead, he framed it as an evasive, roundabout inquiry, hoping Cedric would pick up on the subtle cue. "You're not on a tight schedule, by any chance?"



Cedric, with his hands placed in the pockets of his sharp, tailored black suit, slightly tilted his head. His consistent choice of dark attire only served to deepen the formidable aura that clung to him.


Even the slightest flicker of a smirk was enough to snuff out any semblance of defiance.


When he finally spoke, his voice was deep and coarse, cutting through the thick air. "Your concern is noted,Mr.Harper."


His answer was concise-courteous, yet noncommittal.



Caiden suppressed his irritation, not daring to contest.



The air in the room thickened with tension, the silence so heavy that it felt almost suffocating.Eventually, Daniela shattered the quiet, addressing Cedric in a poised yet assertive tone. "Everything's fine here. If you've got other matters to deal with,don't worry about this-l've got it covered."


Cedric drew his hands from his pockets, his voice now soft and soothing, contrasting sharply with his earlier domineering presence.


"No rush. The signing has been rescheduled for later this afternoon."


Caiden, Katrina, and the assembled reporters all inhaled sharply in shock.


This meeting was no ordinary affair-it was a crucial discussion about an international contract worth billions of dollars. And Cedric had rescheduled it as if it were a mere inconvenience.



That very morning, a throng of media representatives and top-tier executives had converged outside the Phillips Group headquarters, all eager to witness the landmark signing of this colossal agreement. Yet now, Cedric had postponed it.
His boldness left everyone present utterly dumbfounded. Amid their astonishment, it became glaringly clear. Daniela held a place in his life so vital,no one could ever hope to fill it.


The gravity of this insight rendered the crowd deathly quiet, with nobody daring to break the silence.



"What seems to be the issue? Is it really that difficult to speak up?" Cedric grasped a chair, scraping it across the floor with a grating sound, and took a seat near the security station. Propping his chin on his hand, he leaned forward with a challenging look."Look, I'm merely here as an observer. Proceed and engage with the CEO of Elite Lux. Act as if I'm not even here."



Silence enveloped the lobby once more.


He wanted them to ignore his presence? The notion seemed absurd.


The icy, piercing sharpness of his stare was palpable.

Unless they suddenly went blind, ignoring Cedric's overbearing presence was completely out of the question.
###Chapter 61 Sweetheart


The reporters exchanged uneasy looks, unsure whether they should stay or leave the scene.

Even Caiden, who had come in with confidence, now seemed eager to leave.

But Katrina wasn't ready to let it go. She subtly tugged at Caiden's sleeve.

She'd dropped nearly twenty thousand to bring these reporters in. If they left now, it would be a total waste of all that money.

Besides, they hadn't yet accomplished what they came for.

Katrina leaned in and whispered to Caiden, "Do you want to fix things with Daniela or not?"

Caiden bit his lip, clearly wanting to say something, but after catching a glimpse of Cedric's expression,he held back.

"Daniela, I shouldn't have slapped you yesterday. I'm here to apologize. Katrina and I got up early today and made this soup just for you. Eat it, and let's put everything behind us. Yesterday was a mistake. Please don't hold it against me."

The reporters behind him were snapping photos, capturing every word and every exaggerated gesture.

Katrina smiled warmly. Rather than passing the insulated lunchbox to the secretary behind Daniela,she opened it herself.

The rich scent of soup filled the air, and the reporters began snapping shots of it.

"Come on, darling, just take one little sip, and we can forget all about what happened. Take a look around-there's a whole crowd here watching us. Even though you're the CEO of Elite Lux now, it wouldn't hurt to show a bit of respect to your dad. And as for those things you said yesterday about cutting ties, those shouldn't be said again. Do you have any idea how much it hurt your father? He sighed all night. Look at him; he's even got a white hair now, all thanks to the stress."
  Her words depicted Caiden as a caring, regretful father who deeply regretted losing his temper and slapping his daughter.

Caiden didn't hesitate to jump in, his voice dripping with self-importance. "Daniela, listen to me-you have to realize that everything I do is for your benefit. You're my daughter. If I don't look out for you, who else will? When you mentioned cutting ties yesterday, do you even understand how deeply that cut me?"

He stared at Daniela's unfeeling, distant expression, then quickly shut his eyes for a moment, cursing her silently in his mind.

He reached out to her, his insincere smile growing wider as he spoke. "Come here, sweetheart.Did I hurt you too much yesterday? Let me check."

Daniela took a step back. That look-intense and unforgiving-made a knot form in Caiden's gut.

It was a look he recognized instantly. The same one her mother had given him years ago.

Cold. Unforgiving. Relentless. A headache. Just like her late mother.

Caiden knew Daniela wouldn't fall for threats or compliments. But did it really matter? With all the reporters here,what could she do?

He'd already pretended to regret his actions. If Daniela dared to challenge him, the next day's headlines would be shouting, "Daniela Harper: The Ungrateful Daughter."

Once that label stuck, not even the top PR team at Elite Lux would be able to fix her reputation.

Reputation was the core of any business. No one would back a company led by a CEO accused of being cold-hearted toward her own family.

A surge of triumph rushed through Caiden. Being her father gave him the upper hand.

He straightened his jacket, his chest puffing out with newfound confidence.

And Cedric? Who cared? He was just another man. Sure, Cedric might scare some people, but not Caiden.
Cedric wasn't invincible, and today's little showdown made that crystal clear.
A self-satisfied grin crept across Caiden's face.

Katrina, noticing his smug expression, gave his arm a gentle tug, a reminder to tone it down. Caiden quickly wiped the smugness off his face and replaced it with a mask of warmth and concern. He turned back to Daniela and said, "Sweetheart, can you just forgive me?"

Daniela stood motionless, her cold, unflinching stare locked on Caiden.

It was the first time Caiden had used that word in years, not since she was five.

Sweetheart.

For years, she had convinced herself that she wasn't worthy-like she hadn't done enough to deserve his love.

She believed that if she worked harder, achieved more, and made herself irreplaceable, maybe, just maybe,she would finally hear him say "sweetheart."

She had waited for that word endlessly. Even when she topped her class, it never came.

When she skipped grades and joined the elite gifted program, still nothing.

And when she passed her exams at fifteen, becoming the youngest doctoral candidate in her field, it remained absent.

She had finally accepted that, no matter what she achieved, she would never hear that word come from her father, not in this lifetime.

And now, there it was. Caiden, with a forced grin, had finally said it.

The irony was almost too much to bear.

A bitter laugh escaped Daniela.

Caiden's eyes gleamed as he turned to the reporters, beaming while pointing at Daniela. "See? She's smiling. That means she's forgiven me," he said, his focus entirely on how the reporters would see him.

Katrina's face lit up, spotting her chance. "Sweetheart, you're right-your father and I messed up yesterday.
We shouldn't have put that pressure on you. The mix-up is all our fault. Joyce shouldn't have acted like that."

But Joyce couldn't stay silent and whined in objection, "Mom!"

Ignoring Joyce's outburst, Katrina kept her calm and overly sweet demeanor, turning back to Daniela. "You know, Joyce really looks up to you, Daniela. You've been her role model. But, you know how she is. She struggles with everything, poor thing. At her age, still staying at home, it's been such a concern for all of us."

Joyce stared at Katrina, her mouth hanging open, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

Even Caiden furrowed his brow, confused by Katrina's sudden criticism of Joyce.

But Daniela saw through it. Katrina wasn't just throwing Joyce under the bus-this was the beginning of her real request.

And, as expected, Katrina didn't waste any time before unveiling her true agenda.

"We're still family, right? And as family, we're supposed tohelp one another. Joyce is young and has a lot to learn.Why not take her under your wing? Let her join you at Elite Lux, help her gain some hands-on experience. She looks up to you so much, Daniela, and has always admired everything you've built with Elite Lux.Just offer her a director's role. It's no big deal-just a way for her to dip her toes in the water. I promise you, she'll give it her all."

At this, Joyce's face lit up instantly. The pout and the anger from before vanished in an instant. In their place, her lips curved into a smug, victorious smile as she looked at Daniela.

She was already imagining all the perks that came with such an impressive title.

Yes,she thought, tossing aside the idea of running a tinyclothing store-becoming a director at Elite Lux?Now that was real prestige and allure.

She was determined to become a director at Elite Lux.

Caiden was just as thrilled by Katrina's suggestion. Her plan was pure genius. If Joyce could figure out how to earn money like Daniela, he wouldn't have to worry about relying on Daniela's generosity as he aged. Joyce could support the family just as easily.

Grinning with excitement, Caiden quickly turned to Daniela and added, "Yes, exactly. Just give her a director's role."
###Chapter 62 Counterattack


Katrina was worried Daniela might decline. Her voice grew louder. "It's merely a director position, Daniela!You're now the CEO of Elite Lux, powerful and established. Are you truly reluctant to bestow such a minor role upon your own sister? Or could it be that you're worried Joyce might eclipse you?"

Daniela's lips twisted into a subtle smirk, her poise undisturbed. "Worried? Hardly."

Katrina's eyes sparkled with unexpected hope. Lately, she had become accustomed to encountering nothing but roadblocks and hadn't anticipated Daniela's apparent willingness to cooperate, especially in the presence of the press.

Beside Daniela, her secretary's brow furrowed, her gaze shifting between her boss and the eager journalists, poised to intervene.

However, Daniela continued, "A director position? It's hardly a big deal. I've only just come back to the country, and while I'm still laying my groundwork here, if my family insists on putting someone in the company, I'll graciously accept. After all, whether they share my blood or not, how could I possibly refuse?"

As her words hung in the air, Katrina's smile stiffened on her lips. The underlying sarcasm lacing Daniela's remarks did not go unnoticed, piercing her with its intended sting.

Keeping her poised and gracious air intact, Daniela carried on. "Elite Lux has been a bastion of meritocracy from the start-that's well understood. But now, my stepmother wants to dismantle years of our foundational values with her shallow speeches. Often, they talk about the challenges of being a stepmother,yet they seldom mention the trials of being a stepdaughter."

At these words, Katrina's complexion grew noticeably lighter.

Turning her attention to Joyce with a slight tilt of her head, indicating genuine curiosity, Daniela asked,"Joyce, could you share your educational background with us?"

Without hesitation,Joyce replied, "I left school before finishing high school."
Daniela regarded her with a reflective expression, her voice tinged with courteous sarcasm. "A high school dropout,then."

She lightly tapped her chin, pretending to mull over the information. "That indeed suggests a unique set of skills. I'll have to consider carefully how we might utilize your talents."

Suddenly, a look of revelation crossed her face as she turned her eyes towards Caiden.

"Dad," she called out with exaggerated sweetness.

The overly affectionate term caused Caiden to tense visibly. "Yes?"

"Could Harper Group possibly make room for Joyce? She is your daughter, cherished deeply. Surely,elevating her to the role of president wouldn't be too difficult, would it? In fact, placing her merely as a director in my company might not even do justice to her remarkablecapabilities."

Daniela's words had barely finished resonating when soft laughter began to fill the lobby.

Turning, she caught Cedric trying to suppress his amusement.

With a mock sternness, Daniela admonished him.. Phillips, I'd appreciate it if you could keep up that dignified demeanor of yours."

Cedric shrugged with a sly grin. "Alright, I wwill."

The unusual rapport between them caught everyone off guard.Yet, Daniela was not one to let the moment slide without comment. She turned to Caiden and remarked in a humble tone, "Dad, I've always known I'm not the brightest-certainly not enough to gain your approval. Yesterday, you were so upset that you struck me. Truth be told, I was as restless as you were last night. After much reflection, I've realized something crucial:with my modest abilities, I'm simply not suited to take over Harper Group. So please, don't burden yourself with thoughts of having another child with my stepmother. Just give the reins to Joyce. She truly is your pride and joy. As for me, I'll bow out gracefully. I have no intention of vying for the family's legacy any longer."

The reporters marveled at her generosity.
Daniela lowered her head slightly, exhaling a deep sigh. "That slap really put things into perspective for me.I wouldn't dream of contending for anything anymore."

Her declaration ignited a surge of outrage among the reporters. The crowd was outraged. What twisted father would drive his daughter to turn her back on her birthright?

As Caiden and Katrina stood there, their shock was palpable.

Caiden's face twisted into a scowl as he shot back, "No way! Joyce can't possibly run Harper Group!"

Daniela retorted, "Dad, aren't you a bit old to cling to power? It's somewhat unbecoming, don't you think?"

Her words struck hard, and all eyes darted towards Caiden.

Even Joyce joined in, her voice tinged with a hopeful whine. "Come on, Dad, give me another shot at the company!"

In a moment of frustration, Caiden sharply tugged his hand away from Joyce's grip. His patience fractured like brittle glass.

With fury in his voice, he bellowed, "How dare you even suggest that? I entrusted you with the finance department, and you squandered over a million! When I moved you to marketing, you drove away a key client-one we've maintained for more than a decade! And in public relations, you ended up entangled with some junior intern! What more can I possibly trust you with? Each moment you spend at Harper Group only hastens our downfall!"

Daniela was all too familiar with what had transpired.

Katrina, ever the strategist, had long been persuading Caiden to allow Joyce to"ather experience"at the company, secretly dreading that Harper Group might someday fall into Daniela's more capable hands.

And the outcome? In less than a week, Joyce had cost the company over ten million.

Ever since the incident, Caiden had been steeped in unease. He found it impossible to include Joyce in any client interactions at the company. During one unfortunate meeting, she inadvertently caused a staggering loss of over five million dollars.
At a dinner gathering, she mistakenly addressed Mr. Bradley as "Mr. Chavez," and thenconfused the real Mr. Chavez with their competitor, Mr. Norris. That epic fail spread like wildfire in Olisvine, making them the butt of every joke for an entire year.

Consequently, Caiden felt compelled to confine Joyce at home, pampering her like a cherished but sheltered princess, safely away from the business's operations.

The tale was that the client involved in that fateful meeting still harbored resentment. Despite Caiden's efforts to mend fences by sending several cases of exquisite wine, the relationship remained strained.

To Katrina, this mess was the kind of shame that refused to die, always gnawing at her.

Recently, following a flopped deal to secure a new shop location, Katrina decided to make her daughter a director in Daniela's company. And Caiden was more than willing to cooperate. After all, they clearly thought Daniela was stupid enough to accept Joyce.

Daniela remained unruffled, casually dropping a remark before receding into the background, her eyes observing the ensuing tumult.

Joyce latched onto Caiden's armn, her voice laced with sharp impatience. "Dad! Did you hear that? Daniela just renounced her claimto Harper Group! It should be mine now! You won't be around forever,you know!"

Even Katrina, usually so composed, was caught off guard by the bluntness of the statement.

Reporters leaped into action, their pens dancing across notepads, cameras capturing every moment.

Surrounded and overwhelmed, Caiden struggled to navigate the relentless flood of inquiries. Joyce continued to cling to his arm, her pleas tinged with desperation. Katrina, gripped by fear that Daniela might reconsider her decision and stake a claim, added her voice to the growing clamor.

Meanwhile,Daniela had retreated to the fringes of the chaos.

She stood apart, her expression cool and distant, silently observing the spectacle unfold.
###Chapter 63 A Legally Binding Termination


Caiden had reached his breaking point.

With a thunderous shout, he barked, "Enough!" Both Joyce and Katrina recoiled instinctively, taken aback by the sudden outburst.

The reporters, however, remained unfazed. One of them pressed further, "Mr. Harper, are you genuinely considering Joyce as your successor in the future?"

Caiden rubbed his forehead, trying to ease the pounding ache in his head. But then, from the corner of his eye, he noticed Katrina's piercing gaze locked onto him. A cold shiver ran through him.

In her eyes, Caiden saw the same ambition and greed-cold, sharp, and relentless-that he had once seen in Daniela's late mother. That familiar, haunting look had tortured him for years, like a recurring nightmare.

And now, that very gaze was back, this time in the eyes of the woman he loved most.

Caiden felt overwhelmed, his mind struggling to process it. He blinked fast, hoping to shake the image from his mind. When he looked back, Katrina had already dropped her eyes, tears running down her cheeks, her face filled with sorrow and grief.

With a shaky exhale, Caiden tried to convince himself it was just a figment of his imagination.

He forced himself to regain focus, straightening up as he turned to face the reporters. "This is a private family matter. We appreciate your interest, but this isn't the right time or place. Please leave. Thank you."

Realizing they weren't going to get anything further, the reporters began to disperse, given that Katrina had secretly bribed them.

In no time, the atmosphere grew quiet.

Caiden remained at the center of the lobby, his face clouded with frustration. He was seething inside-today, Daniela had made a mockery of him, embarrassed him in front of everyone, and he couldn't stand it.
He spoke sharply, his tone icy. "Daniela, just answer me one thing. Will you allow your sister to work at Elite Lux or not?"

Without missing a beat, Katrina chimed in, "It's not just any position, of course. We're talking about a director's role; something that reflects her status."

Caiden slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. He was about to light it when he felt Cedric's cold stare fix on him. The weight of Cedric's gaze made his hand hesitate. With a sigh, he begrudgingly tucked the cigarette back into his pocket.

Holding back his frustration, Caiden managed a smile and turned to Cedric. "Mr. Phillips, this is a private family issue. You're a busy man, I'm sure you..."

He made a subtle gesture, signaling Cedric to take his leave.

But Cedric leaned back, exuding an air of easy defiance. "Oh, don't worry about me. I've got all the time in the world. Go on, pretend I'm not even here."

Caiden felt his eye twitch involuntarily. He thought about redirectingthe conversation elsewhere, but before he could offer the idea, Daniela interjected, "I'm extremely busy. If you have something to say, say it here."

Feeling cornered, Caiden bit back his growing irritation. He had no choice but to proceed. "Joyce is your sister.You're the CEO of Elite Lux, with numerous positions at your disposal. Surely, it wouldn't be hard to find her a place-a director's role, nothing too extreme."

Daniela locked eyes with the man in front of her.

Once,she had seen him as her father, the one person closest to her, the one she had trusted without question.

But now, as she looked at him, anger had faded, leaving behind something much deeper.

When disappointment cuts that deep, it consumes all other feelings.

Daniela spoke quietly, as if offering Caiden, and herself, one last chance to hold on to whatever was left of their family bond.
"I can set up a position for Joyce within thecompany. In her department, she'll have full authority.Once I make a promise, I always keep it. You don't have to worry."

As she finished, her secretary moved forward, but Daniela raised her hand, signaling that she had everything handled.

The secretary hesitated, glancing quickly at Cedric, who was still sitting nearby. His calm eyes were fixed on Daniela, his face showing quiet trust and solid support.

Across from her, both Katrina and Caiden wore expressions of visible excitement.

The idea of Joyce, once just a shopkeeper, now rising to a position of power within Elite Lux, was something they had never even dared to imagine. It was a win they were eager to celebrate.

Moreover, with Joyce under Daniela's wing, if anything went wrong with her down the line, they'd have someone to answer for it.

Maybe Joyce could pick up some useful skills, or even better,"borrow" some of Elite Lux's trade secrets.Perhaps starting her own company one day wouldn't be such an unrealistic goal after all.

At the very least, she would have some stability, and if any problems arose, they could always point the finger at Daniela.

Caiden's grin stretched even wider, his relief clear as day. He couldn't hide his satisfaction.

"But I do have one condition," Daniela said slowly, her tone calm and even as she locked eyes with the three greedy smiles staring back at her.

Caiden and Katrina were absolutely thrilled.

"Of course, go ahead and tell us what it is," Caiden said, practically bouncing with excitement.

Katrina quickly added, "As long as it'snot too much to ask, we'll agree to it. Daniela, at last, you're doing something that truly matters for this family!"

Daniela spoke slowly, making sure each word hit with precision. "I want to officially cut ties with Caiden."
Caiden froze, his smile faltering as his face hardened with disbelief.

Daniela pressed on, "And not just in name. I want a complete, legally binding termination of this relationship."

As she said this, she raised her hand, signaling for her legal team to take action.

One of them stepped forward, holding out a set of documents that had clearly been prepared in advance."Sign these, and then have Joyce deliver them to me. Once everything's in order, her position at Elite Lux will be confirmed without delay."
###Chapter 64 From This Day Forward


Caiden received the documents, his expression unreadable as he took hold of them.

He thumbed through the documents. Daniela's request was simple: she sought to cut all ties with the Harper family.Beyond that, she demanded nothing.

It wasn't exactly a shock. Considering the robust financial status of Elite Lux, Daniela likely had little interest in the modest assets of Harper Group.

Yet, Caiden fell into a brief silence. He looked at Daniela, then at the lobby around them.

Signing the documents meant severing every link to Daniela for good.

In his twilight years, as life faded away, Daniela would bear no obligation towards him.

Was this the correct path to choose?

Katrina's thoughts churned silently. No matter Daniela's achievements, she was not her flesh and blood.Introducing her own daughter to the ranks of Elite Lux seemed the more crucial strategy.

Katrina faced Daniela, her eyes narrowed with suspicion, and declared, "We'll sign, but mark my words. If you fire Joyce right after, don't expect to get away unscathed!"

Daniela responded with unruffled serenity, "Joyce is welcome to remain at Elite Lux as long as she wishes."

Relief washed over Katrina at these words.

Turning to Caiden, she spoke with unwavering certainty. "This deal is absolutely worth every bit of it! Or are you still under the illusion that Daniela will look after you in your old age? Just look at her-she's eager to sever all ties! Do you genuinely believe she still regards you as a father? Consider the cunning it takes to ascend to CEO of Elite Lux. Do you honestly think she's a straightforward person? Stick with her if you want,but as soon as Elite Lux solidifies, she'll focus all her energy on tearing you apart. Don't say I didn't warn you. This deal represents the best scenario for us! Joyce is far too naive right now. Daniela should step in and provide the mentorship she needs to grow. When it's timne, Joyce will return to Harper Group and propel it to new heights."

Katrina shot a'meaningful look at Cedric, then continued, "There's no denying that Joyce has a crush on Cedric. Given the Harper family's prestige, she wouldn't stand a chance to even meet someone of his caliber. Yet, by staying close to Daniela, she's around him daily. Consider this-hasn't Alexander already shown a preference for our daughter? Once Cedric truly sees what Daniela is like, he'll inevitably be drawn to Joyce, just as Alexander was. When that happens, imagine Cedric as your son-in-law. What concerns could you possibly have as you grow older?"

Her words were meticulously chosen, each one striking precisely where intended.

Caiden cast a glance towards Daniela, his face unreadable for a long moment.

Daniela, for her part, remained poised, her expression serene yet detached. In that moment, it dawned on Caiden that Katrina's insights were spot-on.

Daniela, with her aloof and steadfast demeanor, could not be depended upon in the way they needed.

"Very well," he declared, his tone decisive.

Daniela's eyelids fluttered closed momentarily, concealing whatever emotions might have surfaced.She then observed as Caiden extracted a pen from his suit pocket and leaned forward to inscribe his name meticulously on the documents.

As he concluded his remarks, Caiden straightened his posture and gazed into her eyes. "Honestly, Daniela,you ought to have grasped these truths by yourself. Yet, since the bond of father and daughter no longer binds us, allow me to offer you some final guidance. A woman should not be overly assertive. The ideal role for a woman is to remain at home, supporting her husband and nurturing her children. You were on the right track when you pursued Alexander-submissive, gentle, and aware of your role. However, you failed to keep him, didn't you? That fault lies with you. You should ponder on where you went astray. As a daughter, you're a complete disappointment. What good are all your fancy degrees and titles if you can't even manage basic decency or a shred of kindness? You've consistently failed to endear yourself to others, and that is your most profound failure. When Joyce enters your company, observe carefully how she conducts herself. In this matter, you should emulate her-she surpasses you in every conceivable way. And let me reiterate, from this point forward, your fate is no longer linked to the Harper family. You're entirely on your own. Should you ever marry, do not seek us out-you'll have no familial support to rely on. These documents, this severance -you pushed for it. Thus, do not return in tears seeking reconciliation. And regarding the Harper family's wealth-your mother and I accumulated it together. You are correct in one regard: you have no right to it.Thankfully, you had the sense to recognize this. From here on out, you are on your own. That is all I wish to impart to you."

As Caiden spoke, his eyes were icy and detached, reflecting nothing but self-serving intentions.

Daniela stood motionless, absorbing the scene unfolding before her. Every word uttered, every gesture made, was indelibly imprinted in her mind, stark and inescapable.

Her eyes brimmed with tears, yet she staunchly held them back.

A subtle smile flickered across her lips as she finally addressed Caiden. "Well then, I appreciate your words."

She had anticipated a moment of hesitation from him.

She had hoped he might deliberate a bit longer, given Elite Lux's staggering achievements.

But that was not to be.

In his eyes, regardless of her accomplishments, she remained dispensable.

Daniela gathered the folds of her flowing gown and bowed slightly.

Raising her head, she gazed up at Caiden-mirroring the way she once looked up to him as a child, filled with awe and longing. Now, however, her eyes were stripped of that naivety.

Then, she declared, "Henceforth, be it in life or death, in joy or in grief, I am no longer of your concern."
###Chapter 65 Anxious


With poise, Daniela pushed herself upright, her every motion a display of unwavering grace. Caiden was momentarily caught in a wave of emotions-tinges of regret and guilt intermingling subtly.

It dawned on him with surprising clarity that Daniela was no longer a child.

While Caiden stood there, lost in his reverie, Josie approached with her ever-alert senses. The aroma of soup drifting from the thermos caught her attention.

Her eyes expanded in alarm, and with a swift motion, she yanked Daniela back a few steps, casting a disbelieving stare at Caiden. "Is that rosemary in the soup?" she demanded.

Caiden was rooted to the spot, baffled and unprepared. The soup was a simple task left to the housekeeper.Yet,the potent scent of herbs lingering in the air hinted strongly at the presence of rosemary.

Josie's expression darkened, her tone laced with fury as she confronted him. "Are you kidding me? She's allergic to rosemary. Even a small taste could cover her in rashes. How can you call yourself her father when you don't even remember such a critical detail about your daughter?"

Under Josie's piercing gaze, fragments of forgotten memories began to resurface in Caiden's mind.

There was a faint echo of truth in her words-Daniela's allergy to rosemary. The memory had faded over the years,blurred and distant.

By the time Caiden's gaze lifted to seek out Daniela, it was too late. Guided by Cedric, she was already vanishing into the elevator, her figure a mere shadow behind the closing doors.

Meanwhile, Katrina reveled in her triumph. A satisfied grin spread across her face as she leaned in close to Joyce, her voice a jubilant whisper. "The Harper family's wealth is practically in our grasp now. And that's not all-you've secured the director position at Elite Lux! This outcome surpasses even my wildest dreams!"

Katrina quickly ushered Caiden and Joyce towards the exit, fearful that Daniela might reconsider her decision. In the lobby, Richard and Alexander had quietly observed the unfolding drama.

Richard turned to Alexander. "Caiden's a complete moron. Other than Katrina, the Harper family's a bunch of brainless idiots. If you were to marry Joyce, you'd have Katrina-and consequently, the entire Harper fortune-right where you want them. And Daniela? Should she prove too challenging, I wouldn't object to Joyce as my daughter-in-law."

Alexander clenched his jaw, his tone resolute. "Marrying Joyce has never crossed my mind."

Richard clapped Alexander on the shoulder with a knowing nod. "Then brace yourself, you've got a tough road ahead. Daniela isn't easily fooled; she's a cut above the rest of her family. You won't manipulate her as easily as the others."

Silence hung between them, yet a spark of determination ignited in Alexander's gaze.

Daniela's obsession with him wasn't exactly a secret. He figured it was only a matter of time before she came crawling back.

Whether it was to touch on personal subjects or to discuss their joint venture on the North District project, it was inevitable. Given that Bennett Group was a titan in Olisvine's redevelopment sector, Daniela couldn't possibly progress without HIS involvement.

When the time came, Alexander knew he wouldn't have to exert much effort. A mere hint of interest in reigniting their connection would suffice. Daniela would be desperate enough to fall for it.

There was an effortless assurance in his posture whenever he thought of Daniela.

He couldn't quite pinpoint why, but he was convinced of her enduring fondness for him.

As Alexander waited, his expression the very picture of calm certainty, his secretary found himself torn between comprehension and confusion.

It was clear why Alexander felt confident-Daniela had once been wrapped around his little finger.

Her tendency to go out of her way for him had made a deep impression on all who had seen it, not least the secretary himself. Yet,there was a puzzling element to this calm.

The North District project was on the cusp of its inauguration. How could Alexander afford to remain so tranquil? Did he not fear another firm might swoop in and clinch the deal first?

Days ticked by-one, then another.

Suddenly, Richard's urgent, furious call broke the serenity of Alexander's office. "Alexander, where the hell are you right now?" The sharpness in his voice sliced through the calm, sending a shiver through the room.

Alexander was deeply engrossed in reviewing a minor project proposal. "What seems to be the problem?"he asked.

"Where on earth are you? Are you aware that Daniela is on the brink of seáling a deal with Clayton Renovationtoday? You've constantly boasted about your rapport with Daniela, your unwavering certainty that she'd choose your side. So, what's going on? How have we ended up in this debacle?" Richard's voice burst through the line, seething with fury.

Gripping the phone, Alexander felt a chill as color drained from his face. Moments stretched on as he struggled to muster a reply.

After a tense pause, he sputtered, "Wait, Dad, are you really sure about this? Couldn't it just be a misunderstanding?"

The thought of Daniela partnering with another company gnawed at him.

Fueled by a mix of shock and betrayal, Alexander's calm shattered. How dared she?

The moment the CEO of Clayton Renovation stepped into Harper Group with a contract, Alexander stormed into Daniela's office, all formalities forgotten.O

Daniela was poring over the development plans with her design team assembled around her.

The words "Clayton Renovation" were elegantly scribbled on the small blackboard behind her in a script that Alexander recognized instantly as hers.

With his chest heaving and his tie hanging crookedly, Alexander stared at Daniela with disbelief and seething anger. "Are you really going to collaborate with Clayton Renovation?"

Taken aback by his sudden entrance and the harshness of his tone, Daniela, still clutching her pen,responded almost reflexively, "Yes."

The pain in Alexander's eyes intensified as he fixed his stareon her. "Daniela! How long are you going to keep this up? Do you really think these cheap tactics will capture my attention?"@

Everyone else, including Daniela, was visibly shocked.

Lillian propped herself against the table, her lips curling into a smirk. "What's this? Trying out for the role of our office clown?"

However, Alexander seemed oblivious to the light-hearted jab or the others in the room. His stare was fixed intensely on Daniela, his voice sharp and unyielding as he commanded, "Get out, all of you. This is between me and Daniela."

Before anyone could muster a reply, the elevator dinged open, revealing the CEO of Clayton Renovation.

With the multi-billion dollar contract on the verge of being sealed, he was wary of any disruption, especially from Alexander.

Waldo Clayton, the CEO, stepped through the crowd, his expression marked by clear annoyance.Bennett, this is not how we conduct business. The deal is almost done. Do you think it's appropriate to storm in and interrupt like this? Is professional decorum just a joke to you now?"

Unperturbed, Alexander brushed off Waldo's hand and moved a step closer to Daniela, his determination undeterred. "I need to speak with you. Alone." 

###Chapter 66 Toilet Director


Daniela straightened her posture, her eyes calm yet piercing as she spoke to Alexander. "Mr. Bennett,please remember, you're at the branch of Elite Lux, not Bennett Group."

His expression turned grim, the sting of betrayal burning in his glare.

However, Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "Really, Mr. Bennett, gazing at me like that won't change the situation. I'm all about my career these days-men just aren't worth the hassle. Nice try, but your looks won't faze me or get the outcome you're dreaming of."

Her teasing tone elicited chuckles from the others.

Her tone turned icy as she added, "If there's something pressing you need to discuss, I would suggest making an appointment through my secretary. We handle sensitive business here, and your presence as an outsider is a bit disconcerting."

Daniela's demeanor towards Alexander was meticulously neutral.

There was a time when she had been deeply, hopelessly in love with him, chasing him with relentless passion.

But those days had faded into the past. She had loved fervently, yet she was no longer hesitant to acknowledge that ###Chapter was closed.

Now, she offered him nothing but professional civility.

She even empathized that Alexander might need time to come to terms with her newfound detachment.After all, adjusting to the absence of her once unwavering affection could be jarring for him.

But then, Alexander's expression hardened, his eyes turning frosty. With a curt nod, he stated firmly,"Daniela! If this is how you're going to carry on, consider this conversation over. You think I'd ever want you back? Pathetic. You've let me down in every way!"
Alexander shot her a cold glare before turning on his heel and storming out like she wasn't worth his time.

The room plunged into a profound silence, the air thick with tension.

Several moments later, Daniela blinked, her mind snapping back from the shock. She massaged her temples, let out a deep sigh, and steeled herself to begin the meeting.

Suddenly, the office door banged open with such force that it echoed throughout the space.

Daniela shut her eyes momentarily, a reminder flashing through her mind about enhancing the office security.

"I'm going to kill you, Daniela!" Joyce bellowed as she burst into the room, brandishing a toilet brush like a weapon.

Her hair was in disarray, and she appeared as if she'd just emerged from a trench, dirt and all. A troupe of flustered security guards trailed behind her.

"Ms. Harper," the administrative manager gasped, catching up and panting heavily. "I'm so sorry. I did everything I could to stop her, but she wouldn't hear it. She just didn't care."

Brushing past the guards, Joyce stormed up to Daniela,her face flushed with rage. "Daniela! You assigned me to toilet cleaning duty!"

Daniela lifted her eyes, her expression serene. "Is something wrong?"

"You told Mom and Dad you'd appoint me as a director at Elite Lux!" Joyce's voice teetered on the edge of hysteria.

This day was meant to mark her grand entrance as a director at Elite Lux. She had proudly shared the news far and wide, even promising her friends snapshots of her new office.

Yet, instead of an executive suite, the administrative staff presented her with a toilet brush. They escorted her to a neglected nook by the basement bathrooms and gestured to a rickety stool-her so-called office.

The indignity of it all was overwhelming. With a dismissive gesture, Daniela signaled the security and administrative manager to exit the room.

Once they were alone, Daniela reclined in her chair, the picture of control. Her lips curled into a smirk as she stared Joyce down. "Have I ever outright denied you the director's position?"

Joyce's makeup was a smeared mess, and next to Daniela's calm elegance, she looked like a frantic wreck-bordering on unhinged.

She shook her head. "No, you haven't."

Daniela's gaze remained unwavering, her tone even. "And indeed, you are a director. No one has stated otherwise."

Joyce's face twisted with rage as she barked, "A 'toilet director'? Screw you, Daniela! I'm not your joke! Are the restrooms in Elite Lux decked out in gold or what? Why on earth would they need a director for that? You must be joking with me!"

Reclining slightly in her chair, Daniela answered calmly, "Believe it or not, even the headquarters of Elite Lux appoint directors to oversee restroom facilities. The choice to accept the position is yours alone."

A flicker of uncertainty crossed Joyce's face. "The headquarters have toilet directors too?"

Daniela affirmed with a nod, "Indeed, they do."

Curiosity piqued, Joyce continued, "Are there any other kinds of director roles available? I really don't want to be known as a toilet director. It sounds absurd."

"Toilet director? That's your term, not ours. We certainly don't call it that."

Joyce's eyes narrowed as her voice lost a bit of its edge. "Fine. If that's not it, then what do you call it?"

Daniela replied, "We refer to it as the 'Director of Comfort.'"

The title resonated with a certain prestige, casting a dignified air around it.

Joyce seemed to come to terms with the situation. Daniela added, "Now you're officially a director at Elite Lux. Think about it; it's quite a leap from selling clothes on the street, isn't it?" Joyce glared briefly before storming off without another word.

With her out of the way, Waldo sprawled the contract across the table and asked skeptically,"|there really a 'Director of Comfort' at the headquarters?"

Lillian, clutching her sides from laughing so hard, confirmed eagerly. "Absolutely! It's an honorary title we bestow upon family members who pitch in with the cleaning duties. It's our way of showing respect!"

In essence, Daniela had been merely playing with Joyce's expectations.

Moments later, Cedric strolled into the room. He spotted Daniela at her desk, her head tilted slightly, a subtle smile gracing her lips.

His usually rigid demeanor gave way to a brief, unexpected glimmer of amusement.

Lillian grinned and quipped playfully, "Mr. Phillips, who could possibly call you cold and aloof? I'm seeing more and more smiles from you lately."

All eyes drew to Cedric's unexpectedly cheerful demeanor.

Strikingly, Daniela hadn't repeated her usual security concerns today. There was no, "We need to enhance security. How can we just let anyone wander in?"

With the room bathed in a lighter tone and the air filled with ease, everyone's laughter mingled, casting glances of admiration and respect towards Daniela.
###Chapter 67 Why Should I Apologize


Alexander's fury burned like a wildfire, untamed and fierce.

He marched out of the Luxor Tower, his footsteps echoing as he passed a group of security guards huddled near the entrance for a briefing.

The security chief spoke firmly. "Starting now, we'll inspect every ID of anyone coming into the building.Higher-ups' orders-too many unauthorized people have been slipping through. Stay sharp, everyone!"

A crisp and unanimous "Yes, sir!" rang out, reverberating through the entrance.

Following close behind, Alexander's secretary leaned in cautiously and murmured, "Mr. Bennett, do you think this new rule is aimed at us?"

Alexander let out a derisive snort. Block him from entering? Demand his ID for access? Had Daniela completely forgotten who he was? She wouldn't have the nerve to block his path.

Still simmering with rage, Alexander walked away, his jaw clenched tightly in aggravation. Inwardly, he resolved that unless Daniela dropped to her knees and begged for his forgiveness, he wouldn't even spare her a glance.

Observing Alexander's thunderous expression, the secretary hesitated briefly before saying,,about Elite Lux's deal with Clayton Renovation... They're close to finalizing the contract. Your father's been pressing me about your progress with Ms.Harper.How should I respond?"

After a slight pause, he added, "Maybe easing your approach could help, sir. I don't believe Ms. Harper is completely indifferent to you."

Alexander spun around, his piercing gaze fixing on the secretary. "Are you saying she still loves me?"

The secretary blinked, visibly startled by the sudden question. Wait, was that really the point he was trying to make? Under Alexander's unrelenting stare, the secretary lowered his head and replied, "Yes, sir. I think Ms. Harper still holds feelings for you. Otherwise, with such a major project, she would have at least opened it for public bidding. Opting straight for Clayton Renovation without competition-it does feel a bit sudden."

Alexander nodded in agreement. "Exactly! You understand. Daniela is just pulling a stunt to grab my attention. She hasn't moved on from our marriage, and this is her way of retaliating against me."

The secretary was at a loss for words. He couldn't decide whether to laugh or question Alexander's logic.

With a newfound determination, Alexander walked into the Bennett Group building. Once in his office, he placed a call to the appropriate department and, with measured precision, lodged a complaint against Clayton Renovation for alleged fire safety infractions.

Alexander ended the call and leaned back, a smug smile spreading across his face as satisfaction settled in.

His actions would compel Clayton Renovation to launch internal safety reviews, a procedure guaranteed to drag on for at least half a year. Daniela's project was on a tight deadline-she couldn't afford such a setback.

Only Bennett Group had the resources and know-how to handle a project of this magnitude.

Sinking into his chair, Alexander basked in his triumph. He was convinced that Daniela was cornered. Sooner or later, she'd have no choice but to come to him, pleading for assistance.

That evening, a charity gala was the highlight of the city.

As Alexander walked in, Keith was already mingling.

Seeing him, Keith strolled over with a playful grin, givinghim a thumbs-up. "Nice work! I heard Daniela was about to finalize the deal with Clayton Renovation today, but you threw a wrench in it?"

Alexander gripped his wine glass firmly, his expression stormy, as if the world owed him something.

Keith let out a chuckle and glanced across the room at Daniela.

She wore a white gown that hugged her waist. Keith, unable to resist, extended his hand and spread his fingers, picturing how easily her waist would fit within them. "What do you think you're doing?" Alexander muttered, his gaze seething as he shot a glare at Keith.

Keith nervously licked his lips, clearly embarrassed to be caught in the act.

"Take it easy, Alexander. I'm just saying, Daniela's a reaI knockout. No surprise you can't seem to forget her."

Alexander snorted in disbelief. "Me? Can't forget her? That's ridiculous!"

Keith tapped his glass against Alexander's. "Come on, stop fooling around. If you didn't care, would you be going this far? Reporting Clayton Renovation, pulling strings to get a deal with Daniela's company-that's some serious effort, my friend."

Alexander stiffened, his glare as cold as ice. "You think I'm doing all this for Daniela? Don't be absurd. Do you even remember who we're talking about? She used to trail after me like a lost puppy, begging for my attention. She even hand-washed my underwear in the freezing winter. And now you think I'm the one running after her? Unbelievable."

As Alexander continued his heated speech, Keith's attention seemed to drift. His eyes briefly darted over Alexander's shoulder, and his face flushed a deep shade of red.

Alexander's gaze followed Keith's. Standing behind him was Daniela.

Joyce had overheard their conversation about Daniela and, without missing a beat, tugged Daniela over just in time to hear Alexander's harsh words.

Joyce's face brightened with smug satisfaction. Any lingering resentment from the "toilet director" incident had melted away, replaced by pure joy. She lifted her chin with arrogance, sneering at Daniela."See that,Daniela? What good is your success in business if Alexander still doesn't want you?"

Daniela stood there, cradling a wine glass. For the briefest of moments, a subtle shadow of sadness flickered across her features, almost as if a forgotten memory had surfaced. But in the blink of an eye,it vanished, replaced by a smile that was as smooth and practiced as ever. "Oh really/? Well, Mr. Bennett is clearly out of my league. I wouldn't dare aim so high."

With that, she spun on her heel and walked off. Watching her leave, Joyce felt triumphant. She slipped into the seat Keith had left and started ranting to Alexander, whining about how Daniela had mistreated her by making her the toilet director.

As Joyce continued her chatter, Alexander's expression grew colder. His frosty demeanor made her hesitate. After a moment, she excused herself and left.

Keith returned to his seat beside Alexander and let out a deep sigh. "You know, Alexander, that was a bit harsh. No matter what Daniela did before, it was because she cared about you. The world has already used her feelings against her. But for you, someone she once cared about, to pile on? That's low. And she's a woman-women tend to be more sensitive. Maybe you should think about apologizing to her."

Alexander clenched his wine glass, his eyes locked on Daniela, who was now across the room laughing with Cedric.

"Apologize? For what? I just spoke the truth. No matter how successful she gets, she can't stop people from saying what's true, can she?"
###Chapter 68 Alexander's Blind Confidence


Keith's sigh was heavy with exasperation as he shook his head. "Stay stubborn if that's what you want. Let's see how long that pride of yours lasts when reality hits."

As the gala drew to a close, Alexander couldn't help but monitor Daniela's every move. His car followed hers, maintaining a discreet distance.

Inside Daniela's vehicle, her driver peered into the rearview mirror and noted, "Ms. Harper, there's a car that's been tailing us since you got in."

Daniela turned her head slightly, her piercing eyes quickly recognizing the familiar car-it was Alexander's.

Relaxing into her seat, she instructed in a steady voice, "Just ignore it."

The two cars wove through the city streets in a quiet pursuit, finally coming to a halt outside the imposing Luxor Tower.

Just as Daniela stepped out, Alexander intercepted her.

She raised her weary eyes to meet his gaze. Despite the fatigue weighing on her, she remained poised. "Mr.Bennett,do you need something from me?"

He tailed her car relentlessly, shadowing her all the way to the office building.

"You and Cedric are not right for each other," he declared bluntly.

Raising an eyebrow, Daniela responded, "Don't you have more important things to attend to?"

His lips pressed into a thin line as his eyes widened slightly, struggling to mask his disbelief.

Daniela pressed on, her tone dripping with challenge. "Or have you really become so unoccupied that you stoop to meddling in your ex-wife's affairs? Haven't you ever heard the saying, 'The best kind of ex is one you never hear from again'?"
Alexander's face grew stern, his jaw clenching with quiet intensity.

The thought of her laughter mingling with Cedric's ignited a sharp, unbidden irritation within him.

"Alright then. If you insist on being stubborn, just remember not to come crying to me when things go wrong. Don't say I didn't warn you."

Daniela dismissed his remark with a nonchalant wave of her hand. She attempted to brush past him,but Alexander extended his arm, barring her way.

"Was there something more?"

"Yes," he replied tersely, his tone cutting through the chill air.

Daniela paused, giving him a fleeting look."Go ahead."

Initially, Alexander had resolved to let Daniela seek him out. Yet, a nagging unease twisted in his gut.

Daniela had a knack for poor decisions, and if she aligned herself with another company instead of the Bennett Group, it would inevitably drag him into yet another conflict.

After a moment of deliberation, he opted to confront the issue directly. "I've got a deal you might find interesting."

He fixed his gaze on her, her features bathed in the ethereal moonlight. His fingers tightened into a fist,then he consciously relaxed, striving to smooth his expression.

As he spoke again, his voice softened into a husky whisper, carrying a hint of intimacy. "This isn't the right spot for this conversation. Let's head up to your apartment."

Daniela eyed Alexander with a mixture of confusion and caution, taking a deliberate step back. "I don't think that would be appropriate."

A shadow of frustration quickly passed over Alexander's face, his annoyance clearly rising to the surface."Why do you find it inappropriate with me, yet it seems okay when it's Cedric? Daniela, don't you understand? For a woman, being loyal-showing devotion to one man-is paramount."
The night breeze played with Daniela's hair, adding a dramatic flair as she faced him, her features sculpted with both shock and disdain. "Are you suggesting that I should keep chasing you around?"

A flicker of regret passed through Alexander's eyes. He brought a fist to his mouth, disguising a cough.
"What I mean is that you shouldn't be so fickle."

Daniela remained silent, observing him closely. Once upon a time, this clumsy, awkward aspect of Alexander might have amused her, even seemed charming-as if she were glimpsing a part of him that remained hidden from everyone else.

Those pathetic days were dead and buried. Daniela wasn't that reckless fool anymore.

Daniela turned to leave, but not before casting a parting shot over her shoulder. "It's late, and frankly, you being here reeks of desperation. As for your so-called proposition, partnerships require integrity-something I'm not sure you understand. There's no common ground between Elite Lux's principles and those of Bennett Group. If you're here to discuss the North District project, save your breath-I'm not interested."

Daniela's rejection was absolute, leaving no room for argument or delusion.

Alexander was left motionless, shock rendering him silent.

It took a few moments beforehis secretary approached, piercing the heavy silence. "Mr. Bennett, Ms.Harper has already gone inside. Perhaps we should also leave?"

Alexander stared in disbelief where Daniela had vanished, struggling to pull himself together.

He turned to his secretary, his voice tinged with confusion. "What did she mean by that?"②

The secretary bowed his head slightly, his words measured. "Ms. Harper was indicating that the North District project will proceed without Bennett Group's involvement."

Alexander blinked, his thoughts scrambling to catch up.

If Bennett Group wasn't her choice, then who did she turn to?

Clayton Renovation was out of the picture. In the entire city of Olisvine, no other firm possessed the resources or expertise needed for such a massive endeavor. It had to be him.

Alexander let out a cold, biting laugh that echoed in the frosty air. "She's got to be bluffing."
###Chapter 69 A Chance


Cedric had initially intended to drive Daniela home.

Work, however, demanded his attention, and he stayed behind. When he finally wrapped up, a text from Ryan awaited him.

It was a simple text.

"You're too slow."

Exiting a meeting, Cedric saw the message and replied with a question mark.

His secretary was updating him on office affairs at the time.

By the fourth point, the secretary noticed Cedric's unusual inattentiveness-his typically diligent boss was distracted by his phone.

Pausing, the secretary doubted Cedric's focus and skipped an item on the list. Without looking up, Cedric pointed out, "You skipped one."

Taken aback, the secretary apologized and readied to proceed, but Cedric, phone in hand, stood abruptly.

The secretary, accustomed to Cedric's steady presence, noted a rare unease in his demeanor.

Cedric appeared restless, bordering onanxious.

Such descriptors were foreign when it came to Cedric.

The secretary halted, anticipating Cedric's next move.

Yet, Cedric dismissed him with a gesture. As the door shut, the secretary overheard Cedric's low query into the phone. "Ryan, what exactly are you implying?"

On the other end, Ryan, weary from a night without sleep, was perched on a rooftop, nursing a drink. "They mean exactly what you think. I just spotted Alexander's car tailing Daniela home. Cedric, what on earth are you up to? It's been forever, and you still haven't told her how you feel. Are you frightened or what?"

The secretary, poised to knock, halted abruptly. Frightened? Who? Cedric? That couldn't be!

Then, Cedric said, "A bit."

The secretary's mouth hung open in shock.

Ryan, caught off guard, pressed, "Cedric, what scares you? You have it all-wealth, looks. What's there to fear? I just can't wrap my head around it."

Cedric slumped into his chair, his head lowered, his tone somber. "You don't get it."

Ryan was flabbergasted. "I don't get it? Or is it you who's missing the point?"

Cedric exhaled deeply. "She told me she's not ready for a relationship. Being away from her makes me restless, but getting too close... I worry it might push her away. I'm walking on eggshells here. You don't understand her like I do. Push too hard, and she'll close off entirely."①

Ryan burst into laughter. "Who would have imagined? The great Cedric Phillips, now so cautious and humble."

Cedric appeared unfazed by the comment, shifting the topic. "What was Alexander's business with Daniela?"

Ryan snorted dismissively, "What do you think? He wants her cooperation. He's angling for that North District project, but the way he clung to her in the footage-it looked off. Just a heads-up, Cedric. You should keep an eye out."

Cedric's expression hardened, his response resolute. "Understood."

The following morning, Cedric postponed an early appointment to visit Daniela for breakfast.

Daniela descended the stairs to find Cedric contemplatively resting his chin on his hand at the dining table.

She eyed him curiously, then whispered to Josie, "What's wth him today?"

Josie shrugged, clearly bemused. "Beats me. He arrived early, took a seat, and hasn't uttered a single word."

Daniela laughed, then shouted for Lillian to come down. Lillian appeared, yawning and complaining about her late night, her appetite absent.

As Daniela settled at the table, Cedric preemptively served her some side dishes.

She ate in measured silence, Cedric attentively topping up her plate with each bite she took.

Daniela smiled, her amusement nearly breaking through her poised demeanor as she continued to eat quietly.

After finishing, Daniela dabbed her mouth with a napkin, then faced Cedric.

Cedric, visibly uncomfortable underher scrutiny, looked away and muttered, "What?"

Daniela smiled, probing, "You don't usually come over early to play host. Anything you're trying to say?"

Cedric cleared his throat awkwardly. "Not at all."

Daniela gave a slight nod. "Alright then, I'm off."

At Daniela's suggestion of departure, Cedric quickly shed his guise of indifference, blurting out, "Wait!"

Daniela chuckled and resumed her seat.

Cedric propped his chin on his hand, gazing earnestly at her. "Let's have a conversation."

Daniela settled comfortably. "Alright,let's talk."

Cedric began tentatively, "This year's economy hasn't been kind."

Daniela met his gaze. "True, yet Phillips Group has just secured a significant deal. You're managing'to expand, even amidst these challenges."

Cedric paused briefly, then confessed, "However, collecting payments has been particularly tough lately."

Daniela nodded, her expression reflective. "That's understandable. Yet, your company maintains robust cash flow. It's one of the few not dependent on borrowing."
Elite Lux was the other exception.

Cedric exhaled heavily. "It's a tough season for business. Big deals are scarce, and the competition is fierce.My team is under so much pressure, they're turning to liquor to cope with the demands of networking."

Daniela tilted her head, intuiting his implication, yet she simply smiled and began to respond, "True,however-"

"Don't 'however' me," Cedric cut in, raising his hand. "If we continue this line of discussion..."

He'd find himself without a leg to stand on.

Resolving to be forthright, he stated, "I'm considering cuting corners. Phillips Group also specializes in architectural and renovation ventures. Why didn't Elite Lux consider us for the North District project? You shouldn't treat me differently just because we were classmates."

Cedric maintained eye contact, his tone softening. "I'm just asking for a fair chance."
###Chapter 70 Cedric Dared


Cedric's voice carried a gentle undertone as he spoke.

Even Josie, engrossed in her kitchen tasks, paused to glance over at him. She let out a soft chuckle and silently cheered for him.

A surge of nervousness washed over Cedric immediately after his words left his mouth. He found himself unable to look Daniela in the eye.

His hand clenched around his fork, the grip so tight that his knuckles whitened.

Daniela remained silent for a long moment, a palpable tension hanging heavily in the air, muting all other sounds.

Cedric moistened his lips and his voice was a whisper when he spoke again. "Phillips Group stands at the forefront of the renovation sector. If you give me the chance to lead this project, I assure you it will be executed exquisitely."

The silence stretched on, during which Cedric had an epiphany. Daniela was offering him a way out, an opportunity to preserve his dignity with grace.

Yet, Cedric rejected her silent offer of mercy.

He was beyond caring about appearances or pride at this point.

All he desired, the only thing he yearned for, was a straightforward response from Daniela.

"I sincerely want to partner with Elite Lux on this project. It means more to me than any previous venture."

Daniela had yet to respond.

Consequently, Cedric also lapsed into silence.

In the kitchen, the soup simmered quietly on the stove. Daniela pursed her lips, wrestling with her thoughts uncertain of her next words.

It took a lengthy pause before she could speak, her tone serene yet laden with weight.

"I've always been the kind of person who dedicates their entire being to someone else. Entrusting all my hopes to one individual never gave me any stability-it always felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to crumble.Cedric, you're wonderful, truly. However, that's precisely why I can't entrust this project to you."

With those words, she rose, opened the door, and departed for her job.

Cedric remained frozen at the table, lost in his contemplation. Josie peeked from the kitchen, observed his still form, and sighed softly.

The day's sunlight was gentle, casting mellow, golden hues throughout the room. Cedric's hands were tightly clasped, his lips drawn into a narrow line, as if navigating through a labyrinth of thoughts.

Josie approached, bearing a bowl of the warm soup, and placed it before him, hoping to lift his spirits."Daniela actually-"

Cedric cut her off. "Your son is in the renovation business, isn't he?"

Josie nodded. "Yes, he does. You were the one who recommended it, right? You mentioned he should explore renovation projects. He's been excelling lately! Just last month, he secured a contract worth over a hundred thousand dollars. He was so excited that he didn't sleep all night."

Her lips curved into a warm, affectionate smile as she reminisced about her son's enthusiasm.

However, she paused when she noticed Cedric smiling as well.

A shiver of unease trickled down her spine. "Please don't smile like that. It's unsettling."

"Josie, would you want your son to be even happier?" Cedric asked, his tone smooth.

Without a moment's pause, Josie answered, "Of course, but there's a limit to-"

Before she could even finish her sentence, Cedric jumped in. "That's settled, then."

Meanwhile,Tyler Maynard was visibly stunned as he stared at the tender document in his hands. "Two, two... Two billion and five hundred million for a project? Are you serious about this?" His eyes were wide with disbelief as he gestured wildly. "Mr. Phillips, you must be kidding! Two million, maybe, but two billion? That's absolutely insane!"

Cedric spoke with composed assurance. "Relax. I'll personally oversee this project for you. All the profits will be yours. Just one thing-this must remain completely under wraps."

Days later, an unexpected player made a splash in the Olisvine renovation scene, stirring the waters of the business community and unnerving the industry's heavyweights.

The word was out. This newcomer had confidently presented a partnership offer to the prestigious Harper Group.

The revelation sent shockwaves through the Bennett family, prompting a frenzied search for clues about the enigmatic company's owner. Despite their extensive efforts, Tyler appeared to have sprung from thin air,with not a single breadcrumb leading back to a prior business footprint.

Daniela, too, had her eye on this curious new entity.

She tasked Ryan with some sleuthing, and he reported back, coolly providing the details Cedric had shared.

"I've done a thorough check. The company's solid-decent folks, no sketchy background."

Daniela perused the documents briefly, then looked up at him, her eyes reflecting a mix of intrigue and suspicion. "Do you know them personally?"

"Family..." Ryan stopped for a moment, then added, "Kind of, yeah."

Daniela reclined in her chair, placing the folder on the desk. "Family? In that case, you'll oversee the initial contracts and the vetting process. If everything checks out, you're cleared to seal the deal."

Ryan was well aware of Daniela's readiness to assist those tied to her team.

Mentioning "family" was enough to convince her.

Provided the company met the standard criteria, the agreement was practically guaranteed-bypassing the usual competitive bidding. With that, Ryan gave a nod and exited the office.

The moment he was out the door, he fired off a short message to Cedric. "OK."

Lillian,walking by, caught sight of this and emitted a soft whistle. "Wow. You really have Cedric's back, don't you? Stepping up for him like this?"

Ryan, a lollipop tucked in his cheek, shot back, "Could you erect a business empire in mere days for someone who has already rejected you?"

Reconstructing a billion-dollar renovation business required more than just capital. It demanded a vast network of labor, resources, and connections to kickstart operations.

Then,after laying the foundation, significant investment of actual, hard-earned cash was essential.

In an era marked by capricious and hurried attitudes, who else would commit so thoroughly?

Cedric was one who dared.
###Chapter 71 The Building


Cedric refrained from using the company's funds.

Instead, he invested his own savings into the project.

Tyler, staring at the long string of zeros in the company's balance, felt the immense burden of his role.

He blinked, overwhelmed, and queried, "You do realize I'm the legal representative of this company, right?"

Cedric, momentarily cheered by Ryan's approving text, gave Tyler a brief glance and responded distractedly,"Hmm?"

Tyler's worry deepened. "As the legal representative, this money is technically under my stewardship too.Are you comfortable entrusting me with such a substantial amount?"

The potential for misdeeds loomed large; with the access he had, embezzlement was a terrifying possibility.

This was no small sum; it was in the billions!

And that was aside from the vast sums already tied upo in the business. Funds were swirling through accounts like a torrential river.

The recent costs for entertainment and hospitality alone surpassed anything Tyler had ever encountered in his life.

To Tyler,the financial maneuvers seemed sheer madness.

Yet Cedric, ever composed, simply stated, "It's all worth it."

Turning to look at Cedric, Tyler observed the slight dark circles under his eyes. Even Cedric, seemingly unbreakable, bore the scars of his ambitions. No one, not even he, could dodge the demands of hard labor.

Tyler silently pledged to himself-he would uphold Cedric's trust. He would not fail him. Among all possible choices, Cedric had chosen him.

"Rest assured, I won't misuse a penny of the company's funds!"

Cedric offered a faint smile and dismissed him with a wave. "This company only needs to tackle one significant project. If you're driven, use this opportunity to carve out your own path. Should you have any queries, I or my secretary are at your disposal."

With that,Cedric exited, eager to meet his team on the construction site to discuss the initial design concepts.

He envisioned erecting a building on the North District land that would captivate and inspire for centuries,and his entire vision was dedicated to Daniela.

Cedric collected his hard hat and made his way to the site.

As the design plans were revealed, the team was struck mute.

"Mr.Phillips..."

Several team members exchanged wary glances, uncertain whether to voice their thoughts.

"Go on," Cedric urged.

The lead designer stepped up, hesitating. "Earlier, you specified using only the finest materials and hiring top-tier engineers, with directors overseeing everything personally. So what budget are we working with for all this?"

His question came tentatively.

Though not a finance guru, he could rough out the costs for the materials and labor as specified by Cedric.

Given Cedric's standards, the project's expenses were projected to exceed 2.5 billion.

How could such expenditure yield a profit?

It seemed far more probable they'd face a substantial financial hit.

Wasn't the primary goal of a business to generate profit?

What was the rationale otherwise?

The team was baffled by Cedric's strategy. Day in, day out, he was on-site, meticulously managing every phase of construction. His expensive black suit was perpetually dust-laden. From laying the foundations to the final touches, Cedric was involved in every detail.

It became a common sight at Phillips Group: the chief secretary donning a hard hat, yelling updates to Cedric amidst the roar of drills and machinery.

On one occasion, Lillian and Ryan chanced upon the site.

Witnessing the commotion, Lillian couldn't resist commenting with a thumbs-up, "Since Cedric can't capture Daniela's heart, he's channeling all that passion into her business ventures. It's absolutely wild!"



Alexander had just landed from a business trip.

At the airport, he checked his phone repeatedly.

After realizing Daniela hadn't reached out, he scoffed, "She's really keeping her cool."

His secretary, nearby, ventured cautiously, "Might it be that she's not just 'keeping her cool'? Perhaps she's moved on to better prospects?"

Alexander let out a scornful laugh, oozing confidence with each word. "Better prospects? Daniela? Sure,she's skilled in her field. But for a venture this large? She'd never risk it with someone who's not up to par.She's too savvy for that."

Alexander got into his car.

As his secretary began to speak, Alexander's phone interrupted with a ring.

It was Caiden, inviting him over for dinner.

Without hesitation, Alexander directed the driver to Caiden's place.

Joyce, learning of Alexander's impending visit, immediately arranged for a professional makeup artist.

She selected a breathtaking dress, identical to one Daniela had once worn.

The dress was exorbitantly priced, but Joyce felt it justified.

She had pondered her future-running a business wasn't for her. Marrying well and enjoying a luxurious life seemed far superior, infinitely preferable to Daniela's relentless, work-driven existence.

Her mother's advice resonated with her."Awoman should not overexert herself. Stay tender, stay gentle,and life will reward you."

Cedric hadn't reached out to her in a long time. Clearly, he wasn't destined to marry someone of her caliber,a true heiress from a prestigious family. Alexander, however, remained a viable option.

Previously, Alexander had jilted Daniela at the altar for her sake, a testament to his unwavering commitment.

Joyce reflected on this with satisfaction. Sharing her thoughts with Caiden, she found him receptive.

Caiden nodded understandingly, promising to subtly mention it to Alexander at dinner.

They agreed it would be ideal for Alexander and Joyce to hold their engagement ceremony before the New Year.

As Alexander's car traversed the North District bridge, he looked out the window.

Suddenly,his expression changed dramatically. The calm indifference gave way to sharp indignation.

He leaned forward abruptly, pressing against the window, pointing angrily at the imposing building ahead."What the hell is that?"
###Chapter 72 Mistaken


The secretary remained silent for an extended period.

Alexander snapped his head around, his tone icy. "Speak up! Have you lost your voice, or what?"

The secretary recoiled slightly. "It's Ms. Harper's project. Construction has already begun."

"What?" Alexander's face twisted in astonishment. "What did you just say?"

How was this conceivable?

How had the project slipped through his fingers?

That land was Daniela's lure, the means by which she had kept him ensnared. How had she relinquished it so soon?

Alexander shook with rage, his body quivering. He gripped the car window tightly, his voice a chilling whisper."Who?"

Who had snatched away the opportunity that was rightfully his?

Who indeed?

The secretary faltered. "It was Tyler Maynard. He secured it just before your trip."

Alexander's gaze sharpened menacingly. His command to the driver was a growl. "Head to Elite Lux.Immediately."

The driver complied without delay, accelerating the vehicle.

The car surged ahead, rainwater from the recent showers splashing wildly as they sped away.



Daniela and Lillian were just returning from lunch when a car barrelled towards them.

The vehicle skidded to a stop directly in front of them, causing Lillian to instinctively step back.

Shielding Lillian, Daniela squinted against the bright light, her expression turning steely and cold.

Alexander then emerged from the car, his aura tempestuous, charged with a palpable fury. His glare bore the old disdain he often directed at her.

"Daniela, why?" His voice broke with anger, his usual composure shattered.

He strode up to her and seized her hand, his dark eyes drilling into hers. "Why?"

Daniela attempted to withdraw her hand, but his grip was too strong. Ceasing her struggle, she faced his anger with an icy calm. "Why what?"

Lillian moved to intervene, but was blocked by Alexander's secretary.

As she reached for her phone, it was snatched from her grasp before she could call for assistance.

Daniela's face hardened further, her eyes chillingly sharp as she demanded, "What do you want?"

Alexander faltered, taken aback.

He had witnessed Daniela's many moods-her joy, her warmth, her intense passion.

Resentment, hesitance, perseverance.

A gamut of emotions.

But this-this unyielding coldness was something utterly foreign.

The disappointment in her eyes was palpable, leaving Alexander momentarily stunned. Daniela seized this chance to slip her hand from his grip.

Regaining his composure, Alexander snapped, "Daniela, there must be a limit to your obstinacy! Do you grasp the implications of diverting the North District project to someone else? This could jeopardize Bennett Group's standing in Olisvine! Did you consider any of this?"

Daniela gazed at him, a flicker of amusement crossing her face at his absurd accusations. "And why should "It concerns me deeply. I lead Bennett Group. Losing such a critical deal-do you understand the repercussions for me? My reputation with my father, the board, our employees-what will they think?Daniela, why must you act so impulsively? Do you think such antics will make me return to you? You're only driving me further away!"

He glared fiercely, spitting out, "You don't even know how to love someone!"

Daniela laughed-a sharp, bitter sound. If she had once resigned herself to Alexander's demeanor, now that resignation crumbled into clear, sharp hatred.

"I don't know how to love someone? Alexander, you question my capacity to love? For a decade,I stood by your side and shielded you. I thought our shared childhoods without mothers made us kin. I pitied you.I supported you. When you were a kid making messes, who cleaned up after you? As a wayward teen, who pulled you back from the brink? When gangsters cornered you in a bar, who was the one who broke a bottle and fought to rescue you? And during your early struggles at work, who endured sleepless nights alongside you? And now, Alexander, you dare to accuse me of not knowing how to love you?"

Her laughter turned more sardonic, her eyes reddening with a mix of rage and sorrow. "You know,Alexander? I'm beginning to wonder if the person who helped me out of my depression years ago was really you."

Inflamed with anger, Alexander couldn't help but react to Daniela's mention of her past struggles.Impulsively, he shot back, "Who saved you? What depression?"

As soon as the words escaped him, the atmosphere turned icy. Daniela stared at him, utterly shocked."What did you just say?"

Alexander averted his gaze, his eyes dodging hers, his mouth set in a firm line, and he remained silent.

Daniela's eyes narrowed as she studied Alexander intently.

When she was only five, she experienced the profound loss of her mother. Shortly after her mother's death,Katrina entered her life, along with Joyce.
On a particularly hot summer day, Daniela witnessed Katrina and Caiden in a compromising embrace on the sofa.

Tears rolled down her cheeks in silence. As Katrina caught her gaze, her eyes sharp and challenging,Daniela felt a deep chill.

That moment cast a long shadow over her childhood, ushering her into a deep depression.

Following that day, Daniela withdrew into herself, stopping her speech entirely. Her family, preoccupied,failed to notice, leaving her alone in her silent, isolating despair.

One afternoon, she discovered a sketchbook hidden within a tree near the swing set.

The first page featured a drawing of her, depicted with a bright, almost heavenly smile.

Overwhelmed with emotion and suspecting a cruel joke, Daniela ripped the drawing to shreds and discarded the sketchbook back into the tree hollow.

The following day, she found the sketchbook once more placed in the tree, as if it had been patiently waiting for her return.

She opened the sketchbook again to find a new drawing of herself, captured with the same warm smile as before.

In a surge of anger, she tore the page into shreds.

Yet, on the third day, the sketchbook was there again.

And on the fourth, it returned once more.

This pattern persisted for three long months.

Initially, Daniela's fury was palpable, but gradually, she became desensitized, her resistance waning.

Eventually, she started to engage with the sketchbook, using it as an outlet for her pent-up emotions by sketching her own frustrations and sorrows onto its pages.

It was a three-month journey.

After those months, Daniela posed a question within its pages. "Who are you?"

The following day, the sketchbook was back in its usual spot, but this time it contained a sketch of a boy's profile, distinguished by a small, nearly hidden beauty mark near his eye.

Through their shared drawings, they arranged a meeting.

The next day, Daniela spent the entire day at the swing set, waiting, but no one appeared.

Summer faded into fall.

Fall gave way to the chill of winter.

Daniela maintained her vigil for a full year.

A year later, she began to speak again and returned to her studies.

The sketch of the boy's face became her treasured keepsake, securely stored in a safe in her room.

On her first day back at school, a new student joined the class.

The boy confidently swung open the classroom door, stepping in. He stood there, bathed in the gentle morning sunlight, exuding a poised and polished presence.

"Hello, everyone. I'm Alexander Bennett."
###Chapter 73 Repay


Once, Daniela had asked Alexander about it. "Are you the boy from those sketches?"

Alexander's lips tightened, and he responded dismissively, "Why dredge up the past now?"

To Daniela, his evasion felt like a tacit admission. If it were false, surely Alexander's forthright nature would have spurred a direct denial.

Yet, over time, she harbored doubts.

The boy from her past, who had filled that sketchbook with kindness and warmth, seemed entirely unlike Alexander, who was often detached and aloof. How could they be the same person?

She struggled to reconcile the two images.

Eventually, she ceased trying to piece it together, but occasionally, her eyes would drift to the barely noticeable spot near Alexander's eye where a mole had once been.

Alexander had once explained he had it removed because it made him look less masculine.

She had accepted his reasoning without question.

How could Alexander, with his pride and arrogance, fabricate such a tale?

Yet, now, as his dismissive words echoed, her old uncertainties reawakened.

"Are you really the boy I made that promise to beneath the tree hollow all those years ago?" she asked, her voice tinged with a hint of skepticism.

Already frustrated by his recent business setback, Alexander grew more irritated. "What are you implying?Do you believe I deceived you? Do you see me as someone who would lie about something so insignificant?" he retorted sharply.

His eyes narrowed, his voice sharpening defensively. "Daniela, I've always wondered-if I hadn't been that boy, would your treatment of me have been the same? Is your kindness just because of a few childhood drawings and three months of memories? Are you saying that all our shared experiences, all these years together, mean less than those brief moments?"

Alexander's gaze was piercing, challenging her to respond. "Tell me! Without those three months,would you have cared as much? Would you have been so patient? Would you have supported me as I built my business, or made me scarves to keep me warm?"

"No." Daniela's answer was prompt, her tone resolute and clear.

The word hit Alexander like a physical blow.

"Without those three months, I wouldn't have endured, wouldn't have cared as deeply as I did all these years."

She understood her own suffering and the neglect she'd felt.

Only a profound reason could have sustained her through such hardship.

For Daniela, it was the belief that the boy from her past was the kind, gentle soul she had once connected with.

Alexander scoffed bitterly, stepping back with a wild, nearly deranged smile. "Incredible, Daniela! You really exceed yourself! Now, you say whatever you please, huh?"

Daniela remained composed, her demeanor untouched by his sarcasm.

Alexander's tone became taunting. "So, what now? Continue being kind to me! Hand over the North District project! What happened to all those sentiments from your childhood? Have you forgotten them?"

He glared at her, his eyes aflame with intensity. "Didn't you claim I pulled you from your darkest days as a child? Didn't you vow to repay that debt? Very well, secure the North District project contract for me! Hand it over, and we'll call it square from here on out!"

Daniela remained motionless, a chill enveloping her heart, ice spreading through her veins. She gazed at Alexander, her eyes wide with disbelief.
This marked the second time she had been overwhelmed by her emotions since her return-her earlier turmoil had come when she cut ties with her father, Caiden.

And now, this moment.

She locked eyes with Alexander and demanded,"What did you just say?"

Alexander, now visibly more composed, suppressed the surge of irritation and turmoil within. "If you truly want us to settle all debts, then bring me the contract for the North District project. Otherwise, Daniela, you will forever be in my debt."

###Chapter 74 Contagious


Alexander's face darkened.

Daniela's words seemed to hit him hard, as though she had just wiped away all the effort and care she had shown him over the years.

So all her affection had been directed at the boy she believed he was.

All this time, she had been striving to please someone who wasn't truly him.

Alexander squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to push back the irritation swelling inside him. But it was pointless. The feeling tightened around his chest, choking him, making it almost impossible to think clearly.

"Daniela! You've got two days. Think it over. When you're ready, come to Bennett Group with your answer."

Alexander shot her a cold, hard stare, taking in her stunned, unmoving face before turning away without a word.

Daniela stood frozen, fighting to hold herself together. But Alexander's words kept ringing in her ears,shattering her composure. Her body started to shake.

Ten years.

How many decades did a person truly get in a lifetime?

For ten long years, she had loved Alexander completely, admired him, stood by him, and given up so much for him.

And now, he wanted her to hand over the North District project as a mere trade.

Was this really about the project?

To Alexander, their childhood bond was nothing more than another deal.

Daniela felt empty, the weight of it all crashing down. What had she been clinging to all this time? Her love, her loyalty, all the compromises she'd made-they meant nothing.

It was just a bitter joke at her expense.

Her body shook with a force she couldn't control. She struggled to stay upright, leaning forward with her hands braced on her thighs, desperate to regain some balance.

"Daniela!" Lillian's voice cut through the air as she rushed towards Daniela, security guards on her heels.But by the time they reached the entrance, Alexander was nowhere to be found.

Lillian came to an abrupt stop.

She'd never seen Daniela like this, not even when Daniela had ended things with Alexander.

Daniela stood in the soft glow of the morning, her legs slightly bent, hands pressing into her thighs for support. Her usual upright, strong posture had vanished, leaving her slumped and fragile.

She was trembling, not from fear, but from pure, unbridled rage.

Lillian's voice was quiet, hesitant. "Daniela?"

Daniela didn't face her. Instead, she lifted one hand from her knee, her voice rough and quiet as she said,"I'm fine. You can leave. I just need some time to pull myself together."

Lillian paused, uncertain, but then nodded for the security guards to go.

She stayed at the building's entrance, her gaze remained locked on Daniela.

It was the usual morning rush, with employees coming and going. As they spotted Daniela, many of them instinctively slowed, ready to offer a greeting. But before they could speak, Lillian subtly shook her head,signaling them to move on.

In an instant, the usually lively entrance fell into an unexpected silence.

Only when Daniela finally managed to straighten up did Lillian hurry over. She took Daniela's arm, her voice low and filled with concern. "Are you okay?"

Just as Daniela was about to nod, beads of sweat clungto her pale face, finally slipping down her skin. She spun around and hurried towards the restroom, barely making it before she was seized by a violent wave of nausea.

Inside the restroom, Joyce stood in front of the mirror, applying her lipstick.

The sound of someone rushing in caught her attention, and she glanced up just in time to see Daniela stumble towards a stall, Lillian hot on her heels.

When Lillian called out, "Daniela," Joyce couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement crossing her face.

She leaned casually against the doorframe, listening to the sounds of retching from the stall. "Daniela,throwing up this much so early? Don't tell me you're pregnant."

Lillian spun around, fury flashing in her eyes as she hissed,"Shut up!"

Joyce let out a soft laugh, clearly unfazed by the frustration in Lillian's voice. "Honestly, Daniela, even though you're no longer part of the Harper family and we're not sisters anymore, I feel like I should remind you of something. As women, we know that our first experiences are important. Sure, maybe you're used to being reckless, but now that you're leading Elite Lux, shouldn't you be more careful with your reputation?After all, you wouldn't want to bring shame to the company,right? But then again, I can see where you're coming from. Someone like you, always so cold and distant--it's no surprise you're all alone. Men probably steer clear of you, don't they? Unlike me, of course. I'm sweet, obedient, and gentle. Men can't get enough of me. Cedric, Alexander-men of real class, they're all at my feet. Tell me, Daniela, what do you think Dad would say if he knew you were fooling around with men before marriage? What if he found out you were pregnant and unmarried? Don't you think he'd regret not cutting ties with you sooner? You've always been a disappointment to the Harper family. And if word got out that you were pregnant out of wedlock, do you really think any wealthy family would want you?"

It was obvious that Joyce had been utterly bored in the restroom, trapped with no one to talk to all day.

So,when the chance to taunt Daniela came up, she wasn't about to let it pass her by.

Her constant jabbering filled the space, and gradually, the emotions choking Daniela's chest began to dull.

She straightened up, hit the flush button, and pushed open the stall door. Joyce gasped dramatically, "Daniela! What's with that pale face? Are you really pregnant?"

She leaned in, curiosity practically dripping from her tone. "So, who's the father of the baby?"

Daniela stopped herself from slapping her and instead signaled for Lillian to come over and help her out of the restroom.

Joyce didn't stop. "Daniela, you don't even know who the father is?" Her face contorted into a cruel grin."Ugh, Daniela! With all the deals the company's been landing lately, don't tell me you've been using your body to seal them? Seriously, you're disgusting! You don't even know who the father of your child is? But really, that's how it works, isn't it? Nobody owns up to, you know, transactions like that. Even if you get pregnant, it's always the woman left to deal with it. Poor thing! A child growing up fatherless, raised in a home without love-it's only going to turn out as messed up as you are! Let me give you some.."O

Suddenly, a slap cracked through the air, sharp and final, silencing Joyce mid-sentence.

For a moment, everything went quiet. Daniela exhaled deeply, feeling a wave of satisfaction. Sometimes,actions spokelouder than words.

With Lillian's support, she made her way out of the restroom.

Joyce stood frozen for a moment, stunned. She then hurried after Daniela, ready to shout at her retreating form, when, out of nowhere, a wave of nausea washed over her.

Her stomach twisted in a sickening churn.

She stumbled back to the toilet, bent over it, gagging and dry heaving.

Gripping the edge of the toilet, Joyce muttered under her breath, "Damn Daniela! Pregnancy isn't contagious, is it?"
###Chapter 75 He Could Endure Anything


Joyce exited the restroom, meticulously retouching her makeup.

Just as she finished, her phone vibrated with a text from Katrina. "Don't forget tonight's family dinner."

Joyce typed back,"Got it."

Another message quickly pinged. "You haven't been fooling around, have you? Remember, we can't have a repeat of last time! I've invited Richard and Alexander for tonight's dinner. I plan to talk about your engagement to Alexander."

Joyce's eyes sparkled with excitement. She was on the brink of becoming Alexander's wife.

Overwhelmed with elation, Joyce didn't wait for the workday to conclude. She grabbed her purse and left the office early.

Her heels clicked decisively against the floor as she made her way to the upscale salon upstairs.

At the salon, Joyce splurged on an exclusive annual membership card costing $500, 000, insisted on receiving the premier service they offered.

Joyce was in high spirits. Daniela's setback had already made her day sweeter, and now, the prospect of her imminent engagement to Alexander filled her with a sense of triumph.

As she lay on the treatment bed, fantasizing about her upcoming luxurious life, a jasmine aroma wafted into the room.

Normally, Joyce adored this fragrance. Yet today, as soon as it hit her senses, she sat up abruptly, her hand over her mouth, feeling queasy. Grabbing a glass of water, she gulped it down, attempting to quell the sudden nausea.

"What the hell is happening?" she whispered to herself, her frustration evident. "Pregnancy can't be contagious, can it? I need to keep my distance from Daniela!"
After her spa session, Joyce headed for the elevator. As the doors slid open, a brisk breeze swept through the lobby.

A man entered, covered in grime and still sporting a hard hat.Joyce's expression twisted into a scowl of disdain.Wheeling around, she was ready to chastise the man for his disarray. However, her rebuke froze on her lips when she recognized him.

"Cedric? What on earth happened to you?" She observed his condition-his clothing was caked with dirt and his face lined with sweat, as though he had come from a construction site.

The sight of him, so unkempt and incongruent with the setting, filled her with embarrassment. In her mind,she compared Cedric's ruggedness to Alexander's polished demeanor, and any residual affection she might have felt for Cedric evaporated.①

Without sparing him another look, Joyce straightened herself and walked briskly away.

Meanwhile, Cedric headed to the 25th floor.

Lillian was stationed outside the CEO's office, peering through the slightly open door.

Upon the sound of the elevator's arrival, she turned and saw Cedric, his appearance marked by toil and dust.She realized immediately that he hadn't bothered to clean up after leaving the construction site.

"Why did you come here like this?" she asked in a low voice.

Cedric glanced through the door's narrow crack. The office was quiet, empty of any activity.

"She's on the couch, asleep. Don't wake her," Lillian murmured, nodding towards the interior.

Those close to Daniela understood that she often sought refuge in sleep when troubled.

As a child, neglected and alone, she had learned to soothe her emotions through slumber-a coping mechanism that persisted into her adult life.

Cedric nodded in acknowledgment, catching his breath."Alright."

"How's everything at the site?" Cedric responded simply, "It's fine."

Lillian suggested, "You should really have someone else oversee the site. Can you manage shuttling back and forth like this? I heard your secretary even set up an office there. Cedric, you need to delegate. You can't keep going at this pace. It's too much. With all that's happening at Phillips Group, how can you handle it all?"

Managing a multibillion-dollar project was a colossal task, fraught with endless challenges.

For Cedric, the CEO, to personally monitor the site seemed to Lillian an unnecessary strain.

The construction environment was harsh, filled with dust, hardly suitable for someone of Cedric's stature.

Yet Cedric, his gaze still fixed on the office door, dismissed her concern with a gesture. "She's asleep. Go find a blanket and cover her."

Lillian shook her head. "That's not going to work. She's always on alert, even in sleep. If I touch her, she'll wake up right away."

The office windows were ajar, letting in a breeze that had cooled the room significantly.

Cedric frowned. "We can't have her catching cold. Get a blanket."

Lillian nodded and hurried off to fetch one.

Taking the blanket from Lillian, Cedric quietly pushed open the office door with careful steps.

He approached Daniela, crouching beside her and gently unfolding the blanket.

As he covered her,Daniela stirred slightly.

Her eyes, large and clouded with sleep, fluttered open, her voice soft and husky. "Cedric?"

Hearing his name from her lips momentarily disrupted his calm. He adjusted the blanket around her more snugly and whispered, "Go back to sleep." And she drifted off once more.

A pang of emotion tightened Cedric's chest. His eyes dwelled on the subtle redness beneath her eyes, emotions brewing inside him-a mix of heartache,tenderness, and a fierce protectiveness. He harbored a deep-seated urge to confront Alexander, to make him pay.

But he hesitated. Was Alexander still a fixture in her heart? If she still held feelings for him, then he would restrain himself.

Cedric remained crouched beside her, watching over her slumber. He waited until her breathing deepened,indicating she was fully at peace, before he quietly stood and exited the office.

Outside, Lillian exhaled deeply and muttered with evident disdain, "Alexander is such a scumbag!"

Cedric's face showed nothing, his features set in an impassive mask. His hands, however, betrayed his inner conflict, clenching and unclenching at his sides as he fought to keep his emotions in check.

###Chapter 76 All He Wanted


After a protracted silence, just as Lillian believed Cedric was on the verge of leaving, he broke the quiet unexpectedly.

"What did Alexander say? Do you know?"

Lillian wished he hadn't asked.

The mention of the topic seemed to ignite a fire within her.

Her face flushed with anger as she erupted. "That scumbag! Completely shameless! I've never encountered someone so vile!"

Cedric remained silent, maintaining a composed demeanor as he absorbed her tirade.

Once she had let off steam, Lillian elaborated, "Alexander insists that if Daniela wants to break things off completely, she needs to hand over the North District renovation contract as a trade! Can you believe it?The contract with Tyler is already signed, construction has started! Daniela has devoted years of love to him,supported him through thick and thin, even ended her first marriage for him! And now, he demands this contract as the price for their separation? Are we just supposed to comply? Who does he think he is-a king?"

Cedric's hands tensed, opening and closing as he fought the urge to react more strongly.

After a moment's pause, he asked in a level tone, "Does she really want to cut ties with him?"

Lillian answered without hesitation, "Absolutely! What's the point in prolonging this?"

Her quick response made Cedric pause, considering the potential impulsiveness of her answer. Gathering his thoughts, he proposed, "Do me a favor. Check on that. If she truly wishes to end things with him, I'll handle it."

Lillian looked at him, bewildered. "What are you suggesting? You mean to say you'd let go of the North District contract? Cedric, I might not know every detail, but I do know the enormous effort you've invested in that project. Over 500 design revisions! Are you really considering giving it up to Alexander?"

"No," Cedric stated resolutely. "I won't hand it over. There's another way to handle this. Alexander is only after profit, right? I've just secured a deal for a new international airline route. I'll offer that to him instead."

Lillian was visibly shocked.

An international airline route was a major asset, a lucrative investment that could generate immense profits over decades.

"That's far too generous for Alexander!" she protested, her voice tight with disbelief.

Cedric looked down at the calluses on his hands, his face composed, masking the storm of emotions within.In a steady voice, he affirmed, "I believe it's worthit."

He was prepared to sacrifice anything to extricate Alexander from Daniela's life.

He needed the construction rights for the North District building.

Articulating this, Cedric felt the full weight of his resolve.

He simply wanted Daniela, the girl from his childhood memories, to have a joyful, serene life.

He envisioned her living in a space he crafted, a place where her laughter would echo, free from any burdens.

For that dream, he was ready to relinquish anything.

Observing Cedric's determined gaze, Lillian gave a resigned nod. "Okay, I'll talk to her."

But Cedric had more instructions. "Just find out if she truly wants to sever ties. If she does, I'll take care' of the details. And don't let her know."

Lillian looked puzzled. "You're going to all this trouble and you don't want her to know? What do you gain from this?"

Cedric dismissed her concerns wwith a wave and went back to the construction site.
What did he stand to gain?

For Cedric, it was all about securing Daniela's happiness and peace.

He was resolute, prepared to do whatever it took.

As he headed back, his mind churned with anxiety. He was plagued by the fear that Daniela might not truly wish to cut ties, and the possibility that Alexander might reject the proposal.

His secretary, riding alongside him, voiced his disbelief bitterly. "Alexander won't turn this down. Do you realize the value of this deal? It could set the Bennett family up for generations! You've invested so mnuch into this airline-think of the contacts you've used, the countless meetings over drinks to secure it. And you're just going to give it away?"

Cedric's eyes stayed glued to the landscape fleeting past the car window.

To him, the airline route was more than just a business venture. He had conceived it amidst learning of Daniela's divorce, even naming it "Daniela Line."

It was intended for her-a way to offer escape and discovery if she ever felt adrift post-divorce.He dreamed of showing her the world, a gesture to help her shed her sorrows.

Unbeknownst to Daniela, Cedric had meticulously crafted countless plans for her, detailed and carefullylaid out, yet he had always hesitated to reveal them.

It wasn't solely insecurity. It was also fear.

Daniela was so admirable, so impeccable, that he often felt unworthy of her.

Cedric chuckled mirthlessly. In the presence of the woman he loved, he felt like a coward.

He returned to his refuge at the construction site, immersing himself in work, all the while eagerly awaitng a response from Lillian.

Elsewhere,Joyce had already arrived early at the hotel for the family dinner.

Sitting at the table, her anticipation radiating from her, she eagerly pulled out her phone and texted Alexander. "Alexander, are you on your way yet?"
###Chapter 77 Relatives


After a considerable delay,Alexander's response finally arrived. "On my way."

Joyce's excitement was palpable. She spun around to face Katrina, her eyes sparkling as she brandished her phone triumphantly. "Mom, Alexander's almost here!"

Katrina's smile was warm, filled with tender affection. She reached out, gently smoothing back a loose curl from Joyce's face. "You're about to become his wife, darling. It's time to put away childish things. How are things at Elite Lux?"

Joyce managed a nod, though her eyes darted away, betraying her nerves.going really well."

Unaware of Joyce's discomfort, Katrina pressed on. "Daniela really threw me for a loop this time, appointing you as a director. Forge strong bonds with your team, and when the time is right, invite them to join Harper Group. With that caliber of talent, our company could rival Elite Lux in no time!"

Joyce offered another nod, this one tinged with guilt.

She was keenly aware of her own qualifications-or lack thereof. Director? The title meant nothing to her.

So what if she was the toilet director? The paycheck was hefty, the duties were a breeze, and the grunt work stayed firmly with the team below her.

Sure, the job title wasn't exactly glamorous, but to outsiders, she was a director. As Daniela had pointed out,holding the title of director at Elite Lux carried a certain cachet. It didn't matter which department she oversaw. What really counted were the sizeable paycheck and the glittering prestige that came with the role.

When Joyce shared the news with her circle of friends, envy was the unanimous response.

Truth be told, the position was ideal-lacking in stress and devoid of any rigorous mental strain.

It was a welcome change from the high-pressure sectors of finance, marketing, or risk control that Caiden had previously thrust upon her.

 Why would she bother mastering those fields? She was destined to marry into the rich. She wasn't crafted for the grind; she was fashioned for a life draped in luxury and ease.

The gathering wasn't extensive, with the Harper family consisting only of the families of Caiden's siblings.

These people werelavishing Joyce with compliments, buoyed by Caiden's evident partiality towards her and Katrina.

"Joyce,you're truly remarkable! A director at Elite Lux and soon to be the wife of the CEO at Bennett Group.You're all set for life!"

"Absolutely! Andit's no surprise, considering who her mother is. She's every bit as intelligent and stunning as Katrina."

"Joyce, during my last trip to Elite Lux to catch up with Daniela, I didn't spot her anywhere. However, I did notice you lounging by the restroom, snacking. It was during working hours, wasn't it? Shouldn't you have been busy working?"

Joyce halted mid-reach across the table, her fingers poised in the air, as if frozen. After a tense moment,she managed a strained chuckle and replied, "Oh, that? My tasks for the day were all wrapped up, so I was just taking a little breather. Plus, at Elite Lux, nobody really has the nerve to question my schedule."

Laughter cascaded through the room, and several relatives nodded and gave Joyce approving thumbs-ups.

"You've really outdone yourself, Caiden-such a clever and accomplished daughter! Speaking of which, why isn't Daniela here tonight?"

The reality of severing ties with Daniela to secure Joyce's position was a secret Caiden had kept close to his chest;he lacked the courage to divulge it to the family.

"She's tied up with work," Katrina interjected, her face lighting up with a practiced smile that masked the underlying tension.

Wyatt Harper,Caiden's brother, saw an opportunity in the prestige and power of Elite Lux, especially now that his daughter had completed her college education. "Caiden, seeing as Daniela managed to secure a role for Joyce, perhaps she could also find a spot for my daughter? It doesn't need to be something high- level-just a managerial role would suffice."

Before Caiden could respond, Ronald Harper, Caiden's another brother, eagerly jumped into the conversation. "And while you're making arrangements, Caiden, maybe Daniela could also help find positions for my son and daughter-in-law?"(

A young couple at the table sprang to their feet, their smiles a blend of warmth and formality. "Thank you,Uncle!" they chimed in, their eyes alight as they addressed Caiden.

Despite their rare appearances at family events-often excusing themselves due to hectic schedules-here they were, punctually seated and instantly transforming the once sparse dinner into a bustling affair.

Ronald, flashing a grin at Caiden, boasted with a touch of pride, "Caiden, you're well aware of how capable they are. One's already mastered the role of a department head, and the other excels as an executive assistant. I suggest you have Daniela consider my son for managing a branch office and appoint my daughter-in-law as her assistant. For a pivotal role like executive assistant, it's prudent to keep it within the family. My daughter-in-law is not only efficient but also exceedingly dependable-she would significantly ease Daniela's burdens."

As Ronald concluded his proposition, a chorus of glasses clinked in a toast to Caiden, accompanied by broad, approving smiles.

Caiden exchanged a glance with Katrina, who returned a cordial, rehearsed smile and was just about to reply when Ronald interjected, "Caiden, your children have certainly carved out impressive paths for themselves, but we must support one another. It's only when the entire family prospers that we truly embody strength. You shouldn't monopolize the success, leaving the younger ones to fend for themselves."

Wyatt immediately joined in, topping off Caiden's drink with a hearty splash and turning a chastising look to Ronald. "Ronald, what are you implying? Caiden has always been our guardian angel. He's the first to spot any opportunity and make sure it's offered to us!"

In Ronald's and Wyatt's view, if Caiden could extend his generosity to Joyce, who wasn't even his own flesh and blood, how could he possibly overlook his own siblings and their children?

They didn't see it as a favor-it was an expectation, plain and simple. Caiden was supposed to manage it all,

as if it were his duty, without them saying a word.

The mere fact that they had to voice their needs already felt like a favor to him.

Moreover, hadn't their families extended their help to Caiden in times past? He was indebted to them. This was merely settling scores.

Caiden gulped down his drink, the sharp liquor searing his throat. With a heavy exhale, he conceded, "Sure."

Instantly, smiles blossomed on the faces around the table.

However, Joyce, seated next to Katrina, pulled gently at her sleeve. "Mom, dealing with Daniela won't be easy these days. She won't go along with this!"

After all, these relatives had never shown Daniela any kindness.

And now they expected her to secure jobs for their children? Daniela was no longer someone to be trifled with.

Katrina appeared unfazed by this. She decided to let them manage Daniela on their own.

The only thing that mattered to her was ensuring Joyce's engagement to Alexander was secured.

Turning Joyce into Alexander's wife-that was the ultimate goal, the one thing that truly mattered.
###Chapter 78 Is Joyce Pregnant


"Hey, Joyce, life must be good to you lately, huh? Looks like you've put on a few pounds." Ronald, seated across from Joyce, made the remark offhandedly.

Katrina turned to her daughter at his words. How much weight could Joyce have really gained?

Katrina subtly lifted her hand and pinched her daughter's arm, feeling the unexpected softness. "What's going on?" she inquired in a subdued tone.

Joyce,looking somewhat bothered, responded, "I don't know! l've just been really hungry all the time." As she spoke, she reached for a side dish.

Katrina's brow furrowed, about to comment, when the door to their private room burst open.

Richard and Alexander entered, smiling as they presented a thoughtfully wrapped gift to Katrina. "Sorry for the delay, Mr. and Mrs.Harper. Traffic was a nightmare," Richard apologized.

Katrina eyed Alexander, who seemed disengaged, more interested in his phone than the event.

Katrina beamed, encouraging Alexander to sit next to Joyce and addressing Richard warmly, "Oh, please,there's no need for formalities here. You can call my husband Caiden and me Katrina. Let's keep it relaxed."

Katrina was skilled at smoothing over any awkwardness, her words weaving a sense of unity and ease.

Her approach made it clear to all present; this gathering was more than a mere family dinner. It was a strategic move to cement an alliance between the two families.

This contrasted sharply with Daniela and Alexander's hastily arranged wedding, which had lacked a formal introduction to family members.

Now,with Alexander present, they nodded in approval.

He was mature and composed-a perfect match for Joyce.

"Alexander, I'm Joyce's second uncle, Wyatt. Over there is her third uncle, Ronald. We haven't had much interaction before, but from now on, let's keep in touch. We're family, after all." With a swift motion, Wyatt finished his drink in one gulp.

As he set down his empty glass, he noted that Alexander had only sipped his water.

His expression darkened momentarily, but he quickly masked it with a smile as he refilled his glass. "So,Alexander, I hear your business is flourishing. You're in the renovation industry, correct?"

Wyatt, who also owned a small renovation company, made a modest living with orders just in the hundreds of thousands annually. "Should you have any upcoming projects, consider involving me." He clapped the young man sitting next to him on the shoulder. "This is my son. He's green but eager.It would mean a great deal if he could shadow you and learn from the best. What do you think?"

Wyatt had done his homework before the dinner, aware of Alexander's significant status in the industry.Securing a position for his son under Alexander could potentially elevate their family's standing in the fiercely competitive local business environment.

Alexander stayed silent during Wyatt's proposal, prompting Katrina to intervene. "Let's focus on the meal,everyone.Alexander, don't worry about drinking. Make yourself at home, relax and enjoy the food."

Despite Wyatt's attempts to steer the conversation back to business, Katrina smoothly redirected each time.

Finally,Wyatt slammed his glass onto the table, chuckling scornfully. He realized that while Daniela, not being Katrina's bioogical daughter, could be subjected to familial pressures without much concern from Katrina, Alexander was a different story.

Alexander represented a direct benefit to Katrina, and she would not allow any encroachments on what she considered her personal asset.

Wyatt rolled his eyes at this.

Katrina remained unfazed. In her view, only she was entitled to reap benefits from her daughter or her prospective son-in-law.

As the meal progressed, a plate of steamed fish was served.

The fish, cooked to perfection without a drop of wwater, was tender and flavorful, a dish Joyce always relished.

Katrina slid the dish towards Joyce with a warm smnile, then turned to engage Richard. "Richard, when we first met, we were both in our early thirties. Now here we are, our children grown, time slipping by. It's remarkable how fast the years go, isn't it?"

Richard recognized Katrina's tactic immediately.

Everyone at the table understood.

Katrina was subtly setting the stage to steer the conversation towards Joyce and Alexander's impending union.

Richard offered a polite smile in return. "Yes, indeed, time does fly."

Earlier, en route to the dinner, Richard had discussed the situation with Alexander. He viewed Daniela as a coveted match currently beyond reach. For the moment, maintaining stability with Joyce was prudent.

By neither accepting nor dismissing the proposal outright, he could delay decisions until Daniela's intentions became clearer.

Shoud she show signs of a change of heart, a reunion might still be feasible. If not, Joyce would serve as an adequate alternative.

Feeling it was the right moment, Katrina began to extol Joyce's virtues enthusiastically. "Joyce is a wonderful girl. She's charming and unlike some young women who flounder at the sight of a suitor. No,Joyce has always shown exemplary discipline. She embodies the grace of a genuine lady, groomed to be the ideal spouse for a distinguished family. The man who marries her will indeed be fortunate. And you-"

"Urgh!" Joyce interrupted with a sudden gag, cutting Katrina off mid-sentence.

Katrina fixed her with a stern look. Now? At this critical moment while she was lavishing praise?

Joyce sat there, her face ashen, overwhelmed by the strong scent of the fish that she normally loved. Now,

it was repulsive, the smell invading her senses, triggering waves of nausea that coursed through her.

She pushed the plate away and muttered, "Please, go on."

Katrina's irritation was palpable as her eyes narrowed, but she quickly masked it with a forced smile,turning back to Richard. "Now, where was I? Oh yes, Joyce's character is impeccable. She's truly a wonderful-"

"Urgh!" Joyce gagged again, cutting Katrina off a second time.

Katrina's expression turned stormy with frustration. "Remove that fish!" she commanded the waiter sharply,her annoyance spilling over onto the staff.

When she faced Richard again, her expression had reset to one of calm and control, as if the previous outbursts had never occurred.

Richard couldn't help but be struck by her ability to maintain poise. Despite the awkward interruptions, she appeared utterly unruffled.

Internally, he cringed, feeling a secondhand embarrassment for her situation.
###Chapter 79 Maybe She's Really Pregnant


"Richard, I appreciate your time, so I'll get right to the point. You see, after Alexander and Daniela's marriage -which, frankly, was less than ideal-they ended their union just days after the ceremony," Katrina explained, her smile unwavering. "I admit, some of the blame falls on Caiden and me. We failed to guide Daniela appropriately. Her temperament really isn't cut out for domestic life. We could see Alexander and Joyce are a match made in heaven. Their chemistry is undeniable, and frankly, I'm quite fond of Alexander.I'll be blunt since everyone's here. Alexander is the perfect fit for my daughter, and I'm not settling for less.Richard, wouldn't it make sense to let him and Joyce be together?"

Richard was visibly stunned by her frank approach. He thought Katrina would wait for him to bring up the topic, but she mentioned it herself.

As the eyes of everyone around the table bore into him, he felt the weight of the moment.

Undeterred by Richard's silence, Katrina continued, "Of course, our approval isn't enough;your blessing is essential. But I know you have the foresight to look beyond our family's superficial prestige. Take Daniela,for instance. Despite her wealth, what does it truly amount to without her family's support? Does she even have anyone left to lean on? Any parents? Wealth is fleeting, and Daniela's fiery spirit hardly makes her manageable. Even during her time with Alexander, she maintained her distance. Did Alexander ever truly get close to Daniela?"

Richard pivoted, catching sight of Alexander's furrowed brow.

Katrina's laughter held a sly undertone as she teased, "No hand-holding, no kissing-what sort of romance is this? Merely Platonic? Despite her strong feelings for Alexander, she never wavered from her beliefs.There was a time when she had nothing to her name. Now, as the head of Elite Lux, she commands respect from hundreds of employees. Do you think she'd bother listening to you? Bennett Group's performance this year isn't even a third of what Elite Lux has achieved. In a family, the main earner often holds the reins. Had Alexander remained with Daniela, he certainly wouldn't be the one making decisions today."

Katrina's eyes flickered with triumph as she observed Richard's hardened gaze and pressed on. "However, Joyce is a different story. She's been nothing but sweet and endearing since her youth, maturing gracefully like fine wine." Her stare intensified as she spoke.

Richard was on the verge of responding when Katrina leaned forward to fillhis glass once more.

"My daughter now stands as the sole heiress to the Harper famil. You grasp the weight of that, don't you?Unlike Daniela, Joyce isn't idly waiting. Should today pass without a resolution, we will seek alternatives. As the heiress to the Harper family, she'll have no difficulty securing a match."

With a gentle smile and a look of sly confidence, Katrina's expression was enigmatic.

Richard was stuck in a tricky situation with no easy way out.

Katrina was keenly aware that Daniela's burgeoning success might tempt the Bennett family to mend fences.

Could she simply stand by and watch Daniela's and Alexander's lives remain intertwined?

Resolved, Katrina had determined that should the Bennett family spurn this chance, she would seek alternatives.

She was resolute: Joyce's golden years would never be sacriiced for a worthless, unfaithful fool.

Richard raised his glass to his lips, savoring a brief sip before attempting to set it down, only to find Katrina proffering her glassright in front of him.

With an unwavering smile, she suggested, "Shall we toast to new beginnings?"

Richard perceived Katrina's gesture as a call to take a stand.

The allure of the advantages Daniela offered was strong, yet thoughts of Joyce lingered...

Casting a sidelong glance at Alexander, who was absorbed in his phone and detached from the unfolding drama,Richard exhaled a resigned sigh, his fingers poised to clink glasses with Katrina.

But just as their glasses were about to meet, a disruptive retching noise halted the moment.

Katrina's gaze followed the near-touch of their glasses, thwarted unexpectedly. Richard placed his glass back on the table.

"Joyce, is everything alright?" he inquired, his tone laced with worry.

Joyce had been straining to tolerate the discomfort, yet the pervasive fishy odor overwhelmed her senses.

She flapped her hand in front of her face, her complexion ashen, and suddenly shoved her chair back,bolting towards the restroom of the secluded dining area.

A loud,gut-wrenching retch echoed from within.

An awkward hush descended over the room.

The continuous sound of gagging stripped the appetite from everyone present.

Katrina's brow creased in concern. "What could she have eaten to react like this? What's happening?Everyone, please, keep eating." She stood, attempting to smooth over the disruption.

Across the table, Ronald's wife leaned closer to him and murmured,"Why is Joyce so violently ill? Could she be pregnant?"

No sooner had she voiced the thought than a chilling silence fell over the room.

Oblivious to the sudden focus on her, she went on, "When I was expecting my first, the morning sickness was dreadful. Didn't Joyce mention the fish smelled particularly strong today? Though she's usually fond of it. If she's turned against it, perhaps she is indeed pregnant."

The speculative whispers triggered a vivid memory among the Harper family members.

Katrina had once remarked with absolute certainty, "Joyce is the epitome of innocence, never so much as held hands with anyone. She's never dated anyone at all."
###Chapter 80 Are You Pregnant


Richard's face became a mask of complexity.

Katrina slammed her hand down on the table, pointing furiously at Ronald's wife across from her. "What absurdity is this? How dare you suggest such a thing? Joyce doesn't even have a boyfriend. How could she possibly be pregnant? She has given her whole heart to Alexander. She's one of a kind!"

Katrina felt sure that everything was aligning perfectly. But then, an unexpected twist threw her plans into disarray.How could she contain her anger?

She scowled, gearing up to press her agenda with Richard, when he suddenly stood.

With a courteous smile, Richard addressed Katrina. "Given that Joyce seems unwell, perhaps it's best we cut this dinner short. Katrina, I appreciate your sentiments, but these matters should really be left to the younger ones to decide. There's no need to rush. Indeed, a young woman's best years are valuable, and careful consideration is essential. Should there truly be a suitable match for Joyce, we would wholeheartedly give our blessings."

Katrina was stunned. She scrambled for words to defend Joyce, but Richard had already turned to Alexander, signaling their departure. "Alexander, let's head out."

As Katrina and Caiden saw them off, Katrina hurried to clarify to Richard. "Please understand. Joyce ate something cold earlier, which upset her stomach. Please, forgive this misunderstanding. You're absolutely right-finding true love is essential, and I firmly believe Alexander is perfect for Joyce. Now that Daniela is out of the picture, nothing should stand in their way!"

Keeping pace with Richard's strides, Katrina struggled in her high heels.

Richard paused only to offer a parting word before climbing into his car.

"Katrina, I've taken in everything you've said. The young people indeed seem well-suited, but if Joyce is indeed feeling unwell, perhaps a doctor's visit would be prudent, just to rule out any concerns. Only then can we all truly rest easy,don't you agree?"

Katrina fully grasped the weight of Richard's parting words.

For the Harper and Bennett families to successfully unite, Joyce couldn't be pregnant.

Katrina and Caiden maintained their smiles as they bid Richard and Alexander farewell.

However, as soon as their car disappeared from view, Katrina's suppressed fury resurfaced. She stormed back into the private dining room and struck Ronald's wife across the face. "You fool! What rubbish are you spouting? Just because you've had a child, you think you know better?"

Ronald's wife heId her cheek, her voice meek. "I was merely making conversation. I never imagined Richard would take it to heart.Besides, if Joyce isn't pregnant, it's merely a jest. Why such a harsh reaction?"

Katrina found herself gasping for air, overwhelmed by frustration.

Someone else interjected, "Exactly, if Joyce isn't really pregnant, what's the harm in the comment? Why the outrage?"

Ronald, humiliated by the public spectacle, challenged Katrina. "You're overstepping, Katrina! Remember,before you married Caiden, you were just a street vendor. Now you lord over us as if you've always been above us. Control your daughter better! I'm convinced Joyce is pregnant. She's unmarried and bringing disgrace upon our family. Like mother, like daughter! You're no better than Caiden's first wife. Joyce is far worse than Daniela ever was."

The comparison to Daniela's mother infuriated Katrina more than anything else. She pointed furiously towards the exit. "Get out! All of you, get out now!"

Ronald protected his wife, his sneer cutting through the tension.this your party, or does it belong to the Harpers? Who are you to order us around? If you're so confident, have Caiden disown us!"

Katrina closed he eyes, overwhelmed by the chaos.

Joyce reappeared from the restroom looking worse for wear. She felt dizzy and her elegant dress was ruined, damp and clinging awkwardly. Her hair was unkempt, adding to her disheveled appearance. "Mom, where's Alexander?"

By then, the room had emptied, the relatives having departed in a wave of moral outrage. Katrina, left with the aftermath,'slammed her hand on the table in frustration.

All her meticulous arrangements had come to nothing.

Observing Joyce's changed appearance and considering her recent nausea, Caiden suggested, "She's gained some weight and her stomach's upset. We should probably take her to the hospital for a checkup."

Caiden's naivety was almost legendary. While everyone else understood the underlying tension, he alone took Katrina's word at face value, believing Joyce had merely eaten something disagreeable.

On the drive home, Caiden sat upfront, the picture of oblivious contentment. Katrina, meanwhile, was a storm of thought in the back seat,her mind whirling with plans.

Once home, while Caiden retired upstairs, Katrina detained Joyce in the living room, fixing her with an intense,scrutinizing stare.

Slowly, emphasizing each word, she demanded,"Are you pregnant?"
###Chapter 81 She' Extraordinary
Joyce pursed her lips and gave a silent nod.



Katrina briefly closed her eyes, letting out a long,slow breath.



Joyce clutched her mother's hand, her voice shaky."Mom, the doctor said if I go through with the abortion, I may never be able to have children again."


Katrina paused, taking a moment to think over her words.



"After tonight, the Bennett family will be watching your every move. You'll have to find someone else to marry," Katrina said, fixing Joyce with a firm look.



Joyce's eyes grew wide with confusion."What? Who would I marry?"


Her mind flickered back to that night at the bar-everything was a blur through the haze of alcohol.


Nothing had been clear to her in that fog of drunkenness.



The only thing she could remember was waking up the next morning, catching a glimpse of someone slipping out the door. She vaguely recalled a mole on the back of his neck, but everything else was a blur.

"Alexander's off the table," Katrina muttered under her breath. "You need someone stable, someone reliable. In all of Olisvine, Cedric is your best bet."



Joyce hesitated, biting her lip nervously. "But would he even say yes? He barely even talks to me."


The weight of her situation was sinking in. Pregnant,unmarried, and no clue who the father was-if people found out, she'd become the subject of ridicule.



Katrina looked at her daughter's panicked, bewildered expression and let out a deep, resigned sigh.


"If Cedric refuses, we'll find someone else willing to marry into our family. That way, your father and I can ensure you're taken care of."



Joyce rested her chin in her hand, pondering it."Then I'll go with Cedric. Life's too long to waste on someone I can't even tolerate."


She knew that anyone desperate enough to marry into their family probably wouldn't be much of a prize.


Joyce had always been pampered, putting her own comfort above everything else.



Katrina stared at her daughter in silence for a moment,completely at a loss for words.


After a long pause, she sighed again, her voice soft."Let mne handle it."
 
 As they drove home, Richard glanced over at Alexander and asked, "Joyce is pregnant, it seems.What's your take on that?"


He couldn't stomach the idea of losing the Harper family's fortune.


Joyce,with her impulsive, naive nature, was easy to manipulate.



As Katrina had warned, trying to control Daniela the way they controlled Joyce was futile. Daniela was not someone they could bend to their will-not now,not ever.



Alexander stayed silent, his eyes glued to his phone.


Richard leaned back in the back seat, his voice calm and detached. "Honestly, whether there's a child or not, it doesn't really matter to me. You don't love her,after all. Just treat it like taking in a stray animal-don't let it complicate things. As for who you choose to be with outside of this marriage, that's entirely up to you. I won't get in your way."


He glanced at Alexander. "So? What do you say?"


Alexander, clearly uninterested, didn't look up from his phone as he answered,"Whatever you say."


He had long given up any hopes or expectations for marriage.

Whether it was Daniela or Joyce-it was just exchanging one face for another.


To him, there was no real difference.



That was how he had always seen it.



Now, as he sat there, loosening his tie,he convinced himself that nothing had changed.


If Alexander outright rejected it, Richard would push even harder. But when Alexander agreed without hesitation, Richard hesitated.



"Give it two weeks," Richard said after a beat. "If nothing comes of you and Daniela by then, youcan marry Joyce."


The pregnancy didn't matter. Joyce's family would make up for it.


In Richard's view, it was hardly a bad deal.


What happened between Alexander and Joyce after the marriage? That wasn't his concern.


With that thought, Richard looked out the window, his mind wandering in its own direction.







Once he had sent Lillian to gauge Daniela's feelings,

Cedric didn't look away from his phone, his focus locked on the screen.



For the first time ever, a hint of fear flickered within him.



He paced restlessly across the familiar construction site,where he was known to everyone.



Catching sight of the site supervisor passing by,Cedric called out, "Marco, got a smoke?"


Marco Pittman, a no-nonsense guy, grinned as he dug into his pocket. "Well, well, I didn't expect you to ask for a smoke," he remarked with his thick accent,pulling out a cigarette and offering it to Cedric.


The workers regularly offered Cedric cigarettes,but he always declined. Most people thought he didn't smoke.



And yet, here he was now, sitting down on the ground with a cigarette in hand.


Still wearing his hard hat, he leaned back, staring up at the skyscraper towering before him, its sharp edges cutting into the sky.


With a satisfied smile, Marco said, "This year's shaping up nicely. We'll have something to celebrate come the New Year."
Cedric stayed quiet, lost in his thoughts. Marco turned to him, grinning. "Mr. Phillips, you're young,but you've got the work ethic." He flashed a big thumbs-up, then added, "Not many guys like you these days-down-to -earth and dependable."


Cedric gave a faint smile, the cigarette still smoldering between his fingers, not yet touched.



"But honestly, with your status as a CEO, what are you doing out here? I saw your name in the financial news.You're handling deals worth billions. So what brings you to the site?" Marco asked curiously.



Cedric's smile lingered as he tilted his head back, his gaze fixed on the towering structure before him. A glimmer of a smile flickered in his eyes,as though he could already see Daniela stepping into the building -radiant,confident,and completely untouched by the wind or rain.



"I don't have anyone behind me. Everything I've built,I did it step by step, with hard work and setbacks.I've been reckless before and spent lavishly on sports cars and mansions. Had it all, but none of it felt meaningful." His crisp white shirt was streaked with dirt, but it didn't seem to bother him.



There was such honesty in Cedric's voice; it didn't come across as boasting. It felt more raw, more sincere.
The cigarette burned down to the filter in his hand,but he hadn't taken a single drag. He snuffed it out on the ground and said, "But this project I'm working on,this one feels meaningful."


In the warmth of the morning sun, Cedric shared something personal with someone he barely knew.


Marco laughed, giving Cedric a hearty slap on the back. "You remind me of myself when I was chasing after my wife years ago. So, who's the lucky girl?"



He scratched his head, thinking it might be someone from the site. "But that doesn't make sense. With your looks and status, why would you go through all this?"



Cedric let out a soft chuckle. "She's beyond amazing She's so extraordinary that just thinking about her feels almost wrong."



Marco let out a low whistle, teasing, "Sounds like you're chasing an angel straight from the heavens!"


At that moment, Cedric's phone buzzed, the notification pulling his attention away.
###Chapter 82 We Are Her Family Too
Cedric lowered his head and checked the message.


Lillian replied, "Daniela said Alexander could go to hell!"



In an instant, Cedric's face lit up with a broad grin.


He leapt to his feet, his mood visibly lifting. Marco,who had been observing him closely, caught the sudden shift. Just seconds before, Cedric had been restless. Now, he radiated a surge of determination and vitality.



Marco raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "What's up?"


Cedric stretched,his joints popping satisfyingly. "Time to take on the world for my princess!"



Marco couldn't help but smile at Cedric's enthusiasm,which was downright contagious.


As Cedric dashed toward the construction site, Marco shouted after him, "Don't forget to send me an invite to your wedding with her!"



Cedric's laughter boomed across the bustling site,full of life and promise. "Deal!"


In the midst of the chaos, Cedric's assistant maneuvered around heaps of steel and concrete, his arms laden with documents.



He was baffled at how Cedric seemed so much more content here, amid the disarray of the construction site, than in the tranquility of his plush office. 2







At Elite Lux



Lillian collapsed onto Daniela's desk with a dramatic flair, her chin propped on her folded arms. "Are you seriously going to just brush off Alexander like that?"


Daniela glanced up from the paperwork in her hand,one eyebrow arching in skepticism. "Do you honestly think I've lost my senses?"



She had zero interest in rehashing old grievances with Alexander or considering the North District project as some sort of compensation for bygone favors.



What could he possibly do if she refused? Take legal action?



Lillian asked, "So, what about the past? The sketches and all that... Are you really ready to dismiss it all?"
During Daniela's previous, infatuation-laden phase,Lillian had been genuinely alarmed, dreading that Daniela might surrender the North District project to Alexander out of some residual affection. Such a decision would crush Cedric.



To Lillian's relief, Daniela seemed more rational and detached than ever.



With a nonchalant shrug, Daniela dismissed the concerns. "Forget about it. Anyway, we've got to visit the North District site this afternoon. I need to oversee the progress myself. It's going to be Elite Lux's flagship domestic branch, so it has to be flawless."



Lillian opened her mouth to reply when suddenly, the sharp ring of the secretary's call interrupted them.



"Miss Harper, two gentlemen asserting they're your uncles have arrived. One calls himself Ronald, the other Wyatt. In the brief ten minutes since their arrival, they've managed to clear out the snack tray in the lounge. Actually, they've shoved snacks into their pockets."



Daniela's brow furrowed in annoyance. "Inform them I'm tied up in a meeting. I'm unavailable today."


These individuals were no different from Caiden-cut from the same cloth.

Back when her mother was still alive, they had whispered harshly about her, branding her as domineering and manipulative, and they didn't hesitate to spread those tales to anyone outside the family circle.



After her mother's death, not one of them had bothered to show up at her funeral.


Yet when Katrina had married into the family, they had draped over her, calling her "sister-in-law" with a cloying sweetness that was almost repulsive.



Over the years, Daniela had distanced herself from these relatives and had no desire to bridge that gap now.



Her priorities lay elsewhere-signing more contracts and boosting the company's bottom line was far more appealing.


Once Daniela ended the call, the secretary stepped into the lounge, wearing a practiced, polite smile. "I'm terribly sorry, but Miss Harper is currently engaged in a meeting and will be occupied for the remainder of the day. Unfortunately, she won't be able to meet with you."


Ronald's brow furrowed as he turned to Wyatt, his tone laced with disbelief. "Seriously? What the hell is her problem? We're her damn uncles, for crying out

loud!"



Wyatt rose to his feet, his voice firm as he addressed the assistant. "Pass this along to Daniela: because of her, we've severed ties with Katrina. We're backing Daniela now. She needs to come down and see us."



The assistant kept a courteous smile plastered on her face."I'll convey your message, gentlemen, but as l mentioned earlier, Miss Harper is engaged in a meeting and really can't spare any time today."



Wyatt's expression darkened and turned to Ronald."What do we do now? Are we really just going to walk out like this?"



Ronald leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper,tinged with urgency. "Walk out? Are you out of your mind? Katrina is no help with the jobs at Elite Lux. If we don't talk to Daniela, we're going to end up jobless and destitute! We stay right here, even if it takes all day. If she won't talk here in the lounge, we'll confront her in the parking lot. Daniela managed to secure a position for Joyce. Why the fuck can't she do the same for us? Aren't we her family too?"

###Chapter 83 A Shameless Family
Standing in the parking lot, Wyatt scowled, his irritation clear. "Why am I the one dealing with Daniela's mood swings? It's your wife who couldn't keep her mouth shut and upset Katrina. How's that my problem?"


Ronald turned,his disbelief evident. "Not your problem?Are you kidding me? Do you think Katrina's a fool?She's as stuck-up as they come, always putting Joyce on a pedestal. Do you really believe she'd go out of her way to ask Daniela to help you? Keep dreaming.Just wait and watch!"



Wyatt let out a heavy sigh,his frustration matching Ronald's. With so many mouths to feed at home,being jobless wasn't an option. They'd be drowning in bills. If things weren't so dire, he wouldn't have stooped to asking Daniela for a favor.


"Ronald, do you really think Daniela will help us after all the crap we've said about her and her mother?"Wyatt asked.



"Why wouldn't she?" Ronald scoffed, his bulky frame shaking with disdain. "If Joyce can land a cushy job, why not us? We're her uncles! And if she refuses, I'll cause a media uproar. She's a CEO-her reputation matters. She'll have no choice but to give us something. If Joyce can become a director, we deserve nothing less than a top role, maybe even a CEO gig!" ②


Wyatt's face lit up, a glimmer of hope flickering in his eyes.


Daniela had stayed at work late that evening. The moment she stepped out of the elevator,she noticed two familiar faces waiting near the entrance.



The underground parking garage was nearly empty,the silence broken only by the soft echo of her heels."Do you need something?" she asked and instinctively stepped back into the elevator.

Before she could close the doors, Ronald's hand shot out,holding them open.


"What's with the hesitation, Daniela? It's just us-family. We stopped by your office earlier, but you were tied up. Thought we'd catch you here since it's on your way out," Ronald said with an overly cheerful grin, keeping the doors from shutting.


Wyatt chimed in, nodding eagerly. "Long day, huh,Daniela? You must be exhausted." Reaching into his pocket, he produced some snacks he'd pocketed from the waiting room earlier. "Here, have a bite."


Daniela gave a faint smile, already calculating her limited options. At this hour, help wasn't exactly on standby. With steady composure, she stepped out of the elevator and asked, "Alright, what do you want?"


Ronald trailed behind as Daniela walked to her car.The moment their eyes fell on her limited-edition luxury vehicle, the two brothers exchanged wide-eyed looks of disbelief.


A car worth millions, and she treated it like just another ride? The extravagance floored them. ②



Spotting the opulence, Ronald's hopes of securing a job grew even stronger.


Smiling slyly, he said,"Alright, Daniela, let's cut to the chase. You got Joyce a job, didn't you? Well,we're family too. Isn't it only fair you help us out as well?"


Daniela didn't even break her stride at his words. She was already standing beside her car. For a moment,she stayed silent.


Wyatt added eagerly, "Exactly, we're family! You can't just favor Joyce. Don't forget when..."


He fumbled, trying to recall some past favor they'd done for Daniela, but his mind came up empty. The awkward silence only made his embarrassment worse.
Ronald gave Wyatt an exasperated look and shoved him aside. Turning to Daniela, he said, "Listen, Daniela,when you were a kid, we were the ones looking out for you. Don't let money make you forget your family.One day, when you're in trouble, it's us you'll need,isn't it?"


Daniela's eyes dropped for a moment.


Family?Really?



She remembered when her mother had jumped off that building. The doctor had asked for help with the stretcher, but these two didn't lift a finger.


In the end, it was a stranger who stepped in to help.



The years hadn't dulled the memory of their cold,disdainful expressions. They were burned into her mind.


That was the moment when she felt utterly powerless,surrounded by her so-called family. Ronald had whispered cruelly, "Why would she commit suicide?Did she cheat on her husband?"



Wyatt had sneered. "Who knows? Always flaunting her fancy clothes and acting so important. Who knows how many men she's been involved with?" 


And now, here they were,claiming to be "family."
Ronald, noticing her silence, decided to play tough.He scowled and said, "Daniela, let me make this clear-we're not here to beg. If Joyce gets something,we expect the same. If not, we'll make sure everyone knows how you turned your back on your family.Elite Lux just made its big return, and you wouldn't want bad press, would you? I know how much people like you value their imnage."


Ronald was always full of big talk. He'd spent a few years as a mid-level manager before running his mouth and getting fired. In his mind, his argument made perfect sense.	


Wyatt,as usual,just nodded in agreement.
###Chapter 84 A Slice Of The Pie

Ronald's fists were balled up, his eyes burning with fury. Every muscle in his body was coiled tight, as though he was seconds away from charging at anyone who dared provoke him.



Daniela stood poised and unbothered, a soft smile playing on her lips.


She was dressed in a stunning white gown from Elite Lux's latest collection. The dress hugged her tall,elegant frame, the perfect tailoring emphasizing her every curve, while pearls dangled from her ears,highlighting her glowing complexion with understated elegance.



Ronald and Wyatt gritted their teeth, doing everything they could to force Daniela into a corner.



At the sight of approaching security, Ronald's gaze turned cold as he leaned closer to Daniela, his voice low and menacing. "We're at rock bottom, Daniela,and we've got nothing to fear from someone with so much to lose. My debts are stacking up, my family's out of work, and we're barely scraping by. If you don't give me an answer today, it's simple: either you'll be six feet under, or I'll climb tothe top of the building and end it all! Blood will spill in front of your precious tower, and then let's see how well your business runs after that!"



He knew how to make a threat feel real.



Daniela nearly applauded his dramatic performance.



Lillian, who had just entered, shot them a disapproving look.



She was about to snap when Daniela held up a hand to stop her. Turning slightly, Daniela winked at her and said in a teasing, yet firm tone, "These are my uncles,Lillian.Show a little respect."



Lillian blinked, momentarily taken aback, but quickly understood the cue. With a quiet "okay," she stepped back,folding her arms across her chest.


When Daniela faced Ronald and Wyatt again, her demeanor became more sincere.



Ronald and Wyatt were momentarily caught off guard,but their smirks quickly resurfaced.


Internally, Ronald couldn't contain his satisfaction. No matter how successful Daniela was, he knew she was still beneath him.



His chest swelled with pride, certain that he had the 
upper hand.


Wyatt watched Ronald with admiration, clearly impressed by what he thought were top-tier negotiation tactics.


"I always knew you were sharp. Smarter than Katrina and Joyce, for sure. Now, let's cut to the chase.What role can you get us?"


Ronald misread Daniela's calmness as a sign of defeat,his confidence growing.



His whole attitude screamed victory, as if the battle was already over.


Behind Daniela,Lillian couldn't hide her contempt. She rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. They were the ones begging. How could they be so clueless about their own situation?



Daniela stayed as composed as always, her voice polite yet unwavering. "I've always recognized your potential. You just need to find the right opportunities.Otherwise,you would have been in roles like manager,president, or even chairman by now."


Even Ronald, who usually exuded arrogance,was momentarily taken aback. But as her words resonated,he found himself agreeing. "Exactly! It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that no one's ever truly recognized our potential."
Wyatt, in contrast, was overcome with emotion.His eyes welled up as he looked at Daniela. "That's what family does! We understand each other. You've always seen what we're capable of."


Daniela gave a slight nod, her smile unshaken. course."



Ronald wasn't completely sold, though. Narrowing his eyes,he asked, "What about the salary?"


Daniela raised a finger. "Your annual salary? It's this much."



Wyatt hesitated, his voice uncertain. "Ten thousand?"It didn't seem like a lot.



Daniela's smile widened. "One million."



Ronald's mouth fell open. "What? One million?"



The jobs they had been barely scraping by with only brought in fifty or sixty thousand a year. Yet, Daniela was offering a million right away.


Ronald nodded eagerly, his face lighting up with greed."Deal! We'll start work tomorrow. One million it is!"


Wyatt, just as thrilled, nodded enthusiastically,his mind racing at the thought of such a massive paycheck.

A million!



"Work, you said? I'm afraid that's not going to happen."While they were still basking in the excitement of their imagined victory, Daniela smoothly opened the car door and motioned for Lillian to get in.



Ronald's smile wavered as he watched her settle into the car. His brow furrowed, and his voice turned serious. "What do you mean? Are you messing with us?"


"Of course not. You just said it yourself. I should arrange jobs for my family."



Ronald gave a quick nod. "Correct."



Daniela's face grew serious. "Family comes first for me. Look at Joyce, for example. She's utterly useless,and she can't do a single thing. Yet, I still offered her this much."



She held up a finger again.



Ronald's eyes widened, thinking Daniela was talking about one million for Joyce.



Daniela's voice softened, pretending to feel regret,her long lashes fluttering downward. "But after Joyce joined Elite Lux, Caiden cut all ties with me as his daughter. Ronald's and Wyatt's eyes went wide in shock.


Daniela continued, "So we're no longer family. And because of that, I can't justify helping you or arranging jobs for you. I just don't get why Katrina had to do this.I had already agreed to let Joyce join the company,but still, she made Caiden sever ties with me. As for me, I'm okay. I've got enough money, plenty of people around, and more than enough friends. But you two, and the rest of the family... Without that connection, there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied."



Starting the car with a careful look of regret, she went on, "I suppose the next time we meet, it wouldn't be right for me to call you 'uncles' anymore. Anyway, I'll be on my way now. Take care."


With that, Daniela revved the engine, and the car sped away,leaving behind only a cloud of exhaust.


Ronald's and Wyatt's expressions contorted with fury.



"That damn Katrina!" Wyatt hissed, his voice tight with anger as he ground his teeth. "She shoved her daughter into the spotlight and left us in the dust!"



Ronald,barely able to contain his rage, struck the wall with his fist. "Katrina, you played us dirty! Don't expect us to just sit back and take it!"

###Chapter 85 Turning Down Money Like That
Lillian leaned back in the passenger seat, her laughter so uncontrollable that she had to clutch her stomach to keep from doubling over.


"They're unbelievable! How can they be that clueless?But, Daniela, that was pure genius! You flipped everything onto them so smoothly."



Daniela gave a small smile, keeping her focus on the road. "I'll let them deal with their own mess."



If not for the endless complications, Daniela would've changed her last name by now.



Lillian couldn't stop giggling. But as time passed, her laughter slowly faded away. She looked out the window. "Where are we headed?"


Daniela answered, "I've got some free time, so l figured I'd stop by North District to check on the progress. It's been hectic lately, and you and Ryan have been doing most of the heavy lifting. You both deserve a break."



At this, Lillian froze. She quickly grabbed her phone to text Cedric, but there was no response. Meanwhile, Daniela parked the car with ease and unbuckled her seatbelt. She noticed Lillian fidgeting uncomfortably beside her. "What's going on with you?"she asked, a little confused.



Lillian stumbled over her words.



The moment Daniela stepped out of the car,she instantly knew what was going on.


Beneath the skeletal structure of a half-built high-rise,a man in a hard hat was giving orders to workers adjusting ropes high above.


"Pull tighter! That's it! Don't worry, I've got an eye on things from down here."



From the sound of his voice, Daniela knew exactly who it was.



The man stood with his back to her, completely oblivious to Daniela's presence as she watched from a distance.



His white shirt was marked with yellow stains, and one of his pant legs was rolled up to his knee. His leather shoes were stuck deep in the thick mud.


The width of his shoulders made Daniela pause briefly,her mind wandering. Lillian, who had been standing beside her, quietly broke the stillness. "Daniela?" she whispered.



"How long has this been happening?" Daniela asked,without looking away from Cedric.



Lillian hesitated, aware there was no way to hide it anymore.



Before Lillian could speak, Daniela stated, "So Cedric is the one backing Tyler's company."



It wasn't a question, but a statement.



Lillian shifted uneasily and rubbed her hands together."Yeah," she confessed.



Daniela's hand, resting at her side, clenched into a fist.



She remained still for a while. But just before Cedric could turn and see her, she turned and slid back into the car.



"You should've told me earlier," she said, gripping the steering wheel tightly.



"Cedric didn't want us to tell you. He didn't want to be a burden."



"Honestly, he wasn't wrong," Daniela replied with a sigh. "It does feel like a burden." She really hated being in a position where she owed someone a favor -especially when she wasn't sure if she could ever return the kindness.



The very idea unsettled her. Daniela had been burned before,her heart broken by love.



She knew better than anyone how deeply disappointment could wound a person, how it could tear them apart. She didn't want Cedric to go through that same kind of pain.



Back at the office, Daniela asked Ryan for the budget report.



Numbers were her forte. It didn't take her long-just over an hour-and she had gone through the numbers,recalculating everything.



By the time Cedric rushed into the office, she had already set her pen down.



He was still in the same dirt-streaked clothes from earlier, panting as if he'd sprinted all the way there.


The office was dimly lit, with only the desk lamp casting a soft glow. Daniela lifted her eyes to find Cedric standing in the doorway, his shadow stretching long across the floor from the hallway lights behind him.



He stepped inside, quickly rolling down the sleeves he'd pushed up earlier, clearly trying to gather himself. He paused in front of her desk, his voice steady but urgent. "I can explain."


As he spoke, Cedric's gaze drifted to the scattered papers on her desk, each one covered with columns of handwritten numbers.



His eyes narrowed as he recognized them immediately -the actual figures from the project's accounts.


They were nothing like the ones Ryan had handed in earlier.



"Listen, as for the building materials, most of them come from Phillips Group. Since we're old classmates,I've been giving you factory rates. I'm still making a profit,so it's fair," Cedric stated, adjusting his posture just a bit. Despite his reputation as a tough, no-nonsense business tycoon, he suddenly seemed uncertain,almost regretful.


Daniela didn't respond. She didn't even bother taking off the anti-fatigue glasses resting on her nose. Her quiet, steady gaze seemed to weigh heavily on him,and he shifted uncomfortably under it.


"Construction can be tricky," he quickly added,his voice now a bit more shaky. "I've been in this industry long enough to know how it works, Daniela. Some parts need top-notch materials, while others don't.I've made sure to balance things out to keep costs down. Believe me, the profit here is more than fair."


Still silent, Daniela watched him. Cedric began to fidget,wiping the sweat forming on his forehead.


She took off her glasses, grabbed a tissue from the desk, and handed it over to him. Cedric accepted it,using it to wipe his forehead.



She gave him a slight, almost tired smile. "The more you talk, the more it feels like you're just trying to come off as innocent."



His eyes widened in surprise. "What? No! That's not true!"



His voice dropped, carrying a note of grievance, as if the accusation stung him deeply.


Daniela rested her chin on her hand and motioned for him to take a seat across from her.



After he sat down, she pushed a sheet of paper towards him. "This is the payment schedule from here on out."



Cedric didn't even spare a glance at the paper, quickly blurting out, "That's not needed."



Daniela interlaced her fingers on the desk and looked him in the eye. "Then I'll just cancel the contract."

She grabbed her calculator, tapping it with a small frown. "Let me figure out what I owe you for the penalties."


Cedric went still, a chill creeping in. No matter how sharp he was in business, Daniela always had a way of trapping him completely.


"Fine. Let me at least offer you a discount."


"Seriously, you don't need to do this."


Just then, Ryan stepped into the room, catching the moment. It wasn't exactly common to see someone turning down money like that.
###Chapter 86 Are You Seeing Cedric
Daniela meticulously calculated the final settlement figures and presented Cedric with an impressive 80%profit margin.


She further sweetened the deal by reserving five expansive floors in the upcoming skyscraper for Phillips Group's office space.



Cedric, fervently punching numbers into his calculator,abruptly realized his oversight-his good fortune had inadvertently come at her expense.


As he stepped out of the building, a veil of frustration shadowed his expression.



Numbers were her playground, and his skills simply couldn't match her extraordinary intellect.



Lillian couldn't hold back her frustration any longer."Honestly, Cedric, you're acting like a total coward!What's got you so terrified?"



Ryan observed the exchange with keen interest, his arms folded tightly against his chest.



Lillian continued, "Just open up to her! Admit you're smitten. You're clearly putting in the effort; so what's holding you back? See how she takes it! Or are you really just going to hide behind this 'just friends'facade?"



Cedric's frustration reached its peak. "I want to confess,I really do. But every time I approach her, her piercing gaze and her unyielding grasp of the data intimidate me. I'm used to the rough and tumble of construction sites, not the sharp world of numbers.Each time I try to speak, her incisive stare cuts me off.What can I do?"



Lillian exhaled sharply, frustration evident in her voice."Cedric, I can't believe how shy you become around her!"



Once Cedric had departed, Lillian shook her head disapprovingly. Ryan, tilting his head and wearing a mischievous grin, inquired, "Didn't you have reservations about Cedric before? You used to say he was too aloof."


"Yes, and my feelings haven't changed," Lillian retorted, her tone a mix of irritation and resignation.Daniela was a survivor of a troubled past. She wore a smile like a mask, yet beneath it, she was distant and detached,her childhood wounds far too deep for any wealth to mend.And Cedric? He had plunged into the corporate world on his own, adept at unmasking the true intentions of those around him. Could someone

like that truly possess warmth?


The notion of two such detached souls together seemed doomed. Rather than warming each other,they were likely to pull each other further into the cold. How could they possibly make a good match?


Lillian sighed, her voice softening. "But watching Cedric act so humble, I can't help but feel a pang of pity for him."


Despite this, Cedric behaved as though he had the upper hand.



Such foolishness!



Once her reflection ended, Lillian questioned Ryan,"Why do you back Cedric so fiercely? Has he promised you something?"


Ryan drew his sweatshirt's hood over his head,casting his features into shadow. "No."



"Then why...?"


"Because, on the day Daniela married, I saw him cry."


Stunned,Lillian fell silent.



Without another word, Ryan turned and walked away.


Lillian stood against the sharp, biting wind, her mind reeling from the unexpected sight of Cedric-a normally composed man-visibly crying.







Alexander was waiting for Daniela's reply.



At breakfast, Richard had maintained his composure."Today,you need to ask Daniela whether she'll give you the contract, or if she intends to remain indebted to you. Should she choose the latter, suggest remarriage."



Alexander bowed his head, his turbulent emotions now quelled. "But the person Daniela cherished from her childhood wasn't..."



"Wasn't who? It was you! Daniela has harbored feelings for you for many years. Does the truth even matter at this point? Feelings are the most deceiving of all. Don't let them lead you astray. Confront Daniela today. If she refuses, then marrying Joyce isn't such a terrible fallback."



Although Richard always put the company first, he secretly believed that Daniela's affection for Alexander wasn't just a relic of the past.


Her sentimental heart hadn't been hardened by their separation.



She surely still held Alexander in high esteem. As long as she harbored love for him in her heart,there was hope that all could be mended.



Alexander avoided Elite Lux; he had no desire to have his true intentions discovered by Daniela.



With the knowledge that Daniela was due at a social function that evening, he cleverly picked the same restaurant to dine in, setting the stage for an inadvertent encounter.



The construction team was already at the restaurant when Daniela walked in, her arrival leaving them momentarily speechless, captivated by her commanding aura.


At the toast, Cedric presented her with a glass of juice and clinked his glass against hers.



With a conspiratorial grin, he leaned towards the foreman and whispered, "Let's keep the evening light for her; alcohol tends to cloud her bright spirit." His voice dripped with an overt protective charm.



It was common knowledge among the construction team that Cedric's involvement in thei project was deeply tied to Daniela.


With genuine smiles, the workers toasted. "Ms. Harper,we'll give it our all! You can rely on us!"

As the president of a powerful and expansive company,Daniela graciously invited them to a lavish dinner.Her warm smile and effortless charm filled the room, though she knew full well that she couldn't prevent Cedric from visiting the site. This dinner was her subtle way of paving the path for him to earn the trust and camaraderie of the workers.



Marco Pittman, the foreman, observed their interactions,his expression one of content satisfaction.


The evening concluded with everyone feeling uplifted and jovial.



Daniela approached the counter to settle the bill,only to discover that Cedric had preemptively taken care of it. She then excused herself to the restroom,unaware that she was about to encounter Alexander upon her return.



Alexander's eyes were cold as he fixed his gaze on Daniela. "Are you seeing Cedric now?"



Daniela, completely sober, washed her hands before replying, "Mr. Bennett, is there something you require?"


Alexander's tone hardened as he pressed on. "I asked you a question! Are you and Cedric seeing each other now?"



He understood Daniela's character deeply. Unless her heart was engaged, she wouldn't have a meal with a construction team to be near Cedric.



"No," Daniela responded truthfully.



"Then what are your intentions?"



Maintaining her composure, Daniela replied calmly,"Regarding what exactly?"



"Concerning your feelings," Alexander stated,his stare penetrating. "About us."
###Chapter 87 You Are Not That Boy
Daniela kept her calm. "I've moved on."



Alexander narrowed his eyes. "What's that supposed to mean?"



Daniela responded simply,"Exactly what it sounds like."



Alexander gave a slight nod. "And what about you and Cedric?"



Daniela's tone was icy. "That's none of your concern."


"How could it not matter? You're my ex-wife! It's my responsibility to evaluate the men you pick!" Even Alexander realized how absurd he sounded.



Daniela, unfazed, said calmly, "I'm perfectly capable of handling it myself."



Alexander nodded again. "Fine, let's move on. As per our last conversation, you're handing over the North District deal to settle some old childhood debt?"



Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile at his remark.Slowly raising her eyes to meet his, she said, "You and I both know if you were truly that boy from back then."

Alexander's face froze, the words striking him harder than he expected. A wave of mortification washed over him, leaving him utterly speechless.



He stood there, rooted in place, struggling to muster a response. It felt like an eternity before he finally managed to lift his gaze.



That single, fleeting glance was all Daniela needed.



Until now,she had her doubts, but in this moment,she knew for sure.



Daniela's smile turned cold, almost mocking."Alexander, you've really let me down."


Her eyes were slightly red as she spoke, but it wasn't because of Alexander. It was the weight of the unwavering commitment she had poured into everything over the past ten years, the years that now felt as if they had been erased in an instant.


Without another word, Daniela turned and began walking away.



Alexander stayed rooted in place, his eyes locked on her retreating figure, watching her slowly fade into the distance.



Just as her figure was about to disappear, panic surged through him. He yelled desperately, "Daniela! Stop being so difficult! You're just making excuses to hold on to that North District contract. I am the boy from ten years ago. I helped you out of your depression,and you owe me for the rest of your life!"


Alexander's words rang out, but Daniela simply kept walking,unbothered.



Struck by her indifference, Alexander took a few staggered steps back.



His fists tightened, the pressure of panic flooding his chest. The realization hit him like a jolt-he was terrified that Daniela might never come back, that he had already lost her for good.


Everything he'd hidden-his lies, his motives-were now exposed to her.


She regarded him coldly, as though he were nothing more than a fool.



Pride coursed through Alexander's veins, and he couldn't bear to accept the humiliation.



He turned and stumbled off, unable to face the truth any longer.


Meanwhile, Cedric,waiting in the private room,finally emerged after a while. He caught the tail end of Alexander's shouting, but the creak of the door behind him drowned out the rest of the words.

Cedric couldn't make out what Alexander had been yelling.


From the bits he could hear, it sounded like it had something to do with events from a decade ago.



Just then, Daniela walked in, and he asked, "Was Alexander here? What was all that shouting about?"


Daniela opened the door to the private room, her voice calm. "Don't mind him. He's just being his usual over-the-top self."



If there had been even the faintest trace of feeling for Alexander before, it was gone now.


She couldn't bring herself to remember the time wasted on him over the past ten years. She was too sharp to get lost in the past; she understood the importance of moving forward, of never looking back.



Back at home, Richard was already in high spirits,celebrating.



This was how things had always gone.


No matter how ridiculous Alexander's requests were,Daniela would always cave in.



This time, it was just a contract-hardly a challenge for Daniela to refuse. The idea of Daniela becoming his daughter-in-law again brought Richard a great sense of satisfaction.



Once Daniela remarried Alexander, Elite Lux would be completely under his control. She would stay at home,raising kids and supporting her husband, while Alexander would take over Elite Lux gradually. By the time she noticed, Elite Lux would already be entirely in the hands of the Bennett family.



At that point, who could compete with Bennett Group in the entire country?


Richard had been eagerly awaiting this moment for so long.


He chuckled to himself, but his laughter was cut short when the front door suddenly swung open, and Alexander stepped inside.



Still smiling, Richard looked at him and asked, "When are you heading to Elite Lux to sign the contract?"


Alexander, frustrated, yanked at his tie as he explained what had happened.



Richard's brow furrowed as he quickly asked, "After you yelled all that,how did Daniela react?"



Alexander's eyes dropped, his mind still racing with confusion and panic. "She ignored me. I'm not event Boy sure if she heard me."


Daniela had changed so much.


In the past, her emotions were always clear,easy for him to read. Now, he couldn't even tell what she was feeling,let alone her thoughts.


Richard squinted, his voice low. "Then she's still unsure.I'll figure something out."


Alexander's grip tightened as he replayed the image of Daniela in the corridor over and over, feeling helpless to change anything.


She must have seen right through him.Otherwise,why would she be so distant and cold? 2



Richard took a long drag from his cigarette before turning to Alexander. "The secret spot in the tree Daniela talked about... Was it at the Harper family's villa?"



Alexander gave a brief nod.


Richard fell silent for a moment, then spoke. "Since that's where everything happened, there might still be clues there. Daniela's room could have some traces left. No one else is competing for the role of the boy from that year, so if you say the right things, you can win her over!" Even if Alexander couldn't convince her, at least she wouldn't completely reject him.



Alexander needed to act quickly and remarry her before Daniela realized everything.



After remarriage, everything would be much simpler.Her assets would become Alexander's, and the Bennett family could take control.


Having made up his mind, Richard quickly reached out to Katrina, telling her that he wanted to pay them a visit.



Katrina, excited by the unexpected news, assumed Richard was coming to talk about the marriage between Alexander and Joyce.



She was thrilled by the thought of it and eagerly opened the door, ready to welcome the Bennett family with open arms.

###Chapter 88 Caiden's Sudden Enlightenment 
Joyce shifted uncomfortably on the couch. "Mom,why do you think Alexander will come?"


With a knowing chuckle, Katrina replied, "HHe probably got rejected by Daniela. Do you really think the Bennett family hasn't considered all their options? At the end of the day, they're eyeing our fortune."



A knot of unease tightened in Joyce's chest. She harbored fears that Alexander might scorn her, and beyond that, she was troubled by the thought that he might not treat her child with kindness.



It wasn't until Katrina reassured her the Harper family's fortune would be in her child's name and she'd take care of the child herself that Joyce's tension eased slightly.



Caiden furrowed his brow upon hearing that.



The thought of taking care of a child was the furthest thing from his mind.



He had no interest in a life cluttered with the chaos of diapers and nursery rhymes.

Yet, he kept his feelings to himself for the moment.



Glancing over at Joyce's belly, Caiden realized this child wasn't connected to him by blood. Was he about to endow his vast fortune on someone who wasn't even his own kin? 4



Joyce living in his house and using his money was one thing. He couldn't take his wealth with him beyond the grave. But the thought of leaving it all to an outsider sent a chill down his spine. The child did not share his blood.



The more Caiden dwelled on this fact, the deeper his discomfort grew.


And if Joyce ever married, her allegiance would inevitably pivot to her husband's family, relegating him,her stepfather, to an ever more peripheral role in her life.



Something about the situation just didn't sit right with him,no matter how he pondered it.



He trudged towards the garden, his mood somber, and called back to Katrina that he was off to pick up Richard and Alexander.



Katrina, oblivious to the storm brewing in Caiden's mind, brightly reassured Joyce. "See how eager your father is to embrace a grandchild someday. Don't worry, Joyce. Everything in this house belongs to you and your child-no one can claim it otherwise."



Caiden's pace faltered as he stepped outside. For an inexplicable reason, he glanced back over his shoulder.



In the living room, illuminated by the bright lights,Katrina's face was heavily made up, her eyes alight with pride and her smile wide with a hint of smug superiority.



Memories flooded back to Caiden unexpectedly,recalling the summer Katrina first became a part of the Harper family.



He had come home to retrieve some documents during lunchtime.



He saw Daniela perched at the top of the stairs while Joyce,seated at the grand dining table with a bib tied neatly around her neck, declared insistently, "I want egg custard!"



The maid flashed a smile and suggested, "You've had a lot of egg custard today. Perhaps you'd prefer some fish instead?"



Joyce's mood soured instantly. She ripped off her bib and began to wail loudly.



Katrina shot the maid a fierce look and defiantly carried the whole plate of egg custards to Joyce, who devoured them with enthusiasm.



At that moment, Caiden hadn't really been paying attention.



It was just a bowl of egg custard, after all. Yet now,as he reminisced about the incident, he remembered seeing Daniela, whose plate bore nothing but a few scant leaves of vegetables.



During that time, Daniela had shed her baby fat at an alarming rate. But he had failed to take note.



Looking back, the maid's reserved expression,Katrina's self-satisfied smirk, and Daniela's silent acceptance all seemed to underscore Daniela's unhappiness.


That year, Daniela was merely five years old. Yet, in the face of such inequity, she did not weep or make a fuss.



Reflecting on it, Caiden couldn't fathom why the image of Daniela's small hands clutching a plate larger than her face now struck him so profoundly.



A torrent of feelings overwhelmed Caiden.



In the garden, the gardeners were conversing.



"Alexander Bennett is on their way. Seems like he's here to propose an engagement to Joyce."



"She's expecting, and he still pursues her?"



"For the affluent, money can buy almost anything,can't it? Moreover, since Daniela has severed her ties with her family, all properties in this home will soon be Joyce's. The Bennett family is shrewd in their dealings.They clearly recognize the advantage in this arrangement."



"In my opinion, everyone's adept at making calculations-everyone except Caiden. Daniela is his flesh and blood, his own daughter. How could he possibly disown her? She's both talented and compassionate. Should he ever face adversity, she would undoubtedly come to his aid. But is it wise to depend on someone as selfish as Joyce?"



"That's right! She doesn't even know who the father is.In any other family, she'd be nothing but a filthy scandal."



"Daniela would never find herself in such a disgraceful situation. There's a saying that a leopard doesn't change its spots, and there's some truth to it.Consider Joyce, wwho's lived in this home for years,yet remains as unrefined and impulsive as ever. Who knows where she got those traits? Anyone marrying her would surely be after her wealth." "I simply can't fathom Caiden's thought process. Why is he so lavish with his fortune on outsiders? Once he passes,how will he justify his actions to his first wife?What will he say when she inquires about the severe treatment of their daughter all these years?"



"Truly, while men may wander, it baffles me that Caiden takes his commitment to Joyce so seriously,given she's not even his own blood. What did the late his first wife see in him?"



The servants continued their hushed discussions.



Caiden watched the servants, his expression unreadable.



Usually,they lauded him for his genuine kindness,even towards his adopted daughter, filling him with pride.



Yet unbeknownst to him, behind his back, they considered him a gullible fool.

###Chapter 89 Caiden's Sudden Enlightenment
Caiden's life had flipped upside down in an instant.



For the first time, he sat down with a grave expression,mulling over the stark contrasts between Daniela and Joyce.



His thoughts consumed him so deeply that he failed to notice the Bennett family's car rolling through the gate.



It was only when Katrina's voice echoed in the garden that Caiden snapped out of his reverie, rising from his chair with a start.



As he made his way into the house,memories of the day he had cut ties with Daniela flooded back-the day she had knelt before him.



If it were Joyce, would she have made this choice?


Would she bid him farewell with a gesture of gratitude as her parting act?



Absolutely not-she wasn't the type to do that



For Joyce, her own well-being always took precedence over anything or anyone else.


At the dinner table, Katrina, wreathed in guilt, flashed sheepish, apologetic smiles at Richard and Alexander,while Caiden watched Joyce closely.


Joyce seemed preoccupied with herself, fussing and failing to see the bigger picture.She had potential for so much more, yet she seemed to settle for less.


During this tense moment, Katrina shot Caiden a significant look, silently prompting him to speak up.


"Alexander, please, have peace of mind. As long as you marry Joyce, everything from the Harper family will be yours and Joyce's, considering she's our only child. Isn't that right,Caiden?"


In that instant, Caiden acutely sensed the possibility that Joyce's lack of foresight might actualy drain his personal resources to rectify her blunders.



All the wealth of the Harper family had been painstakingly accumulated by Daniela's mother, and while he had reaped the benefits, the idea of redistributing it, as suggested in hushed tones by the servants, was contrary to Daniela's mother's wishes-and certainly not in line with Daniela's expectations.


Faced with the prospect of Joyce neglecting him in his later years, Caiden wondered desperately whom he could depend on. His thoughts whirled in confusion as the eyes of everyone at the dinner table turned to him.



Richard, ever the opportunist, flashed a concerned yet calculating smile and probed, "Caiden, is everything alright? You seem a bit off."


His presence was not just social; he was there to secure a promise from the Harper family and to unearth the childhood sketches Daniela had created with that boy from years ago. His gaze, filled with faux concern, subtly urged Caiden for answers.



Katrina initially beamed a smile, which soon dissolved into a look of puzzlement. "Caiden, didn't you mention you intended for everything to be left to Joyce and her future spouse? Wasn't that your plan?"


Caiden smiled and took a sip of his wine. "Richard, you must try this wine; it's exceptional."



At his response, Richard raised his eyebrow in surprise.



Katrina's face stiffened, her smile vanishing as she reined in her brewing irritation, her features settling into a frosty mask.


Joyce tugged on Caiden's sleeve, her expression fraught with anxiety. When she could no longer contain her impatience, she leaned in and whispered urgently,"Dad,why did you suddenly change the topic? Richard was only asking for your opinion. Just make it clear that the Harper family's assets are mine. Who else would you consider?"



She stated this as though it were the most natural conclusion, completely ignoring Daniela's existence.



Previously, Caiden hadn't given much thought to her dismissive attitude. However, this time, it stirred a sense of discomfort within him.



Both women, living under his roof and spending his money,seemed to constantly belittle and undermine his daughter.



A sharp glint flashed in Caiden's eyes, noticeable enough to make Katrina frown.



She leaned closer and hissed, "Caiden! What's gotten into you?"



Caiden merely shrugged off her concern with a scoff and took another sip of his drink, ignoring her question.



Richard, sensing the unresolved tension, chose not to press the matter.


After dinner, he suggested that Alexander and Joyce might want to retire upstairs to see the study,while he himself strolled into the garden to make a discreet phone call.
This maneuver tactfully gave Caiden and Katrina the opportunity they needed to have a private conversation.



The moment they were alone, Katrina's restraint shattered.



"What is the meaning of this, Caiden? Why didn't you say a damn thing just now? The Bennett family's finalizing everything, and all you did was sit there with your mouth shut like an idiot. What is it-can't bear to part with the family fortune? Or is it that you don't think my daughter deserves it? Let me guess-you're questioning if Joyce is even yours now?"



Overcome with emotion, Katrina hid her face in her hands, her body sinking to the floor as sobs racked her frame. "You heartless man! I gave up the chance to have children with you because I didn't want Daniela to suffer. Now that my childbearing years are gone, you've got the audacity to hold grudges?Caiden, you're nothing but a cruel, selfish asshole!"


In a sudden surge of fury, Katrina struck Caiden across the face.



The slap echoed sharply, powerful enough to leave Caiden reeling in shock.



Upstairs, the atmosphere was starkly different.Alexander, with just a handful of gentle words, convinced Joyce to let him see Daniela's room.



There, amidst the quiet and dust, he discovered a sketchbook. Flipping it open, he found the last message the boy had scribbled for her.



"Let's meet tomorrow."

###Chapter 90 What He Offered Now Meant Nothi...
For some inexplicable reason, the childlike handwriting on the paper struck a chord of familiarity within Alexander.



It felt hauntingly familiar, as if he had encountered it somewhere in the past, yet he couldn't pinpoint exactly where.



As Joyce watched Alexander prepare to leave, a wistful sigh escaped her lips. "When are you going to marry me?"



Preoccupied, Alexander merely climbed into the car,leaving her question hanging unanswered in the chilly air.



From his vantage point next to the car, Richard caught sight of Joyce's reddened eyes. He offered a sympathetic comment. "Go back inside. Don't worry.This will sort itself out soon enough."



Yet, inwardly, he harbored a deep aversion towards Joyce.He thought her utterly foolish, behaving like a petulant child. Did she really believe the universe orbited around her whims?

Inside the car, Richard asked, "Did you manage to get the sketchbook?"



Alexander nodded absentmindedly.



Richard's disdain for Joyce only deepened.



Her lack of prudence was astonishing.



She had let Alexander into Daniela's room without hesitation and allowed him to take whatever he wished without batting an eye. Could she really be so ridiculously naive?



Letting her into the Bennett family was as good as inviting burglars to raid their treasures.



With a frown, Richard sighed deeply. After a moment,he turned back to Alexander, decisiveness in his voice."Hand over the sketchbook. There's no need for you to seek out Daniela. I'll take care of it."



Alexander was still preoccupied with the handwriting,racking his brain to recall where he had last seen it,but the memory remained elusive.







With that, the Bennett family pulled away, their car disappearing into the distance.



No assurances came from Caiden; his silence said it all.



Katrina's cries echoed through the living room, her shoulders trembling with emotion.



With frustration evident, Caiden called the driver,who immediately came to pick him up.


Just as Caiden stepped into the waiting car, Katrina's voice cut through the air from behind. "Where are you going?"


Paying no mind to Katrina, Caiden waved the driver forward, urging him to start the car and drive off.


Glancing at the rearview mirror, the driver inquired,"Where are we headed, sir?"



After a brief pause, Caiden muttered, "Elite Lux."



The driver nodded subtly, pressed the accelerator,and the car sped off.



As they reached Elite Lux, droplets began to speckle the ground.



Fresh from a banquet, Daniela emerged in a flowing silver-white gown that accentuated her elegance.


A security guard offered her a tissue. With a warm,genuine smile, she accepted, murmuring, "Thank you Her smile reflected a deep, genuine warmth reminiscent of her mother.



A wave of regret washed over Caiden. Realizing his shortcomings as a father over the years, he impulsively swung the car door open and called out,"Daniela."



Daniela, adorned with long earrings that delicately grazed her cheeks, turned to find Caiden under the somber, drizzly sky.



Daniela hesitated briefly before stepping out, her tone calm and courteous. "Do you need something, Mr.Harper?"



Caiden gazed at her intently, the realization dawning on him that the little girl who once perched on the stairs munching on her meals had blossomed into a poised young woman.


His words came at last, but a slight quiver betrayed his composure. "I remember Katrina used to laugh about how you'd never sit at the table, preferring the stairs instead.Was she right?"



The evening air wasn't particularly brisk, yet Caiden's words whisked Daniela back to a childhood tinged with solitude. Her smile dimmed a touch as she murmured,"| don't remember."

 In those days, she'd been overlooked, invisible. And now,she was unwilling to entertain belated regrets.



By holding on to her grudge, she risked being seen as utterly void of compassion.



Upstairs, Josie had prepared a steaming pot of soup,and the ringing of a phone call pierced the quiet night.


After disconnecting, Daniela maintained her composure and nodded towards Caiden, her voice steady. "The past is behind us. I'm fortunate now to have people who care about me. Mr. Harper, goodbye."


With those words, Daniela pivoted and strode away.



In that instant, a profound melancholy enveloped Caiden. He watched her receding figure, yearning to call after her, yet she vanished into the distance,beyond reach.



His attempts at reconciliation now seemed futile to Daniela.



As the rain began to fall, the driver unfurled an umbrella over Caiden, who asked in a hushed tone,"Does she still harbor resentment towards me?"



The driver, a thoughtful man in his fifties, replied cautiously, "Ms. Harper is compassionate by nature.She might be hurt, but at the end of the day, you're

her father. Blood ties are enduring, a connection that's difficult to sever."



He paused, choosing his next words carefully. "In some families, emotions aren't always laid bare immediately, particularly if they wish to avoid stirring up conflict."



Caiden regarded the driver with a hint of curiosity.



Tilting the umbrella against the wind, the driver spoke with quiet conviction. "You see, when someone joins a new family, they tend to tread lightly and avoid stirring trouble. Yet, when they're among their own family, they're more inclined to express their true thoughts. Do you know the reason?"



Taking a thoughtful pause, he went on, "It's because with one's own family, there's a greater latitude for openness. With in-laws or outsiders, however, people are more guarded."



He looked over at Caiden, adding,"The same principle applies to your family, Mr. Harper. Observe carefully,and over time, you'll discern Daniela's and Joyce's genuine selves. You've ascended the ranks through sheer effort, assuming others have endured similar trials.Yet,human nature is fickle. Ultimately, everyone prioritizes their own interests."



The driver, having served under Daniela's mother for many years, had witnessed much and was unafraid to share his insights.



Throughout the ride home, Caiden was deep in reflection.



Katrina lingered in the living room,awaiting his return.Upon his entry, she offered him a towel.


As Caiden made his way upstairs, Katrina glanced at the driver with a hint of unease. "Where did he go?"



With a calm demeanor, the driver responded, "He went to his office, reviewed some documents, then returned."



Katrina exhaled in relief.



She had suspected he might have developed a sudden sense of duty and set off in search of Daniela.



It turned out her fears were unfounded.

###Chapter 91 The Death Of Daniela's Mother
Katrina had just stepped out of the shower and was lying on the bed,plotting her next strategy.



Her choice of attire, a revealing dress, shimmered with an alluring charm in the dim light.


She was especially enthusiastic tonight. As soon as Caiden entered the room, she embraced him and started kissing him.



However, Caiden's interest seemed to wane, his responses sluggish and detached.



Driven by the lure of the family fortune that dangled within reach, Katrina intensified her efforts.



Outside, the storm unleashed its fury, mirroring the tumult inside.



Once their encounter concluded, Katrina, breathless and flushed, nestled against Caiden's chest and murmured, "Honey, what's wrong today? You're not quite yourself."



Caiden, unfazed,reached for a cigarette and lit it, the silence thickening with the rising smoke. Katrina held her breath,watching him, and once the cigarette was spent, she attempted to recapture his attention,her seductive dress clinging to her contours.



"Honey, it seems Alexander is gearing up to propose to Joyce formally," she ventured, trying to gauge his reaction.



Caiden, drawing another cigarette, responded with cold indifference,"Alright."


Smoke wreathed around his face, quickly shrouding his expression.



Clearing of her throat, Katrina sought to reclaim Caiden's attention.



In the past, such a signal would compel him to discard his cigarette and draw her close, enveloping her in his arms.



Now, however, Caiden appeared deaf to her cue. A flicker of anguish shadowed Katrina's gaze, deepening ominously before she quickly veiled it with a radiant smile, masking her true feelings. She had crucial motives today and needed Caiden on her side.


Rather than protest, she pressed herself against him,her fingers sketching tender patterns against his chest."Honey, consider the benefits after Joyce marries Alexander. Given the Bennett family's flourishing status, Joyce would thrive as one of them."

 Caiden, wrapped in his own silence, gave no response as he continued to puff on his cigarette.


Katrina continued "Joyce is already pregnant. The Bennett family probably wants to seal the deal because she's the only daughter, and our family's wealth is a big safety net for her. But for some reason,Richard didn't mention it today. It seems he's waiting for our promise. What I'm getting at is..."



Katrina paused strategically, her eyes locking onto Caiden's with intentional gravity. "What I'm getting at is that ultimately, the family fortune will belong to Joyce. We're doing this for her future, aren't we? So,why not transfer your assets to her now?" 1



Caiden lingered in silence, a thin trail of smoke curling from his cigarette.



Katrina arched up and planted a kiss on Caiden's lips."Besides, everything's been arranged,right? We won't have any more children. We might as well let Joyce solidify her standing in the Bennett family. Once Joyce is married, my only job will be to attend to you."



Her voice was tender, filled with the assumption that Caiden would concur. However, he remained eerily silent.



Katrina nudged his arm, her voice laced with concern."Honey, what's on your mind?"

Caiden murmured, "I need some time to think it over."


Katrina's brows knit together in a sudden scowl, a flash of revulsion darting across her features unseen by Caiden.



When she lifted her gaze again, her expression had morphed into one of wary calculation. "Certainly,take your time to consider. I know Joyce holds a special place in your heart, and you always prioritize her needs. But, honey, we need a swift decision. Our daughter's condition grows more apparent by the day,and if she bears a child out of wedlock and it becomes public, it would tarnish our family's reputation, don't you agree?"



Caiden's reply came as flat as before. "Indeed."



Katrina's displeasure deepened, puzzled by Caiden's unusual detachment.



She had been gearing up for this moment all year.



After dedicating over a decade to serving Caiden, she was at the brink of claiming the family fortune, and errors were not an option now.



She was poised to press further, but Caiden abruptly snuffed out his cigarette and stood.



Katrina watched his retreating figure heading towards the bathroom, her expression hardening into a frosty glare.



What exactly was happening?


Caiden was unusually aloof, his demeanor casting a shadow over the evening.



As Katrina pondered his changed attitude, her seldom -used backup phone tucked away in a drawer buzzed urgently. Casting a cautious glance towards the bathroom, she retrieved the phone and stepped out onto the balcony.



"Mom,why on earth are you calling so late?"



The first time Katrina had encountered Brylee Harper,Daniela's mother, she had spun a tragic tale of being the sole survivor of her family, desperately seeking refuge. She had implored Brylee to take her in as a maid,claiming she had nowhere else to turn.



That deception had carried on for over a decade.



Even Caiden didn't know Katrina's mother was still alive.



"Send me some money; I lost again at poker!"



"Didn't I just hand you five hundred thousand? Mom,try to keep some for yourself."

"Just do it quickly! And since Joyce is pregnant, take good care of her."



Katrina responded with a subdued, "Yeah."



"What's the matter? You seem off. Isn't it said that you have Caiden completely captivated? What could possibly be troubling you?"


Katrina turned to check if anyone was behind her,finding herself alone.



She whispered, "I've noticed something off about Caiden today. Normally, he's quick to agree with anything I say. But earlier, when I suggested he should pass the fortune to Joyce, he paused-a first.Why have | devoted the last decade to that old man?Clearly, it's for the money. Why else would I endure,always smiling and bending over backwards?"2



Katrina gazed into the deepening night sky,her mind racing as a sudden thought struck her.


With a gasp of realization, she cried out, "Mom,could he possibly know about Brylee's death..."



"Ridiculous!" her mother yelled through the phone,cutting sharply through Katrina's spiraling thoughts."Brylee took her own life by jumping off that building.We will not discuss this again."

Katrina,subdued, nodded her head in agreement. "Yes,you're right. I'm just being foolish."



No sooner had she uttered the words than the door behind her emitted a haunting creak. Swiveling abruptly, Katrina's face hardened.



Her glare, caught in the ghostly glow of the moonlight,carried a silent threat.


She ended the call with a snap and called out to the door, "Who's there?"

###Chapter 92 Suspicion



"Who's out there?" Katrina's voice was sharp and controlled,slicing through the stillness like a blade.



She didn't hesitate and moved towards the door quickly.


Outside, the space was completely deserted. Not a single soul was there in sight.


Katrina stopped in her tracks, her keen eyes darting through the shadows. Out of nowhere, a sudden gust of wind swept past.



The door creaked, nudging softly against the frame,the sound startlingly loud in the quiet of the night.


Her expression didn't waver,radiating an icy calm that hinted at an underlying menace.



Turning back into the villa, she closed the balcony door firmly. Holding the spare phone in her grip, she began descending the stairs.



The master bedroom was eerily silent, the only sound coming from running water in the bathroom. Katrina's eyes flicked to the floor-the white tiles were pristine and bone-dry. She approached the bathroom door, gave it a light knock, and leaned in to listen, her ear resting against the cool wood.



"Sweetheart?" she called out.



No reply.



Whatever fleeting relief she'd felt earlier evaporated,replaced by a tightening unease curling in her chest.



She made her way to the table and picked up a fruit knife. With the blade firmly in hand, she returned to the bathroom door.



"Caiden,sweetheart? Are you in there?"



She called his name several times, but the only response was the persistent hiss of water flowing behind the door.



Katrina's fingers curled tightly around the doorknob,her other hand gripping the knife with an unyielding hold.



The blade was sharp-sharp enough to pierce a chest and sever an artery, causing instant death.



She knew this. She had done it before.



Even after all this time, the exact location of the heart remained seared into her mind, as though permanently etched like a blueprint. Taking a deep breath, she firmed her hold on the doorknob before shoving the door open with determined force.



Inside, Caiden lay relaxed in the bathtub, lazily scrolling through his phone. Startled by Katrina's sudden entrance, he lifted his gaze, his expression a mix of surprise and confusion. "What's going on? I'm just taking a bath."



Katrina hid the knife behind her back. "I've been calling you. Why didn't you respond?"



Glancing briefly at her, Caiden returned his attention to the screen. "I'm playing chess on my phone. Didn't hear a thing."



Katrina forced a nervous laugh. "I thought something had happened, like you slipped or worse. You gave me quite a scare! At your age, you've got to be more cautious, sweetheart. Don't stay in too long,okay?Come out soon."



Caiden didn't bother responding, his focus already absorbed by the game on his phone. Katrina lingered in the doorway, silently observing his relaxed profile.



Thoughts raced through her mind as she deliberated.Maybe this was the moment-she could step forward and end it right now. Just then, a knock broke the tension. The dangerous glint in Katrina's eyes disappeared in an instant. She left the room, returning the fruit knife to its usual place. Only after that did she turn the handle and open the door. She shot the housekeeper a sharp glare, her tone curt as she asked, "What now?"



The housekeeper faltered briefly before replying,"Ronald and Wyatt have arrived. They've brought some members of the Harper family with them."



Katrina's expression darkened into a deep frown.Returning to the room, she stated flatly,"Ronald and Wyatt are downstairs."



Without lifting his eyes from the screen, Caiden dismissed her words. "You deal with it. It's probably about jobs again. What can those fools even manage,anyway?"



Katrina's gaze lowered as she studied Caiden's indifferent profile. Her voice was calm but probing as she asked, "Did you go up to the rooftop earlier?"



Still focused on his game, he replied in a distracted tone, "Why would I go up there? I'm occupied here.Don't disturb me."



The tension in Katrina's chest finally started to subside,and a subtle smile crept onto her lips. "Alright. You focus on your game. I'll take care of it. I'll just tell them  to talk to Daniela. Those penniless relatives of ours are more trouble than they're worth. Hiring them would only invite chaos into the company."


Running a company meant one golden rule: never mix family with business.


If they succeeded, they'd demand praise. If they failed,you couldn't even call them out.



It wvas a headache waiting to happen.



Caiden had always avoided hiring family, preferring to steer clear of unnecessary complications.



This approach pleased Katrina immensely.



To her, the Harper family's fortune was meant solely for Joyce. Letting these relatives into the business was like laying landmines-ready to go off and block Joyce's path when her time came to take the reins.


Handing this mess over to Daniela felt ideal. Daniela wasn't her child, so Katrina had no reservations about complicating her life.



Katrina took her time, slipping into a cozy outfit and carefully rubbing hand cream onto her skin. Only then did she make her way downstairs, her steps unhurried and composed.



Downstairs, Ronald paced restlessly, his frustration  evident. "When is Katrina coming down? Does she think she can stay upstairs forever? If she won't come,then call Caiden down instead!"



The housekeeper responded courteously, "Mr. Harper is still in the bath, and Mrs. Harper oversees all family matters here. I ask for your patience."



Ronald glanced at his watch, his expression darkening."It's been over thirty minutes! How much longer do we have to sit here?"



The housekeeper, busy pouring drinks for the guests,seemed visibly uneasy.



Turning to his family, Ronald vented furiously. "Look at this! Do you see how full of herself she is? Katrina was nothing more than a housekeeper here once! She wormed her way into Caiden's bed while his first wife was too preoccupied to notice. Back in the day,a shameless woman like her would've had everyone pointing fingers. And now? She struts around as if she owns the place! She's the one calling the shots in the Harper family business while we, the real Harpers, are left out in the cold, unable to even secure jobs in our own company. And that's not the end of it. After shoving her own daughter into Daniela's company,she destroyed that connection by persuading Caiden to sever ties with Daniela entirely. Who does that? WVhat kind of woman operates like this? Why is she still even a part of this family?"

Desperation crept into Ronald's tone as he turned to the elderly woman on the sofa. "Mom, you have to step in. If you don't, she'll trample all over Wyatt and me!"



Despite her years,Peyton Harper remained sharp and perceptive.


She gave a decisive nod and addressed the housekeeper. "Go upstairs and tell Caiden his mother is here. Get him down at once! I kept quiet when Daniela was disrespected in this family, but now she's the CEO of Elie Lux, worth billions! And Caiden severed ties with her? Has he lost his senses?"



The housekeeper nodded obediently and started up the stairs to summon him.



As the housekeeper neared the stairs, Katrina appeared at the top, her face hard with cold disdain as she made her way down.



Ronald jabbed a finger at her, his voice rising. "Daniela told me she wanted to offer Wyatt and me top jobs -million-dollar salaries! And you destroyed it! Katrina,if you don't find us similar positions in Harper Group,this won't end here!"



Standing beside him, Wyatt tightened his fists and chimed in, "Exactly! You better do what we say!"Behind them, the rest of the Harper family nodded and murmured their support.
###Chapter 93 Peyton Returned
Katrina heard their words and responded with a mocking laugh, causing both Ronald and Wyatt to shift uncomfortably.



"What's so funny?" they demanded angrily.



Katrina crossed her arms, her attitude suddenly shifting from the meek persona she had put on for Caiden.With a biting smirk, she shot a cold look at Ronald and Wyatt.



"You two? Really? Like you're even close to deserving that. A million-dollar salary? Please, do you actually think that's ever going to happen? I get it, you're broke. Fine. But I've got more important things to focus on right now. Want money? Here, take this handout and stop whining."



Ronald's expression soured, his eyes narrowing."Katrina! Who do you think you're insulting? A handout from you? Don't make me laugh. You're nothing but a gold digger who wormed her way into my brother's bed. What do you have to be so smug about? Let me make it clear-if you don't make things right and compensate us for our losses today, I won't  just let this go."



If there was one thing Katrina couldn't stand, it was when people brought up her past.



She had worked her way up by playing the sympathy card, starting as a maid under Brylee before setting her sights on Caiden. The affair had been a scandal at the time,whispered about behind closed doors.


But after she gained power, she made sure to replace all the household staff, making sure no one would ever bring it up again-until now.


These two idiots had crossed the line.



"Leslie! Get them out of here!" Katrina's anger flared,her voice rising. "Forget the money! I wouldn't even give them a single hair from my head!"



"Katrina, you've got some nerve!" A sudden, stinging slap landed across her cheek, making Katrina gasp.



Her hand shot up to her face as she turned around,only to find Peyton standing right in front of her."Peyton? What are you doing here?"



Peyton squinted, her gaze sharp and unforgiving. She hadn't uttered a single word up until this point and quietly watched everything unfold.



Over the years, this daughter-in-law had become  increasingly bold and disrespectful. Peyton hadn't taken Ronald's and Wyatt's complaints seriously when they first called. Katrina's sweet words and docile nature had been nothing more than a carefully crafted act.



"Get Caiden down here!" Peyton commanded sharply.



Katrina pressed her lips together, her left cheek now swollen from the slap.



Inside,she cursed whoever had thought it was a good idea to bring Peyton back from the countryside.



With a forced smile, she said, "Didn't you mention you weren't used to city life? What brings you here today?"



As she spoke, she cursed Peyton in her mind.



Peyton remained seated, her posture rigid and unyielding. "Bring Caiden down here."



When Caiden walked in, he offered a quiet "Mom" in greeting before settling into a seat close by.



Katrina was sent upstairs, out of earshot.



Peyton's voice dropped to a chilling tone as she turned to him. "So, you've cut ties with Daniela, have you?"



Caiden,perched on a small stool, gave a brief nod. "Yes."



"She's your own daughter. Your flesh and blood. Have you completely lost your sense, Caiden?"



Lately, he'd been hearing this so much that it hardly registered anymore.



Caiden glanced up at the stairs and saw Katrina watching from above. He was about to say something but thought better of it and kept quiet.



"Regardless of anything,Daniela is your firstborn.How could you be so cruel? She's always had a gentle heart. If you hadn't pushed her to her limits, she wouldn't have pulled away. Even now, she's still considering ways to help her uncles find employment.Her heart is in the right place, Caiden. I'm telling you,it's time to bring Daniela back into this family!"



Caiden paused, glancing at the stairs again.



As expected, Katrina hurried down the stairs. "That's out of the question! Caiden's decision to cut ties with Daniela was officially approved!"



Katrina was in a panic. Alexander was ready to marry Joyce. Once Joyce took over the Harper family's fortune,Katrina wouldn't need Caiden anymore. With the Bennett family's support, there was nothing Joyce couldn't do. She'd already imagined a future where Alexander ruled Harper Group,with Joyce-her daughter-giving her the power she needed.



She was done being subservient. She was eagerly anticipating the day when Caiden would be the one waiting on her, not the other way around.



But now,Peyton wanted to bring Daniela back into the picture? That could mess everything up.



Peyton's gaze sharpened as she glared at Katrina."I don't care about legal papers. Daniela is still part of this family, whether you like it or not. Without my approval and a proper family meeting,she stays. The wealth you have now is because of Brylee. I kept quiet when you remarried, but I won't sit back and let outsiders take advantage of my granddaughter!"



To Peyton, the only thing that truly mattered was bloodline. How could Joyce possibly inherit the Harper family legacy? Absolutely not!


Caiden hung his head, not daring to protest. "Mom,please don't get upset. You're right. We'll do whatever you say."



Peyton's anger eased just a little.



However, Katrina suddenly lifted her head in pure shock. "Caiden! What exactly do you mean by that?"
Ronald quickly stepped in. "What's he talking about?Can't you see? Mom's here, and in this family, her word is law. Are you really going to defy her? Or are you trying to take down the whole Harper family just to help your daughter?"



It was a grave accusation, and Katrina knew she couldn't risk making things worse before securing the assets she needed.



Peyton shot Katrina a smug smile before focusing back on Caiden. "I'm not leaving. I'll stay here until this is sorted and Daniela is back where she belongs.Only then will I go back to the countryside."


Wyatt and Ronald were quick to assist Peyton, eager to settle her into the guest room.



To them, Daniela's return wasn't just about family-it also meant that their promised salaries would finally be within reach again.


All this time, Katrina had been holding on tightly to control,leaving them with nothing as a result.


On that very day, Peyton, Ronald, Wyatt, and their families-at least twenty people in total-moved into the house.

###Chapter 94 An Invitation



The Harper family's children played in the yard, their raucous laughter and chatter echoing loudly,shattering the tranquility and denying Katrina any semblance of rest.


Leaning against Caiden's chest, Katrina sought comfort. "Honey,what did your mother mean by that?After all these years of marriage, why am I still an outsider in her eyes? Is it because I never bore you a child? I made that choice so Daniela could bask in a mother's love, sacrificing my desires for hers. And now,am I to blame for that?"



Her voice cracked under the weight of her emotions,her sobs painting a picture of profound despair.



Caiden rested his arm lightly on her shoulder. "She's my mother, Katrina. You shouldn't take her words to heart."



Katrina's scowl darkened as she crossed her arms tighty. "And what am I to do now? How do I even begin to explain this to Alexander and Richard.Joyce's pregnancy will soon be visible to all." She sat up abruptly, wiping away her tears.



"Honey, let your mother think what she wantS. I've  weathered much for the love of you, and I'll bear this too.But not Joyce-she doesn't deserve this agony.Here's what we'll do. Tomorrow, I'll pick out a cafe.You get the lawyer there. We'll transfer the company shares and your personal assets into Joyce's name.After that,I'll meet with the Bennett family and secure her engagement to Alexander. Once we've got everything locked down, any objections your mother has will be meaningless by then. What do you think about that?"



Katrina's eyes shimmered with eager anticipation, her gaze fixed on Caiden as she hoped for an affirmative response.



However, Caiden remained engrossed in his mobile game, his head bowed, seemingly oblivious to her anxiety.



After a pause, he responded without looking up, "That won't work out. The moment my mom finds out,she'll lose it completely. She can't stand people scheming behind her back."



Katrina's face fell, and her fingers curled into tight fists, betraying her frustration.



Noticing her tension, Caiden glanced up briefly, his voice calm and unhurried. "But seriously, what's the hurry? Is it really necessary for Joyce to marry Alexander right now? As long as I'm behind her, she has the freedom to marry whoever she chooses.Why stir up unnecessary drama? If you provoke my mother and it affects her health, it'll become the talk of the town. And trust me, I'd be the subject of ridicule."



He shrugged, a sly smirk tugging at thecorner of his mouth. "Not that public opinion bothers me. I can handle abit of slander, but it would crush me to hear them speak ill of you. Let's hold off for now. Just focus on keeping my mom happy. If she's content,she'll approve anything you propose. Getting the assets into Joyce's name won't be a problem-it's all in the family anyway."



Katrina was on the verge of speaking out when Caiden silenced her, guiding her towards the door. "Enough of this, Katrina. Stop being so stubborn. My mother is here and you've barely said a word to her. How do you expect her to warm up to you? Go and spend some time with her."



Caiden brushed her off with a few words and went back to his game.



With a sigh of resignation, Katrina headed to Peyton's room,determined to make a good impression on her mother-in-law.She diligently massaged Peyton's legs,kneaded her shoulders, and even fetched a basin of water for her to soak her feet.



However, before Katrina could shift the conversation towards her grievances about Daniela, Peyton interrupted with a yawn, declaring her exhaustion and her desire to retire for the night.



Frustrated, Katrina retreated to her own room, only to discover Caiden already deep in sleep.



Fuming wwith irritation, she stepped onto the balcony,her fingers trembling as she dialed Richard's number.



Richard,always pragmatic, wasted no time in cutting to the chase. He stated that Joyce had to be officially declared the heiress to the Harper family fortune before any wedding plans could proceed. Why would the Bennett family invest in raising another man's child that Joyce was carrying if she wasn't acknowledged as the heiress?



The conversation left Katrina even more agitated.Just then, Joyce entered the room, visibly distressed."Mom,why won't Dad transfer the family assets to me?Is he still thinking about fixing things with Daniela?"



"He's not," Katrina declared with unwavering certainty."Your father holds my opinions in the highest regard.He's merely acting the part of the devoted son now because that old hag is around. Do you forget? She opposed our marriage initially, yet here l am."



Joyce's anxiety seemed to dissipate at Katrina's assertive words. Later, she attempted to contact Alexander before retiring for the night, but received no response.



...


The following morning, the Harper family household was engulfed in chaos.



Katrina felt completely swamped, rushing around in a frenzy to tackle the endless demands of the day.


In the midst of this turmoil, Peyton took Caiden aside into the garden. "You need to take Daniela back to our family."


Caiden, unexpectedly compliant, simply nodded."Alright."





Smirking with satisfaction at his obedience, Peyton gave him a firm pat on the shoulder and inquired about Daniela's company address.



Standing before the towering Elite Lux building,Peyton craned her neck, awestruck by the architectural magnificence.



She turned to Ronald, who was standing next to her,and questioned with a hint of disbelief, "Is this really Daniela's company?"



Ronald flashed a triumphant grin as he nodded."Without a doubt! Your granddaughter has made an outstanding mark in her field. Can you believe it?She's sitting at the very top as the wealthiest in the world! I've heard her clothing line sells for outrageous amounts, hundreds of thousands each."



Peyton's expression illuminated with pleasure.


Ronald assisted her toward the building's grand entrance. However, as they neared, a security guard stepped in front of them, blocking their way.



Ronald's smile faltered, his brow creasing with coldness. Despite this, the guard addressed them in a respectful yet firm tone. "Ms. Harper is currently overseas at our main office. She won't return for another two weeks."



Unfazed, Peyton maintained her cheerful demeanor,nodding appreciatively to the guard. With Ronald's arm for support, she turned and made her way back to the car. As they departed, Peyton cast a final glance at the building. A surge of pride swelled within her.


Once they had left, Lillian emerged from her discreet spot and approached the guard. "There's no need to inform Ms. Harper about today's visit. Let's pretend it never occurred. If they show up again, just let them know that she isn't available to see them."



The guard gave a firm nod in acknowledgment."Understood."
At that moment, Daniela's phone lit up with a call from Richard. "Daniela, are you free today? I'd like to take you out for a meal."



Daniela's brow furrowed in suspicion.



Richard, known for neither his kindness nor his empathy, had never extended such an invitation before. Her mind flashed back to the days she had devotedly followed Alexander, seeking his favor,only to be met with Richard's scathing mockery.



She vividly remembered him belittling her in front of an audience, sneeringly branding her as "merely Alexander's slave."



And now, here he was, reaching out as if none of that had happened.



"Daniela, what's the matter? You seem quiet. Have you forgotten my voice?" Richard chimed in, his tone overly cheerful. "I'm already at your office building.It's lunchtime, and believe it or not, we've never actually shared a meal, just the two of us. And don't worry, Alexander won't be joining us. Come on, I was once your father-in-law.Would you really deny an old man a bit of company?"



Realizing that Richard wouldn't take no for an answer and would likely persist if she declined, Daniela accepted reluctantly. "Alright."

###Chapter 95 The Sketchbook
Lunch was arranged at a cozy restaurant sitting right in front of Daniela's company building.



As she entered, she found Richard already comfortably settled at a table, awaiting her presence.



Daniela's expression softened into a courteous smile as she took her seat.



Richard greeted her with a warm smile. "It's been too long, hasn't it? You seem slimmer."


His voice carried a light, familiar tone,the sort that old friends might use to reconnect after years apart.



Richard had this innate ability to foster a cozy, inviting ambiance effortlessly.



Daniela cut straight to the chase. "So, what do you need from me?"



The interaction, though polite, retained a certain cool formality.



Richard gestured to the staff, signaling that they were ready for their meal. While Daniela focused on her food, Richard kept up his affable facade, his smile never wavering. "You really stand out, Daniela. Bred  from such a noble family, your elegance and decorum are beyond reproach. Compared to you, Joyce is barely even in the same league."



Daniela offered no response, merely selecting a piece of sushi and continuing her meal.



Richard continued, "In the past, I may have been unkind to you. Please, let's put that behind us. Things have been overwhelming for me, and I know I let my frustrations slip out unfairly. I hope you can let it go,Daniela."



From a tender age, Daniela had been her mother's shadow at stately gatherings. While her recollections of those formative years were vague, her proficiency in managing such affairs had become second nature.


Offering him a polite smile, she responded, "You've a lot on your plate, yet you found time to invite me to lunch.I really appreciate the invitation."



Her reply was courteous but reserved, skillfully dodging Richard's attempt at reconciliation. His smile wavered for a moment.



"No need to be so formal," he suggested with a semblance of warmth. "After all, we are family. I've watched you grow alongside Alexander, almost as if you were my own. There's no need for such formality between us."
Observing Daniela's reluctance to engage further,Richard changed his approach once more. "I know you've been tied up, but how about joining us for dinner at our place next time? With Alexander around,it would be wonderful to reconnect."



Daniela continued to focus on her meal, maintaining her poised demeanor and refined movements.



"Daniela, I've asked for your time today for a couple of important reasons. First off, I owe you an apology.Alexander relayed to me what he said to you earlier.I've given him a piece of my mind-truly, it's absurd to dredge up childhood stories in business dealings. It's complete nonsense! Please, don't dwell on it. He wasn't in his right mind. I assure you, he wvill apologize to you face-to-face.I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive him."



After a brief silence, he added, "The second matter l needed to address is this." He reached behind him and retrieved a sketchbook. For a moment, Daniela thought it was her own, but she soon realized the difference. Her own sketchbook bore an illustration of a little boy on its cover, whereas this one depicted a little girl.



Richard opened the sketchbook and began turning the pages. "Over the years, Alexander has never stopped thinking about you. After he gave you that first sketchbook, he crafted this one as its counterpart. See here-he's preserved it all this time." 2



Daniela froze, her hand pausing mid-air.



Carefully flipping through the pages, Richard stopped at the final one and pulled out a neatly folded note.On the note were the words, "I want to see you."



A wave of emotions overtook Daniela. She quietly put her fork down and extended her hand to take the sketchbook.



Without uttering a word, she scrutinized the pages meticulously,her face betraying no emotion.



Meanwhile, Richard observed her with keen interest,his face momentarily clouded by a flicker of apprehension. He had someone reconstruct the sketchbook to mirror the one Daniela once cherished,yet, devoid of any artistic insight, he remained uncertain if it perfectly captured every intricate detail.


After the meal, Richard courteously walked Daniela to the grand entrance of the Elite Lux building.



His smile was soft and reassuring as he remarked,"Daniela, you're aware of how reserved Alexander can be. However, beneath that quiet exterior, you've always held a special place in his heart. His dealings with Joyce are mnerely a formality-she is, after all, a Harper, and he had little choice. But the bond you and Alexander share? That's genuine,isn't it?"



Beneath the grand building, Daniela stood, ethereal in her bespoke white gown.



She gave a faint nod, her voice tinged with a hint of sorrow as she responded, "Yet, there is something real between Alexander and Joyce too. I think it's best if I step back."



Richard's lips twitched nervously before he leaned forward, his tone earnest. "No, that's not the case at all! What Alexander feels for you-that's true love!"



Daniela's head tilted slightly, her earrings moving gracefully. "Let's not linger on this topic. It belongs to the past. Richard, I appreciate your kindness in sharing the sketchbook with me today. I must leave now."



She spun around without awaiting his reply and strode determinedly into the building.



Richard, who had appeared nervous just a heartbeat ago,now flashed a victorious smile.



He eagerly retrieved his phone and dialed Alexander's number. "It's done," he announced with glee. "I'm convinced Daniela still harbors feelings for you.Forget Joyce! Don't let Daniela misinterpret things any further!"



In stark contrast to the grandeur of the Elite Lux, the Harper family's wealth seemed trivial, mere loose change.


On the other end of the call, Alexander's voice was laced with skepticism. Richard's assurances seemed overly optimistic.


"Are you sure about that?"



Previously, Daniela had only shown contempt for him,consistently keeping her distance as if he were contagious-not the behavior of someone secretly smitten.



"Absolutely!" Richard was practically vibrating with anticipation. He then cast an admiring glance at the majestic building, his smile broadening at the prospect of it someday falling under his control. "Daniela still has feelings for you. She's only been distant because of the divorce. Now, as CEO of Elite Lux,she has her reputation to consider. But mark my words, play your cards right,and Elite Lux could be in your grasp before you know it. Let me arrange a delightful dinner.Daniela will come by, and as the wine flows, you two can reconnect and see where the night takes you.Daniela's always been a sucker for romance. Reignite that old flame, and she'll be walking down the aisle with you again in no time!"



Alexander absorbed this silently, finally offering a low,noncommittal grunt of "Mm." Yet, Richard detected a hint of satisfaction in his tone.



After Richard hung up, his phone buzzed with an incoming call. This time, it was Katrina on the line. He promptly pressed the decline button without a second thought.



Daniela entered the elevator, finding Lillian already inside, awaiting her. "You're not actually considering giving Alexander another chance, are you?"



"Absolutely not," Daniela responded with composure.



"Then what was all that about just now?"



"Merely messing around with him. They think I'm the idiot, strutting around with their pathetic charades,hoping I'll fall for their garbage. I've known that sketchbook inside out for over a decade-l spotted the discrepancies immediately. They think I'm stupid enough to buy this bullshit? I'll make them regret ever trying to screw with me!"



Daniela admitted to her own stupidity back then-letting herself get swept up in ridiculous fairy tale fantasies about love.



Alexander was never the man she had imagined him to be. Yet, he persistently resurfaced,wielding the same old manipulative tactics, aiming to exploit her once more.
Every damn time, he tried his shameless crap, thinking she would just let him take everything and walk away unscathed.



Such individuals were nothing more than the leeches of society. And leeches deserved nothing less than to be obliterated underfoot.
###Chapter 96 You Broke Them Up
After Peyton's visit to Daniela's company, she had become utterly insufferable. She couldn't go a minute without bragging about her "most accomplished granddaughter."


At every meal, without fail, she would point to a dish on the table and announce to everyone, "This is Daniela's favorite. You should all have more of it-maybe it'll make you as clever as she is."


Katrina forced herself to swallow both her food and the simmering rage building inside her.


"Katrina!" Peyton suddenly slammed her fork down onto the table, her sharp eyes locking onto her. "Have you lost all sense of manners? What's with that expression? I'm still here, aren't I? Or do you think you're the one in charge now?"



Then, Peyton shifted her gaze to Joyce, who was sitting at the head of the table. "And you-sitting at the main seat in front of us all? Like mother, like daughter! We gave you a roof over your head and even let Caiden, that clueless fool, marry your mother.If it weren't for us, what kind of life would you have?
How dare you push my true granddaughter out of this house!"



Turning to the housekeeper, she barked, "Daniela's room used to be in the center. Whatever it takes, that room needs to be restored by tomorrow. The best room in this house belongs to her!"


Unable to keep quiet, Katrina shot back, "Absolutely not! That room has the best sunlight, the warmest and brightest spot in the house. Daniela's current room is cold and drafty at night. Joyce can't even stand it."


Peyton slapped her hand on the table and stood up,her eyes flashing with fury. "So, the best room should go to your child? What about Daniela, my true granddaughter? Is she supposed to live in some filthy room?"



Katrina quickly protested, "That's not what I meant!"



As she spoke, she leaned into Caiden's arms,tears falling. "I know your mother has always seen me as less because I haven't had a child with your blood.I can accept that, but why bring Joyce into it? If I'm such a failure, maybe I should just disappear!"



Watching Katrina cry, Joyce's eyes welled with tears,and she began to sob too.



"Alright, let it go. Mom's getting old. Don't argue with her," Caiden muttered in his usual indifferent way. Katrina had heard this excuse so often that it grated on her nerves. Just as she was about to lose it, a servant entered and announced, "Alexander is here."


As soon as Katrina heard the name, her eyes lit up with excitement.



For days, she'd felt anxious. Richard hadn't returned her calls, and she feared things were getting out of hand. But with Alexander standing there before her,her hope surged. "What a surprise, Alexander! What brings you here today?"



Alexander wrapped the sketchbook in a black plastic bag and handed it to Katrina. "I borrowed this from Joyce a few days ago. It was taken from Daniela's room. Can you return it for me?"


Katrina beamed,eager to do Alexander a favor.course."



She considered inviting Alexander in for a meal,hoping to give him and Joyce a chance to connect.But the memory of Peyton's scowl held her back.



As Alexander was about to leave, he couldn't help but glance over his shoulder. His eyes landed on Katrina,who tossed the bag into the trash can.


The bag hit the bottom with a loud clang, and just like that, the trash can was full to the top. She then called over to a servant. "Replace the garbage bag and take it out."



The servant quickly crouched to change the bag as the door clicked shut behind Alexander.



After taking in the scene, he walked off.



To him, the sketchbook had done its job and was now nothing more than a burden. Since Daniela still harbored feelings for him, keeping it around seemed pointless.



He couldn't let Daniela still hold feelings for another man-even if that man was nothing more than a memory,a boy from the past.



If Daniela was going to have a future with him, she had to sever all tieswith her past. It wouldn't be hard-after all, they were just a few childish sketches,worth nothing at all.


As he thought about Richard's plan to have Daniela over for dinner in a few days, a slow smile tugged at the corners of his lips.



A flicker of anticipation stirred within him-something he didn't often allow himself to feel.



Daniela might not have the most exciting personality,but there was no denying her beauty. If she could  settle down and be the kind of wife and mother he envisioned,he thought their marriage might just work after all. 



With that thought in mind, Alexander pushed the gas pedal, and his car shot off down the road.


Meanwhile, Peyton waited for the doors to shut completely before looking at Caiden. "Was that Alexander just now?"



Caiden remained silent, but Ronald, always ready to cause a stir, spoke up. "Yes, that's Alexander.The one who married Daniela and then divorced her. And if I'm right..."



He paused for effect, then grinned as he continued,"It's all because of Joyce, isn't it? She made a scene at their wedding and ruined a perfectly good marriage."



Wyatt nodded eagerly, jumping into the conversation."Oh, that was all over the news. Mom, I still have the video of the fire on my phone. Your precious granddaughter nearly died in it."


He pulled out his phone, found the video, and passed it to Peyton.
###Chapter 97 Alexander And Peyton's Meeting
As Peyton watched the video, her expression darkened with each moment that passed.



Abruptly, she slammed her palm against the table,rising to her feet.


She jabbed a finger towards Katrina, her voice sharp as she accused her. "You scheming little pest!"


She then spun to face Caiden, her eyes ablaze with indignation. "Look at the sort of people you've let into our family. What have they turned your daughter into?On such a crucial day, they dared to behave like this and yet they lounge comfortably in our villa! You've clearly let these two rascals get away with too much.It's no wonder Daniela felt compelled to flee from this place after enduring such torment. Caiden, you really are beyond belief!"



As Peyton unleashed her tirade, Katrina attempted to muster a tearful display of innocence.



However, before she could begin her act, Peyton cut her off sharply, and when Katrina resorted to a dramatic threat to end her own life, Peyton coldly addressed Caiden. "If she's serious, then so be it!
Nonetheless,my granddaughter's marriage couldn't be delayed. Fetch Alexander immediately!"



Katrina's eyes shot open in alarm. "Peyton, what are you implying? Alexander belongs to Joyce now! Why summon him here? Are you seriously implying that Daniela and Alexander should try to spark things up again?"



Peyton swiveled her head back, her voice steady and resolute. "And why not? Marriage should be based on mutual affection. If Alexander retains his feelings and wishes to reunite with Daniela, I see no fault in exploring that possibility!"



The words hit her like a slap, and all Katrina could think about was how satisfyingit would feel to shut Peyton up permanently. 3



She turned to Caiden, her eyes brimming with tears,seeking some solace or support. Yet Caiden,absorbed in his phone and utterly detached, simply shrugged."Mom isn't wrong. Joyce was at fault back then.Haven't you always trusted the Bennett family? It wouldn't hurt to have Alexander come over and discuss things. Marriage does require agreement from both parties, after all. You wouldn't want Joyce to end up miserable, would you?"



His words rang with a veneer of reason and righteousness. Katrina's gaze lingered on Caiden, now riddled with doubt and suspicion. "Honey..." She positioned herself beside him, her tone tinged with concern. "Have you been dealing with something lately?"



Caiden barely glanced up from his game. "Hmm?"



"I haven't forgotten how you were once all for Alexander and Joyce, claiming they were perfect for each other, like it was written in the stars."



It had been days since she heard Caiden refer to Daniela as a disgrace.



"Really?" Caiden's response was nonchalant. "I still believe they're suited for each other. But with Mom here now, it seems wise to go along with her wishes."



Katrina had never considered Caiden particularly devoted or dutiful.


In her younger days, Peyton had been a forceful personality with little time to spare for nurturing her children. Despite outward appearances of closeness,Katrina sensed the children's affections were superficial at best.



She was keenly aware of the emotional distance.



Lately, Katrina had even grown suspicious of Caiden's frequent use of his phone, fearing he might be entangled in an affair.



However, her investigations revealed that Caiden's most significant phone expense was not clandestine meetings but online chess games. 2



Ultimately, it was Caiden who arranged for Alexander to visit, ostensibly for Peyton.


As Alexander was about to enter, Katrina clasped his hand urgently. Her expression was anything but serene as she implored, "Alexander, my mother-in-law is inside. Just respond to her questions, and remember,there's no need to be nervous or speak without thinking,alright?"



Pulling his hand gently from her grasp, Alexander responded with a measured coolness, "Understood."


Feeling the absence of his hand, Katrina experienced a pang of emptiness.



Upon his entry, Peyton greeted him with uncharacteristic warmth. "Alexander!"



Taking a seat, Alexander acknowledged her with a nod."It's good to see you, Mrs. Harper."
###Chapter 98 Hands Off The Harper Family's Fortune
Peyton, her face etched with deep lines of age,suddenly beamed a wide smile. "Alexander, you see, l invited you here because I want to know if you still harbor any feelings for Daniela."



Alexander caught a glimpse of Katrina, who was covertly signaling him with winks.



Richard had vaguely mentioned some urgent business over the phone. However,Alexander was completely unprepared for such a direct personal query.



Caiden strode into the room with a platter with fruits,which he placed on the center table, casting a meaningful glance at Alexander.


"Nothing deeper to it. We're simply asking," Caiden remarked, extending an apple towards Alexander.



Without a word, Alexander kept his thoughts to himself.



Impatience crept into Peyton's tone. "Speak, won't you? Without your words, how am I to assist you?"


Peyton,always charmed by the unpolished honesty of country people, found herself quite taken with Alexander.



Her expression softened into a gentle, encouraging smile. "Is it shyness that holds your tongue? Well then,let me pose it this way. If life hadn't thrown that unexpected twist, and you and Daniela were still married, do you reckon life would have been good with her?"



Alexander took a deep breath, weighing her question with a serious gaze. "Yes, I believe it would have been.Daniela was the one who initiated our divorce."



This was indeed the reality of their situation.


He had never once entertained the notion of divorce after marrying Daniela.



While Daniela lacked ambition, her compliance was a trait he found to be adequately pleasing.


Had it not been for her stubbornness, their lives would not have unfolded as they did.



With a chuckle, Peyton asked Alexander once more,"So, if I managed to reunite you two, would you be open to that idea?"



Katrina, who had been biting her tongue until now,burst out, "Peyton, that's out of line. Alexander is destined to marry Joyce. We've settled on that-he's my son-in-law."


Ignoring Katrina's protests, Peyton	grasped Alexander's hand with a sincere expression."Alexander, what do you say? If you're willing, I'll make it work."



Reflecting on his father's recent conversation with Daniela, Alexander hesitated momentarily before responding to Peyton, "I don't think she'd want to marry me anymore."


At his admission, Peyton slapped her thigh. Caiden's face softened.



"Don't fret over it. I'll take care of everything. Daniela isn't foolish; who else would she choose over a catch like you? Yes, she's quick-tempered, but overlook that for now. Just sit tight and wait for my update-I'll speak to her, and soon you'll be on your way to making her your bride again. Trust me, I'll sort this out flawlessly."



Alexander had previously crossed paths with Peyton.She consistently preferred the company of boys to girls. In her perspective, Daniela was scarcely noteworthy.



Alexander had frequently caught Peyton openly disparaging Daniela as a pointless expense, voicing her criticism loudly and without any hesitation.  His trust in Peyton's remarks was thin.


Raising his eyes, he noticed Caiden offering a surprisingly affectionate smile.



In a soft and reassuring voice, Caiden comforted him."Mom assured us she'd take care of everything. Just head home and stay tuned for updates. Remember,Joyce was the one who acted out of turn and shook up your marriage. If you're still harboring feelings for Daniela, it's only right that you receive some form of fairness."



Acknowledging the advice, Alexander stood up decisively. "I'll go and talk it over with my father."


Caught off guard,Katrina remained motionless nearby,her eyes wide as she watched the two men conclude their business just like that.



Not a single word was said about Joyce.



Burning with indignation, Katrina nearly sprinted after Alexander, but Caiden grabbed her arm, stopping her.



She whirled around, her eyes cold as she faced Caiden."What are you suggesting?"


Feigning naivety, Caiden explained,"The timing is off.Joyce is pregnant, and marrying into the Bennett family under these conditions would only lead to disdain. You'd have to promise a hefty dowry. The Bennett family isn't known for being gullible. If the dowry seems insufficient,would they even consider it?"



Katrina's expression turned from shock to sheer disbelief. Gazing intensely at Caiden, she challenged him. "Caiden! What exactly are you implying? Didn't we settle on a plan earlier? All the Harper family's wealth is going to Joyce! Are you seriously thinking of not keeping your word?"



Before Caiden could muster a reply, Peyton exclaimed,"What did you just say? Joyce is pregnant? And the baby isn't Alexander's? You plan to bestow the entire Harper family's fortune as Joyce's dowry?"


Peyton's reaction was fierce. "Katrina, over my dead body will you touch a dime of the Harper family's assets!"



Katrina felt like she was on the verge of losing her mind.



For years,she had weathered countless difficulties,all for the sake of Caiden. 2



Wasn't it all for a share of the Harper family's fortune?
2

Was all her dedication to be disregarded with a mere word from Caiden, demanding she forfeit her claim?That was utterly unthinkable. Suddenly, the entire house plunged into turmoil.







Back at the company, Daniela felt a sense of unease creeping over her.


Richard had shown up with a sketchbook similar to hers, suggesting they knew about the original one.


She swept the papers off her desk and informed Lillian,"I need to return to the Harper family."


"Okay." Lillian turned around, only to discover that Daniela had vanished without a trace.
###Chapter 99 Leeches



The Harper family's doorbell chimed unexpectedly.


Caiden was taken aback to find Daniela on the doorstep. "Daniela, you're back already?" he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice.


The bustling noise from inside the house ceased instantly at his words.


Peyton appeared in the doorway, excitement etched on his face,with Ronald and Wyatt trailing behind him.


"Daniela, you've returned from abroad! How marvelous to see you, and look at you, more stunning than ever!" Peyton burst out, his smile spreading from ear to ear. "Please, come in-this is your home.Why stop at the doorstep? Come on in,I've got fantastic news you need to hear!"


Before Peyton could elaborate further, Daniela cut in,her voice steady yet filled with urgency. "I apologize for interrupting, but there's a sketchbook I left in my old room. It's quite personal to me, and I need to get it back."



Her frustration was palpable; she was annoyed with herself for overlooking such a vital item amidst the recent upheavals.


At first, Daniela had assumed the figure from her past was Alexander. Having resolved to sever connections with him, she had dismissed the importance of the sketchbook.



However, upon realizing her mistake-that it wasn't him-she recognized the profound significance of the sketchbook.



Whether or not she would ever reconnect with that individual, the sketchbook had been her refuge during bleak moments. It was an essential emotional lifeline,and she was determined not to forsake it.



Peyton attempted to usher Daniela through the doorway,yet Daniela briskly shrugged her off.


"Would it be too much trouble for you to retrieve it for me?" Daniela asked Caiden, her voice carrying a frosty note.


Caiden's response came quickly, accompanied by a fervent nod. "Certainly. I'll go fetch it right away."


Katrina,who had been observing from a short distance,squinted her eyes in suspicion, scrutinizing Caiden's apparent zeal.


Something about his demeanor seemed decidedly peculiar. With a purposeful stride, Caiden ascended the stairs.


Meanwhile, Peyton, unfazed by the slight rejection,offered Daniela a reassuring smile. "Daniela, don't hesitate. Remember, you'll always belong with the Harper family. One day, all of this will be yours."


Daniela remained indifferent to the allure of the Harper family's fortune.


Elite Lux's three-month revenue was so staggering that they could have bought the Harper family outright.


Disinterested in their trivial disputes, she stood at the doorway, waiting for Caiden to return with her sketchbook.



Peyton chuckled. "You've really taken after your mother-stubborn to the core. However, a young woman like yourself can't afford to be this way forever. There comes a time when you must learn to lean on others. Believe me, life gets a lot easier when you're not trying to juggle everything on your own.I recently met Alexander. He's quite tall, strikingly handsome,and moves with an air of confidence. Word is, their family business is flourishing. Should you choose to join their family, they might even lend their expertise in managing your company. Here's a bit of advice-there's no need for a woman to prove she's overly capable. At times, it's wiser to let others take the lead. Consider your mother-she toiled relentlessly, but to what end? After her passing, all her hard-earned gains simply lined the pockets of those who hardly deserved it. You should delegate more. Let the men in the family handle some things.Speaking of which,your uncles are not only skilled but they're family too. Cutting ties with Caiden doesn't change who you are-you're still family. So,about helping your uncles with their jobs-you'll do it,won't you? With your success, it's the perfect time to step up and help. Ronald's managed to buy a new home,though he's still struggling with the mortgage."


Ronald's eyes sparkled with a mix of gratitude and urgency. "Exactly, Mom! We're still stuck with over two million in debt to deal with!"


"And Wyatt. You haven't purchased a car yet, have you?"



Wyatt quickly responded, "That's correct, Mom. But I've set my sights on a limited-edition supercar-priced just a bit over ten million!"



Ronald beamed with anticipation, exclaiming, "Mom,I'd like one too! My car's practically falling apart. And you know, our little house just isn't big enough for us anymore. Daniela, if you could get us another one,that'd be absolutely incredible!"


Peyton nodded with approval. "Absolutely. With Daniela raking in the cash these days, it's only fair she lends a hand to her family. Daniela,you really should take care of your nieces' and nephews' school fees as well."



Ronald chimed in, "Mom, the kids have been dreaming of studying at an international school."


Peyton quickly concurred, "Yes,definitely!"


Ronald cast a cautious glance towards Daniela and whispered, "But keep in mind, it's costly-millions per year. And if they go overseas for college, we're talking over ten million for each child."



The family had five children to consider.


A fund of seventy to eighty million wouldn't be amiss -it took a fortune to provide the finest for one's children.



Ronald's thoughts drifted towards the ambitious.



Peyton, steadfast in her resolve, proclaimed, "Yes,that wilI do!" She then turned to Ronald's wife, adding,"You're fortunate to have Daniela's support. With such great opportunities, don't hold back. Expand the Harper family-Daniela can handle it!"
###Chapter 100 The Sketchbook Was Lost
Peyton's authoritative tone rang out, making Ronald and Wyatt grin like fools as she piled on ridiculous demands for Daniela. 



Inside, Ronald's child was practically leaping with excitement. "I'm going abroad!"


Katrina observed from a distance.



Daniela stood poised at the doorway, waiting for Caiden's return with the sketchbook.



Noticing Daniela's quiet demeanor, Peyton frowned slightly and pressed her lips together in mild annoyance. "Daniela, you're awfully quiet. What's the matter? You're not having second thoughts,are you?Remember, you're a Harper. A little expense shouldn't make you bat an eyelid."



But Daniela remained silent,her expression unchanged.



Peyton's frustration grew, and she bit her lip, feeling a twinge of guilt for her past harshness towards Daniela. "Alexander is willing to remarry you. Can't you manage a smile for that?" At these words, Daniela struggled to contain her emotions. "To begin with, I never sought your intervention.Furthermore, I've severed all ties with the Bennett family, so kindly refrain from involving yourself."


Katrina, who had been listening, nearly burst into laughter.



Irritated by the exchange, Peyton's face darkened,and she abruptly slapped Daniela's hand.


The slap was sharp enough to leave Daniela's hand visibly reddened.


Daniela barely flinched, her eyes remaining locked on the staircase,ignoring the sting on her hand.



Caiden was yet to make an appearance.



From the corridor, his voice resounded, calling out,"Josie! Could you help me look for Daniela's sketchbook? It seems to have vanished."



To everyone in the family, it was clear that the sketchbook was Daniela's most treasured item.



The absence of it sent a wave of anxiety crashing over Caiden.



Josie hastened upstairs and embarked on an extended search.


Peyton craned her neck, her voice laced with concern."What's happening? Why is this taking so long?"


Unable to contain her frustration any longer, Daniela stormed inside. A throng of curious onlookers trailed behind her, all cramming into her tiny room.


A mere ten minutes later, every corner of Daniela's room had been upended.


"Where could it be?" Daniela demanded,her tone icy and her expression steely.


Caiden, not giving up, turned to Josie once more."Any idea where it is?"


Josie, overwhelmed and close to tears, admitted, "I honestly don't know. Mrs. Harper told me Ms. Harper should tidy her own room, so I steer clear of it.Besides, it's quite stuffy in here-no windows, no sunlight. It's usually deserted."


Caiden's brow furrowed in response. Trying to reassure Daniela, he said, "Don't worry. Josie hasn't touched anything in here, so it's bound to be somewhere around. We don't have many visitors, so it surely hasn't been misplaced."



Upon hearing that, Daniela halted mid-motion, her eyes narrowing as she fixed a piercing gaze on Katrina.
"Why are you staring at me like that? I..." Katrina suddenly remembered the black plastic bag Alexander had delivered just days prior. She had carelessly tossed it into the overflowing trash bin, commanding Josie to dispose of it.


A flicker of panic flashed through Katrina's eyes, a detail Daniela didn't miss.



"Where is it now?" Daniela demanded, her expression stern and unyielding.


Peyton grabbed Katrina by the arm and pressed,her voice laced with frustration. "Where the hell is it?"


Unfamiliar with the upper floors, Peyton was oblivious to the fact that Daniela had been relegated to such a modest room.



In the grandeur of such a vast villa, it was astonishing that Daniela resided in a mere storage room.



Katrina exchanged a helpless glance with Caiden, her eyes begging for assistance.


Caiden asked, "Where is it?"


Katrina's response was hesitant, her words tumbling out awkwardly. "That day, Alexander brought it here,encased in a worn-out garbage bag. When I felt it, it was stiff, like thick cardboard. So I tossed it into the  cash can."



Turning abruptly towards Josie, Katrina rebuked her sharply. "Josie! How could you let this happen? I threw out something important, and you didn't even care to check? What's wrong with you?"



Josie was caught off-guard.



Katrina whirled to face Caiden, her unease palpable."Alexander's at fault too. How could he be so careless with something that mattered so much? At the very least, he could have packaged it properly. And really,what interest does a CEO like Alexander have in Daniela's sketchbook? If he hadn't taken it in the first place, I wouldn't have dismissed it as trash so thoughtlessly."


Daniela stood nearby, her fists balled in silent fury,her gaze fixated on Katrina. She glanced towards the door,noticing the lock that had long been weak, and her eyes darkened with a deep, unsettling shadow.


Worried about facing Peyton's reprimand, Katrina hastily grabbed her phone and called Alexander.


"Alexander, was the black garbage bag you brought over last time the one with Daniela's sketchbook in it?"



Alexander, interrupted during a meeting, took a moment to confirm. "Yes, that was it."
"Why on earth didn't you specify? I assumed you had brought actual garbage, so I threw it out. Now Daniela has returned and is looking for it. Can't you tell how this mess is making me look bad?"



Seated in the conference room,Alexander hesitated before instructing Katrina, "Please pass the phone to Daniela."
###Chapter 101 Something's Off With Caiden
Katrina passed the phone to Daniela, and she accepted it.


"Daniela, I admit it's my mistake," Alexander explained,his tone casual and distant, as if the issue didn't matter much to him. "That sketchbook was worn out,and frankly, it wasn't worth much. I'l have a better one sent to you soon."



After a brief pause, he spoke again, clearly thinking the matter was settled. "A few days ago, my dad mentioned he visited you. He suggested I invite you for a meal. When would be a good time? Let's call it my way of saying sorry. How does that sound?"



A heavy silence filled the room. Everyone's gaze was fixed on Daniela.



The coldness in her posture, the way her hand tightened at her side-it was clear she was fuming,a storm of emotions brewing under her still exterior,though she remained silent.



Caiden bit his lip, stepping closer to console her."Daniela, I understand how important that sketchbook was to you.I..." "Fine." Daniela's unexpected reply interrupted him,her voice steady but surprising. She gave a slight smile and spoke into the phone. "Let's meet at Elite Lux."



She ended the calI without another word.



Katrina,watching her closely, scoffed loudly."Oh,so now you're playing hard to get, huh? All that nonsense about how precious that sketchbook was to you-what a joke. The truth is, you were just looking for any excuse to get close to Alexander again, weren't you?Don't try to fool anyone, Daniela. You're still the same pathetic girl, desperate to follow Alexander around like some eager little puppy, hoping for his attention."



Katrina's words were laced with venom. "If this was your plan all along, why bother with all the drama?Daniela,you disgust me."



Daniela casually threw the phone into Katrina's arms,her gaze unblinking. She leaned in closer, her voice low enough for only the two of them to hear. "You're right about one thing. I came here just to disgust you After the meal with Alexander, do you honestly think your plan to marry Joyce into the Bennett family is still going to succeed?"



Katrina's expression darkened.



Daniela let out a soft, unsettling laugh, the kind that didn't resemble the sweet girl everyone was familiar with.



"Katrina, I couldn't care less about what you've done before. But this time, you've gone too far. Don't worry,I won't deal with you. I'll let you stay alive long enough to watch what happens to Joyce."



With that, Daniela turned and walked away,leaving Katrina standing there in stunned silence. Her hands clenched intofists, and her voice trembled with fury as she shouted after her, "How dare you! Daniela,how dare you!"



Her words echoed in the stillness, but Daniela didn't so much as spare a glance. Without hesitation, she slid into her exclusive, limited-edition car and sped off.



As Peyton descended the stairs, her gaze wandered toward Joyce's room.



The room was a perfect blend of princess-like elegance,filled with sunlight. It was spacious and airy,with floor-to-ceiling windows that opened up to a verdant greenbelt. Fresh air streamed in, rejuvenating anyone who entered.



Peyton snapped her head towards Caiden, shooting him a cold look. "Caiden, you really went all out raising someone else's daughter!"



Ronald and Wyatt, on the other hand,were only concerned with one thing. "Mom, do you think Daniela will keep her word? When do you think she'll make it happen?"



After all, it was about a future of endless wealth and luxury.



Peyton's wrinkled face twisted into a displeased frown."Didn't you notice the way she was acting today? She was in a terrible mood. Just give her some time.I'll take some fruit and visit her at work. Did you see? She didn't even argue with a single thing I said earlier.Trust me, she's wealthy now, and you're her uncles. Do you really think she'd hold back from helping you?”



Ronald and Wyatt visibly relaxed, their tense expressions softening with relief.



But Katrina wasn't as easily comforted.



She turned to Caiden, her voice edged with concern."Caiden, what do you think Daniela meant by what she said? Is she trying to destroy Alexander and Joyce's relationship? She is, isn't she?"



Caiden remained composed, his tone steady. "You're reading too much into it. Daniela isn't like that."



"Not like that? She said it herself! She told me exactly what she was planning. And the way she looked at me -her eyes were cold, full of calculation,ruthless!Daniela is Brylee's daughter! She's got that same blood running through her veins. With a mother like  Brylee, how could Daniela possibly be anything but trouble?"



Katrina's anxiety grew stronger as she continued,"You have to understand, Caiden. Daniela really said it. She promised she wouldn't touch me, but then she made it clear she wants me to witness Joyce's destruction firsthand. She's planning to ruin our daughter!"



"That's impossible. Daniela is my daughter too. She wouldn't harm Joyce," Caiden responded flatly.



Katrina collapsed into tears. She cursed Peyton,Caiden, and Daniela even more fiercely.



Annoyed, Caiden snatched his phone and retreated to the guest room.



Katrina went to the balcony with a cigarette dangling between her fingers. "Mom, I'm telling you, there's something really off about Caiden lately. He's not acting like himself at all."
###Chapter 102 Was This Really Daniela

In the past, no matter what Katrina asked of him,Caiden would always obey without question.



He never dared to oppose her, always going along with her wishes.



He showered her with affection, treating her as if she were precious beyond measure.



She had free rein over the finances, spending as she pleased, and he never once raised an objection. His attitude towards Daniela had always been one of contempt.



Today,however,when Caiden saw Daniela, there was no trace of his usual irritation, but rather a subtle,restrained joy.



That wasn't like him at all. Something definitely wasn't right.



Katrina's mother replied, "Caiden's always been like this for years.Why are you acting so surprised? You're just being too impatient. Besides, you've had the upper hand with Daniela for so long. How could she suddenly flip the script? Don't worry. You still hold the power over him."



Katrina hung up the phone. Her eyes lingered on the city lights outside as she murmured to herself, "Looks like Daniela won't be as easy to handle from now on."







As the secretary arrived at the construction site,Cedric was deep in conversation on the phone.



Not wanting to interrupt, the secretary quietly moved past him. As he did, Claude Vazquez scrunched his nose in distaste. "Benny, what's that awful smell on you?"



Benny Salazar let out a laugh. "The company bought a landfill to turn into a cemetery. I was just there."



Claude gestured towards the object in Benny's hand."Do you paint?"



Benny looked down at the sketchbook in his hand, a slight frown forming. "This? How did I end up with this?; I found it in the trash. It was so hot; I just used it to cool myself off."



As he spoke, he made a move to toss it away, but when he saw Cedric finishing his call nearby, he quickly grabbed some documents from his bag and s shoved the sketchbook inside.
That night, the whole Olisvine landfill was scoured from top to bottom.


Lillian, her clothes covered in dirt, spoke with frustration. "I couldn't find it."


Daniela's eyes were like ice, filled with a cold fury.She stood motionless in the landfill for what felt like an eternity, not a word escaping her lips.



As the first light of dawn began to break, she let out a heavy sigh,exhaustion weighing her down. "Let's go."


When she returned, she took a long, much-needed shower before collapsing into bed for a deep sleep.


Later,when Alexander came looking for her, he found Daniela standing on the balcony with her attention focused on sketching the sunset.



Today, she wasn't dressed in her usual formal attire,but instead, she wore simple, comfortable home clothes.



The spacious balcony had a slight chill to the air, and Alexander stood silently behind her.



He wasn't one for art, never quite able to grasp its depths, but he sure knew how to appreciate a woman.


Daniela was dressed in a pristine white floral top that  shimmered softly in the fading sunlight. Her long hair,softly curled, rested elegantly over her shoulders,swaying gently with each movement she made.



He muttered something quietly. Daniela, however,remained silent, absorbed in her work.



The warm glow of the sunset bathed her face in a golden light, casting an almost ethereal glow on her features.



Alexander found himself momentarily mesmerized by the scene before him.



It wasn't until Daniela set her brush down that he slowly snapped back to reality. 



"That's a beautiful painting," Alexander remarked,his voice filled with genuine admiration.



Daniela dropped the brush into the tray, then walked to the bathroom to wash her hands. Afterward, she poured herself a glass of water, the quiet moments stretching on.



She took a sip, then finally turned her gaze to him.



He was the man she had loved deeply for so long, the one she had once thought was everything to her.



Now, as she regarded him, there was no longer the adoration or reverence that once filled her eyes.  Instead, she saw him as just another man, ordinary and flawed.



She had lost the urge to explore him.



With a small gesture, she indicated the chair acrosS from her. "Please, take a seat."



Taking a seat, Alexander apologized. "I'm truly sorry about the sketchbook." Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a brand-new sketchbook and extended it towards her. "I hope this can make up for it."



Alexander, assuming that a gift would win her over,believed she would appreciate and cherish it as a token of his apology.



He convinced himself that Daniela's earlier visit to the Harper family, where she had asked about the old sketchbook,was merely an excuse to get closer to him,as Katrina had suggested.



However, as he observed Daniela's expression, the indifference in her eyes pierced him.



All he saw was a cold, distant look, devoid of the warmth he once relied on.



"You don't like it? If it's not to your taste, tell me what kind you prefer, and I'll have someone find it for you." The humility in Alexander's voice was a rare shift,revealing his desire to make amends. Daniela, of course, understood his intentions. A faint smile tugged at her lips, but she didn't even look his way. "It's fine. I don't paint much these days, so it really doesn't matter."



Alexander gave a nod. "I understand. Your company's doing well now, so l imagine time's harder to come by.But once someone steps in to help share the load,things will be much easier." 3



Daniela, without a word, lowered her gaze and continued cutting her steak, her focus entirely on the plate in front of her.



A flicker of frustration crossed Alexander's face.



He wasn't accustomed to being shut out by Daniela.Just as he opened his mouth to speak again, Daniela had already set down her knife and fork. "I'm done.Are you?"



Alexander looked down at his untouched steak and,standing up, replied, "I'm not hungry."



Daniela nodded, her voice soft but firm. "I'm tired. I won't be seeing you out."



She then walked to the living room, silently organizing the sketches on the balcony, her face unreadable,her eyes entirely distant from him. Alexander had no choice but to follow the silent cue and leave.



Just as the door was about to click shut, a soft sound of footsteps caught his attention. He spun around,his curiosity piqued.



To his surprise, it was Daniela, who had just been in the living room moments earlier. She walked to the dining table, picked up the sketchbook he had just handed her, and without a second thought, tossed it into the trash can.



For a moment, Alexander stood frozen, staring at her in disbelief. Daniela met his gaze briefly, her eyes cool and distant.



Under the harsh light, her eyes seemed bright yet completely indifferent, her aloofness sharp. She glanced at him for a fleeting second before turning away slowly



He stood there, watching her retreat upstairs, her movements deliberate and final.



The door closed behind her, and Alexander remained,standing in place, lost in thought.



He couldn't understand it. But in that moment, an unsettling sense of cold dread  washed over him.



Was this really Daniela?
###Chapter 103 | Suspect Daniela Doesn't Like Me...
Alexander stepped out of Daniela's residence to find Richard waiting expectantly by the car.



Richard had taken it upon himself to drive Alexander today,his motives clear.



Given Daniela's soaring influence, Richard was desperate to win her good graces.



The thought of anyone else gaining her favor was unbearable to him.



"How did things go?" Richard pressed, flashing a sly grin. "Was it a candlelit dinner or a lavish meal? Did Daniela invite you to stay overnight? Remember my advice, Alexander. Don't be too quick to please her.You need to keep her intrigued. First, secure the lucrative North District project, then aim for the company shares, and finally, make her desperate to marry you. Then, she won't be able to leave you anymore. And Elite Lux will be firmly in your hands.You're playing your cards right; you really are my son!"Richard's voice swelled with pride. 



"Dad, I didn't have dinner," Alexander interjected, his tone flat. 
Richard's smile vanished, replaced by a look of utter disbelief. "What did you just say?"



Holding Richard's bewildered gaze, Alexander replied,"I didn't eat a thing. She had her meal alone and then told me to leave."



Richard, flustered, waved his hand in dismissal."That can't be right! Daniela would starve herself before neglecting you like that. Have you done something to upset her?"



Alexander shook his head with a slow, deliberate motion. He recalled how Daniela had disdainfully tossed his sketchbook into the trash can. Her expression was cold, calculating, distant, and eerie. 



"I suspect Daniela doesn't like me anymore,"Alexander murmured, releasing a weary sigh.



Richard, however, remained unconvinced. "How can you say that? Why did she invite you to dinner if she didn't even like you? If she truly didn't give a damn,she wouldn't even take your calls. And let's face it,you wouldn't have lingered up there if she didn't show some interest.Sometimes,you need to coax a woman." He pointed to the grand sign adorning the building and continued, "With all this wealth at stake, even if Daniela doesn't harbor feelings for you now, you must sway her to marry you. Don't worry. I know charming  women isn't your strong suit, so I've assembled some tools to help you win her heart!"



With that, he took Alexander back to the company.



The moment they emerged from the car, Alexander's eyes widened at the sight of a dozen employees lined up at the entrance.



They chimed together in a well-rehearsed chorus."Good evening!"



Once inside, Richard ushered Alexander towards the CEO's office.



With a gentle push, he swung open the door to an office adorned with an array of photos featuring Daniela.



Across from the desk, a large blackboard dominated the room, covered in extensive analyses of Daniela's preferences, personality, and the traits she found appealing in a partner.


"I've brought in a relationship strategist specifically for your pursuit. They've dissected every facet of Daniela's life to maximize your chances of captivating her heart." 2



As Richard elaborated on the strategy, his phone buzzed-Katrina was calling. He excused himself with a reassuring pat on Alexander's shoulder, whispering, "The Bennett family's future rests on your shoulders now."



With those parting words, he stepped into the corridor.



"Katrina, Alexander is currently committed to his professional responsibilities and is not considering any romantic entanglements. You'll need to look elsewhere for a father for your daughter's child,"Richard stated flatly.



Katrina's eyes widened in disbelief as she demanded,"What do you mean by that? I thought we had an agreement. Why this sudden change? Richard, are you worried that Caiden might exclude Joyce from his will?You're overthinking this, really. Joyce is the sole heiress of the Harper family.Who else is there but her?Yes, she slipped up, got pregnant out of wedlock,but I assure you, she's severed all ties with that man! If you have any further conditions, let's dscuss them openly."



Richard held his phone at arm's length, his expression one of scorn. "While Joyce is your treasure,Alexander remains my pride. He will not shoulder the burden of raising another's child. Should this scandal come to light, the blame would fall squarely on my shoulders,as if I traded my son's future for your fortune. No wealth is worth that compromise." Katrina,frantic,attempted to salvage the conversation."But no one need ever learn of Joyce's child..."



However, her words were cut short by the harsh beep of the call ending.



A storm of fury surged through Katrina, overtaking her completely.



Staring down the phone, her face twisted in rage, she spat, "Daniela, you fucking bitch! You've ruined my plans, and I'll make damn sure you regret it!"



Daniela had never imagined that her offhand remarks would cause the Bennett family to reconsider their relationship with Katrina.



At breakfast, Katrina had come to cause a scene.



Daniela was seated in the dining room, observing Katrina,who looked wild and frantic, her hair a mess.



Ronald, Wyatt, and a few others restrained Katrina.



Then, Peyton, unable to contain her frustration any longer,slapped Katrina hard, sending her crumpling to the ground in a flood of tears.



"Are you all ganging up on me now? Caiden! You have to intervene! Will you just stand there and let me be tormented?" Katrina cried out. From her position on the floor, she pointed accusingly at Daniela through the floor-to-ceiling window."And look at your ex-wife's daughter, taking pleasure in my distress! Can you see this? Whose side are you on,Caiden?"
###Chapter 104 | Don't Settle For Cast-Offs
Daniela was anticipating Caiden's eruption into the fray.



Yet, Caiden cast a brief glance at Daniela, who was observing the commotion with her chin resting on her hand, and addressed Katrina with unexpected composure. "What the hell is wrong with you? Get off the ground and stop embarrassing yourself like a goddamn idiot!"



Daniela, her expression icy and detached, overheard every word clearly.



Off to the side, Lillian leaned towards Ryan and murmured, "Caiden's behavioris peculiar today, isn'tit?"



Peering towards Daniela, Ryan nodded and whispered back, "Ever since that sketchbook disappeared,Daniela has been in a foul temper. She doesn't give a damn about anyone else."



Realization dawned on Katrina that her theatrics were futile.Daniela was merely a spectator to her disgrace,entirely uninvolved and unresponsive. Leaving now would just make her a loser walking away with empty hands.She picked herself up, yanked Caiden aside, and wpedher tears away forcefully, "Caiden! Cut the crap andtell me what the hell is your problem? Daniela ruinedmy daughter's marriage, it's her or me today! Youneed to confront her and demand justice for us!"
Without a word, Caiden remained still, giving nothingаwаy
Katrina's voice escalated, tears streaming anew, "Fine!If you won't defend me, we might as well divorce!We'll split everything, Half for you, half for me. Wththat, the Bennett family will certainly welcome mydaughter with open arms!"
Caiden froze for a moment, stunned that Katrine hedthe nerve to stake a claim on half his wealth,
His eyes widened in surprise, and as he gaped at herKatrina's voice softened a touch, "Don't give me tha!look, and let's not revisit how the Harper family'sfortune was eamed by Bree, I'm your wife nowCaiden, What belongs to you also belongs to me. l'mnot picking a fight, but Daniela's gone too far!"
Joyce's belly was visibly growing day by day
If Alexander wouldn't mary her, was her fate to bewth a man once maried?
The mere idea sent a shiver down her spine, Observing the resolve in Katrina's expression, Caiden conceded,"Fine."



Katrina exhaled a quiet breath of relief, reassured by her belief that Caiden wouldn't leave her-not when no one else could match her unwavering support for him.



She leaned in slightly, her tone laced with reassurance."Honey, don't worry. I won't cause a scene. I'll simply ask her about it, and if Daniela isn't involved, I'll apologize."



Caiden barely looked up, his voice devoid of emotion."Sure."



With that, Katrina turned on her heel and marched back to the building, her steps echoing with resolve and a touch of defiance.



"Daniela! Come out! We need to talk!"



Daniela emerged, her presence icy. "What is it?"



Katrina's eyes blazed with fury as she snapped,"Was it you who wrecked Alexander and Joyce's marriage?"



Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she pressed on."Tell me,did you?"



As she spoke, Katrina raised her hand in a threatening  gesture, but before it could strike, Daniela looked up sharply, her intense eyes locking with Katrina's in a silent challenge.



Katrina's heart fluttered unexpectedly, causing her raised hand to pause mid-air before retreating to her side.



"What bullshit are you even saying?" Daniela's lips twisted into a subtle smile, her eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and challenge as she faced Katrina."Give me a break. You're throwing out accusations like a fool. Show me some proof or get lost."


"What proof is necessary when it's clear as day it was you? Why else would the Bennett family go back on their word? They were committed to the wedding just after New Year's! Is this your way of getting back at us?"



Daniela nodded, her expression thoughtful yet mocking. "Interesting theory. So, tell me, what am l supposedly avenging? What kind of shit do you think I care enough about to get revenge for?"



"You..." Katrina faltered, her eyes darting nervously."You were once married to Alexander, and Joyce has already apologized for that incident at the fire. What more do you want from her? Daniela,let bygones be bygones!"



Daniela's smile turned frosty, her tone dripping with  sarcasm. "Let bygones be bygones? So, you beg for mercy when you screw up, but when it's someone else's tum, you never let them live it down. Real classy of you, Katrina. And let me make one thing clear-if you're so desperate, feel free to scoop up the trash l toss out, but leave my name out of your pathetic games. I don't deal with leftovers. Oh, and one more thing. Your family really does have a thing for scraps,don't they? Just because Joyce is desperate enough to hang on to Alexander doesn't mean I give a damn.Do me a favor and keep your filthy drama to yourself -I can't stomach that disgusting crap."



Joyce felt those words like a punch to the gut,knocking the air right out of her.


The insult didn't just wound Joyce; it deeply affected Katrina and Caiden as well.



Everyone present was taken aback.



This was a side of Daniela they had never witnessed before.



Daniela, esteemed for her principled conduct and seldom seen engaging in disputes, had always appeared aloof, often ignoring petty squabbles and dismissive of the gossip swirled around her.


Yet, no one had ever seen her display such vehement anger. Without a moment's pause, Daniela whipped out her phone and dialed Alexander's number, right there in front of the entire Harper family and an increasingly curious circle of bystanders. She then activated the speakerphone.



Since their divorce, Daniela had never once reached out to Alexander first.



The sudden call took him by surprise, and his voice,tinged with unexpected warmth, didn't go unnoticed by Katrina, who watched with a frosty glare.



"Hello,Daniela."
###Chapter 105 You Caused This
Daniela's voice sliced through the air like a shard of ice, chilling Ryan and Lillian to their core. It was as if she harbored a murderous intent.



"Alexander, I have you on speakerphone. The Harpers are present. I need a direct answer. Have you been engaged to Joyce or not?"



"Absolutely not. I assure you, I have never been engaged to Joyce."



Daniela turned her piercing gaze to Katrina, whose face had bloomed a fiery red. She told Alexander,"Your family made this mess, so clean it up yourselves!If you told Joyce you'd marry her, then stop pestering me."



Alexander's voice, tinged with panic, cut through the tension. "I promise you, there's no truth to that! Have they been causing you trouble? I'll have my father sort this out immediately."  



After that, Daniela ended the call.



A mere ten minutes later, Richard arrived, his anxiety palpable. He approached Katrina, his voice laden with worry. "What's the commotion about? We're all reasonable folks here: why stir up such a scene?"



Richard, adept at gauging the mood, sensed Daniela's seething anger. Misinterpreting it as indignation over a rumored engagement between Alexander and Joyce,a smug satisfaction flickered across his face.



Seizing what he believed to be a chance at redemption, Richard donned a sincere smile and turned to Daniela. "Daniela, I admit, I mishandled things. I'll make sure Alexander apologizes to you personally.Just leave everything to me, okay?"



Next, he faced Katrina, his voice now laced with contempt. "Katrina, what you're doing is utterly unacceptable. Stop spreading your lies. Everyone here is well aware of Alexander's integrity. He truly is the finest young man anyone could know. However, his goodness doesn't give you the right to push your wayward daughter at him."



Katrina wanted to say something, but Richard continued, "Remember this-Alexander always wants Daniela. His loyalty to her has been unwavering. As for Joyce, with her dubious reputation and now expecting a child, she's clearly not a suitable match for him. It was Joyce who disrupted Alexander and Daniela's wedding once before. And now, just as they are finding their way back to each other, here you are causing chaos again! Katrina, the fact that Daniela isn't  your biological daughter doesn't give you the right to treat her like garbage. Remember, it was Brylee who took you in. After that,you fucked your way to power by crawling into her husband's bed. You're a walking disgrace. If you're hell-bent on this path, don't cry when Joyce ends up just as ruined as you. Is that what you're aiming for?"



Richard was a master at manipulating words, skillfully unveiling Joyce's secrets in a few deft sentences while portraying himself as the paragon of virtue.



His maneuvers were carefully orchestrated to capture Daniela's favor.



He cast a smug look towards Daniela, expecting approval. Yet, her expression remained icy and detached.



Katrina was left reeling, feeling the weight of judgmental glances and whispered conjectures around her.



The only response she could summon was a fiery glare directed at Daniela. "Daniela! Just you wait! This isn't over!"



Humiliated and cornered, Katrina was briskly escorted away by the Harper family, her departure marked by a trail of disgrace.



Caiden made a futile attempt to converse with Daniela,  who turned her back and disappeared into the building,leaving him amidst the unsettled crowd.



Richard dashed after her, his face stretched into a perennially ingratiating grin. "Daniela, next time something like this happens, don't hesitate to reach out to me. As for individuals such as Katrina, extending excessive politeness only serves as an invitation for exploitation."



Daniela entered the elevator, her gaze sharp and frosty as she faced Richard. "Shouldn't you be the one handling this mess? What, are you expecting gratitude from me now? If I'd known the circus of bullshit you'd bring into my life, I would've stayed the hell away from Alexander. Don't even think about showing your faces again."



With a resolute press of a button, Lillian initiated the elevator doors to close.



Richard made a brief attempt to wedge himself into the elevator to offer an explanation, but the doors clamped shut before he managed,leaving him outside.A security guard promptly intervened, escorting him away from the scene.



Visibly irked, Richard stomped his foot and dialed Alexander's number. "You need to resolve this immediately! Damn it, Daniela's pissed off! That bitch Katrina is trying to screw me over completely. If she  szibves Daniela away, I'll hunt her down and make her teansh she never crossed me!"
###Chapter 106 Begging For Help

That day, the scandal that Joyce was pregnant with another man's child and still pestered Alexander erupted across social media.



The very crowd that once lauded them while disparaging Daniela was now furiously posting online.


"Getting knocked up and then bugging her stepsister's ex-husband? That's some next-level desperation!"



"Richard said it himself-Joyce's mom schemed her way into the Harper family by spreading her legs for Caiden.Guess neither of them has a shred of decency."



"Poor Daniela. Honestly, I've always seen her as someone decent. But losing her mom so young and living under Katrina's rule must've been brutal."



The online frenzy was growing more intense by the minute.



Joyce was sprawled on the couch, weeping so intensely that she struggled for breath.



Peyton remarked nonchalantly, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Caiden, we're caught in your  storm. Haven't you noticed? Daniela won't even spare us a glance. I'm warning you, Caiden. If she bears a grudge, it'll be on you to salvage any favors she might extend to Ronald and Wyatt."



Katrina's tears stopped suddenly, her expression hardening in an instant.



Just as she opened her mouth to object, Caiden cut in."Alright, I'll handle it. Just leave Daniela out of this."


No sooner had he spoken than Ronald and Wyatt began to tally up their demands with their fingers."Caiden, since you're stepping up to take responsibility, we're not asking for much-just cars,houses,and a tidy sum of money."



Ronald and Wyatt exchanged knowing looks and declared in unison, "Eighty million each."



"Eighty million? Are you out of your mind?" Katrina jumped up, her voice dripping with disdain. "Just go rob a bank if you're that desperate!"



Ronald and Wyatt frowned. "Why the hell are you so worked up, Katrina? This isn't about you. We're talking to Caiden,not you."



"These are joint marital assets!" Katrina argued, her voice firm. After years of dedicated service to Caiden,all she desired was a fair share of the wealth."Don't even dream of getting a penny from me unless I fucking allow it!"



Ronald glared at her, jabbing a finger in her direction."What bullshit are you even talking about? Joint marital assets? Do you even have any claim to this money? This is the legacy our former sister-in-law left behind. You have no part in this!"



Katrina stormed into the kitchen, snatched up a knife,and bellowed, "Anyone who dares touch my family's fortune will answer to me. I'll make damn sure you regret it!"



Her shitty past, riddled with hunger and hardship,crept back in, making Katrina tremble. Giving away eighty million to those leeches felt like signing her own death warrant.



Unperturbed by the prospect of death yet terrified of destitution, Ronald advanced, his face defiant, and taunted her. "Go on, do it if you've got the guts!You're nothing but a bitch, Katrina. If you can't bring yourself to do it today, that money is as good as mine!What's the matter? Are you scared? Let me tell you something-within these walls of the Harper estate,you're not the one in charge..."



He was cut off mid-sentence as a sinister gleam flashed before his eyes.



"Ah!" Ronald's scream ripped through the air as a knife plunged.



Blood spattered everywhere.



Then came the piercing scream of Peyton. "You fucking bitch! How dare you assault my son! I swear,I'll fight you to my last breath!"


Soon after,the wail of an ambulance filled the estate,rushing three members of the Harper family to emergency care.


Ronald, the knife still embedded in his cheek, was in the gravest condition, his screams barely audible above the chaos.



Katrina paused at the doorway, her hand tightly clutching the knife, while a piercing cold wind moaned through the night. ①


Beside her, Joyce shuffled forward, her legs barely supporting her trembling frame. Her voice broke through her tears as she murmured, "Mom, you attacked Grandma and both uncles. Are you going to be arrested?"



The knife slipped from Katrina's grasp, clattering against the floor.



She slumped against a stone pillar, her gaze burning with fierce resolve. "No, your father will protect his image at all costs. If word of this spreads, Harper  Group's shares will nosedive. They'll have to keep quiet."



She was determined to prove that she was not a woman to be underestimated.



Meanwhile, in the hospital, Caiden was overwhelmed by despair. Ronald had sustained the gravest wounds;Wyatt was writhing from a back injury, and Peyton,having fallen, had broken her arm.



Their cries of agony echoed through the sterile corridors, each one stabbing at Caiden's conscience.


Haunted by the lifeless look in Katrina's eyes as she brandished the knife, he knew her intent had been lethal. She had truly been prepared to kill.


Ronald's knife was lodged deep in his cheekbone,necessitating its removal, yet no specialist in the area was available in the city.



The doctor suggested, "Mr. Harper, maybe your daughter could help. She's quite worldly and might know someone who could assist."



Daniela, who not only operated a successful design firm but also ventured into the medical field, was well -equipped. Much of the hospital's cutting-edge equipment came from her company.



Her connections and resources dwarfed their own. Caiden, clutching a phone borrowed from the doctor,stepped aside and implored in a hushed, desperate tone, "Please, as a personal favor to me, could you come to the hospital? This is a life-or-death situation.Even if you don't consider us family anymnore,perhaps you could help us as mere strangers in dire need?"



Tears streamed down his face as he spoke.



When Brylee was there, she fortified his world,giving him the freedom to live a blissful life, playing with his pets without a second thought. 3


Following Brylee's passing, he stepped back from the company,thriving on the monumental empire she left behind, enough to carry him through forever.



His days were filled with bliss, enchanted by Katrina's captivating presence.


But now, confronted with this dire crisis, he was begging Daniela for help.
###Chapter 107 The Family He Cherished
 "Daniela, I'm begging you, get here as fast as you can!Things could take a very dark turn if you don't!"Caiden's desperate plea crackled through the phone line.



The attending doctor had rarely encountered such raw vulnerability-a father who seemed shattered, unsure of where to turn.



Once the call ended, Caiden dabbed at his eyes,briefly masking his sorrow before facing the doctor."My daughter will be here shortly."



He then dialed his home number again, seeking some comfort or update.



Silence greeted him-no response.



Annoyed and anxious, he switched tactics and called Joyce.Over the years,he had indulged her every whim,sparing no expense for her happiness.



Now, amidst the turmoil, he expected her to rise to the occasion.



After all, it was Katrina who had entangled themin this  disaster.



Moreover,he needed Joyce to bring a substantial sum of money. In his haste to reach the hospital, he had managed only to bring five hundred dollars.


The phone rang several times before Joyce picked up.


"Joyce, I'm at the hospital. We need fifty thousand dollars. Ronald requires surgery, and Wyatt and Mom need to be hospitalized immediately."



On the other end, Joyce sighed dramatically,her tone laced with exasperation. "Dad, Mom has the safe key,so I can't access the money. I'm not going to that hospital. It's full of sickness and bacteria, and as someone who's pregnant, I'd think my health would be a priority!"


A fresh wave of helplessness swept over Caiden.



After a brief pause, Joyce went on, "Dad, you really should come home too. Mom's incredibly upset.There's little you can help there. It's probably best to employ a nurse-they'll mnanage everything far more effectively than you. Plus, Mom blames the entire ordeal on them, insisting it's none of our concern." Initially, Joyce had felt a twinge of anxiety when the chaos erupted.



However, as the minutes passed without any police involvement, her womy dissipated, giving way toindifference
Caiden felt a deep ache in his chest as he absorbedher dismissive tone
Over the years, he had lavished Joyce with affectionand gifts, often at the expense of Daniela, whoreceived scant attention from him.
Now, in his time of need, Daniela rushed to his aidafter just a simple call Joyce, conversely, offerednothing but weak justifications.
Stop talking like that, Joyce," Caiden retorted sharplyThey're still family, and tuming our backs on them iscruel. Or do you enjoy watching them struggle fortheir lives?"
Sprawled on the couch, an apple in hand. Joyce rolledher eyes and huffed, "That's their dilemma. not mine.If it's help you need, go to Daniela. She's always readyto play the martyr."
Caiden's fingers dug into his phone, his face growingalarmingly pale, as if all the blood had vanished.
Before he could utter another word, Joyce ended thecall abruptly.
A profound sorrow enveloped him This was the family he had cherished for over a decade.



Left with no alternatives, Caiden hastily summoned a taxi to take him home.



Upon his arrival, finding Katrina absent, he reluctantly turned to Joyce to request financial help.


With a touch of reluctance in her voice, Joyce stated,"Fine,but consider this a loan. You're going to have to repay me-with interest. Family or not, money is money."



She then proceeded to transfer ten thousand dollars to him.



As he confirmed the transaction, Caiden inadvertently saw the balance in her account-a startling number of zeros trailing behind.



He had been providing Katrina and Joyce a lavish monthly allowance, which accumulated to over a million dollars a year.



Yet now, at his timne of need, one had vanished, and the other grudgingly handed over merely a fraction of her wealth.



Caiden felt a profound sense of poverty wash over him. On his somber journey back to the hospital, he mused bitterly that depending on Joyce had been a futile hope all along.



Upon his arrival, he found Daniela already waiting.


As the hospital staff delineated the steep expenses involved, Caiden, who had previously never been troubled by financial concerns, shut his eyes in bitter disappointment.



Peyton, overwhelmed by the sum mentioned,dissolved into tears. "We can't pay for the treatment.Just let me go already."



Seeing the distress filling the room, Daniela stepped outside to the doctor and inquired, "Can you tell me exactly what the situation is?"



After piecing everything together, she made a brief phone call. Returning to Caiden, she announced, "A top-notch surgeon will oversee the surgery. He's reviewed the scans and sees no significant concerns.He arrives tonight, will rest tomorrow morning,and is scheduled for the procedure in the afternoon."



Ronald's shoulders dropped as he exhaled deeply, a visible weight lifted by the news.



"Wyatt and Peyton don't have any major problems-they just require proper care," Daniela stated, her voice unwavering. "Unless there's anything else, I'll take my leave now."



As she strode towards the exit, Caiden tagged along behind her, his steps uncertain. "Thank you."



Pausing by her car, Daniela faced him with a stern expression. "The financials are your responsibility.They never showed me consideration, so why should I bear the cost? You'll manage, I'm certain. Besides,this hospital belongs to a friend of mine. I've already discussed it with them. You have five days to arrange the payment."



With those final words, she slid into her car and drove away.



The clock struck 1 a.m., and a gentle rain began to patter against the pavement.


Outside the hospital, Caiden stood rooted to the spot,overwhelmed by a sudden surge of regret. His hands flew to his face as tears escaped, mourning the years lost and the estrangement that had grown between them.



How had it come to this?



How had he allowed the little girl who once called him "Daddy" to become so estranged?



Inside the hospital room, Peyton's eyes burned with  anger as he confronted Caiden. "You're the reason Daniela's done with us! She doesn't give a damn about this family anymore, and it's all thanks to you!"
###Chapter 108 The Empty Safe








Ronald reclined on the bed, his face swollen and contorted in agony.



Wyatt,observing the grim scene, turned to Caiden and spoke with evident frustration. "Did you witness the day's events? Daniela, your own flesh and blood, came despite not wanting to deal with your shit.Yet,one word from you, and she was here. She respects us as family. But Joyce? That ungrateful brat isn't even ours and couldn't give a shit about us. And Katrina? What's there to say? She swung a goddamn knife at us! Who the hell does that? We never imagined she'd actually go through with it, but she did. Look at Ronald and me -sure, we're just your brothers. But think about our mother.Even if she were a stranger, an elderly woman on the street, one simply does not strike someone of her age. That's just common decency!"



He exhaled heavily and continued, "We always thought your ex-wife was too assertive, too formidable. Had she been here, this chaos wouldn't have unfolded like this. And the family finances? Are they even under your control anymore? As the CEO of a publicly traded company, why are we scraping together funds for hospital bills? Do you really think Daniela isn't crushed by all of this? Let's face it-your comfortable life today is built on the foundation of your late wife's diligence. Instead of safeguarding Daniela's future, you're being swayed by another woman's machinations. If I were Daniela, I wouldn't recognize you as my father either."



Peyton then fixed Caiden with a cold, piercing stare."What are your plans to address this? We'll refrain from involving the police for your sake, but we cannot ignore this. If you're planning to let this shit slide, don't you dare call me Mom ever again!"



Peyton had never addressed Caiden in such a harsh tone, and her biting words struck him like a punch to the gut.



Silently, Caiden exited the room and made his way to the hallway, where he succumbed to his emotions,weeping uncontrollably.



The following day was marked by Ronald's surgery.Anxious, Caiden attempted to reach out to Daniela,only to be informed by her secretary that she was tied up in a meeting.



By the time Daniela got back to him, the operation had concluded.



With his voice quivering from relief, Caiden expressed his gratitude. "Daniela, I can't thank you enough! The  surgeon you recommended was exceptional. It all went perfectly! No need to worry about a thing!"



Daniela offered a brief, indifferent "Hmm" before disconnecting.



A bitter taste replaced Caiden's fleeting smnile,as he acknowledged his own role in the unfolding events.



Attempting to spread the positive news,he called home, only to be met with Joyce's harsh, resentful tone. "Oh, the surgery was successful? That's unfortunate. They deserved to fucking rot for what they put Mom through!"



With a chilly edge, Joyce reminded him before hanging up. "And remember, Dad-you still owe me money. I expect it back soon."



Caiden shut his eyes, a single tear trailing down his cheek in silence.



From the corner of the room, Peyton observed him and let out a scornful chuckle.



Throughout the hospital stay of Peyton, Ronald, and Wyatt,neither Katrina nor Joyce paid a visit.



Caiden found himself borrowing money from friends to manage the overwhelming hospital bills.



He no longer sought Daniela's assistance, burdened by a deep sense of shame.



To minimize discord, he arranged for their relocation to a modest apartment in a different neighborhood.



Once they were settled, he ventured back to the villa to collect some personal items.


As Caiden neared the front door, the sound of laughter echoed from within.



The blend of joyful voices with the scent of a meal being prepared struck him harshly-it seemed like a bitter mockery after enduring countless days filled with fatigue, sleepless nights, and the stress of caregiving.



His appearance was disheveled, his beard unkempt from days without proper care. When he entered,Joyce looked at him with a grimace, her expression piercing his already tender spirit.



"What the hell, Dad? You smell so bad I'm about to gag! Did you roll around in a dumpster or what?" she exclaimed.



Caiden's gaze turned to Katrina, who was engrossed in a television show. She didn't bother to look his way;her expression was icy, stripped of the warmth and affection she once radiated towards him.



Without a word,Caiden made his way up the stairs, craving the relief of washing the dirt and weariness from his body.



Refreshed after the shower, he was about to leave the room when he noticed the safe was open. Inside,nothing remained but the stark, empty void of the once-secured container.



Rooted to the spot, Caiden stared into the empty safe
###Chapter 109 Inheritance



With rage boiling over, Caiden charged downstairs, his eyes blazing as he prepared to confront Katrina.



Joyce reclined on the sofa, leisurely biting into a crisp,bright red apple, barely glancing his way. "Dad, you're in the way! Move-I'm watching the best part!"



Without uttering a response, Caiden strode over and turned the television off.



He folded his arms and fixed a piercing stare on her,his tone brooking no defiance."Getupstairs.Rightnow."



Joyce, undeterred by Caiden's authority, knew well that in this household, it was Katrina who held the reins.



Remaining calm and collected, Katrina reassured Joyce. "Head upstairs, sweetheart. Everything's under control."



With a reassuring smile, she watched Joyce ascend the stairs, clutching her doll tightly.



At home, Joyce was doted upon, and recently,her pregnancy was becoming noticeable.


Katrina harbored concerns but kept them to herself. Given the family's wealth, she mused over the possibility of securing a live-in son-in-law. True,Joyce was pregnant,yet it would be her first marriage.Nowadays, with enough money in her pocket,what was there to even stress about?



She decided to let the Bennett family suck up to Daniela all they wanted. That fucking bitch was bound to face her downfall sooner or later.



The vengeful thought curled K<atrina's lips into a wicked,twisted smirk that made Caiden's blood run cold.



He inhaled deeply before confronting her. "Did you take everything from the safe?"



"Yes, I did. What about it?" Katrina's response came with a dismissive shrug, her voice dripping with nonchalance. Relief had washed over her when she'd earlier checked the safe; without that, she wouldn't have unearthed the fact that Brylee had left Daniela a lavish inheritance.



The bounty included a colossal insurance policy and an entire island-a prime tourist hotspot whose value had likely soared.


The terms of the inheritance were strict, stating the island would only legally belong to Daniela after she had been married for a year. Until that milestone, any revenue the island generated was to be strictly held in trust, utterly inaccessible.



Katrina eyed the island with voracious intent.



Securing it for her daughter meant independence from any financial reliance on a partner. She envisioned a future where men would queue up, desperate to cater to Joyce.



"All that shit belongs to Daniela. Even some of the properties-Brylee left them for her, not you. So keep your grubby hands off," Caiden interjected, his voice steady yet assertive.



Without even granting him a glance,Katrina countered,"This house and everything in it belongs to me. Let me make one thing clear-if you dare tell Daniela,I'll divorce you!"



Her tone turned icy, slicing through the air. "You understand the stakes, don't you? Harper Group has been riding on Brylee's coattails for years. Should another scandal erupt, we might as well file for bankruptcy right now!"



Katrina reclined in the sofa, her laughter tinged with derision. "Really, do you believe Brylee would be pleased,knowing you've frittered away everything she painstakingly established? Not leaving even a penny for Daniela? She would despise you. She'd rue the day she fell for a worthless man like you. And Daniela?She'd sever all ties. Isn't that your greatest dread?Being forsaken in your old age, with no one to look after you? Go ahead, keep it up. You'll end up rotting alone with no one to even care when you're gone!"



Her words struck Caiden with surgical precision, each syllable designed to inflict maximum pain. Yet, Katrina was not through.



Her voice took on a syrupy tone, dripping with deceit."However,align yourself with me,follow my lead,and we can keep this family whole. Remember, you are Daniela's biological father. Once she marries, you could travel overseas, apply for her death certificate,and all her assets would naturally revert to you. You'd be set for life, so don't act like you're the one losing out."



Caiden's face registered shock, his features contorting between disbelief and dread. He gaped at Katrina, his voice barely above a whisper. "What the fuck did you just say? Apply for Daniela's death certificae?"



With a wicked grin, Katrina clapped her hands together and chuckled. "Oh, come on! It's just some damn paperwork-it's not like she's really going to drop dead. What's got you trembling? Listen closely,Caiden, I married you seeking a stable life. Maintain that stabilty, and I'll ensure your life remains lavish.Your fortune won't be squandered on my watch." As she spoke, Katrina sent him a coquettish look-a look that once had him utterly ensnared and distractible.



Seeing Katrina's ruthless, greedy nature laid bare,Caiden's stomach churned with disgust. She was the embodiment of everything he despised.



Katrina was already plotting the course of Joyce's life.She envisioned an ideal suitor for Joyce-tall, striking,burdened by neither aging kin nor any familial ties,ideally an orphan, unencumbered and free.



She had pledged a sizable amount of five million dollars for the suitor who satisfied these criteria.



Caiden realized where Katrina's boldness stemmed from-it was the inheritance Brylee had set aside for Daniela.



Yet, something held him back; he couldn't force himself to see Daniela about the matter.



Overwhelmed by shame,he couldn't bear to meet her gaze-not after all the turmoil they had endured.
###Chapter 110 Not A Word To Anyone
Richard had been on edge lately.



He couldn't get his hands on the land in the North District, and Daniela had flat-out refused to meet Alexander.



Moreover, things with Joyce had completely fallen apart,leaving no opportunity for reconciliation.



It seemed as though he was trapped in a losing battle,with no way to turn things around.



He stared at the sketchbook in his hands, his eyes fixed on it. Days had passed, yet he couldn't pinpoint what set it apart from Daniela's.



Meanwhile,Alexander paced restlessly back and forth,his mind visibly preoccupied. His thoughts circled around whether Daniela suspected he was the person from their shared past.



If she did, there was no trace of the warmth she used to show him.



If she didn't, her straightforward nature would have likely prompted her to confront him outright. Her indifferent attitude left him unsure of what she was thinking.



Alexander never thought he'd find himself in a position where he had to guess what was going on in Daniela's mind.



Lost in his musings, Alexander didn't notice Keith stepping in through the doorway.



Keith greeted Richard, but his words went unnoticed.



Taking a seat beside Alexander, Keith leaned in and asked, "Hey, did you hear? Daniela's gone and purchased lands in both the South and East Districts.She'sunstoppable!lsshe building her own empire now?"



Richard's eyes flew open in shock. "What? She's acquired more land?"



"That's right," Keith confirmed, his attention turning to Alexander's phone, where a photo of a note displayed the message, "Let's meet tomorrow."



Something about the handwriting struck him as familiar, so he picked up the phone for a closer look.



Almost immediately, Richard turned to Alexander with urgency. "Alexander, you have to grab this chance!"His voice shook with a mix of excitement and nerves. He hadn't expected Daniela to be so wealthy,let alone imagined another shot at securing the project.



To top it off, the South and East Districts had a larger building area than the North, which meant they promised even bigger profits.



"Alexander, you have to act fast and tell Daniela you want the building rights for those plots. Securing them will skyrocket Bennett Group's financials for the next five years. Don't let Cedric swoop in and snatch them away from you!" Richard's impassioned plea appeared to light a spark in Keith's thoughts.



"Wait,Cedric!" Keith exclaimed with a booming laugh,pointing at Alexander's phone. "That handwriting-it's Cedric's!"



Keith slapped Alexander's thigh enthusiastically."Remember when we visited that celebrity exhibition in the city? There was a whole section about Cedric,showing his rise to fame, and even a childhood notebook where he practiced writing. You pointed out something then-that Cedric had this quirky habit of adding a dot in the bottom right corner of the last letter on every page."



Keith gestured towards the dot in the corner."See?The handwriting matches perfectly, and so does that little dot! It's unmistakable, right?" When Keith looked up, his laughter abruptly faded.Both Richard and Alexander were staring at him with expressions far too serious for the moment.



"What's going on?" Keith asked, his confusion evident as he scratched his head. "Why are you so interested in Cedric's handwriting? What's the big deal?"



The color drained from Richard's face, which had been flushed with excitement just moments ago.



Under the stark glare of the lights, his complexion now resembled a ghostly shade of white.



Keith was just about to crack a joke to ease the tension when Richard suddenly leaned back, collapsing to the floor with a loud thud.



The room instantly descended into chaos. When the paramedics arrived, Alexander didn't hesitate to climb into the ambulance with them.



As the doors shut, he locked eyes with Keith and said in a chillingly firm tone, "This stays between us. Don't say a word to anyone!"
###Chapter 111 Are You Taking Revenge On Me
Richard jolted awake in the hospital bed, his breathing uneven as he clutched Alexander's hand tightly."Alexander, you must not breathe a word about Cedric being that boy. If you do, you can kiss any chance of seeing a penny from Daniela goodbye for the rest of your life."



He glanced at the clock on the wall-it was well past midnight.



Letting out a strained sigh, he continued, "Go home.Put all your energy into winning Daniela over. I'm fine here.All I want is for you to win Daniela back."


Despite Alexander's hesitation, Richard insisted,urging him to leave and focus on the bigger picture.



As he drove aimlessly, Alexander eventually found himself parked at the Elite Lux building.



He stepped out of the car, his gaze instinctively drawn to a specific floor of the towering structure. Without a word, he lit a cigarette, letting the hours slip by as he smoked in silence under the cover of night.



Richard's tireless efforts to win over Daniela were  falling flat, despite all the time, money, and energy he'd poured into the attempt. The lack of progress gnawed at Alexander, leaving him with an uneasy restlessness he couldn't shake.



He remained there until the first light of dawn crept over the city, then finally got back into his car and drove off to check out the plots of land in the South and East Districts.



Richard hadn't been exaggerating-these plots combined were massive, easily over five times the size of the North District. Securing them would come with an astronomical price tag,running into tens of billions.



Alexander couldn't help but admit that Daniela's wealth and influence were nothing short of extraordinary.



As Alexander stared at the vast land before him,his phone suddenly buzzed.



It was his secretary calling. "Mr. Bennett, you're trending online."



Alexander's brow furrowed.′′|Sthis about my father being taken to the hospital yesterday?"



"Actually, no. It's about you standing outside Elite Lux last night. Someone caught it on camera, andit's gone viral this morning. Do you want us to have it removed?" After a brief pause, Alexander replied evenly, "No,leave it. There's no need."


Ending the call, he glanced at his watch. Daniela should be up by now. Had she come across the viral post yet?


Would it stir something in her heart? ①







The first light of morning found Daniela face-to-face with Lillian.



She stood by the door, tablet in hand, peering at Daniela with a curious look.



Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, Daniela greeted her,"Good morning."



"Did you catch the trending topic this morning?"



Daniela stretched out,leisurely taking in the morning air. "No,I haven't."



Between juggling major deals and the recent acquisitions in the South and East Districts, she hadn't had a moment to check her phone.



"You're such a rebel against modern habits! Most people grab their phones the moment they wake up,"Lillian teased.  Daniela chuckled, continuing to stretch her limbs."Anything interesting going on?"



"Yes, there is. The number one trending topic is Alexander standing outside Elite Lux last night,smoking away the entire night!"



Daniela replied nonchalantly, "Is he eyeing the building?We can move out and let him bid for it."



"Daniela! He's interested in you!" Lillian exclaimed,her voice filled with concern.



Even though nearly six months had passed, Lillian couldn't shake her worries about the possibility of Daniela and Alexander reigniting their old flame.



They had shared ten years together.



After all,how many decades did one have in a lifetime?



It was hard for most people to let go of a relationship that had lasted that long, and Lillian wasn't sure if either of them could truly move on.



Daniela gave a relaxed smile, ready to head to the dining room for breakfast, when Lillian suddenly gasped, "Wait, why did they take down the trending topic?"



Lillian looked at Daniela's radiant expression and  mused, "Could someone be interested in you and not like seeing you and Alexander trending? Maybe they had it removed first thing this morning?"



Daniela nibbled on a small piece of bread as her eyes skimmed through her schedule for the day.



Lillian suddenly thought of a certain man from the construction site and felt a pang of sympathy.She had never witnessed such devotion, a person who asked for nothing in return-not even acknowledgment.



She felt it would be harsh to leave Cedric working at the construction site. "We have an inspection today.How about we visit the land in the North District?"



Daniela gave a slight nod.



Ryan, standing just a few feet away, winked desperately at Lillian, but she pretended not to notice.



After Daniela went downstairs to get to work,Ryan turned to Lillian, frowning. "What's going on? Cedric asked us not to tell Daniela he's personally managing the project, so we don't add any pressure on her."



Lillian crossed her arms, clearly frustrated with the two clueless men. "Do you want Daniela to end up with Cedric or not?"



Ryan nodded eagerly. "Of course, I do!" Lillian pressed on, "One of them has to step up,make their feelings clear, and show they're present. Look at Alexander, he's at Elite Lux every day. Meanwhile,Cedric's out there getting dirty at the construction site.By the time he returns in a year, Daniela and Alexander might have kids."



Ryan was visibly shocked by the thought.



Josie appeared from the kitchen, spatula in hand,clearly agreeing with the conversation. "Exactly! What kind of guy chases a woman while vanishing for a whole month to work at a construction site? It'sjust ridiculous!"








When Daniela made her way downstairs, Alexander was already there, waiting in her office.



He stood and greeted her with a smile. "Good morning."



Daniela nodded back, sat down, and began working on her computer without a word.



Alexander had hoped she would be a bit warmer today,but instead, she remained as indifferent as ever,maybe even a bit colder.



"Did you see the trending topic this morning?"Alexander asked, trying to make conversation. Daniela kept her eyes on her screen, not responding to him.



The silence in the office began to gnaw at Alexander,his irritation building with each passing second.



Daniela's consistent disinterest and dismissive attitude towards him had left him feeling invisible, sidelined in his own efforts.



Now, he truly understood how she must have felt when he had ignored and neglected her all those times.



"Is this your way of getting back at me?" Alexander asked,staring at her.


At that moment, the secretary knocked before entering. "Ms. Harper, the car is downstairs, and the surveyors for the lands in the South and North n Districts are ready. Should we head out?"


t=Daniela replied, "Yes, I'm almost ready. Tell the driver y to bring the car to the main entrance."



As Daniela powered down her computer, it seemed rielike she finally noticed Alexander in the room. "Do you ahsneed something?"



Alexander was about to suggest joining her to inspect the land when Daniela quickly cut him off. "If it's not  urgent, maybe you should head back to your own company. I've been swamped lately, and if you don't have anything important to discuss, it's better you don't drop by. We both run companies, and some things need to stay confidential. As another business owner, I'm sure you understand that, right?"
###Chapter 112 Elite Lux Was Just The Least Of Daniel...
Daniela wasn't moved at all, and she even reprimanded Alexander. This sparked a flare of irritation within him.



He considered himself a sought-after man, not one to be dismissed lightly.


Daniela's demeanor, suggesting he was somehow desperate for her attention, was intolerable to him.



Yet, when she drove away from the parking lot, he couldn't help but trail behind her.



With Daniela at the helm of a billion-dollar project,he knew staying close was his only option-if he didn't,someone else surely would.



This realization was a blow to his ego. Alexander had never felt so diminished.



At the construction site, Daniela dove into her tasks with unwavering dedication. Alexander, donning a safety helmet, remained by her side throughout the day.



What caught him off guard was her expertise-she  wasn't only giving orders but knew the intricacies of architecture, engineering, and market trends by heart.



In several respects, her expertise eclipsed his own,despite his ten years in the industry.



This revelation cast Daniela in an entirely different light.



He observed her,her delicate features accentuated by the helmet, exuding a sharp concentration. She even seemed to grasp the surveyor's techniques intuitively.



During the lunch break, Alexander walked over to her with a meal he had brought along.



But Daniela, leaning into the brisk wind, was engrossed in a phone conversation.



Alexander's ears perked as he overheard snippets of her phone conversation. "Dreamscape Research Institute must quicken its steps. Our heart restoration technology already leads the world, but I need sharper,more intricate data. Let's hold off on notifying marketing-more thorough evaluations are essential before we push forward with experimental surgical initiatives."



She delivered each word with a resolute and commanding air.



On the other end of the line, someone responded  submissively, "Understood."



Alexander stood motionless, his lunchbox dangling in his grasp, as a surge of realization overwhelmed him.



Dreamscape was the titan of tech-medical research,a behemoth reigning over the medical sector for decades, boasting over 50, 000 medical patents globally.



The implication was clear-Dreamscape's workforce casually generated billions annually through their patents alone.



The researchers at Dreamscape were an elusive league,comprising the world's top ten intellects. They shunned the public eye, yet their rare appearances heralded monumental advancements.



The Bennett family had once ventured into the medical sector, but it proved too intricate and profound for them; their attempts amounted to nothing more than modest endeavors.



Lately, whispers had circulated throughout the global medical circles that Dreamscape had pioneered a groundbreaking technology for repairing heart damage. This innovation promised a definitive remedy for cardiac ailments, potentially eradicating congenital heart defects in patients.



Their claim was almost unbelievable-a single pill  could restore heart function and breathe life into those who thought all hope was lost.



News of the pill spread like wildfire, leaving the entire planet buzzing with anticipation.



Questions swirled like a storm. Who were the unseen geniuses driving this monumental force? What marvels were unfolding within their brilliant minds?



Stunned into silence, Alexander couldn't tear his gaze away from Daniela's graceful frame.



It dawned on him that the very person he had been searching for had been right before his eyes the entire time.



The thought made him sick-he had actuallychoose Joyce over Daniela, like a fool chasing scraps.



It was as if Alexander's chest had been ripped open,his heart left bleeding.



Daniela pivoted, her eyes narrowing on Alexander,who stood there, his face ashen and beads of sweat forming despite the sweltering heat.



"What are you doing here?" she inquired,her voice tinged with suspicion.



Alexander's response lingered in the air, his eyes distant and unfocused. Suddenly,he erupted into a fit of laughter-loud and wild,bordering on the edge of madness.



With an intense glare, she demanded, "What's so funny?"



His laughter erupted even louder, tears now cascading freely down his flushed face.



Lillian stepped in, positioning herself between them."He's completely lost his mind, Daniela. Avoid him at all costs-it's for your safety!"



Undeterred,Daniela sidestepped him, returning to her tasks with a dismissive shake of her head.



Alexander's laughter was still ringing through the air when his phone vibrated. It was a call from Richard.



Initially, Richard was puzzled by Alexander's unrestrained laughter, but he quickly grasped the situation.



"Has Daniela finally agreed to relinquish the construction rights?" he probed,his voice laced with impatience. 



"No, Dad," Alexander responded, a hint of sardonic humor coloring his tone. "Daniela's expertise is such that she can manage those projects with her eyes closed." Richard's response was a dismissive scoff. "Bullshit! A partnership with us is a no-brainer. Why the fuck would she refuse?"



The laughter that escaped Alexander then was tinged with cynicism.



′′Apartnership? That's the most absurd thing l've heard all year! Dad, do you truly understand who Daniela is?" he queried.



Richard's irritation was palpable as he retorted sharply,"What about her? She's just Daniela. So what if she's the CEO of Elite Lux? Has Elite Lux become so prosperous that it's now invincible?"



In that moment, Alexander's laughter came to an abrupt halt.



Straightening his posture, he fixed his eyes on Daniela.The evening gloom cast her into a silhouette, barely discernible in the darkening horizon.



Turning back his attention to Richard, he said into the phone, "Daniela has been immensely wealthy-far wealthier than we've realized. She isn't just the CEO of Elite Lux; she's also the one running Dreamscape."



Compared to Dreamscape, what significance did Elite Lux really hold? Perhaps to Daniela, Elite Lux was merely a minor outpost in her vast business dominion.
###Chapter 113 We're Not Fools Here

Richard stood frozen for a moment, his mind reeling.



Then, a spark of realization flashed in his eyes.Dreamscape launching its new heart medication?" he asked,his voice bubbling with excitement.



"Yes," Alexander answered in a flat tone.



Richard's face brightened, his voice nearly trembling with joy. "This is it! Dreamscape and Bennett Group should team up! What a golden opportunity!"



Alexander was drained of energy, while Richard practically burned with fervor.



"And Daniela marrying into our family-isn't that the best thing ever?" Richard continued, his excitement almost contagious.



Alexander had never heard him so animated before.



"Daniela's brilliant at making money, you know! And who knows, she might even have hidden identities. Do you realize how lucky you are? She's cut ties with her family. It means she has no backing now, no one to protect her. Everything she owns could be yours. Wait, no, ours! Go speak to her about the medical deal,"Richard urged.



Standing in the biting wind, Alexander remained unnervingly composed.



As Richard's enthusiasm grew, Alexander allowed a faint smile to tug at his lips, but his eyes spoke of nothing but irony. "Dad, think for a second. If you were Daniela, would you even consider working with the Bennett family?" Do you know why I laughed just now? Do you remember what you said about Daniela when she was after me? You said Daniela was just some unwanted daughter her family didn't care about and was shamelessly clinging to me because she was after our wealth and power. You said with her poor background, marrying her would ruin the Bennett family. And what use was a woman like that if she was not obedient and submissive? And at our wedding,you openly pointed at Daniela and accused her of marrying me for my money."



He could still picture Daniela's unshaken calmness that day.



She smiled slightly, her eyes showing quiet strength.Behind her, a sea of whispering guests pointed fingers and threw accusations. Through it all,she remained by his side, her resolve unwavering.



Alexander laughed bitterly at himself. He had been  given a rare treasure but hadn't recognized its value.



He was, without question, the most foolish man to ever walk the earth.



Daniela had no time to waste on fools.



She didn't bother with people who weren't on her level. Occasionally, out of boredom, she might entertain their nonsense, but she didn't wNaste much energy on it.



After finishing her work, she moved on to inspect another property.



Later, she stopped by a barbecue restaurant and rented out the entire place.



She placed an order for hundreds of skewers and had them delivered to the construction site in the North District.



Lillian, holding a megaphone, shouted, "Cedric has ordered barbecue for us! Everyone, take a break!"  



Cedric spun around in surprise and found Daniela standing behind him, her smile warm and genuine.



"What are you doing here?" Cedric asked, his brow furrowing. "It's cold and windy, you'll catch a cold."



Daniela,dressed in Elite Lux haute couture, looked like she had stepped out of a luxury advertisement. Yet there she was, casually sitting on the sidewalk as if it were the most natural thing to do.



She offered Cedric a skewer with a teasing smile."Care to do me the honor of trying one?"



Cedric couldn't help but smile. Shaking his head, he grabbed a clean piece of cardboard and slid it under Daniela for her to sit on before sitting down next to her.



It was already past 11 p.m.



The dim lights from the distant construction site cast long shadows. The two sat there together, watching as the towering structure slowly took shape in front of them.



"What do you think?" Cedric asked with a grin,mimicking Daniela's earlier tone. "Any suggestions?"



Daniela shook her head, nibbling on a piece of corn."None."



It was the plain truth.



Cedric was dependable and thorough-someone who could be relied upon to get things done without a hitch.



She had no feedback or advice to give. In that moment, Daniela wasn't focused on work or plans. She just wanted to sit on the cool concrete in front of what would soon be her empire, enjoying barbecue and beer with Cedric.



When Alexander showed up, he found Daniela and Cedric clinking beer bottles, casually seated on the sidewalk,completely carefree.



Alexander frowned deeply as he walked over. He looked at Cedric and said, "She's being reckless,but you should know better. Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux. If someone catches a picture of this, it'll cause a storm of rumors. You need to think about your own reputation and stop encouraging her careless behavior."



Alexander believed his words were perfectly reasonable. However, to his surprise, Daniela's face turned to a cold frown.



The friendly, relaxed vibe she'd had with Cedric disappeared in an instant, replaced by clear frustration that was impossible to hide.



"Mr. Bennett, do you know where you're standing?"Daniela's voice was icy, and she didn't even glance his way. Her eyes stayed locked on the muddy construction site in the distance. "This is my domain.You don't get to come here and act like you're in charge." Alexander quickly tried to explain, "I'm doing this because I care about you."



But Daniela got to her feet and wiped her hands clean.She looked at Cedric and said, "I've seen enough.The progress looks good. I'll send someone else to take charge from here. You don't need to stay. Focus on your company."



Only then did she face Alexander. "Care about me,huh? I've outgrown that kind of talk. Consider this your first and final warning. Never say that to me again.We're not fools here."



With that said, she turned and started walking away.



After a short while, she stopped and looked back at Cedric,her face relaxing into a smile. "Do you need a ride back?"



Cedric laughed and nodded. "I'd really appreciate it
###Chapter 114 Make Katrina Hate Daniela
Anxiety gripped Alexander immediately!



Just as he was about to follow Daniela, his phone erupted with the shrill ring of an incoming call.


It was Katrina on the line. He pressed the decline button, but she was persistent, calling again.



He declined once more, only for her to send a message.



"Please,Alexander,justpickup already-it'simportant!"



Typically, Katrina's urgencies revolved around Joyce.



Anything less seemed to barely stir her.



His phone rang yet again, and this time, Alexander couldn't ignore it.



He answered, barely getting a word out before Katrina's anxious voice spilled through. "Alexander, I'm terribly sorry to call so late, but I'm really at my wit's end. I need your help."



"What's going on?" Katrina's response was a flood of tears, her voice cracking with emotion. "Alexander, Joyce had a prenatal check-up today, and the doctor fears there might be complications with the baby's heart. They said it might need immediate surgery after birth to survive!"



Her voice broke as she continued, the sobs shaking her, "Alexander, it's my curse to be stuck with someone as cold and soulless as Caiden. All I have left in this world is Joyce, my sweet daughter. If she's taken from me, I don't think I'd have the strength to keep living this wretched life!"



Alexander was hardly in the mood to entertain Katrina's theatrics. He went straight to the point,his voice cutting through the tension. "Just tell me what you want from me!"



Katrina paused, her tears momentarily forgotten as she considered her plea.



What she truly desired was for Alexander to intervene in Joyce's predicament. The blame, in her eyes, lay squarely with Daniela. If not for her, Joyce would have been Alexander's wife by now,uniting their families and sparing her this torment.



Fueled by a resolute desire to see Daniela held responsible, Katrina implored, "Alexander,your group operates a healthcare company, doesn't it? Could you  possibly find out if there's a top specialist capable of performing such a surgery? Or maybe there's a way to treat the baby without surgery. It's heartbreaking to think of the baby facing a lifetime of medication after surgery."



Alexander fell silent, absorbing her words.



Thoughts of Daniela flickered through his mind, along with Dreamscape's cutting-edge medical solutions.



Typically, such innovations would need official approval, clinical trials, and extensive marketing-a process spanning at least a year.



But time was a luxury the child did not have.



A sliver of hope emerged as he considered whether Daniela might be persuaded to grant an exception for Joyce.



When Alexander confided in Richard, his response was fierce and immediate. "Stay out of it, Alexander! This mess isn't worth ruining yourself over! Daniela has completely severed ties with the Harper family. What business is it of yours to interfere? Think about it-if they mend fences and Daniela ends up backed by the Harpers, given our past run-ins with Katrina, do you seriously believe she'd make peace with us? And what about Joyce? How will you face her?"



The more Richard pondered the situation,the more  his disapproval grew.



"Just let Daniela and the Harpers go their separate ways! Offering help is generous, but choosing not to is your decision. Nobody can fault you for that.Listen carefully, Alexander, don't even think about getting involved in that mess! You don't need to sort this out.Leave it to me," Richard insisted, his voice laden with concern that Alexander might be too compassionate for his own good.



Daniela was a treasure too valuable to let slip into anyone else's hands.



With a firm resolve, Richard muttered, "I'll call Katrina myself. Why the hell are you always dragged into their mess? You're not even family! They're just using you like a damn tool!"



With those words, Richard seized the phone and quickly exited the room.



"Katrina, I regret to inform you that our medical division lacks the necessary technology and expertise.However, I've done some research on your behalf.Lipool Hospital is renowned for its proficient techniques-you might want to consider consulting with them. It's critical to address these matters promptly, especially if surgery is on the table."



He paused, a hint of caution in his voice. "Furthermore,  I must mention, Harper Group's performance hasn't been doing so well lately. Should the public learn of your child's health issues, it could negatively impact your stock prices. I'd advise you to secure a competent surgeon soon. The advancements in medical technology these days generally assure successful outcomes. Please, try not to worry excessively."



Katrina found her usual poised demeanor slipping away, caught in a whirlwind of emotions.



She wholeheartedly believed in Richard's sincerity and quickly expressed her gratitude before reaching out to the recommended doctor.



Unbeknownst to her, Alexander was aware that the doctor in question was hardly a specialist in cardiac matters and had a checkered past with several medical controversies.



Richard's maneuvers were strategically aimed to eventually reveal Daniela's role as the CEO of Dreamscape, leading Katrina to suspect Daniela had knowingly remained passive.



He was determined to make Katrina hate Daniela to the core.



Such a scheme was devilishly clever.



Truly, it was a stroke of genius.
###Chapter 115 Her Former Gentleness Was Gone
Katrina dialed the doctor's number,her movements tinged with urgency.



Joyce slumped into the sofa, her tears flowing unchecked.



Across from her, Caiden occupied a chair, absorbing the scene: Katrina issuing firm commands to the doctor and Joyce's despairing cries piercing the quiet.



Mixed emotions churned within Caiden as he witnessed the unfolding drama,his mind wrestling with indecision.



Finally,unable to remain passive, he addressed Joyce."This illness is no small matter, Joyce. Perhaps you should consider consulting multiple hospitals, seeking various opinions. Weren't you once a director at Daniela's company? Despite everything, you're still on their roster. Maybe Daniela could recommend some specialists. She's well-connected, far more than we are now."



Joyce turned, her face twisted in a grimace. "Dad,please, not this. My friends have already mocked me enough. Do you think Daniela would really help? She  assigned me to supervise the restrooms. It's degrading,sitting there all day. It's clear she's just trying to retaliate. How could she possibly lend a hand after that?"



As Katrina ended the call, she caught the tail end of the conversation and entered the room, her eyes narrowing in displeasure. "What did you just say?Daniela put you in charge of the restrooms?"



"Yes," Joyce replied, dabbing at her eyes, "Mom,what's Dad thinking? Daniela is using her position to demean me, and he suggests I go groveling back to her? It seems like he'd rather enjoy seeing me humiliated!"



After her outburst, Joyce turned sharply and concealed her tear-streaked face within the soft folds of the pillow, her sobs wrenching painfully at Katrina's heartstrings.



Katrina shot Caiden a fiery look, her voice thick with resolve. "Caiden! Daniela torments Joyce relentlessly,and I refuse to stand idly by! Once I've wrapped up my current affairs, I'm going to make her answer for it."



Her features were set in a fierce mask of determination. Her eyes blazed, and her hands were balled into tight fists as though she were ready to take on the world. Caiden, despite his well-meaning advice, found himself the target of her ire.



He exhaled deeply, a hint of resignation in his tone "Alright, confront Daniela if you must. But in your current state, you're unlikely to even gain entry to Elite Lux. Katrina, I'm seriously suggesting you seek assistance from Daniela. You've never held a high-ranking position-you don't realize how those at the top can resolve matters with a mere word, far more efficiently than one can from the bottom."



Katrina scoffed at his suggestion, her disdain palpable."Caiden! Now you're trying to boast? Really? And tell me, when have you ever held a high position? Oh,that's right-through Brylee! Riding on a woman's coattails, and now you parade around as if you're some paragon of virtue? What exactly are you proud of? Any man of honor wouldn't brag about exploiting a woman's success. You're not just unashamed-you're actually proud? How utterly disgraceful!"



Caiden was utterly speechless following her rebuke.He gazed at Katrina, his eyes wide as he observed her once tender expression now contorted in anger. For a brief moment, he was uutterly dumbfounded.



His voice quavered as he looked into her eyes, the hurt evident in his tone. "How can you accuse me of such things? To say I leeched off a woman? Katrina!  Weren't you the one who, while I was drunk,lavished me with praises about my talent, admired my demeanor, complimented my handwriting, and celebrated my artistic sensibilities? You told me I was pure, untouched by the taint of money. I've clung to every word you said for years. And didn't you confide in me about the hardships you faced, how your husband mistreated you, and how you yearned to run away with me? When Brylee departed and your ex-husband passed away, I was the one who eagerly proposed, dismissing the rumors that whispered we were together before our marriage was official.For your sake, I've endured endless criticism over the years, and Daniela has shed silent tears in her room time and again because of it. But none of that mattered to me because I loved you. I wanted nothing more than to be with you. I was genuine in my feelings. And now, you say I'm just leeching off a woman?"



Tears welled up in Caiden's eyes as he sat there, each word weighed down by sorrow.



He stared intently at Katrina, his gaze searching her face for a sign of the love they once shared. "Is this truly how you've always seen me?" he asked,hoping against hope for her to refute his fears.



Yet, Katrina just stood there,her expression chillingly indifferent. Then, her lips curled into a cruel sneer as a mocking laugh escaped her. "Caiden, we're adults;  we need to own our choices."



Caiden's eyes widened in utter disbelief.



Katrina pressed on, her voice sharp with accusation."Remember Brylee? She wNas loyal to you. And you?You betrayed her and ignored your own child. You mentioned Daniela crying in secret, but do you knoW the real story? That day, when you dragged me into your home and we made love on the couch, Daniela saw us! Ever wonder why she started sleepwalking?consulted a doctor, and she was suffering from severe depression. Can you even grasp how many nights she wept silently when you thought she was just being stubborn?"



Katrina gestured to a spot near her eye. "Right here,Daniela got this huge scar during that time. It's less noticeable now, but do you think if she hated you back then?"



Caiden's entire body shook with the force of his emotions. Gazing at Katrina, he no longer recognized the tender-hearted woman he once thought he knew.In her place stood a monster-a complete monster!
###Chapter 116 Keep Loving Me
Katrina didn't even look at Caiden, who was shaking all over, unable to stop himself.



She simply grabbed her phone and walked outside to answer another call.



Caiden stayed where he was, his body tense and still,not able to move a single inch.



Even Joyce felt uneasy by Katrina's outburst. She wasn't sure how to react.



The tension in the air was thick and uncomfortable.



Wanting to avoid getting caught up in it, she hugged her doll close and quickly headed upstairs, getting away from the mess.



Caiden sat still, his eyes glued to the floor as he watched Joyce's bunny slippers disappear up the stairs.A few moments later, the loud sound of her bedroom door locking echoed throughout the house.



He blinked, his eyes slowly opening again, and then started laughing-a sad,empty laugh that kept getting louder. shut the balcony door, and didn't say anything to stop the noise.



But Caiden wasn't just laughing. He was crying, too.Tears ran down his face, mixing with his sad, desperate laughs.



He could picture it so clearly-the future he was headed towards, growing old and being left behind.



Katrina wouldn't look after him, and Joyce wouldn't think twice about leaving him. He'd end up like his father, dying alone and forgotten, filthy and surrounded by bugs.








Ever since Alexander discovered that Cedric was the boy from Daniela's childhood-the one who held a special place in her most cherished memories-he couldn't shake his unease.



Daniela held those memories close to her heart. If she found out that Cedric was the same boy, would all the love she had for him back then turn to Cedric?



Would she end up falling for Cedric?



Would they even get married?



Cedric seemed to care for Daniela in a way Alexander never did. If he had shown her even half of the  kindness Cedric did, maybe they would never have gotten divorced.



The more Alexander thought about it, the tighter the knot of anxiety grew inside him.



Pushing everything else out ofhis mind, he went to Daniela's office, unable to focus on anything else.



When he got there, Daniela was fully focused on carving a piece of jade.



What had begun as a rough, uneven block had already become a finely detailed sculpture of a man-someone who looked a bit like Cedric.



As soon as Alexander saw the jade sculpture, the tension in his mind broke. "Daniela, are you in love with Cedric now?"



Daniela hadn't expected him to show up, but she didn't even glance up. Her hands continued their careful work, her focus never wavering. "Stay in your lane. We're divorced," she replied coolly.



"Yes, we are. But you're the one who insisted on it!"



Daniela completed the last details of the carving,blowing off the dust before placing it down and finally locking eyes with him.



"You've come all the way here, late at night,into my  office, just to talk about this? Is it really that important?"



Alexander, unusually resolute, persisted, "Yes, this matters to me! Back then, I agreed to the divorce because you asked for it. But I never truly wanted it,Daniela!"



Daniela appeared to find it laughable. Her eyes gleamed with sarcasm as she met his gaze."Alexander, do you even realize what you're saying?It's like a man telling a woman after they've been together, 'You went along with it the whole time,so l don't need to take any responsibility.' It's absurd."


But Alexander stood firm. He locked eyes with her and pressed, "I'm asking you plainly-do you have feelings for Cedric? Stop dodging the question."



Daniela turned her focus back to the jade as she replied, "Even if I do, why would that shock you?Cedric was already the wealthiest man in the country long before Elite Lux came back. He's good-looking,taller than you, has a calm nature, and knows his way around the kitchen. Sure, I've made my share of mistakes, like spending time on someone who didn't appreciate me. But I've learned. Now, I only care about people who treat me right."



Her tone was direct, with no hint of apology. "Cedric treats me right and is exceptional in every way. He's  a solid choice. Don't you agree? Or should I go back to wasting my time with someone like you? I'd much rather put my effort into making more money. With enough money. I could live like you men-keeping things flexible, always enjoying life to the fullest.I could even hire a good-looking secretary to make my office more interesting."



A playful smirk appeared on her face as she continued,"You're here asking if I like Cedric? What's going on?Don't tell me after all this time, you've had a change of heart and now want me to fall for you all over again?"



The weight of guilt hit Alexander as Daniela's sharp gaze locked onto him.



After what felt like an eternity of silence,he finally spoke. "Yes, Daniela, that's why I'm here. I'm begging you not to fall for Cedric. You can still love me, and I swear-I'll treat you the way you deserve this time."
###Chapter 117 Are You Looking For Trouble

Daniela barely stopped herself from gagging at Alexander's words.



She forced down the sick feeling rising in her and gave Alexander a sharp, skeptical look.



Back when she had been obsessed with him,she could hardly take her eyes off him. But now, with no feelings left, her patience had completely run out.



Leaning her head on her hand, she couldn't help but find the situation amusing



She had put in so much effort before, bending over backwards, breaking her own boundaries,just to make Alexander love her. Yet, he wouldn't even spare her a second glance.



But now, without her lifting a finger, he suddenly wanted to be kind to her, all because he feared she might be interested in Cedric.



What a complete joke this was!



She wondered if Alexander thought she was an easy target, which was why he kept coming to belittle her. If that was the case, she saw no reason to hold back.



You want to be kind to me?" Daniela replied,continuing to carve the jade in her hand. "Well, go ahead and try. It's hard to say if I could ever feel anything for you again, but just remember, your choices are yours to make. You're an adult,right?"



In Daniela's eyes, anyone who asked for a promise before offering something in return was just playing games-and those who played games weren't worth her time or forgiveness.



Alexander's brow furrowed at her words, a frown tugging at his lips.



This wasn't how he'd pictured it. He had assumed she would agree without hesitation, and they could start building a future together. Instead, she brushed him off as if he meant nothing.



"What?" Daniela raised her eyes to meet his. "You're not willing? Is it that hard for you?"



"Then set me a deadline," Alexander said,his voice low.



Daniela let out a laugh. "Do you really need a deadline to be nice to someone? Is being good to others just another task for you? Or a project?"



"No, that's not what I meant..." 
Daniela stood up, carefully organizing her carving tools and picking up the finished jade from the table.She looked at Alexander for a moment, her expression neutral. "I'm heading upstairs to rest now. If there's nothing else you need, then goodnight."


With that, she turned and walked towards the elevator.She stepped inside and left, leaving Alexander standing there, stunned.



He was usually so quick with his words, but in that moment, he found himself completely at a loss for words.








Alexander couldn't sleep a wink after getting home,tossing and turning in bed, restless all night.


By 6 a.m., he was already up and ordered the housekeeper to prepare a variety of breakfasts for Daniela.



When Richard came downstairs and saw what was happening,he couldn't hide his satisfaction.



By the time Daniela came downstairs in the morning,Cedric was already sitting in the living room.



Lillian walked in and asked Cedric teasingly, "Is the breakfast at your company really that bad? You're  here every day now."



Daniela let out a small laugh as she handed Cedric the hand-carved jade she'd made the day before.



They had recently acquired a new source of jade and had found some really great pieces, one of which stood out as particularly beautiful.


Cedric had been eager to get a hand-carved jade piece,so Daniela had decided to carve one for him.



Cedric took a quick look, not bothered by any imperfections, and happily tucked it into his pocket.


When Alexander arrived with breakfast, Daniela and the others had already finished eating. Lillian was being her usual lively self, laughing loudly at something.



However, the moment she saw Alexander, her laughter abruptly stopped.



As they got closer, Lillian nudged the bag Alexander was carrying. "What's this? Trying to embarrass yourself by bringing this here?"



Alexander opened his mouth to reply, but Lillian cut him off. "If this is your way of trying to get back in, it's a little sad. We just had pancakes made by Cedric.Your breakfast looks like something the housekeeper picked up at the store." Daniela offered a polite smile before heading towards her office.



Alexander hurried after her. "Daniela, what do you want to eat? I'll bring it tomorrow."



Lillian frowned, frustrated at the thought of Daniela's past feelings going to waste. She shoved Alexander into the elevator, pointing a finger at him."Are you trying to stir things up?"



Alexander was about to deny it but then paused.



He had known Daniela for years, yet he couldn't even figure out what she liked to eat. If that wasn't asking for trouble, he didn't know what was.



But the truth was, he had no idea.



In the end, all of Daniela's efforts over the years had turned into nothing more than a joke.
###Chapter 118 Your Ex-wife Now Is So Powerful
Alexander left Harper Group early in the morning,feeling frustrated after his visit didn't go as planned.



By afternoon, Elite Lux had kicked off the bidding for construction project in the South and East Districts.



Keith showed up soon after, looking around the room for Alexander. When he spotted him in the front row,he quickly made his way over.



"I need your help!" Keith said urgently, sitting next to Alexander with a bidding proposal full of dense text.Alexander, you're close to Daniela. Do you have any inside info on this bidding?"



As soon as he finished, the rest of the bidding team subtly shifted closer to Alexander.



In the eyes of everyone, despite Daniela now being the CEO of Elite Lux, she remained the figure who once trailed Alexander like a devoted follower.



That image of Daniela as the ever-loyal follower was still deeply etched in their minds.


Alexander didn't have any insider knowledge at all. But seeing how intently everyone was listening,he felt embarrassed to admit he had nothing to share.



He closed his lips tight and glanced at Keith. "Why?Planning to go home and take over the family business?"



"Don't even talk about it. Last month, I crashed a Maserati, my band went bankrupt, and my gaming project lost more than thirty million. My dad said if l keep blowing money,he'll cut me off!"



Recently, in Olisvine, wealthy families had been cutting ties with their children.



People believed Daniela's success came from Caiden firmly pushing her to step up and face the world,which had led her to where she was now.



The month had barely started, and already two families had severed ties with their children.



Keith was beyond frustrated. "What is Daniela doing?Isn't it our job to be the spoiled,aimless rich kids? Now I'm being forced into this bidding project, and if l don't win it, I'm finished."



Keith gave Alexander a playful nudge. "Come on, you have to help me out! Tell me, is there any inside scoop?" Alexander lowered his gaze, his expression becoming thoughtful.



Keith let out a deep sigh. "Don't tell me the project has already been handed to you? With your connection to Daniela, it makes sense that she'd give it to you. Alexander, be honest with me. If she's already given it to you, I won't waste my time."



Alexander crossed his legs and sat back with a calm grace. "Don't say that."



His words sent a chill through the room. They hinted that the project had already been decided.



Even though everyone had prepared themselves for this outcome, hearing Alexander's confirmation still caused a collective sigh. It was a bitter pill to swallow.



This was an opportunity so profitable that it could easily support multiple companies.



Keith blinked in disbelief and whispered, "Look, this is a goldmine. I'm not asking for much, just a small share,alright?"



A voice from behind them chimed in eagerly, "Hey,what about me? Mr. Bennett, I'll offer you a deal below market value," and gestured a number with excitement. Keith's eyes widened in shock. "Are you insane? If you offer below market value, there's no way you'll make a profit."



"Are you serious? Profit? This deal's a complete loss,"the person responded with a grin, as though it was all part of the plan.



Keith stared at the person's smiling face, clearly stunned. "That smile doesn't look like someone who's losing money-it looks like you just made ten mnillion!"



"I don't think you quite getit. Our families don't have competing products. Let me explain the details."



Keith nodded eagerly. "Go ahead, I'm listening."



Alexander could feel the eyes of the room on him once more.



"As you know, Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux. She bought the landmark building without breaking a sweat. Her financial clout is truly impressive, wouldn't you say?"



Keith gave a quick nod."Of course."



Alexander straightened in his seat, a touch of pride emanating from him.



"Cedric's decision to take over the North District  construction reflects his sharp vision. When the bid came out, he didn't earn a dime. Do you know why?"



"Why?" Keith asked, intrigued.



"It's about cultivating a solid relationship with Daniela and Elite Lux. If the project hadn't been so time-sensitive, would there even have been a bidding process? Daniela could have simply handed it to Cedric, and we wouldn't stand a chance.



"Landing the project contract is like securing a ticket to future partnerships with Elite Lux. It's about establishing a solid reputation with Daniela. Her influence is irrefutable, and Olisvine practically belongs to her. Construction projects won't be in short supply. In our field, it's well-known that it's smarter to work with trusted allies. Once you're on Daniela's radar, how could you ever fear financial struggles? Didn't your father teach you these fundamentals?"



Keith was taken aback by what he had just heard.He turned to Alexander, his voice filled with awe."Alexander,is your ex-wife really this powerful now?"



Alexander crossed his arms, his tone calm. "It seems so."



Keith couldn't hide the envy creeping into his voice.



Had he known then, he would've made a move on  Daniela.



Marrying her would have meant becoming the master of Olisvine.



Regret gnawed at Keith for not acting sooner.



A man behind them handed Alexander a business card with respect, saying, "Mr. Bennett, I've heard a great deal about you. Let's get to know each other."



Soon, business cards were passed to him one after another.



Alexander couldn't help but feel as if both Daniela and her projects were now in his grasp.



A growing sense of satisfaction washed over him.



Meanwhile, another man handed Alexander a valuable antique, and Keith noticed the man subtly signal a number to him.



Eight million dollars.
###Chapter 119The Confidential Budget Report
While Alexander was basking in the attention as people eagerly handed him their business cards,Cedric quietly slipped into a seat in the very last row,keeping a low profile.



Lillian, ever observant, caught sight of him and waved,signaling for him to come forward to the front row.



Realizing there were no open seats available,she quickly arranged a place for him among the staff.



The subtle gesture sparked envy among the men in the room.



Keith leaned towards Alexander and quipped,"See?That's what having the right connections gets you."



Alexander's smug demeanor instantly darkened at those words, and he snapped sharply, "It's just a way to show off."



Keith chuckled and teased, "Feeling any regrets about divorcing Daniela now? Cedric looks like someone you should keep an eye on!"



Alexander scoffed dismnissively. "That guy?" Cedric and Daniela had known each other for ages.If there was ever anything between them, it would've happened by now.



But beneath his confident words, a flicker of unease crept in. Alexander couldn't shake the worry that Daniela might find out Cedric was the boy from her past. He knew this secret needed to stay buried-no one could ever find out.



Noticing Alexander's unease, Keith smirked. "Relax,I won't spil anything. But you owe me one. When you seal the deal, throw me a bone,okay?"



Keith's family specialized in hardware and interior design, after all.



Alexander nodded. "Fine. Once I secure the project,the interior design is all yours."



Keith's face lit up with excitement.



Alexander leaned closer, his voice sharp. "And remember-keep that secret buried."



Keith nodded with a satisfied smile, feeling confident and victorious. He was certain that he could return home with promising news to share.



Soon,the bidding meeting began right on time. While everyone had anticipated Daniela's presence,only the Elite Lux bidding team showed up.



They proceeded with an overview of the project and outlined the bidding schedule.



The entire room sat in focused silence, scribbling down notes diligently, even those who believed they stood no chance.



Among them, Cedric wNas also seen jotting down notes with unwavering concentration.



In stark contrast, Alexander and Keith remained seated upright, showing no interest in taking notes.



Keith, puzzled by their indifference, turned to Alexander. "Why aren't you taking notes? Look,everyone else is all over it."



With the two projects valued in the tens of billions and involving intricate details and cost breakdowns,it was no wonder everyone else was frantically scribbling.



"Why bother? I'll just get the confidential budget report from Daniela later," Alexander remarked,prompting a wave of envy among the note-taking executives.



Their note-taking became increasingly half-hearted. If everything had already been decided, what was the point of their meticulous notes? It felt like they were just going through the motions, jotting down meaningless numbers. This project was clearly intended for Alexander.



Meanwhile, Keith, oblivious to the underlying tension but thoroughly impressed, was in high spirits.



The meeting dragged on for over three hours.



By the time it finally ended, everyone had filled their small notebooks with notes-but no one made a move to leave.



With Alexander claiming access to a confidential budget report, the attendees lingered,hoping for even the tiniest peek to salvage some value from their time.



Alexander was fully aware of what they were sticking around for.



Standing up, he casually brushed the lint off his suit pants and made his way towards Lillian.



Before he could get too close, Lillian gestured for him to come over.



Alexander couldn't help but feel a sudden rush of happiness. Daniela's stubbornness was obvious. Deep down, she still cared about him, no matter how much she tried to hide it. Clearly, this was her way of luring him back.



Wearing a composed smile, Alexander strode forward confidently.



"Cedric," Lillian said as she handed him a thick notebook. "Daniela gave it to you."



All heads turned, and everyone strained to get a better look. And there it was, the Confidential Budget Report.



"Daniela mentioned that you're tied up with the North District project, so there's no need for you to participate in the bidding. By the time you wrap up,this project will have reached its mid-phase, and you can step in with your team to evaluate the earlier work."



The announcement hit like a thunderclap, leaving everyone speechless.



Someone quickly raised a hand. "Wait, does this mean the bid only covers the first phase of the project?"



Lillian nodded affirmatively. "Exactly. The second half wasn't part of the bidding because it's already assigned. We prefer working with trusted partners.If it weren't for the fact that Cedric's tied up with the North District project, we would've let him handle the  entire new project too."



Lillian's statement confirmed the executives suspicions, though few had anticipated the collaboration between Daniela and Cedric would extend beyond the North District project.



It was a reminder of the undeniable strength of connections.



Alexander's mood soured instantly. What on earth was this supposed to mean? Was he expected to work under Cedric's supervision if he won the project?



Seeing the same people who had been buttering him up moments ago now gravitate towards Cedric filled Alexander with indignation, yet he refrained from storming out.



Straightening his posture, he walked over to Lillian with a steely expression. "Can I have a copy of that confidential budget report?"



Lillian gave him a bemused look before chuckling. "I'm sorry, and you are?"
###Chapter 120 More Than Enough.
Alexander furrowed his brow. He was about to say something when Lillian's sharp, mocking voice cut him off. "Why are you so thick-skinned?"


Her words rang out, carrying across the room so that everyone could hear.



"What's this? Daniela divorces you, and you're still hanging around like a parasite? This is private business,don't you get it? An ex-husband is an outsider,not an insider. Got that?"



Lillian's words landed like a slap, and the room's attention snapped to Alexander in an instant.


The crowd, including those who had just handed him their business cards, now murmured to each other in hushed tones.



The weight of their stares pressed against Alexander,his face flushing with humiliation.



Seething with rage,he shot Lillian a furious glare."Fine!If you won't give it to me, I'll take it straight to Daniela.You're just her subordinate, and I won't lower myself to your level. But clearly, Daniela needs to reevaluate  her staff training. I'll make sure to have a word with her about this!"



With that, he stormed off, fury radiating from every step.



Keith, who had been trailing Alexander all day, didn't get the outcome he had hoped for either.



When he finally returned home, his father wasted no time in giving him an earful.


"Stop following Alexander around! Otherwise, Daniela will hate you too! That woman is our golden opportunity-don't ruin this for us!"



After the harsh scolding, Keith left in a huff and headed straight to a bar.



Feeling a surge of frustration, Keith grabbed his phone and dialed Alexander's number. However, the call was dismissed.



Alexander was heading straight for Elite Lux.



When he reached Daniela's office,she was fully absorbed in sorting through a large stack of paperwork. She didn't even look up to acknowledge his presence.



"Mr. Bennett, have you forgotten basic manners? You didn't even bother knocking." Alexander's anger boiled over, threatening to spill out."What the hell. Daniela?" Why did you let Lillian humiliate me like that?"



Lillian had already informed Daniela of the situation,so Daniela was fully aware of what had happened.



"I heard you called Lillian my subordinate? Let me make one thing perfectly clear everyone in this building is my equal. Lillian is my friend,someone l trust deeply and treat like family. I won't stand for anyone disrespecting her. Consider this a warning."



Finally, she raised her gaze, her eyes icy and commanding. "I won't be so lenient next time."



Alexander was about to protest, but Daniela cut him off once more. "Let's at least maintain some basic decency. Mutual respect is the bare minimum. Or should I teach you that too?"



Alexander's frustration grew. He hadn't even begun to express himself, and she was already lecturing him.



"Why are you treating me like this?" he demanded,his voice tight with anger. "Cedric gets access to the proposal.Why don't I?"


Daniela's tone remained steady,emotionless."lforgot."It was a dismissive response, and she didn't offer any further explanation. Alexander extended his hand, his voice cold and insistent. "Give it to me now."



He couldn't afford to let this go, not with rumors already circulating behind his back.



Daniela replied, "There aren't any left."



Alexander's breath caught in his chest, his frustration reaching a boiling point. "You're playing me, Daniela!"



Daniela's lips curved into a subtle smile. "You've asked to be involved in the bidding meeting,but what makes you think our relationship is such that I'd treat you the same way I do Cedric? Is it because you told me you'd 'treat me well'?"



Her smile disappeared, her face hardening into a cold,distant expression. "We're adults, Alexander. Is it really that simple to get under your skin? That's not like you."



She leaned back, a hint of disappointment in her tone."Truthfully, I thought you had some dignity, some pride.If you come crawling back to me now that l've found success, it'll make everything I ever felt for y/ou seem like a joke. It'll make me realize that even your 'love' could be bought with money."



As she spoke, her gaze never wavered from his, and she seemed entirely unaffected by the displeasure that crossed his face. "I'm incredibly wealthy, Alexander. So wealthy that you can't even begin to fathom it. And when you have so much of something, it loses its value. If it only takes money to win your favor, then you can keep it.Understand?"



With that, she turned back to her paperwork,picked up her pen, and resumed her signing



Her handwriting was immaculate, each stroke purposeful. Alexander stared at her, his lips tightly pressed together. After a heavy, silent pause,he spun on his heel and headed for the door.



Just before he left, he spat out bitterly, "Daniela!You'll regret this!"



He had never felt such humiliation. Each step felt more burdensome than the last.



"Alexander," Daniela suddenly called out.



Alexander's heart softened, and he turned back, his face still clouded with frustration. "What now?"



Throughout it all, he kept up a facade of dignity.



"Keep that attitude. Hold your head up high. And don't forget to shut the door behind you when you leave."



The brief softness in Alexander's expression vanished,  replaced by a harsh, dark frown.



With a sharp, angry motion, he slammed the door behind him, the sound echoing violently through the office.



Daniela, however, didn't flinch. She simply let out a small, almost satisfied smile, whle her attention remained fixed on the papers in front of her.



The moment was more than enough.
###Chapter 121 I'm Sorry




Alexander was seething with fury, feeling like he would explode at any moment.


Upon his arrival at the bar, he found Keith swaying slightly, clearly drunk and unsteady.


When Alexander shared his grievances, Keith's eyes widened in astonishment, realizing the truth in his friend's words.


Breaking it down for him, Keith remarked thoughtfully, "Tell me if I'm off base here, Alexander.Wasn't it Daniela who was always following you around? She used to hang on your every word while you barely gave her the time of day. Now,she's wealthy, and suddenly you're showing interest. No wonder she questions your motives. Daniela makes a good point,you know."



Alexander clenched his jaw, his expression growing stormy as he gulped down his drink forcefully. "So you're suggesting I play hard to get?"


Memories of Cedric's tender ways with Daniela flashed through his mind. "If I delay too long, she might settle down and start a family with Cedric!"


"Just keep showing her kindness," Keith advised, his words slurring as the alcohol took over. "People have hearts; they're not just emotionless stones. Be patient with her, whether it's for a year, two years,or even a decade. Alexander, your pride is getting in the way. You act as if everyone should adore you! Daniela has changed; what makes you think she'll return to you? You need to change your approach.Constantly expecting her to appease you will only drive her away. As a man, don't let pride dictate your actions,especially since she's your ex-wife. Why fuss about who's right?"


With a hearty slap on the back, Keith exclaimed,"What a foolish man you are!"


And with that,Keith crumpled to the floor in a heap.


Alexander watched, making no move to assist him. He sat in his chair, ensnared by his own thoughts for what felt like an eternity.
Eventually, his voice broke the silence, soft and uncertain. "Is that really how it is? One year... two years... a decade? If I chase after her, will Daniela ever return to me?"
Elite Lux, embracing a modern approach,had implemented a balanced work week: four days of work followed by three days of rest.
Daniela, ever the efficient worker, had completed her assignments the previous evening. Her secretary popped in with a reminder, bubbling with enthusiasm. "Daniela, don't forget about the banquet tonight."
Daniela's expression shadowed with a touch of melancholy.
The secretary departed with an uncontainable grin.Throughout her tenure, she had never encountered a CEO as genuinely charming as Daniela.

Adorned in her elegant evening gown, Daniela nINE ASKED,

descended the stairs only to be greeted by the unexpected sight of Cedric.


His attire was impeccably tailored-a stark black suit that contrasted with his recent tan, acquired from his time on construction sites, lending him an air of rugged sophistication.


Upon their arrival at the venue, Daniela excused herself to the restroom.



As she made her way back, the crisp sound of her phone's notification caught her attention.


Checking it, she discovered a message from Alexander.


Daniela's eyebrow arched high.


She had assumed Alexander had finally given up after their heated discussion last time.



She let out a dry chuckle, her smirk carrying a sharp edge of sarcasm.


Money had a miraculous way of bending principles. The man she once admired for his staunch principles was now humbling himself repeatedly.


The message simply stated, "I'm sorry."


A smirk played on Daniela's lips.


When Cedric spotted her, she was gazing at her phone, her dimples deepening enchantingly on her cheeks.



"What's got you in such a good mood? You look exceptionally cheerful."


Daniela tilted her phone towards Cedric as they continued on their way.


Meanwhile, Alexander stepped out of the restroom.He caught the sound of Daniela's laughter.


It was her happiness that echoed in her laughter-happiness sparked by his message.


Her laughter rang melodious, stirringa wave of elation in Alexander's heart.


He now believed Keith's advice. If he persisted in showing genuine kindness to Daniela, she would undoubtedly feel his sincerity.


It was only a matter of time before everything Daniela had became his.


He wished, with all his heart, that Daniela could go back to being the person she once was.
###Chapter 122 Jerk





Cedric passed the phone to Daniela, and she slipped it into her bag.


He had questions in mind, but he hesitated, unsure of the repercussions of asking them.


Cedric knew Daniela wasn't one to revisit old relationships, but back then, she had no principles when it came to Alexander.


He was always the one in control, except when it involved Daniela.


Just as they were about to enter the banquet hall,Cedric stopped briefly and gently grasped Daniela's hand.



He held it for just a moment before letting go.


Daniela turned to face him, her brow slightly furrowed. "What's wrong?" Cedric pressed his lips together as he clenched his hand and unclenched it. After a brief pause, he smiled and shook his head. "It's nothing. Just stick to juice. Drinking at night can be tough on your stomach."



Daniela chuckled, her eyes twinkling like stars.


Cedric felt his heart skip a beat, but he still hesitated.


Lillian and Ryan pulled him to a quiet corner for a scolding.


"Cedric! What were you thinking?" Ryan crossed his arms.



Lillian was frantic. "Were you about to confess? You should've just confessed already. How hard is it to say, 'I like you, and I'm going to pursue you?' It's not that difficult, is it?"


Ryan ran his hand through his hair. "You said you'd wait because Daniela had just returned. Then you said the North District project was urgent, so you'd wait again. What now? Are you going to wait until the project of the South and East Districts is finished?" It was unusual for Ryan to speak this much.


Lillian remarked, "Look at this, you've even got the quiet one talking. Cedric, what do you really want?"


Cedric leaned against the wall, his eyes focused on Daniela as she stood nearby, enjoying a cupcake,all while looking out through the large window.


A shy individual approached her with a drink, and Daniela offered a warm smile, completely unbothered by the cutthroat atmosphere that usually surrounded business.



"She's not ready yet," Cedric murmured.


"Ready for what? Look at this..." Lillian started,but her words trailed off as Alexander emerged from the restroom, walking towards Daniela.


Frowning,Cedric started to move towards them, but Lillian quickly held him back. He glanced at her in confusion.


"Don't bother. You won't get it, even if you try. Just watch and learn," Lillian advised as Ryan held Cedric in place.


The person Daniela was chatting with was a young interior designer, someone Alexander recognized.


He came from a humble, rural background with no connections, relying only on his determination to get ahead. The last time he offered Alexander a drink,Alexander took a small sip without much thought,while the young man downed the entire glass in one go.


Later, Alexander had seen the young man vomiting in the restroom, his girlfriend helping him out.


The girlfriend was simple in appearance and modestly dressed, and she smiled at Alexander as she helped the man.



Alexander had witnessed many couples like them-staying together through the toughest times.


He looked down on people like them.


By the time Alexander reached Daniela, the young man seemed visibly nervous. Daniela glanced at him briefly, her tone neutral. "Mr. Bennett."


Alexander carried himself with the confidence of someone who had made it, and the young man,feeling defeated, handed Daniela his business card before leaving.


Daniela gave the card a quick look-Leandro Prescott, an interior designer.


"Don't waste your time," Alexander said, snatching the card from her hand before she could read it."He's just a nobody with little to offer. If you need a real expert, come to Bennett Group. I'll introduce you to someone with over ten years of experience."


With a casual motion, he threw the card into the trash.



Daniela's expression darkened. "He gave that card to me. What gives you the right to make decisions on my behalf?"


Alexander's brow furrowed, his expression barely controlled. "I'm just looking out for you." Daniela's face twisted into a look of distaste, and Alexander trailed behind her, asking, "Why don't you believe I'm looking out for you?"


Daniela coolly sipped her juice, her eyes glancing at the time.


"These events might be dull, but they're great for making connections," Alexander continued. "If you're not having fun, we can go somewhere better afterward."


Daniela remained indifferent, too disinterested to respond.


Alexander caught the resistance in her eyes,tightened his lips, and fell silent.


Daniela sat on the couch, letting time pass by.With Alexander looming nearby, like a dark cloud, no one dared come near her.


Just as Daniela was about to get up and leave,Alexander spoke up. "Look, Leandro's girlfriend is picking him up again. They look so close now, but he'll dump her the first thing when the money starts rolling in."


Daniela looked over.


Leandro was being helped into a car by a slightly chubby woman in a black dress. She shut the door and quickly made her way to the driver's side.


"That woman is so ordinary. Apart from being strong,I can't think of anything else that stands out about her. Daniela, you know why men go for practical women when they're building something? It's because only those kinds of women will stick with you when times get tough. Trust me, with Leandro's ambition, it won't take long before he moves on to a new girlfriend," Alexander said with a smug smile."I've never been wrong about people."


Daniela glanced at him briefly before breaking into a smile, her expression carrying a hint of sarcasm.


Alexander sensed it wasn't a compliment, but his curiosity got the best of him. "Why are you smiling?"


Daniela responded, "I'm really impressed." Alexander, assuming it was praise, opened his mouth to offer a polite reply-but before he could, Daniela added, "You're unbelievable! Jerk!"
###Chapter 123 A Chance





Daniela emerged from the building and noticed Ryan and Lillian at the entrance, their faces clouded with discontent.


Cedric, wearing a grin, strolled up to her.


Caught by the sight of the pair who looked as rigid as statues, Daniela raised an eyebrow at Cedric and queried, "What's up with them?"


Suppressing a chuckle, Cedric shrugged nonchalantly. "Oh, them? Just two goofballs."


They had barely resumed their drive when the driver turned towards Daniela wvith a concerned expression."| think we're being followed."


Glancing behind, Daniela's eyes quickly identified Alexander's car, a vehicle she knew all too well from days filled with unrequited affection.


The mere glimpse of his car used to send her heart into joyful flips.


With an air of cool indifference, Daniela remarked,"Just pay him no mind."


"Need me to take care of it?" Cedric offered.


"There's no need," Daniela stated firmly/. "Don't waste your energy on him."


Alexander persisted in his pursuit all the way to Elite Lux.



Upon their arrival, he burst from his car, urgency etched on his face. "Daniela, we need to speak."


Offering a brief nod, Daniela replied, "Alright, get on with it."


With a sharp glance at Cedric, Alexander silently conveyed his desire for him to leave.


Cedric glanced at Daniela, who stated crisply,are you going to speak up or not? Because if you aren't, I'm heading back inside."


Daniela's tolerance for Alexander was wearing thin. "Yes," Alexander responded, his voice tinged with unease. As Daniela pivoted to leave, he reached out,grasping her arm. "Daniela, you can't have it both ways-spending time with Cedric while you're seeing me."
Her expression turned to one of surprise at his accusation.
"First off, whatever's happening between Cedric and me isn't your damn concern. And Alexander, wvhat makes you think I'm seeing you? Besides, do you honestly think you're someoneI'd consider?"
With a sour expression, Alexander shot back, "You once told me I could treat you well."
Daniela arched an eyebrow, her laugh echoing with derision. "You're really adept at embarrassing yourself. I told you that you could be kind, and that as an adult, you're responsible for your own actions.I have no interest in managing your fantasies. Don't let your imagination get the better of you-it will only lead to disappointment. And weren't you completely smitten with Joyce? You divorced me to be with her. can't fathom why, now that you're both unattached,you aren't pursuing her. Why come here to hassle me in the dead of night? Tell me, why is that?"


Her voice dripped with scorn and mockery, each word more pointed than the last.


Alexander paused, his fists clenched, a surge of frustration building within him. "I don't care for Joyce anymore. Daniela, would you ever think about giving me a shot?"



Daniela let out a soft chuckle, clearly entertained."It's not entirely out of the question."


As soon as the words left her mouth, Cedric's eyes narrowed, a sharp contraction of his pupils betraying his shock. He swiveled his head to gaze at Daniela.


Ecstatic, Alexander couldn't contain himself and blurted out, "You mean it?" Bursting with enthusiasm, he moved forward, nudging Cedric aside without a second thought. "Daniela, is this true? You actually want to be with me?"


With a faint, almnost bitter smile, Daniela tilted her head slightly. "After all the time l've spent pursuing you, it would be a waste if I didn't at least consider your change of heart, wouldn't it?"


Her expression remained impassive as Alexander,brimming with joy, eagerly agreed, "Yes, exactly!"


Meanwhile, Lillian and Ryan observed from the sidelines, their faces mirroring their confusion.



Cedric, usually so composed and astute, stood a short distance away, his hands balling into fists.


Under normal circumstances, he might have discerned the lack of sincerity in Daniela's smile and realized the truth behind her words.



However, overwhelmed by emotion, he was far from his usual calm self.


A crushing weight settled in his chest, his mind spinning in chaos.


"Daniela, I swear I have no feelings for Joyce anymore.If you doubt me, I'll prove it to you right now." Not bothering to think twice, Alexander hastily dialed Joyce's number, eagerly setting his phone to speaker as it began to ring.
###Chapter 124 Setup





The call from Alexander caught Joyce off guard, yet her voice brimmed with an unexpected happiness when she picked up. "Alexander, is this a surprise call to say you've reconsidered? Ready to mnarry me at last? You know, my mom mentioned that marrying me comes with the Harper family's fortune. Of all the suitors, you've always been my top pick."


Alexander barely had a chance to reply before the phone was abruptly passed to someone else.


Katrina's voice, firm and calculating, filled the line."Alexander, did you finally come to your senses?I always knew you were the clever one. Here's the deal -I hold the reins to the Harper family. Marry Joyce,and all that wealth could be yours."


"No." Alexander's voice was steady,his gaze fixed on Daniela as he spoke. "I called to make it clear-I will not marry Joyce. Not now, not at my father's behest.I've realized that my heart still belongs to Daniela, and I've chosen to be with her."
Not giving Katrina a chance to react, he ended the call with a swift tap.
Ignoring the insistent buzz of Katrina's callbacks,Alexander turned to Daniela, his expression earnest."I've made my stance clear to them, Daniela. Is it finally our time to be together?"
Daniela's lips curved into a grin as she remarked,"Alexander, you really went all out, didn't you? Ionly said I'd think about it, not that it was a done deal.Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?"
Alexander was aware that Daniela had only agreed to consider his proposal.
His impatience was getting the better of him. He believed that settling things quickly would be more efficient, particularly with Cedric hovering nearby, a constant threat to his peace of mind.
"We've known each other for years. Is there really anything left to ponder?" he implored, his eyes scanning her expressive face, his heart fluttering with hope.



Daniela let out a derisive chuckle. "You've known Joyce for ages too, yet you didn't hesitate to cut her off just moments ago."


"I was just..." he stuttered, searching for the right words.



Daniela's smile grew sharp. "No need to spell it out.I get it. You're the type who looks at the grand scheme of things. There's no need for excuses with me."


With those words, Alexander felt a weight lift off his shoulders. This was promising. Daniela was beginning to see things from his angle. It wouldn't be long before she returned to being the woman who had always supported him.


"Daniela, I miss the way you used to be-generous,gentle, and considerate,"he admitted.



Daniela's laughter rang out again, light and carefree.She was generous,indeed-turning a blind eye while he shamelessly flirted with her stepsister. Her gentleness was undeniable, always attentive to whatever Alexander had to say. She was undeniably considerate-obedient to a fault and painfully naive.
Of course, he liked such a fool woman.
"So, are you telling me that my power, status, or wealth don't matter to you?" Daniela queried, her gaze piercing into Alexander's soul.
With a firm shake of his head, Alexander responded,"How could those superficial things be the reasons I cherish you? Daniela, believe me, my desire to be with you now is sincere."
Daniela's expression softened as she nodded in agreement. "I'm relieved to hear that. I, too, prefer that my wealth doesn't entangle with my future partner. Genuine relationships shouldn't sprout from personal gain."
Just a moment before, Alexander was brimming with vigor. Now, his face registered shock, as if struck by lightning.
He questioned his own ears, wondering if they had deceived him.
Attempting a smile, he managed only a tense grimace, his eyes locked on Daniela's. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 125 He Didn't Have Proof





Daniela declared with a smile, "I've made my stance clear. I don't like entangling emotions with interests.Imagine us, intertwined as lovers and yet adversaries in business, whispering endearments in solitude and clashing vehemently at work-it would just rip me apart."



Her smile was there, yet her eyes betrayed no trace of warmth.



With an almost mocking sweetness, she glanced at Alexander. "I yearn for a relationship that remains untainted.Is that too much to hope for?"



Her question, profound and stirring, left Alexander utterly speechless.


He stood, bewildered, realizing for the first time the depth of Daniela's reservations.


Could it really be that she harbored such thoughts? Nearby, Cedric was rooted to the spot, equally taken aback by the revelation.


Alexander, though hesitant, wasn't ready to let go.Everything had been aligning perfectly; how could it crumble so unexpectedly?


Struggling to keep his voice steady, he questioned,11SO1what you're saying is, if I want a chance with you, I need to stay away from the project of the South and East Districts?"


Daniela nodded, her smile turning cunning. "Yes,and it's not limited to that. Any endeavor tied to Elite Lux is off-limits for Bennett Group. Moreover, should there be any competition between us, you must quit.After all, if you're pursuing me, competing against me for projects wouldn't be proper, would it? But let's be honest-even if you did try to compete,you wouldn't stand a chance. I prefer to state this upfront to spare youany embarrassment."


Daniela leaned forward slightly and explained, "Elite Lux has scaled back its ventures recently, focusing only on luxury goods, construction, education, tourism, aerospace, and a bit of high-tech involvement."
Alexander's eyes widened, a clear sign of his astonishment. "Doesn't that complicate matters for me? So, are you saying I should just shut down Bennett Group entirely?"
"Absolutely," Daniela replied, her grin brimming with cheerfulness. "Didn't my parents do just that back in their day? It was quite the role reversal. Ultimately,they still had me."
Daniela's gaze turned distant, tinged with nostalgia."That way, a man is less likely to wander. How perfect! I've always yearned for that kind of life. I vowed when I was little that if a man ever cooked for me, I'd marry him right away!"
Her heart swirled with sarcasm, yet her expression remained utterly sincere.
Her eyes sparkled with a glimmer of hope as she pressed on. "Do you think you can handle that,Alexander?"
Alexander felt a pang of despair. "Wouldn't that reduce me to a man who lives off a woman? In our circles, that's just pathetic."
"Is that so? A man who would go to such lengths for love is truly praiseworthy, isn't it? That's exactly the kind of devotion I'm looking for!" Daniela exclaimed with conviction.
Alexander's chuckle was hollow, devoid of real amusement. "You never expected this from me before." Alexander was not ready to surrender.He gazed up at the imposing structure before him. Its majesty and grandeur were undeniable.

"I did before," Daniela lied. "It's just that we hadn't reached this point back then."

Alexander was taken back.
Daniela went on, "Moreover, I've secured my assets with legal ties. If something were to happen to me in the future, I could leave you one percent of my assets. That's hardly insignificant; that one percent could be worth over a billion." himself at a loss for words. Legal ties? But Daniela appeared in perfect health. When would she even need such provisions?
Seeing the shock on Alexander's face, Daniela's smile was tinged with irony. "This is a serious discussion. Why not go home and talk it over with your father? I can wait."
She offered one last piece of advice with feigned kindness. "I'm tied up these days. If you agree, you won't need to attend Elite Lux's bid the day after tomorrow. Well, that's all. I'm off to bed."
With that, Daniela turned on her heel,leaving Alexander no chance to reply as she strode away with an air of triumph.
Alexander remained, filled with suspicion that Daniela might boe messing around with him, yet he didn't have proof.
###Chapter 126 Can't Do Math
Ryan and Lillian observed Alexander's emotions surge and plummet dramatically, much like a rollercoaster-an amusing spectacle to them.
Cedric's brow furrowed deeply, his face etched with a somber expression as he trailed behind Daniela into the room.
While he maintained a stoic exterior, the storm raging within him mirrored Alexander's own distress.
Had he been aware beforehand, he would have steered clear of any involvement with Elite Lux's ventures.
The idea of being a stay-at-home husband, once a concept he dismissed with a scoff, now seemed an unattainable dream.
Taking a deep breath to ease the constriction in his chest, Cedric felt a mixture of frustration and despair after dropping Daniela off at her house. As she began to close the door, Cedric placed his
hand against it, halting its movement.
Daniela gazed at Cedric, her expression filled with bewilderment. "What's the matter?"
Cedric implored, "Daniela, listen-| was involved in the North District project, but I'm not the legal representative. I'm not profiting from it. To date, I haven't received a dime. We're doingthis as a pro bono endeavor, purely out of goodwill. Is that something you can accept?"
Daniela blinked, taken aback. "Didn't I tell you that the profits would be calculated and distributed to everyone eventually?"
"No, that's not it at all!"
"What?" Daniela's face clouded with confusion.
"It's purely a pro bono endeavor. Honestly, we're not after any profit at all! And the project in the South and East Districts? It's entirely for charity too! Our company aims to bolster its image by engaging in these community service projects. Let's make this clear; please, linsist,no money!" Cedric walked away, a throbbing headache beginning to form. Phillips Group was rolling in wealth. How on earth was he meant to spend all this cash? And if he handed it all over to Daniela, would she even take it?
As the elevator doors slid open, Lillian and Ryan emerged. Cedric fixed them with a grave look and ventured, "Do you reckon if I offered Daniela Phillips Group, myself included as part of the package, she'd take it?"
Lillian's brows furrowed as she squinted slightly."Wait, what did you just say?"
Ryan shook his head. "I'm pretty sure her advice is to get your head checked first."
Cedric found himself at a loss for words.
The following day, the North District project transitioned into its concluding settlement phase.
The finance teams from both corporations exchanged looks of bewildered resignation. <###Chapter 126 Can't Do Math                             +120 Points at most
Lucian Chavez, the finance director at Elite Lux,queried, "Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bradley, are you implying that for this partnership, we should treat all construction expenses as charitable donations?Could such a generous arrangement really exist? Is that your final decision? To forfeit hundreds of billions?"
The twisted rationale of the elite left him utterly dumbfounded.
Tyler, the legal counsel, also gazed at Cedric, his expression one of bewildered curiosity.
From its inception, Cedric had been a key investor in the company, holding the reins over Elite LuX's ventures. His leadership had recently culminated in a windfall of profits for him.
Despite attempts to understand his strategies, they remained a mystery to many, including Tyler.
When the accountant at Tyler'sfirm scrutinized the expenses reflected in their ledger, a series of zeroes stretched before him like a road to ruin, ushering in a throbbing headache. Could this deal drive the company into bankruptcy?
Elite Lux's finance team had initially been confident in their ability to negotiate the terms of the agreement. Yet, they found themselves at a loss, as the opposing party disregarded the usual protocols.
"Are you actually forfeiting tens of billions in project funds?" Lucian massaged his temples, trying to find clarity in the chaos.
Tyler glanced at Cedric for confirmation, receiving a nod in return.
Mirroring the gesture, Tyler also nodded.
A flicker of thrill crossed Lucian's features.
They were set to rake in tens of billions, and no catch whatsoever?
"Then are there any stipulations? Perhaps terms for future partnerships with Elite Lux?" he suggested tentatively.
"No, there won't be any future collaborations!"Cedric's tone was firm, leaving no room for  argument. Lucian was utterly bewildered, unsure of how to respond. He couldn't hold back and questioned,"What exactly are you trying to get?"
Tyler, equally baffled, turned to Cedric and echoed,"What do you even want from this?"
Cedric shook his head, brushing off any argument."There's no point explaining. Just sign the settlement and be done with it."
The scene unfolded with a surreal air that made Lucian tread carefully. "Hold on, let me get in touch with our boss," he announced before stepping away momentarily.
Daniela was in a meeting, pressing down on the documents on the table. Lucian returned with the phone and gave it to Cedric. Daniela asked in exasperation, "Cedric, what are you up to?"
Cedric replied, "Like I mentioned yesterday, I'm engaged in charity work." Daniela sighed, a flicker of frustration crossing her face. "We do not entertain charitable sponsorships here. Please, pass the phone to someone from our finance team." Complying without a word, Cedric handed over the phone.
After Daniela's brief exchange, the line went dead,and Lucian's expression morphed into one of sheer confusion. "Our boss just crunched some numbers and based on our market profit share, your net gain from this transaction would be around 10.3 billion.We've decided to round it up to 11 billion."
Before Cedric could respond, Tyler's accountant leaped to his feet, equally stunned. "Excuse me? Did I hear that right? From 10.3 to 11 billion?"
The suggestion to bump the figure by a staggering 700 million sparked disbelief.
That decision defied all logic!
Was it Cedric or Daniela who deemed math meaningless in the world of extreme wealth?
###Chapter 127 Money Or Her

The finance director of Elite Lux felt as though the other party was treating him like he was foolish.
Still, he had double-checked with Daniela several times, and she insisted, "$10.3 billion, round it up to $11 billion!"
Cedric felt like all hope was gone. It wasn't just the $11 billion; it felt as though Daniela was using money to push him away.
"Mr. Phillips, are you going to sign this final statement?"

"No,I won't."
The director of Elite Lux felt as though he was trying to please someone who didn't care, offering something that wasn't even desired.

In the end, the deal fell apart. After the meeting, Daniela reached out to Cedric, but
he didn't bother answering. She found it oddly amusing.
Lillian watched the entire scene unfold with interest.She trailed Daniela into the office and asked, "You mentioned yesterday you'd give Alexander a chance to pursue you. Was that serious?"
At those words, Daniela shot a glance at Lillian. "Am I out of my mind? Why would I ever get involved with Alexander again?"
Lillian pushed further, "Then what about last night?"
"He's always picking on me, acting like I'm a pushover!" Daniela replied.
Lillian laughed. "So, mixing business and personal feelings doesn't bother you? Don't you like how your parents managed their relationship?"
"It doesn't," Daniela said bluntly. "A healthy relationship requires both people to manage it, but mixing it with business can cause a lot of complications, so it's better to steer clear. Of course, it all depends on the couple themselves.Why are you asking this all of a sudden, Lillian? Are you about to confess your feelings to Ryan?" As soon as Lillian heard that, she quickly ended the call in her pocket and started coughing uncontrollably. Her face turned bright red as she exclaimed, "What are you talking about?"
Embarrassed, Lillian hurried out of the room, only to return moments later, warning, "Don't you dare spread any rumors!"
Daniela shook her head with a grin and returned to her work.
Meanwhile, Alexander was in a full-on panic.
He was certain Daniela was finally ready to reconsider their relationship.
He had even planned that once she said yes, he'd propose right away.
That way, all of Daniela's wealth would become his.
But just when he thought he had everything lined up, she dropped the bombshell that she'd already completed a property notarization.


To make matters worse, he was now barred from taking part in any of Elite Lux's projects.


What could he possibly do now?


If he walked away now, it would make him seem like he was only after her wealth, and that would be humiliating.



So he decided to keep his cool with Daniela.


But it felt like she was toying with him, knowing he wouldn't dare agree, yet she still bombarded him with three messages a day asking about it.


Now,he was completely at a loss.


Responding felt like a problem, but staying silent was just as tricky.


He found himself stuck in an unresolvable dilemma.


With Elite Lux's upcoming bidding looming,Alexander's anxiety reached a peak. His stress was so overwhelming that it caused painful mouth ulcers, making it hard for him to speak properly. "Dad, what do you think we should do? Should we go for the bidding?"
Attending the bidding would mean abandoning the commitment he had made earlier.
But if they skipped it, how could he live with missing out on a project worth billions?
Richard balled his fists in frustration, struggling to make a hard choice. He looked at Alexander and asked, "Did Daniela leave any opening for negotiation in what she said?"
Alexander paused for a moment, then shook his head. "No, she was pretty clear. She said what she needed to, then walked out, telling me to think it over on my own. She also mentioned how she admired the way her parents balanced things-her dad taking care of the home while her mom ran the business."

Richard's grip tightened even further. His gaze cut through Alexander like a sharp knife. "So, she's really forcing you to choose, huh? Do you care more about the money or her?"
###Chapter 128 Alexander's Choice





Richard narrowed his eyes. "Don't hold back. Just be straight with me."


Life with Daniela meant a future dripping with opulence and affluence, yet it demanded a sacrifice of his own moral compass.


"Go down this road, and you'll be just another spineless lapdog, like those pathetic losers drooling over Daniela-gutless and the butt of everyone's jokes. Yet, behind the facade of derision, life would be sweet. Moreover, when she's gone, even a tiny slice of her fortune would ensure you live in luxury,much like Caiden did," Richard muttered. "But if you're the one to die first, everything you've done will be meaningless."


He fixed his gaze on Alexander, his expression serious. "This one's on you. Only you can decide. If you want to be with Daniela, remember, Bennett Group will be relegated to a life of modesty." Society often viewed a man dependent on a woman's wealth as devoid of independence and drive.
Richard muttered a string of curses under his breath,seething at Daniela's heartless, manipulative bullshit.Yet, the allure of inheriting tens of billions was no trivial matter.
It was the kind of temptation that could break even the strongest resolve.
With a troubled frown, Richard rubbed his hands together and turned away.
His chance encounter with Daniela while shopping was unexpected.
In days gone by, Richard would haughtily await Daniela's lavish praises.
Now, the sight of Daniela, a vision of sophistication in her designer clothes and shimmering pearl earrings,made his heart skip a beat in apprehension, debating whether to approach and offer flattering words.
Whispers swirled that Daniela's unassuming pearlearrings alone boasted a value exceeding eighty million.
Richard mustered a smile, preparing to exchange pleasantries with Daniela.
But she breezed right past him without a sideways glance, her entourage of mall staff in tow,rendering him, her former father-in-law, utterly invisible.
A shadow of displeasure crossed Richard's face instantly.
Was Daniela considering a reconciliation with Alexander? It seemed quite the contrary; she appeared to want nothing to do with him.
Yet, Richard couldn't help but ponder-if Alexander were to marry into the Harper family, he'd become one of them. How would he maintain his pride when interacting with Daniela? Would he be forced to greet her with a smile only to be snubbed?
This thought sent a shiver through Richard,hastening his steps towards home. Meanwhile, Daniela continued her tour of the store.Lillian cast a glance her way, curiosity tinged her voice. "Daniela, didn't you notice Richard back there?"
"Yeah," Daniela responded with a dismissive shrug.
Lillian nodded, a trace of relief in her tone. "Looks like you've finally snapped out of that obsession.
She had feared Daniela might approach Richard,addressing him with undue reverence.
The mere thought had left her anxious.
With a light chuckle, Daniela brushed off the concern.

Lillian pressed on, her voice laced with intrigue."If Alexander sacrifices his dignity and chooses to be with you, would you truly accept him?"
As Daniela surveyed the store, she shook her head and declared, "No."
Lillian turned to her with a puzzled look. "Why not?" Daniela responded, "Alexander will never relinquish control of Bennett Group. His pride wouldn't allow it.He can't stand the thought of the gossip that would follow if he married into another family to save face.His pride, believe it or not, outweighs his own interests. Even if he were to agree, it'd be because he harbors some hope that l'd pass away soon,allowing him to inherit everything. If he doesn't marry me, he gains nothing from the deal. He's not the type to take such a risk."
Over the years, Daniela had pieced together the essence of Alexander's character.
She recognized his egotism, his aloofness, and the way he masqueraded as a man of virtue while his actions were guided solely by self-interest.
He was a master at playing the part of the stoic,immovable hero.
"Just you wat," Daniela asserted with a hint of certainty. "Alexander will most certainly make an appearance at the bidding." On the day of the bidding, as Daniela and Lillian entered the venue, there was no sign of Alexander yet. However, Cedric was unexpectedly present.


Raising an eyebrow, Lillian queried, "I thought you were determined to stay out of this?"


The last time Daniela had paid him for the project,Cedric had been visibly mortified for days.


"I'm not here to participate. I'm merely here to observe, to set my mind at ease," Cedric replied,seated beside Daniela. "Leave it to me, Daniela.I'l supervise for free. I do have the experience, after all."


Daniela shot back, "Cedric, is watching others get rich your weird little kink? I offered you this job once,and you declined. Now you show up offering to supervise for free? What are you playing at?"


With a warm smile, Cedric extended a thermos towards Daniela. "Skip the mineral water today; it's chilly out. Have something warm instead."


His thoughtful actions almost painted him as a nurturing figure, sparking the question of why he'd fuss over such small details.
Feeling parched, Daniela gratefully took a few sips from the thermos.
As the bidding meeting commenced, Daniela confidently stepped onto the stage to address the gathering. However, her attention was diverted as a figure slipped through the entrance.
The newcomer, with head bowed and shoulders hunched, quietly made their way to the last row and seated themselves discreetly.
Daniela's gaze turned to Lillian.
Catching Daniela's look, Lillian glanced back and recognized the latecomer as Alexander.
A sense of defeat washed over her. Betting against Daniela had been a terrible call, and now she was stuck owing her ten grand.
With a heavy heart, Lillian transferred the money to Daniela, her mood visibly dampened as she slumped back in her chair. Maynard Group and Phillips Group had unexpectedly pulled out of the running, leaving two lucrative construction sites available. The potential profits were so immense; everyone's eyes were on the prize,dreaming of securing a fortune that could sustain their families for generations to come.
Seated among the audience, Alexander's determination hardened as Daniela declared the integration of the construction of the two pieces of land into a single project.
In his view, nothing could rival the allureof wealth.
Clutching his pen, his resolve was palpable.

###Chapter 129 Less Confident
Bennett Group, known for its formidable strength and prowess, stood second only to Cedric's enterprise.Alexander harbored no doubts-this project was meant for him, his ticket to a triumphant future.
The inner turmoil faded away, leaving behind nothing but cold, unyielding resolve.
Under the shimmering lights, Daniela's beauty captivated him anew. Alexander pondered that once he secured the project and its lucrative rewards,it was time to talk to Daniela.
She had given him a second chance before, and she'd probably do it again-she was practically obsessed with him, after all.
On the stage, Daniela's gaze swept over the crowd,landing briefly on Alexander, whose ambition seemed almost tangible.
A subtle smile played on her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, maintaining her poise as she resumed her address.
When Alexander approached Lillian to collect his copy of the bidding documents, he met with a moment's hesitation.
Confusion flickered across Alexander's face.
It wasn't Daniela's potential financial loss that bothered Lillian; rather, she found Alexander's brazen opportunism distasteful.
Alexander had to tug sharply to liberate the documents from Lillian's firm grasp.
The bidding was set for the morning.
Each competing firm would fill in its bid, and the project would be awarded to the lowest adequate offer.
They had meticulously prepared their cost estimates,aware that this was their sole opportunity to submit their bid.

At lunchtime, Elite Lux hosted a lavish buffet free of charge, yet none of the executives had the appetite to partake. Their minds were elsewhere, deeply engaged with their finance teams, laboring over the precise figures to submit on their bid forms later that day.


Alexander felt a surge of confidence in his company's calculations. After quickly finishing his meal, he made his way upstairs to meet with Daniela.


However, as he approached the elevator, a security guard stepped in his path, blocking the way.


"I need to see Daniela," Alexander insisted firmly.


The guard remained unmoved, his expression apologetic yet resolute. "I'm sorry, but Ms. Harper is currently on her lunch break and is not accepting any visitors. Additionally, to maintain fairness, she is not meeting with representatives from any bidding companies during this period. Are you by chance involved in the bids this afternoon?"


If Alexander was involved in the bidding, he would be denied any contact with Daniela. Alexander was well aware of the rules, but his dire situation left him with only one option-go to Daniela.


It wasn't just about him. This was for his family, for the livelihood of thousands of employees, and to live up to Richard's expectations.


He hoped Daniela would understand his position,allowing him to proceed to the afternoon's bid without any lingering doubts.


"Please, I need to speak with Daniela for a moment.It's a personal matter, unrelated to today's bidding."


"She's not available to meet," the guard stated firmly.


As Alexander made a move to bypass him,the guard didn't hesitate to summon reinforcement. "Lillian,could you please come down here? There's someone named Mr. Bennett here, and he won't take no for an answer-he wants to see Ms. Harper now."


Lillian's irritation was palpable the moment she got the message.


Without a moment's delay, she descended the stairs to confront Alexander. Her voice was icy as she addressed him. "What's so important that it can't wait? Why must your concerns always disrupt our peace? Can't you see everyone else deserves a lunch break? Do you really think you're so significant that the world must pause at your whim? It's frankly embarrassing, Alexander.Aren't you supposed to be more mature than this?"
Despite the sharp sting of her words, Alexander remained steady and composed. "Lillian, I realize you have your grievances with me, but this is urgent and only involves Daniela. I assure you, it has nothing to do with the bidding. May I please speak with her upstairs?"
His voice carried a sincerity that seemed more profound than usual.
Yet, Lillian perceived him merely as a man blinded by the lure of profit. Elevating her voice deliberately, she challenged him. "If this has nothing to do with the bid, why are you so hell-bent on meeting her right now?" Her words boomed across the cafeteria, capturing the attention of the other executives who were awaiting the afternoon's bidding session.


Lillian, intent on creating a spectacle, pressed on."And what's more, how can we be sure you're not planning to lean on your past relationship to influence or bribe my boss once you're behind closed doors? Are you looking for an unfair advantage-a shortcut, perhaps? That hardly seems just to the rest of us, diligently preparing our proposals. Alexander, choose the honorable route and abandon these shortcuts! Everyone else deserves a fair chance at this project, too. Why should Elite Lux favor you exclusively? What makes you so exceptional?"


At her provocation, several business owners rose,their gestures accusatory as they pointed at Alexander. "That's right. We all agreed-no meetings with Ms. Harper before the official session. It maintains fairness. How could you disregard the rules?"


"Indeed. You already have an advantage knowing Ms. Harper. Why isn't that good enough for you?"


"Let's progress together in this industry. Allowing one entity to dominate isn't just. Let's uphold equity and collective advancement."


"You're suggesting this isn't about the bid,but we all know there's more to it. You might be scheming something sinister. The Bennett family has a reputation for playing dirty to secure a contract."


With a fortune on the line, tensions were sky-high.No one was willing to back down or risk being outbid.


A minor concession for goodwill was manageable,but on a billion-dollar deal? No one was eager to absorb such a hit.



Voices escalated, clashing in the room, their pointed accusations giving Alexander no chance to defend himself.


Defeated, he withdrew to his seat, his expression one of sheer frustration. He worried Daniela might misread his intentions. Since their divorce, his place in her life had felt increasingly shaky.
Yet, he was resolute in seeking a moment alone with her. He needed to unload the burdens weighing heavily on his heart.
###Chapter 130 Alexander's Heart Was In Turmoil
Daniela was on her way downstairs after lunch break when the abrupt buzz of her phone halted her mid-step.


She mentioned the interruption to Lillian before stepping outside to answer the call.


As she greeted the caller with a crisp "Hello," a series of footsteps resounded behind her.


When she turned and saw Alexander approaching,the pieces clicked intoplace instantly.


"You've really outdone yourself. A whole new phone number just to reach me before the bidding? Truly impressive."


Alexander caught the icy edge in Daniela's eyes as she scrutinized him.


With the bidding meeting looming, he felt a surge of urgency. "Let me explain, Daniela."
Daniela's calm demeanor remained intact as she offered a small nod. "Fine, go ahead."
In Alexander's memories, Daniela was always the sensitive young woman who felt neglected by his inattention.
However, the woman standing before him now was a stark contrast to his memories. Clad in a sharp business suit, her hair slicked back into a neat bun,she radiated the authority of a seasoned CEO.
Her gaze was cool, detached, as she awaited his forthcoming stumble of words.
In that moment, as Alexander faced her, a wave of discomfort washed over him.
Daniela, once familiar and close, now seemed like a stranger, her distance palpable and chilling.
"Weren't you going to explain?" Daniela pressed on,her voice tinged with casual indifference.
Her curiosity was piqued; she was eager to uncover  the kind of elaborate excuses Alexander might unveil.


Just as anticipated, the words started flowing from him.


"Daniela, I realize my visit today might unsettle you,but I can't stand the thought of becoming just another insignificant nobody. Moreover, I believe you're not merely an echo of your father-you possess your own vision, your own strengths, your own dignity. How could you possibly be content with your future partner relegated to a mere househusband? Come on, you're underestimating me and yourself."


His words flowed with a passionate intensity, nearly swaying Daniela's initial skepticism.


Seeing her stunned expression, Alexander felt a surge of hope and continued, "Daniela, I understand you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're not someone who craves power. You may appear strong and decisive now, but I know deep down, you still long to be a little girl."


His statement was capable of thawing the resolve of  any woman, regardless of age.


Internally, Daniela couldn't help but admire the performance. Incredible! What a display of eloquence!


Alexander continued, "That's precisely why I'm here today. I'm asking for a chance to stand by your side.I envision a future where, when people look at us, they won't dismiss me as unworthy. Instead, they'll see us as a perfect couple, affirming that your choice was impeccable!"


With a definitive nod, he concluded, "Trust me,Daniela. Let me take the lead on the project.promise, I'll execute it brilliantly!"


His eyes shone with a mixture of hope and determination, waiting eagerly for her response.


Daniela found his silliness almost too much to bear.Yet, since he seemed determined to underestimate her,she felt compelled to play along.


Her lips twisted into a wry smile as she met Alexander's hopeful gaze and replied with a note of sorrow, "Is that really what you believe? If that's the case, it's clear we're not meant to be."


"What?" Alexander's voice cracked slightly as he blinked at Daniela, his expression a mix of shock and confusion. "What did you just say?"


"What I desire is worlds apart from what you pursue.I yearn for someone who values kindness,thoughtfulness, and puts family above the pursuit of riches. When people look at us, they shouldn't see us as the 'perfect couple' Instead, they should be saying, 'Wow! She really knows how to manage him!'"


Stunned and unsure, Alexander could only stand there, struggling to process.


He had meticulously followed his psychology instructor's guidance, so why was it failing him now?


Everything seemed off.


"Moreover, I'm already financially secure. What use do I have for someone who's just chasing more wealth? There's no charm in that." "But..." Alexander's voice faltered, his hands clenching at his sides. "Weren't you always in love with me? How can you just change like that? Daniela,this must be some kind of joke,right?"


Daniela gave a small, sad nod. "I did love you, but since I realized they were unrequited, I forced myself to move on."



Alexander's mind reeled. No! The way things were before was perfect!


"So, you're saying you chose wealth over what we had?" she asked, her voice laced with a mix of disbelief and sorrow.


Just as Alexander opened his mouth to protest,Daniela, her face crumpling with anguish, raised her hand to stop him. "No, please don't. I think I already know your answer."


At that moment, a storm of regret and despair swirled within Alexander.


For the first time, he felt utterly defeated. He had failed Daniela not just once, but twice now.


Watching her walk away, her shoulders slumped and her steps heavy, Alexander was consumed with self-reproach.


He wanted to slap himself until his face stung for being so damn clueless.
###Chapter 131| Think Alexander Still Loves Me

As Alexander stepped into the conference hall, his eyes immediately caught Daniela signaling something subtle to Lillian.
Moments later, Lillian spun around and shot Alexander an icy, hostile glare.
Confused by her reaction, Alexander wondered what he could have done to spark such hostility. When Lillian faced him, he offered a polite nod, but her response was a just scornful smirk. "You really have a knack for disappointing everyone, don't you?"
The bidding session commenced without further delay.
Alexander, preoccupied with his personal turmoil,found it hard to focus and respond to each bid effectively. After several rounds, he had failed to secure any significant contracts. Ultimately, he settled for a minor project with barely any profit to show for it.


At that moment, he caught Daniela sending yet another signal to Lillian.


It was then that the realization hit Alexander-he'd been set up.


He remained seated in the audience, a bitter taste of defeat settling in. The bidding was done, and there was no turning back.


Nearby, those who once envied Alexander's perceived closeness to Daniela began to snicker discreetly.


"I thought he was someone important. Turns out,he's all bark and no bite!"


"Exactly! Acting like he's close to Ms. Harper, but she barely spares him a glance."


"He always acted so high and mighty. Who was he trying to fool?" "Can you believe the nerve? Showing up at his ex-wife's event! I heard he got tangled up with Ms.Harper's stepsister, and that's why she left him.Apparently, he treated her terribly until he realized how rich she'd become!"
"No way! I thought he had integrity and pride. Turns out, he's just another gold digger."
"Hell yes! All polished and proper, but probably just trying to approach Ms. Harper for her wealth."
"This bidding just knocked the Bennett family off their pedestal in Olisvine's construction world.Serves them right."
The crowd burst into laughter, their voices echoing around him.
Alexander's fists tightened at his sides as he fixed his glare on Daniela, who walked past him with an air of composure, her steps steady and deliberate. His voice dropped to an icy, measured tone as hespoke."I used to carry guilt for the way I treated you. l wanted to make things right. But I never imagined you'd twist my regret to your advantage in this bidding and make a fool of me. Daniela, from this moment on, we're square!"


Daniela's lips curved into a faint, almost disdainful smile. Her voice carried the same chill as her expression. "Don't overestimate your importance.I was in a good mood after a nap and decided to have a little fun with someone oblivious. If your skills fell short, don't blame me for it. Are you really so easily influenced? Perhaps you're just not cut out for handling greater challenges."


Turning to leave, she suddenly stopped, throwing an amused glance over her shoulder. "If you're truly as principled as you claim, you wouldn't have gone for that minor project. You'd cut ties entirely-with me and Elite Lux. So, what's it going to be? Are you backing out now? The ink isn't dry yet; you still have a chance."


Alexander gripped the documents in his hand tightly,feeling the sting of Daniela's words strike at his pride. He wanted to fire back but found himself unable to utter a single word in response. All he could do was watch as Daniela, her mocking smile lingering, walked away without looking back.


That day, Alexander experienced a level of humiliation unlike anything he'd ever felt before.


Aimlessly drifting out of Elite Lux, Alexander bumped into Richard, who greeted him with the eager energy of someone picking up their kid from school. "So?Did Daniela give you the project?"


Alexander shook his head, his expression steeped in defeat.



"Why not? Didn't you say she gave you two options?If you didn't choose her, shouldn't she havehanded you the contract as the logical outcome?"


Alexander looked up at the towering structure before him and let out a bitter laugh. "This was never about a choice. She just wanted to humiliate me. She still holds a grudge. Daniela, your heart must be made of stone."

 
That night, Alexander was overcome by a severe fever. After hours on an IV drip, he eventually began to recover.
Following the ordeal, he allowed his hair to grow out,adopting an increasingly somber and withdrawn demeanor.
While working on various construction sites,Alexander occasionally caught sight of Daniela. But he never attempted to approach her again.
Instead, he maintained his distance and observed her with a cold, detached expression.
Over time, he found himself spending more and more time with the Harper family, particularly growing closer to Katrina and Joyce.
On bright, sunny afternoons, his gaze often drifted to Joyce's growing belly. One day, he asked, "So,when's the baby coming? Have you decided on the hospital and doctor yet?"
He went as far as arranging for a top-notch medical team to admit Joyce into the hospital an entire month before her due date. Relaxing in her hospital bed the other day, Joyce took a bite of an apple. "Mom, I think Alexander's more excited about this baby than I am. It's like he really wants to be with me."


Katrina narrowed her eyes, trying to decipher Alexander's true intentions.


He seemed genuinely invested in the child's well-being.


Whenever Joyce went in for a checkup, Alexander appeared more nervous about the results than anyone else.


But for anyone suspecting he harbored romantic feelings for Joyce, his actions suggested otherwise.He'd usually show up, sit silently, and hardly say a thing.


Joyce's hopeful smile grew as she continued,"I guess Alexander likes me. And I like him too.Could you talk to Dad? Once the baby is born, we'll get the inheritance, and Alexander can marry me."


Compared to the string of unsuitable suitors Katrina had found for Joyce, Alexander seemed like a far better catch.
###Chapter 132 Wish To Slap His Past Self
Joyce had been waiting to hear from Katrina for quite a while, but no response came.


Munching on an apple, she turned to Katrina with wide-eyed astonishment.


"Mom? What's happening? Don't you want Alexander to be your son-in-law anymore?" Previously,whenever Joyce mentioned Alexander, Katrina would quickly concur with enthusiasm.


"You were always singing his praises, pushing me towards him, right?" Joyce queried, her expression a mix of surprise and bewilderment.


Katrina, meticulously peeling an orange, avoided eye contact, lost in her thoughts.


She understood that Joyce showing any sign of weakness could be exploited by Alexander. It was crucial to be open with her daughter.


Now that Joyce was the sole heiress to the Harper family fortune, they had no reason to feel daunted by anyone.


Empowered by this thought, Katrina's confidence surged. She caught a glimpse of Alexander standing in the doorway from the corner of her eye, a slight smile playing on her lips.


Refocusing on Joyce, she responded, "Alexander was a suitable match previously. However, since he's lost the Elite Lux project, he's no longer at his peak.His renewed interest in you? It's merely because his prospects with Daniela fell through, and now he's recalling your worth."


Joyce's lips puckered in a pout at Katrina's blunt words. "Mom, do you really have to say it that way?"


Katrina remained unapologetic. "I'm merely stating the facts. We are not anyone's backup plan. If he's genuinely interested, he should adhere to the proper channels-a formal proposal, a meeting between both families, and plans for a proper engagement and marriage. Yeah, we're rich, but we're not dumb enough to let anyone screw us over."


Joyce came to understand that Katrina truly had her best interests at heart. She pressed her lips tightly together, choosing not to continue the argument.


With a warm smile, Katrina extended the peeled orange towards Joyce. "You'll be a mother soon.If Alexander truly cares, it's time our families had dinner together and discussed a date for the wedding."


Just then, Katrina's attention snapped to the doorway, her expression unreadable. "Alexander?How long have you been there? I didn't notice you.Did you catch all that?"


Joyce stole a timid glance at Alexander.


His hair, styled in a rebellious, slightly tousled manner, was just the way she liked.


His silence lingered uncomfortably long, prompting Joyce to coax him, "Alexander, please, say something. Don't you see what my mother is getting at? She wants us to set a wedding date."


Alexander understood the implication behind Katrina's words perfectly. Yet, he remained silent,casting a brief, telling look at Joyce's swollen belly before he turned away and strode towards the doctor's office.


Both Katrina and Joyce were rooted to the spot,utterly speechless.


"What does that mean?" Joyce turned to Katrina,confusion clouding her features.


Katrina, equally baffled, speculated that perhaps Alexander's pride was getting in the way of his response.



Meanwhile, Richard, who was privy to Alexander's intentions, knew precisely the turmoil unfolding in Alexander's mind.


Alexander had taken a significant blow because of the failed bidding, yet certain matters still needed to be addressed. "I know you're biding your time until Joyce's baby is born. Just when the surgery is about to take place,you'll spring the news on Katrina. You'll tell her that Daniela's breakthrough research can save the child without any surgical intervention, promising a complete recovery. Daniela might falter at first, but she'll come through eventually. Is this your grand plan? To make her feel disgusted as payback?"


Richard's deduction was not merely a guess.It was a conclusion drawn the instant Alexander showed an unusual interest in Joyce's unborn child. "But think this through, Alexander. This maneuver willirreparably fracture your relationship with Daniela.You could have feigned ignorance, yet you opt formanipulation. How does alienating her benefit you orBennett Group? lf Daniela were a nobody, i'd say takeyour shot, But here in Olisvine, she's a force toreckon with. Cross her, and do you really think she'l!let you walk away unscathed? And let's not overlookthe fact that Daniela has harbored feelings for youover all these years. Her love isn't fleeting. lf youproceed with this plan, you'll extinguish any hope for reconciliation. Can you live with that?"
Alexander kept his mouth shut, but Richard's irritation boiled over. There was no way he was putting up with this crap.
The fallout from this could be absolutely devastating.Thinking about the golden opportunities they had blown made him wish he could travel back in time just to beat some sense into his dumbass self.
###Chapter 133 Cutting Ties With Daniela
Richard had always considered himself adept at gauging people's true nature, yet somehow, he had completely overlooked that Daniela was a top-tier CEO.



Now, watching one lucrative opportunity after another slip through his fingers left him restless,haunting his nights with wakefulness.


Richard gazed at Alexander, his expression a mix of urgency and frustration, silently wishing he could swap places with him and plead at Daniela's feet.


"Self-respect? Pride? What value do they hold nowadays?" Richard's voice escalated with intensity."In the absence of wealth, they're worthless!Alexander, I'm not compelling you to act, but I urge you to consider. Do you truly wish to sever all ties with Daniela permanently?" In the days leading up to this conversation, Richard had briefly visited Joyce in the hospital.


Pregnancy had intensified her cravings, rounding out her formerly sharp features.


Richard found himself unable to remain by her side for more than a few minutes, quickly excusing himself.


In his eyes, Joyce couldn't hold a candle to Daniela.


"Try it one more time," Richard suggested, his tone carrying a subtle edge of expectation. "Do you realize why Daniela managed to accomplish so much? Back in the day, when she pursued you, she was unconcerned about appearances. Regardless of the gossip or judgment, she never allowed it to deter her. Reflect on her past actions towards you. Isn't there a lesson to be learned from her perseverance?And consider this-perhaps Daniela is putting you through a test. With her newfound wealth, it's natural for her to be more guarded. Can't you see that?"


The cold detachment in Alexander's face slowly gave way to something softer. His gaze turned to Richard, a brief pause hanging in the air before he finally asked, "Really?"


Richard, although thrilled by the conversation,managed to maintain a composed demeanor.



He nodded solemnly and responded, "Absolutely.And it's not just me-others are saying the same.Just the other day, a friend of mine mentioned that Daniela, now positioned quite high up, might be using these tactics to test people's true intentions.He even asked me to pass on a message: don't get discouraged."



Richard, having played the role of Alexander's father for so many years, was well aware of his son's Achilles' heel-his pride. To Alexander, his self-esteem was paramount, overshadowing all else.


The deliberate choice of Richard's words seemed to unravel Alexander's pent-up frustration.


Rooted to the spot, Alexander clenched his fists tightly, then slowly uncurled them. "Alright. I'll give it another try." A flicker of relief passed through Richard's eyes.


Alexander's demeanor stiffened abruptly, his voice sharpening as he went on, "If Daniela still doesn't give a damn about my efforts, then screw her-l won't hold back anymore!"


Richard responded, "Don't worry. After the distance you've put between you and Daniela, she's bound to have noticed that she upset you last time. Plus, we secured that small bid, right? There's a project progress meeting this afternoon.It's not really tied to us, but you should go anyway. It's the perfect opportunity to see Daniela and break the awkward tension."


Pausing for a moment, Richard nervously rubbed his nose.




If Alexander delayed any longer, Daniela might erase him from her thoughts completely.


With her wealth at her disposal, she had the freedom to choose from a wide array of suitors-kind-hearted,passionate, and untamed alike. She truly had the world at her feet. If Alexander didn't take actions, he would be forgotten by her.


As Alexander headed upstairs to choose a suit,Richard let out a sigh of relief.


His attention then turned to his buzzing phone.Katrina's name lit up the screen. Without a second thought, he swiped to decline the call.


What a load of crap!


Joyce was a complete wreck, yet Katrina still dared to consider marrying her to Alexander?


Utterly pathetic!


Meanwhile, at the hospital, Katrina let out a laugh tinged with disbelief as her call was dismissed."Really? What's so terrible about the Bennett family now? Oh, so I'm the one groveling to them now, is that it?"


Caiden, seated beside her, didn't look up from his phone, where he was absorbed in the latest financial headlines.


The growth of Elite Lux in recent months had been impressive, and Caiden found comfort in the figures dancing on his screen.


Right now, nothing else was of consequence. His primary concern was preserving the Harper family fortune, ensuring Katrina didn't fritter it away as Joyce's wedding gift.


By maintaining control over their assets, he could secure a future where Daniela, endowed with wealth,would ensure his comfort in his later years.
###Chapter 134 Whatever It Took To Secure Her Child's Future
Katrina cast a sidelong glance at Caiden's detached expression, her eyes drifting to his phone screen,where a photo of Daniela was prominently displayed.


She stayed quiet for a moment, the faintest flicker of calculation flashing in her gaze.


Since their last heated exchange, Caiden had become a different man-aloof and disengaged,barely sparing a word for her or Joyce.


Even their moments of intimacy had lost their warmth;he would pull away almost immediately.


It was obvious that he had some hidden agenda.


His once palpable excitement for Joyce's pregnancy had faded,replaced with a cold indifference.


Could he be shifting his reliance to Daniela instead？  That simply wouldn't do.


Katrina had spent decades scheming for the Harper family fortune. There was no way she would let Daniela swoop in and claim the prize.


She needed Caiden to view Daniela as untrustworthy and realize that she and Joyce were the ones he could truly depend on.


Katrina's lips curved into a measured smile as she ladled soup into Joyce's bowl and settled beside her."Joyce, have you given any thought to the baby's last name?"


Without missing a beat, Joyce replied, "Of course,it'll be Bennett. This child will be with me when l marry. It's my first, and you can see how much Alexander already cares about it. He'll adore this baby just as much."


That had been Katrina's plan all along.


Joyce would marry into the Bennett family, taking the Harper family's assets with her. Over time, those assets would pass to her child. However, as the Bennett family's influence waned,Katrina began rethinking the inheritance and the child's role in it.


"The child should carry the Harper name instead,"she proposed.


Joyce and Caiden both turned to Katrina, startled by her suggestion.


Katrina's smile softened as her eyes settled on Joyce. "Joyce, you're not Caiden's biological daughter. It was me who brought you into this family.But all these years, he's done nothing but treat you with kindness. Raising a child is no small task, and you owe him your gratitude. Without his support, you wouldn't have the comfortable life you enjoy today.Do you see that?"


Joyce blinked, confused by the sudden change in Katrina's stance.


"When I first joined the Harper family, I made a promise to Daniela, in front of the media, that l wouldn't have any more children to avoid upsetting her. But over time, Caiden has regretted that  decision, and Peyton has voiced his displeasure,saying our branch of the family has lost its importance. Caiden has always cared for you, Joyce.So, I propose that this child takes the Harper name.It would become a part of the Harper legacy,strengthening the family, and also show gratitude to Caiden for all he's done for you. What do you think?"
Joyce was left speechless, her mind racing. When she glanced at Caiden, his eyes sparkled wit hope and happiness. After a moment of thought, she finally nodded."Alright."  recent days. "Mom, does the baby really need to take the Harper name?"


Katrina scoffed lightly, "Silly girl, what does a last name really mean? If changing it can guarantee a life of wealth and privilege for both you and your child,does the name really matter?"


She let out a cold laugh. "Caiden is selfish and manipulative. If we don't play our cards carefully, do you think he'll willingly hand over the family fortune to you and the baby? Now that you've agreed to let the child take the Harper name, he's thrilled. Daniela won't even cross his mind anymore. People like Caiden only care about securing their future, not the welfare of others."



As Katrina spoke, a gleam of malice flashed in her eyes.


"Joyce, no matter what last name the child carries,they'll always be yours. Blood ties can never be broken, and you must hold on to that truth for the rest of your life. Caiden doesn't grasp this, which is why he turned his back on Daniela. Listen-whether  the child is a boy or a girl, the most important thing is that they respect and follow your lead. Names,loyalty, and affection from others are mere distractions. When you grow old, do you think your child will reject you because of a last name? A wealthy child ensures a secure future for you.Look at my mother. She's reaping the benefits of having a daughter like me. Who wouldn't envy her?"
Joyce nodded, only partly grasping the full weight of the words.
She had to make sure the baby lived a life of wealth and privilege. She would go to any lengths necessary to ensure their future was secure.
###Chapter 135 The Harper Family's Child

Later that day, Caiden strode into the hospital with a lunchbox and a hefty book of baby names.
He declared his mission to pick the perfect name for the newest addition to the Harper family.
Seated next to him, Katrina offered a warm smile as she playfully fed him slices of orange. "Joyce is truly selfless, isn't she? To forgo her right to pass on her own family name and instead let the baby have yours? Honey, should her in-laws ever treat her unjustly over this decision, you mustn't overlook it."
Behind his reading glasses, Caiden thumbed through the book, shaking his head firmly. "That's not going to happen. Joyce is doing so much for this family. If anyone even thinks of mistreating her, I'll be the first to defend her."
Katrina exchanged a sly glance with Joyce, her lifted eyebrows and mischievous grin hinting at quiet triumph. "Exactly my point. It's clear you cherish Joyce above all. And think about Daniela and her accomplishments. Would she really risk a fallout with her future in-laws just to ensure the Harper name lives on? Yet here is Joyce, showing her loyalty to you without hesitation."
Caiden didn't glance away from the book, his voice cool and composed. "Trust me, I haven't forgotten where my loyalties are."
Reassured, Katrina rose to go to the bathroom. By the time she returned, Caiden was already in the hallway, lost in lively conversation with his friends over the phone.
Caiden was still gripping the book tightly. His tone was light, yet a subtle trace of pride colored his words. "Joyce is incredibly dedicated. The baby is hers. There's no need for it to take my surname.Why not hers, right? But you know what her response was? She told me she felt so indebted to me for all the ways I've raised her, more than she could ever repay. She even quipped that had she been born  a boy, she might have changed her surname to mine a long time ago. Now, she insists I should be the one to pick the baby's name personally. I've been poring over this book since dawn and I'm still clueless, so l had to call you. Help me find a name that will bless the child with every possible good fortune!"


Caiden reached out far and wide that afternoon,connecting with nearly everyone he could. His voice resonated down the hallway.


By the time evening fell, the news had spread among all of Caiden's friends and all the patients on the same floor.


Katrina's smirk sharpened, the hint of malice in her expression impossible to miss. Silently, she scoffed to herself, "What an absolute idiot."


Meanwhile, Richard, worried that Alexander might encounter another setback, decided to accompany him in person this time.


Alongside them, several project managers gathered,their spirits high. As they awaited Daniela's arrival, they engaged in light-hearted conversation.


"Marco, this year has been phenomenal for you,hasn't it? You must be seeing some hefty profits from this project," one of them remarked.


Basking in the glow of a deep suntan earned from countless hours outdoors, Marco Pittman flashed a broad smile. His hands, large and calloused from the rigors of construction work, were a testament to his dedication, yet he exuded pride.


"Indeed, we've done quite well financially. It's a rarity to encounter someone like Ms. Harper who genuinely appreciates hard labor. She's always quick to pay and even quicker to lend a hand whenever we're in a bind. There was this one instance when a hurricane was on the approach, and I was concerned about falling behind. I nearly had the team work straight through the storm. However, she personally visited the site and declared she'd extend our deadline by a full week. She remarked that we already put in more than enough effort and refused to push us further.During summer, she ensured we had chilled beverages, and when the cold hit, she didn't hesitate to provide heaters. She even constructed dormitories adjacent to the site for us. Having been in this industry for years, I've yet to meet another leader as fair and compassionate as her. I'll undoubtedly give my all for her!"


Raul Brewer chimed in, "I'mn finally taking a real break this year, too. The project I've been managing just wrapped up, and we passed the inspection yesterday. Ms. Harper has already transferred the final payment. It's a relief-I can face my crew with pride now. You know, with other contracts, payment delays are common, and I often feel embarrassed in front of my team."


The crowvd erupted in hearty laughter.


"Come on, Marco, don't hold out! How much did you make? I heard about your new car. Seems like you're doing quite well for yourself!"


Marco chuckled, his complexion tanned from days in the sun. His eyes sparkled as he flashed a wide,toothy smile. Lifting his hand, he flashed a number with his fingers.
Richard glanced at him, presuming Marco was merely an amateur worker who wouldn't earn much.

However, the moment Richard caught sight of the number Marco displayed, he was stunned into silence.

His mind reeled as if struck by a massive explosion.

###Chapter 136 Blacklisted





Richard tried to smile politely, but it came off forced and uncomfortable. "You really earned that much?"


"What I've earned is nothing compared to what others have made. You know how much Raul earned?" Marco raised his hand, miming a figure.


Richard felt his heart skip a beat as the words hit him. His chest clenched, and for a brief moment,he thought he might faint right there.


He shot a quick glance at Alexander, his voice trembling. "Is that really possible to earn that much?"


Having distanced himself from the business world,Richard only had a general sense of how large these projects were, but he never imagined the profits could reach such astronomical numbers.


Alexander, still involved in business, knew these projects were profitable, but even he hadn't anticipated figures like this. This was more than anything he had ever imagined.


Alexander frowned in disbelief. "Are you sure there's no mistake? Could the profit really be this high?"


"Absolutely," Marco replied with certainty. "Ms.Harper made it perfectly clear. Her company supplies the materials, and her team inspects the construction. Once the inspection passes, we receive payment as agreed."


Alexander squinted, his suspicion growing. "Doesn't that just make you all her employees?"


"In a sense, yes. Ms. Harper mentioned that the industry was once full of fierce competition.Companies would lowball their bids just to secure contracts, leaving little room for profit. As a result,contractors had no choice but to cut corners on materials to make ends meet, wvhich led to subpar construction. By supplying the materials herself, she guarantees quality, while we take care of the work.Once the project meets her expectations, we receive the agreed-upon profit. No one loses, and she gets the quality she demands. It's a win for everyone." Marco gave a thumbs-up, his voice filled with admiration. "Now that's how you make real money.Her vision and bravery-I can't help but admire her!"


Raul nodded eagerly. "Exactly! I even brought some gifts from my hometown today. I'm hoping to thank Ms. Harper in person and ask for more opportunities.Working for a boss like her, it's truly a pleasure."


Richard's eyes darted towards the group of contractors, and it was only then that he noticed the bags they were carrying.


The items weren't costly, nor were they extravagant,just simple, local treasures, but they were meaningful and came from the heart.


Richard looked at Alexander and felt a twinge of regret for arriving without a gift.


He quickly reassured himself. The others had brought gifts, but he had brought Alexander. Surely a living, breathing person like him was worth more than any small tokens.


By the time Daniela arrived, Alexander and Richard had been shuffled into a corner by the eager crowd of contractors.


The crowd surged forward, eager to present their gifts to Daniela.


Richard, shoved and jostled by the crowd,turned to Alexander and muttered, "Is Daniela really this influential now?"


Alexander stood frozen. While he had been focused on Joyce's pregnancy, Daniela had silently built her reputation and earned the admiration of so many.


In contrast to these contractors, hardened by years of grueling labor, Alexander and Richard-accustomed to the comfort of office work-felt completely out of place.


Eventually, when the meeting started, Alexander and Richard had been relegated to the back of the room,sitting on tiny stools in a distant corner.


Richard sat there with a scowl on his face, but despite his frustration, he couldn't bring himself to leave. Pulling Alexander along with him, he stayed glued to his tiny stool, his face contorted in frustration.


Alexander, on the other hand, sat in silence.His eyes remained fixed on Daniela, who stood confidently at the front of the room.


For the first time, he felt an overwhelming sense of distance between them. She had risen to a level he could only dream of reaching.


The realization ate at him, leaving a suffocating weight in his chest.


"Thank you all for your excitement. The reasonI've called you here today is simple. As some of you may have heard, I recently acquired a large plot of land in Kaloria to build an airport."


The room went dead silent in an instant.


Richard's and Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief,their shock clearly visible on their faces.


Richard,convinced he had misunderstood, turned to Alexander, his finger trembling as he pointed to the stage. "What did she just say she's building?"


Alexander's expression stayed tight as he replied,"An airport."


Richard stood frozen, staring at Daniela in utter disbelief.


"All the necessary permits and approvals arealready in place. I've always valued the partnership model we've used in the past. That's why, for this project,I've opted not to go through an open bidding process. Instead, I'll be announcing the companies I've selected to collaborate with. Each of them will receive the airport's construction plans and architectural layout. After reviewing them, please submit your budget proposals. If the pricing is fair,we'll move forward with the collaboration."


Daniela paused, a confident smile playing on her lips."However, there's one thing I want to make clear. At Elite Lux, our guiding principle is..."


Before Daniela could finish, the room erupted in enthusiastic unison as the contractors completed her sentence. "Quality over quantity. Money is no object!"



Richard's jaw dropped. They al know this slogan?


He shot a glance at Alexander, a wave of embarrassment washing over him as he realized they were the only ones in the room who hadn't known.


Daniela's meeting was straightforward and efficient,no frills attached. She then started announcing the companies chosen for the project.


Raul and Marco, both selected, descended from the stage, clutching their blueprints like prized possessions.Despite their age, they were practically bouncing with excitement.


Richard crossed his arms and shot a sideways look at Alexander. "Just wait. Let's see what prime part of the project Daniela has lined up for us."


And so,they continued to wait.


One by one, the blueprints were handed out, and the names of the companies were called. Finally, Daniela announced the meeting was over. But the father and son remained seated, still waiting eagerly. As the crowd started to thin, Richard could no longer keep it in. He stood up quickly, calling out, "Daniela -" Realizing the sharp glances from the crowd, he quickly corrected himself. "Ms. Harper, did you forget about Bennett Group?"
Daniela didn't respond right away. Instead, her assistant took a step forward.
"Bennett Group? I'm terribly sorry. In the last project with Elite Lux, your company's work failed quality inspections three times. So, Elite Lux has decided to cut ties with Bennett Group moving forward."
The room fell deathly silent, and every eye turned to Richard and Alexander.
The words hit them like a slap-sharp and painful,stinging across their faces.
Bennett Group, once seen as the leader of the industry, the epitome of excellence in Olisvine's architectural world, had not only failed inspections three times but was now publicly blacklisted by Elite Lux.


This wasn't just a dent in their reputation; it was an excruciating humiliation.


Richard's body seemed to crumble under the weight of the shame. His vision went hazy, his knees buckled, and he collapsed right there.


The last thing he heard before everything went black was Alexander's frantic voice calling out, "Dad! Dad!"

###Chapter 137 Cedric Has Gone Too Far




After Richard opened his eyes, Alexander gathered Bennett Group's management team responsible for the failed Elite Lux project.


Historically, Bennett Group had been a titan in the industry, orchestrating many high-profile projects and reaping substantial rewards. These managers were accustomed to success and privilege.


Yet, the tables had turned. Daniela's Elite Lux, now a beacon of rigorous oversight, had eclipsed their operations, forcing them to engage with smaller firms they had previously overlooked or assigned only trivial tasks.


This shift in dynamics brewed discontent among them.


In their eyes, Daniela had always been overshadowed by her infatuation with Alexander, appearing more as an obsessive admirer than a formidable professional. This underestimation proved costly. Their sloppy execution led to the project failing three consecutive inspections, resulting in an abrupt and humiliating cancellation.
Mortified by the debacle, they opted against reporting the fiasco up the chain, presuming it tobe a minor blip unlikely to stir significant repercussions given Daniela's past relationship with Alexander.
However, when Alexander brought it up today, it was clear the incident had not faded into obscurity as they had hoped. Caught off-guard, they scrambled to piece together their recollections of the events.
As Richard absorbed their explanations, his expression turned thunderous. Still weak from his recent ailment, the fury coursing through him nearly sent him spiraling into unconsciousness once more.
"It's all Cedric's fault!" one of them declared, his voice laced with desperation to shift the blame. "Our performance has been impeccable! Mr. Bennett,we've mastered this craft over the years. How could we possibly falter on such a basic task? Yet, Cedric
scrutinized every minute aspect. We had adhered strictly to his directives, but he still refused to approve our inspections. It's as though he has it out for us. He even proclaimed, 'Not even your boss can sway my decision!' Can you believe that?"


With his temper flaring, Richard demanded through gritted teeth, "He really said those words?"


The manager paused, a flicker of guilt crossing his features, but he soon affirmed with a decisive nod."Absolutely! That's precisely what he said. He's being a pain in the ass just because he's got a thing for Ms. Harper. What other stupid reason could there be? It's likely eating him alive to see her giving Bennett Group any attention." And now, because of this debacle, there's no chance for Bennett Group and Elite Lux to join forces on any ventures in the future. It's exactly what he desired!"


"That's fucking ridiculous!" Richard, overwhelmed by indignation, slammed his hand against the bed frame. "Cedric has crossed the line!"


He flung aside the bed covers, resolved to rise,but Alexander restrained him, his expression somber."Dad, leave this to me."
As the project managers made their way out of the hospital room, one asked, "You really think this is going to work?"
"Shut the hell up and just keep going!"
After all, Bennett Group wasn't stupid enough to challenge Cedric head-on. Pinning the blame on him was far more convenient.
Richard, his emotions simmering, confronted Alexander. "We can recover lost money, but Daniela is irreplaceable. If you have any courage as a man,you'll fight to win her back."
Gritting his teeth, Alexander stormed out, his mind set on confrontation.
His first destination was Phillips Group, but Cedric was nowhere to be found.
Next, he rushed to the bustling construction site,only to discover Cedric had just departed.  Growing more agitated, Alexander headed straight for Daniela's place.
There, he saw Lillian engaged in conversation with Cedric.
With a thunderous expression, Alexander approached and pointed accusingly at Lillian. "Stay out of this, Lillian. Cedric, we need to talk-now!"
Lillian's brow furrowed, piecing together the reason behind Alexander's urgent pursuit.
She internally critiqued his character, noting how men like Alexander often shirked responsibility and pointed fingers when things fell apart, expecting the world to revolve around them.
Pathetic losers like him did nothing but exist and piss people off.
Before she could voice her thoughts, Cedric intervened with a raised hand,silencing her.
He told Lillian, "If Daniela arrives, please tell her I'm caught up with some pressing business issues but will meet up with you both at the restaurant later Then, he excused himself and followed Alexander.
###Chapter 138 A Beating




Alexander marched forward, his anger silent but undeniable. He made his way to the top floor of the hotel across the street.


Behind him, Cedric pulled out his phone and quickly typed a brief message, sending the location to his assistant.



"Deliver a new shirt to this place."


After slipping the phone back into his pocket, he shrugged off his suit jacket, letting it fall onto a nearby chair.


"Cedric, you've decided to take Daniela from me,haven't you?" Alexander's gaze was icy, his tone slicing through the air, and his whole presence radiated hostility.


As the last slivers of sunlight disappeared, Alexander stood in the chilly evening wind. His hair, disheveled and tousled by the breeze, gave him a menacing, almost sinister look.
In contrast, Cedric stood composed in a crisp white shirt and tailored trousers, his sharp features highlighted by the cool night air. "Yes," he responded, his voice blunt and without a second thought.
Alexander's eyes narrowed to dangerous slits, his gaze cutting through Cedric with the force of a blade. "So, you're confessing it then? You want Daniela!"
Cedric, with his hands tucked into his pockets, met Alexander's stare with equal intensity. "Do I really need to spell it out? Isn't it clear?"
He wasn't a fool. If he didn't have feelings for Daniela, why would he keep going out of his way to help her? He wasn't some reckless playboy. If he didn't love her,why would he keep chasing after her?
Cedric could easily defend his actions. Aside from being a little shy around Daniela, his reputation as a powerful figure spoke for itself. Alexander's chest rose and fell with his mounting rage. "So it's true. You intentionally undermined Bennett Group during the inspections? Cedric, you're nothing but a conniving,manipulative bastard!"


Cedric chuckled darkly, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Alexander, I honestly can't fathom how someone like you managed to make it to the top in this industry. I'm not here to teach you a lesson, nor do I owe you any kind of explanation. But let me be perfectly clear-you can kiss any future involvement in Daniela's projects goodbye."


Bennett Group, with their shoddy projects that crumbled with the smallest push, had the nerve to call themselves industry leaders?


"Cedric!" Alexander bellowed, his voice breaking under the force of his anger. "So, you're set on opposing me,are you?"


Cedric answered with cold certainty, "Yes. What are you going to do about it?"


Alexander hadn't anticipated such a blunt and unapologetic reply. His breath quickened as his anger surged. He was seething, completely and uncontrollably furious. But beneath the rage, an unsettling feeling began to creep in, gnawing at him from the inside.
This was Cedric-the man who, besides Daniela,ruled the city's business landscape without question.
Was it wise to make Cedric an enemy?
Could an all-out clash hurt Bennett Group's prospects?
And most importantly, did he stand a chance of winning?
At that moment, Alexander felt a pang of regret for acting on impulse.
He had rushed in, fueled by raw emotion, without thinking things through, while Cedric stood calm,composed, and unfazed.
Cedric's icy gaze met Alexander's,filled with indifference and scorn.
He'd dealt with men like Alexander before-those who thrived on intimidating the vulnerable but fell apart when confronted with true strength.


Cedric smirked against the cold wind on the rooftop.Before Alexander could even respond, Cedric swung his fist and delivered a punishing blow straight to Alexander's face.


Alexander took a shaky step back, struggling to keep himself upright. He wiped his nose roughly, then stopped to stare at the blood on his hand."Cedric Phillips!"


Cedric chuckled, his voice dripping with mockery."I'm right here."


"Cedric! I'll kill you!"


The rooftop descended into utter chaos.


Dust swirled in the howling wind, mixing with the sickening sound of fists pounding into skin and bone.The punches kept coming, hard and fast, each one landing with brutal force.


Alexander's cries echoed through the night, gradually fading into the biting cold air.
Cedric's assistant reached the rooftop.
He found Cedric standing there, calm and collected,as poised as ever. But his sleeves had some blood stains.
"Sir, your..." His words trailed off as his eyes fell on Alexander,lying unconscious on the rooftop.
Cedric unbuttoned his bloodstained shirt and tossed it aside, slipping into the fresh one without sparing a glance at Alexander."WelI, I'm off for dinner."
The assistant stood frozen, his thoughts racing. He had known for some time that Cedric had been eager to put Alexander in his place, but this?
He stole one last look at Alexander.
Was this really necessary for Cedric to do?
Alexander's face was so swollen and bruised that it was barely recognizable. Would he need surgery to repair this? Cedric adjusted his cuffs before adding, "Call an ambulance. Having someone die here isn't good for business."
With that, he bent down, grabbed his suit jacket,shook it out as though brushing off unseen dust,and put it on. He didn't spare another glance before walking off.
The dinner was already buzzing with conversation,the dishes being served and the Elite Lux team in high spirits when Cedric walked in.
Everyone's gaze turned to him, as they admired the sharp and polished look of his tailored suit.
Daniela, picking at a small appetizer, followed their gaze and glanced at Cedric.
She watched him in silence for a brief moment,then lowered her eyes and went back to her meal, her expression impossible to read.
Cedric's heart skip a beat.
The team,well-acquainted with Cedric, greeted him with casual banter. "Cedric, weren't you with Lillian earlier? What took you so long?"
Cedric grabbed a drink from the table and poured it into Daniela's glass. He smiled faintly and answered,
"Got caught up with something. It took longer than l thought."
The question had been lighthearted, and the team shifted to other subjects.
As Cedric adjusted his suit jacket, preparing to take it off, Daniela's voice suddenly came from beside him."Lillian mentioned you went back to the office."
Cedric froze in place.
Her voice was light, almost indifferent, as if it were a mere comment with no weight.
For some reason, he couldn't bring himself to look at her. His hand, which had been resting on his jacket,slowly dropped to his side.
Desperately trying to mask his discomfort, he selected a dish for Daniela and offered with a smile, great. You should try it."
Daniela gave him a quick glance and a slight nod but didn't say a word.
Cedric's composure faltered. He awkwardly fumbled with his utensils, almost knocking over the dish in front of him.
As the meal went on, he kept serving Daniela, but she ate in silence, offering no feedback. Still, Cedric couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that hung over him.
###Chapter 139 A Man Under His Wife's Thumb
Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Is this really such a big deal? You know, if you two ever tie the knot, you'll be a hen-pecked husband, Cedric. All this drama just because you went back to the office? Keep this up and you'll shatter that aloof, invincible persona everyone admires!"


Cedric chuckled, shaking his head. "Persona? I've never cared about that."



Just as Lillian was about to reply, Cedric turned to Daniela. "Alright, alright, I admit it-I didn't go back to the office; I had something else to take care of.Please, forgive me this time.I promise, no more lies."


Daniela gave him a skeptical look, her eyes dropping to his hand. "Were you in a fight? Your hand looks hurt."



Lillian leaned in, her curiosity escalating. "Oh wow you're right."


Cedric, the epitome of composure and precision,had gotten into a brawl? It seemed out of character, but then again, considering his often cold and distant demeanor with others, maybe it wasn't so far-fetched after all.


Cedric embodied contradiction, a blend of extremes that rarely made sense.


Around Daniela, he was gentle and attentive, yet around others, he was like a simmering volcano on the verge of eruption.


Cedric was oblivious to the fresh scrape marring his knuckles until Daniela pointed it out. He offered a feeble, uncomfortable grin, tucking his hand out of sight behind his back.


"Why don't you head down to the lobby and have the manager get you some iodine for that?" Daniela suggested, her tone laced with concern.


Cedric was about to dismiss the fuss with a shake of his head, but the sight of Daniela's earnest  expression halted him. He rose and said, "Alright, I'll do that."


Lillian, unable to suppress her amusement, leaned towards Daniela. "You know, you two really have the whole old married couple act down pat."


Upon returning, Cedric paused in the doorway,his gaze landing on Daniela, who was quietly sampling the dishes he had placed on her plate.


He watched her for a spell, a surge of simple happiness bubbling within him. He didn't understand why he loved her so deeply.


Shaking off his reverie, Cedric finally proceeded to his chair and resumed his place.


Daniela said lightly, "You really should avoid getting into fights, you know."


Cedric's face softened, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "How about a deal? Be my girlfriend, and not only will I avoid fights, but I'll hang on your every word and devote myself entirely to you," he whispered in a voice that no one else could hear. Lillian cast a quick glance at Cedric and asked Daniela, "What is wrong with him?"


Daniela shook her head. "I'm not sure. He seems to be in a world of his own."



At the same time, Alexander was wheeled into the emergency room. His return to consciousness was marked by agonizing screams of pain that echoed through the sterile corridors.



Richard arrived moments later and was met with a harrowing sight: Alexander's face, a horrifying tableau of bruises and swelling, distorted beyond recognition. He let out a heart-wrenching cry.


Their cries resonated through the hospital,compelling nurses, doctors, and even other patients to peer into the room, curious about the source of such distress.



They were met with the grim visage of Alexander,sitting on the bed, his features battered and raw.


That evening, the incident captured the attention of the media. Reporters descended on the hospital, eager for a sensational story. However, Alexander was in no state to confess that he had been mercilessly beaten by a single individual who had nonchalantly continued his evening as if nothing had occurred.


The thought of acknowledging such a humiliating defeat was mortifying.


The turmoil within him mounted, pushing Alexander to the brink of madness.


As the room emptied and quiet settled once more,he dragged himself to the mirror.


Confronting his reflection, he was rooted to the spot,the severity of his injuries mirroring the turmoil inside him.



Every inch was marred by bruises and swelling,turning his features into those of a man who'd suffered a grave calamity.


Now, he realized the source of the excruciating pain that shot through his skin with even the slightest movement. "Cedric is envious because Daniela preferred my looks! That's why he targeted my face!"


Richard found himself utterly speechless.


At the doorway, their secretary asked, "Should we call the police?"


Richard whirled around, his eyes blazing as he fixed the secretary with a stern glare. "Call the police?Have you lost your senses? Just look at his face! If word of this gets out, it'll be said that the president of Bennett Group was assaulted. Do you want to tarnish our company's image?"


The secretary stood there, dumbfounded. Cedric was stepping on their dignity, and yet, their primary concern was the company's image? This was not the Richard and Alexander he knew.


Usually, they wielded their power ruthlessly, lording it over those beneath them. Only last month, Richard had visited a construction site and a mere speck of dust had settled on his suit. Infuriated, he had demanded that the worker responsible compensate him with 100, 000 dollars. That amount represented a whole year's worth of dedication and labor for the employee.


The man had sunk to his knees, pleading for forgiveness with desperate eyes, yet Richard remained unmoved, his resolve as cold as steel.


The unfortunate worker had driven himself to illness,tirelessly gathering every penny he could muster.


And now? Alexander's features were so brutally marred that his own mother wouldn't recognize him.Yet here they were, forced to digest this bitter pill of defeat without so much as a whimper of resistance.


The secretary, witnessing the scene, couIdn't suppress a twisted sense of satisfaction mingled with curiosity. Who held such sway that they could compel such a complete and humiliating retreat?


With a dismissive gesture, Richard signaled for the secretary to leave.


Once the door clicked shut behind him, Richard's gaze hardened as he addressed Alexander. "Don't hold it against me for not involving the police. You're aware, just as I am, that our family's clout has waned.Since we lost the partnership with Elite Lux, we're not the titan we once were. Crossing Cedric now would spell our doom in Olisvine. For the company's sake,you must endure this."


Alexander's face, swollen and distorted from the assault, betrayed no emotion. Yet, beneath that battered exterior, a fierce hatred simmered,threatening to boil over.


Gesturing towards his disfigured face, he snarled "Dad! Cedric didn't just attack me-he wrecked my face. He's envious because Daniela shows interest in me, so he targeted every strike at my face. Now, with my face like this, how will I ever win Daniela's affection back? And what about my standing? Cedric reduced me to nothing. IfI don't retaliate or even report him, what will others think of me once they hear? They'll call me a goddamn coward! A spineless loser! How the hell am | supposed to lead when everyone thinks I've got no balls?"



Richard remained silent for a moment, his expression unreadable. He sat there, contemplating deeply as Alexander's anger simmered.


With a sigh, he finally suggested, "Listen, here's what you need to do-go to Daniela. This chaos all began with her, didn't it? Demand that Cedric apologize to you. But not just a simple apology-he must also handle all your medical bills."


A sly, calculating gleam flickered in Richard's eyes."And while you're at it, tell Daniela that if she really wants to resolve this situation, she must give us the airport project. That will be the cost of our silence." 
###Chapter 140 Caiden's Plan





Alexander's anger had cooled somewhat."Do you really think this will work?"


Richard replied, "I think it will. Daniela used to care so much about you, even when you were cold towards her. Now that you're in this condition,how could she still be angry? She's your ex-wife. She can't just ignore you. If you land the airport project,there will be plenty of chances to be with her. Once she sees your vulnerability, reconciliation will follow.Alexander,you need to look at the bigger picture.Often, misfortune opens doors. If getting beaten up is what it takes to win her back, then it's worth it.Don't wait for the doctor now. Go straight to Daniela.She has private doctors. Let her take care of you and show her that Cedric is nothing but a brute-completely unworthy of her trust."


Alexander lowered his gaze, uncertainty clouding his expression. "Are you sure, Dad?" He couldn't deny how distant and cold Daniela hnad become toward him lately.


More often than not, Daniela had looked at him as though he were nothing more than a piece of trash.


He no longer had the same confidence he used to share with her.


Not to mention his face was now so disfigured it was almost unrecognizable.


He dreaded facing Daniela in his current state.


"Oh come on, why wouldn't it work?" Richard said firmly. "Alexander, Daniela has loved you for all these years. If it were just about appearances, that kind of love wouldn't have lasted this long."


Alexander nodded slowly. "You're right! Daniela loves me for who I truly amn!"


Standing outside the door, the secretary caught snippets of the conversation. He let out a heavy sigh and closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to shut out the absurdity of it all. Alexander certainly knew how to flatter himself, didn't he?


Upstairs in the obstetrics department, Katrina came across the news about Alexander's beating.


She had just been informed that both Alexander and Richard were in the hospital downstairs.


She cast a quick glance at Alexander's face. What she saw unsettled her, leaving a lingering sense of unease. With a final, apprehensive glance,she made her way upstairs.


She told Caiden what she had witnessed. "You should've seen it, Caiden. Alexander's face was a complete disaster! It looked like a truck had just run over him."



Caiden chuckled at her description, amused but unable to fully picture it in his mind.


He wasn't concerned about Alexander or who Joyce would eventually end up with.


His focus was elsewhere. After secretly consulting the doctor, he discovered that the child Joyce was expecting was a boy.


The news brought him a sense of satisfaction, and he stayed up all night, too elated to sleep.


But this time, he knew better than to rush. He would move forward with careful consideration.


He casually flipped open the book of names,skimming through its pages. "I spoke with the doctor today," he said to Katrina, his tone casual. "Joyce's due date is next month."


Katrina nodded in agreement. "Yes, that's right," she replied, her gaze drifting to Caiden, whose face was partially hidden in the shadows.


Caiden continued, "I've chosen a name for the child -Jack. He'll stay with me after he's born. As for Joyce, I'll find her a suitable match and give her 30million as a wedding gift, considering I'm her stepfather. The rest of the assets-the company,real estate, investments, and even the villa we live in-will go to Jack."


At first, Katrina frowned slightly upon hearing this. Thirty million seemed like a trivial amount for Joyce.


But as Caiden explained further, her expression softened. What difference did it make? The child was still young, and the assets would eventually be under Joyce's control, regardless.


"Of course, the child is far too young to handle this kind of wealth. I intend to keep it under my control until he turns fifteen. Until then, it will remain in my hands," he added.


In that instant, Katrina grasped Caiden's true intentions.



Considering the child's delicate health, Caiden didn't want to take the risk of transferring the inheritance too soon.



What if something were to happen to him?


By the time the child reached fifteen, he would have spent enough time under Caiden's roof to naturally form a bond with him, not Joyce.


This approach would ensure that the boy belonged to Caiden entirely, with very little connection to Joyce.





Katrina forced a smile, her mind whirling. For the moment, she chose to go along with it, deciding to handle the finer details later when she had more time to think.



As she absorbed this, Caiden retrieved a folded document from inside the book-a contract that seemed to have been prepared long before.


"I had a lawyer prepare this agreement," he said."It states that Joyce will marry once she's fully recovered. If we can't find a suitable match, she can live in our city-center apartment."


Katrina stared at Caiden in disbelief. She hadn't expected him to be so ruthlessly calculating.


Caiden went on, "You don't have to worry.The Harper family will always be Joyce's home. I'll continue managing the company as usual. Whether Daniela and I fix things or not, as her father,she can't turn me down if I request a project. You've seen how large Elite Lux's projects are. If I put in the effort, Jack's inheritance will grow immensely. Daniela is close to Cedric, and as her father, I have leverage.Cedric will treat me with respect and wouldn't dare refuse me resources. With connections to both Daniela and Cedric-the two dominant forces in Olisvine-the Harper family will only thrive."


He paused for a moment before adding, "If you think this plan works, persuade Joyce to sign the agreement. After all, she's the child's mother, and she'll want the best for him. I'm not doing this for myself. You both know Daniela wouldn't support us if the child remained too closely tied to Joyce. This is for his future. He'll understand when he's older. And for now, I'll thank you on his behalf."


The hospital room felt unbearably cold, as though winter had seeped into every corner.


Katrina shivered, realizing how carefully Caiden had planned everything.


So,he had always been aware of how she treated Daniela, yet he had chosen to overlook it-because it didn't serve his interests, he simply turned a blind  eye.
Now, every action he took was driven by self-interest, leaving no space for mistakes or second thoughts.  Katrina felt as though she had been tossed into the frigid waters of a frozen lake, the biting cold sinking deep into her bones, draining her of all warmth and leaving her numb to the core.
Caiden gave her a small smile and said, "I know Joyce respects you. Go talk to her. After all, I'm not her real father. If I bring it up, she'll probably just resent me."
###Chapter 141 Our Past



By the time the doctor reached Alexander's hospital room,Alexander was no longer there.



Richard sat in the room, a smug grin plastered across his face. He was certain that, this time, Daniela would feel pity for Alexander. Once she gave in to her sympathy, the future of their family's wealth and status would be secured without question.



The doctor shot Richard a look filled with confusion and disbelief. He couldn't make sense of it. Richard's son had been left battered and bruised, yet instead of rushing to call the police, the man just sat there,grinning as if nothing had happened.


At Elite Lux, Daniela was hard at work preparing for an important event. She was so absorbed in her tasks that when Alexander entered her office, she didn't even acknowledge his presence.



It wasn't until she paused to sip some water that she finally looked up.



Startled,she instinctively threw the cup at his face.



Alexander had lingered at the doorway for what felt like an eternity, growing more and more humiliated as  she stayed completely unaware of his presence.



Just as he was about to put on a pitiful expression to draw her attention, a cup flew towards him.



He was so stunned that he couldn't even react in time to avoid it.



"Ouch!"



The pain was unbearable.



Daniela instantly realized how forcefully it had hit him.



She could even hear a sharp crack-the unmistakable sound of a nose breaking.



Blood began gushing from Alexander's nose,running down his face and dripping onto the floor.



As the cup clattered to the floor, Daniela finally got a clear look at him. Her face drained of color, her stomach twisting in shock. "Who the hell are you?"



Just as Alexander was about to shout in pain, her question struck him silent.



He struggled to shape his face into an expression of sorrow,hoping to appear pitiful enough to win her sympathy,but no matter how hard he tried, his efforts fell flat. To Daniela, the figure standing before her was hardly recognizable.


His face was a grotesque mess, swollen and bruised beyond any hope of recognition.



"Who are you?" she repeated.


Alexander pressed his hand to his bleeding nose, his voice muffled as he rasped, "It's mne! Alexander!"


Daniela blinked, her face frozen in sheer disbelief. Her first instinct was to grab her phone and call the police.After all, this disfigured man could only be here to extort her for money.



Just as she reached for her phone, Alexander stumbled forward, clutching his nose, and shouted,"Don't be scared! I look like this because Cedric beat me up!"



Daniela's thoughts flashed to Cedric-the small cut she had seen earlier on the back of his hand. Slowly,she lowered the phone.



Alexander stood there, waiting for her response, but Daniela remained silent. Finally, unable to keep his frustration in check, he snapped, "Aren't you going to ask why Cedric hit me?" Daniela barely hesitated before answering,"If Cedric hit you, there must've been a reason."


Alexander froze, stunned by her response. Clenching his teeth, he hissed, "That's not it! He..."


He wanted to shout, "Cedric likes you!" But he bit his tongue. Saying it out loud would only end up doing Cedric a favor, and that was the last thing he wanted.


After a brief pause, he changed tactics. "Cedric has been sabotaging Bennett Group during the project inspections. I confronted him to get answers, and what did he do? He attacked me!"



Daniela raised an eyebrow, her expression becoming sharper. "So, let me get this straight-you actually went to confront him?"



Alexander gave a stiff nod."Yes."


"And instead of answers, you ended up getting yourself beaten?"



Alexander balled his fists tightly, his tone filled with resentment."Yes."



"And now, you're too scared to retaliate because it might hurt your company, so you've come running to me, expecting me to step in and handle it for you?"Daniela summarized flatly, getting straight to the point. Alexander's chest tightened, the sting of humiliation hitting him hard. It was the painful truth, but hearing it spelled out by Daniela, along with her icy, mocking look, only deepened his embarrassment.


"Alexander, even children understand that when you lose a fight, you own up to it. Are you seriously telling me you're worse than a child? Or did you come here to play the victim? Hoping I'd feel sorry for you?"Daniela's tone was filled with disbelief. "Do you seriously think I'd still feel the same way about you?That I'd protect you no matter the circumstances?Alexander, if that's what you're counting on, then you clearly have no clue about how women think. Let me be blunt-any woman who sees you walk in with a face like that would lose every last ounce of sympathy she might've had."



Daniela grabbed a mirror from her desk and held it out to him. "Here, take a long, hard look. Why not pay Joyce a visit instead? See,I'm shallow, Alexander.I can't handle a face like that. But Joyce? She'd probably embrace you likea long-lost treasure."



Alexander's bruised and battered face darkened with humiliation, the sting of her ridicule cutting deeper than the physical pain.



Standing there, he felt utterly defeated,wondering how he had been naive enough to believe that Daniela might still harbor any feelings for him, even in his current state.



He turned to the mirror, his swollen and bruised face staring back at him like a cruel reminder of his downfall.Shame,raw and overwhelming,clawed at him for the first time in his life. A fleeting wish crossed his mind-that the floor might split open and swallow him,sparing him from the weight of his disgrace.


Yet, despite the heartbreak crushing his spirit, he didn't walk away. He remained rooted in place, his gaze fixed on Daniela with the silent desperation of a man grasping at his final lifeline. "Daniela, is there truly no chance for us? Just a few months ago, things were okay, weren't they?"



Daniela let out a sharp breath, clearly struggling to believe what she was hearing. "That was all in your head. Now, do yourself a favor and get to the hospital.While they're patching up your face, maybe ask them to take a look at your brain. Or better yet, see a psychiatrist. Who knows? You might have some delusional disorder. If you're really unwell, get help.Don't let it go untreated."



Alexander stood motionless, the ache of humiliation piercing him more painfully than any wound could.



He had come here, clinging to a hope of salvaging what they once had. But her icy indifference shattered him completely.



"Daniela, do you truly have no respect for what we shared? Not even the slightest?" he asked, his hand slowly dropping from his face.
###Chapter 142 You Won



Alexander watched as Daniela nodded without a moment's hesitation.



It felt as though she had never loved him in the first place.


In that moment, the cold wind brushed against his face, sharp and cruel, as the sound of his heart breaking echoed loudly within him.



Women were the most unforgiving,cold-hearted creatures!



Alexander was caught between pain and a strange sense of relief. At least when Daniela had been chasing him desperately, hehadn't shown her an ounce of mercy.



If he had let his guard down, he would've been a complete fool by now. 2



Someone like Daniela, so heartless and calculating,wasn't worthy of love.



She didn't deserve it!



His fists clenched, his face twisted by rage, Alexander shot Daniela a chilling glare. "Fine, Daniela. You've got courage. Don't come crawling back later!"



Without a flicker of hesitation, Daniela nodded again,her voice steady and uninterested. "Alright."


He had anticipated her to second-guess herself, to show a hint of regret-but there was nothing.


He gazed at her composed, emotionless face, and something inside him shattered even further.


His voice rose, now filled with fury and shame."One day, you'll be begging me to take you back. You'll regret treating me like this."



Daniela nodded again, her expression almost mockingly sincere. "Alright. I'll wait for that day."


Alexander narrowed his eyes. "This isn't over, Daniela.Don't think for a second I'll let this go. What Cedric did to me-it's practically mutilation. Either you compensate me now, or I'll go straight to the police.I don't care about my reputation anymore. Let's see if Cedric can deal with the fallout. You don't care about me? Fine. Let's see how you feel when Cedric's name is dragged through the mud!"



At last, Alexander's true nature had come to light.



Daniela's gaze sharpened instantly, the calm demeanor she once held replaced by an unmistakable icy chill. She straightened, her stance stiff and commanding."If Cedric hit you,why don't you go straight to him?"


The implication was clear-he still saw her as an easy target.


He was too afraid to confront Cedric, but had the audacity to come to her, hoping she'd pay him off.


Alexander yelled, "I came to you because all of this is your fault. You're the cause of it all. You're the one responsible."


Daniela let out a light, mocking laugh. It had been a while since she'd come across someone so utterly shameless.



She used to think Alexander was a man of pride and respect, but now? "What do you want me to do?"


"Give me the airport project!" Alexander demanded without a hint of shame.



"That's impossible," Daniela replied firmly. "The project's already been assigned. At Elite Lux, we keep our word. Any company that fails inspection three times is permanently blacklisted."



Alexander grasped his face in frustration, his voice rising with anger. "It's because Cedric sabotaged us!" Daniela remained silent, her cold, emotionless gaze locked on him. Her expression seemed to say,"And?So what if he sabotaged you?"



But her silence only made Alexander's frustration grow."So you're going to back him no matter what,huh?Fine! If the project is off the table, then just give me money instead!"



Daniela raised an eyebrow, her voice dripping with disbelief. "You want me to give you money?"


Fuming with rage, Alexander didn't realize that Daniela had leaned back in her chair, her fingers casually grazing her phone.



"Yes!" he snapped, his voice brimming with indignation.


To his surprise, Daniela nodded without a word of protest. "How much do you want?"


Alexander froze, his eyes locked on her, confusion swirling in his mind.



Why was she being so compliant all of a sudden?



"Three hundred million!"



"Three hundred million?" Daniela echoed, her voice incredulous.



"Yes!" Alexander affirmed, his conviction strong. "Are you certain?" Daniela's gaze narrowed as she let the words sink in, stretching them out deliberately."Three hundred million?"



A flicker of excitement flashed in Alexander's eyes as Daniela reached for her checkbook from the desk drawer. He nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! Three hundred million!"



He hadn't anticipated Daniela would be so agreeable.



In that instant,one thought crossed his mind-he should've asked for more.



He stole another glance at Daniela, watching as her pen hovered above the check, poised to write.



Suddenly, a deep, steady male voice broke the silence in the room. "That's enough."



Daniela stopped mid-motion, lowering her pen Without a second look at Alexander, she shut the checkbook and slid it back into the drawer.



"What? Who's speaking?" Alexander instantly tensed,his eyes darting across the room.



Before he could ask any more questions, a knock echoed at the door. The door opened, and Elite Lux's attorney entered, holding a small recorder in his hand.Without a word, the attorney pressed play. Alexander's voice blared out, loud and unmistakable,demanding three hundred million from Daniela.



The attorney's voice remained composed but carried a sharp edge. "Mr. Bennett, I strongly advise you to leave right now. Given the sum you just demanded from Ms. Harper, this is nothing short of extortion.If you continue down this path, I assure you, the rest of your life will be spent behind bars. Moreover, should you ever make any public remarks or take any actions that tarnish the reputations of Ms. Harper or Mr.Phillips,we will pursue legal action with every tool at our disposal. I suggest you consider your next move very carefully."



Alexander stood frozen, his mind reeling from the unexpected twist. He turned to Daniela with disbelief written all over his face. "You set me up?"



All the words she had spoken earlier? They hadn't been an attempt to negotiate. They had been bait-and he had walked right into the trap.



Alexander's chest constricted, the weight of realization crashing down on him like a sledgehammer.



He had come here today, swallowing his pride,hoping for one last chance to make things right. He was convinced that Daniela still cared and that they could work things out. But she had turned her back on him-coldly, without hesitation-all for Cedric.



"Fine!" Alexander spat, his voice shaking with both fury and heartbreak. "Call the police! Do it! Go ahead!"


The attorney turned to Daniela, awaiting her instruction.



Without lifting her gaze, Daniela opened her drawer,took out her phone, and dialed it right in front of Alexander.



The moment the call connected, Alexander's resolve shattered. His fists clenched, his voice trembling as he muttered, "Fine! You win!"



Daniela hung up the phone.


Alexander gasped for air, his hand pressing against his chest as he staggered back. "Daniela, they always say when a woman stops loving a man, there's no going back. I used to believe you were different. I thought you weren't like those cold, shallow women. But I was wrong. You're just like them. No. You're worse. It's not you walking away from me, Daniela. It's me walking away from you!"



His eye reddened with so much emotion that, to anyone watching, it might have seemed like he was the one who had been betrayed.
###Chapter 143 Daniela Runs Dreamscape
Alexander finished his outburst,his anger spent,but he didn't move. He remained rooted to the spot while staring at Daniela, as if silently daring her to respond,giving them both one final chance.



Daniela slowly raised her gaze, her tone steady."Alexander, I never really blamed you."


He froze, taken aback by her unexpected words.



"| didn't come back for you. I was the one who chose to love you in the first place. That was my mistake.I fell for the wrong person. So no, I don't blame you at all.I understand that I can't control how someone else feels. You treated me badly because you simply didn't love me, and that's fine. It hurt, and I spent a long time questioning myself. I tried everything for you.l learned to drink, I learned to race cars, and I even tried to embrace Joyce, whom I once looked down on. We only get so many years in life, and for a decade, I chased after you. Those were the years of my youth that I can't get back. I always tried to make things between us as comfortable as possible because,even then, there was so much I admired about you. I hoped one day those memories would be worth holding on  to. But today, you've ruined it all. You've shattered everything I worked for. Your behavior has exposed the worst of human nature. All the things I gave up,the sacrifices I made... They mean nothing now. And whenever I think of the past, I'll remember that | loved someone who wasn't worth it. Do you know what that feels like? Your very existence disgusts me."



Daniela's voice was measured, each word deliberate and controlled. Despite the calmness in her tone, the weight of her words cut through him, one after another, each sharper than the last.


Alexander stood still, his gaze locked on her, seeing nothing but the disgust in her eyes.


After a while, a security guard appeared and escorted him out.



That night, Daniela sat alone in her office for hours,as if she were mourning the loss of a part of her youth that had been broken beyond hope.








After leaving Daniela's office, Alexander wandered back to the hospital in a daze.



As he reached the entrance, he ran into Joyce and Katrina, who were out for a walk.



The dim lighting made it hard to see, and Alexander's  face was streaked with blood.



Joyce let out a startled cry and staggered forward.Katrina screamed,"Help!"



Joyce collapsed, her abdomen hitting the ground, and she screamed out in pain.



Hospital staff rushed over with a stretcher to help her.



Alexander attempted to step in,but Katrina pushed him back with all her might. "Get out of here! Who do you think you are? You scared the future Mrs. Bennett!Stay right there! You've terrified my daughter, and you will pay for this!"



Katrina hurried after the stretcher, her steps frantic.



Alexander stood there, alone, in the chilly night air.



He found the situation both absurd and pitiful,but he couldn't bring himself to laugh.



Hadn't Joyce once said she loved him? Yet here she was, too scared to even recognize him, and had been so frightened that she fell.



Didn't Katrina want him as a son-in-law? Now she didn't even know who he was.



They were no different from Daniela, claiming to care but only looking out for their own interests. These women, so quick to turn away, deserved nothing but punishment for their hypocrisy.



Shaking off the anger, Alexander pushed forward,seeking the on-call doctor to tend to his injuries.Afterward, he made his way to the maternity ward.



Katrina, not recognizing him, swung at him in a blur of anger. But before she could make contact,Alexander's voice stopped her. "Daniela runs Dreamscape Research Institute."



Katrina froze,stunned by his words."What did you say?"


Caiden rose from his seat, his expression serious. He was deeply concerned, more than anyone, about the safety of the child growing in Joyce's womb. His eyes narrowed, and he demanded sharply, "What did you just say?"


Alexander let out a heavy sigh. "I'm Alexander. I just learned that Daniela is in charge of Dreamscape, the one with the heart repair technology that could save the baby. I went to her today, begging for help, but she and Cedric had me beaten senseless. You've seen how much I care for Joyce and her child. I gave up everything, including my marriage to Daniela,and even fought with both her and Cedric. But despite all that, I couldn't get the technology in time to save the baby. I've failed you." Alexander's swollen, bloodied face only seemed to reinforce the truth in his words.



The moment his words hung in the air, a newborn's cry echoed from the delivery room.



A doctor entered, beaming with a smile. "Both mother and baby are doing well. It's a boy, though his heart condition isn't ideal. He'll need his first procedure in two days."



The instant Caiden heard that, he grabbed the doctor by the shoulders.



"Doctor, you mentioned that Dreamscape's cardiac repair could save the baby from surgery. Is that true?"Caiden's voice was strained, his eyes locked on the doctor. Desperation filled his gaze



The doctor nodded. "Yes, but..."



Before the doctor could finish his sentence, Caiden and Katrina rushed off, clearly furious.



The doctor shouted after them, "But we don't know who runs Dreamscape!"



Alexander stayed behind, his eyes fixed on the baby.Without hesitation, he reached forward and lifted the newborn from the doctor's arms. The baby let out a sharp, wailing cry that echoed through the room.



A slow smile spread across Alexander's battered face,his expression twisted in the dim light, as a chilling grin formed.
###Chapter 144 Please Leave Immediately
"I must see Daniela now!" Caiden insisted fiercely.



"Apologies, sir, but it's the middle of the night. Ms.Harper has already retired for the evening. If this is urgent, I'd suggest returning at a more suitable hour,"said the security guard.



Katrina edged closer to Caiden. "Every moment we delay puts the child at greater risk. Remember what Alexander told us? Daniela and Cedric assaulted him when he tried to get the medicine for the child. It's obvious Daniela is deliberately avoiding you. This child is your future-your pillar in old age. It seems Daniela doesn't want you having anyone to lean on later in life!"



Caiden's temper exploded instantly at those words. He fixed a fierce glare on the security guard. "Do you have any idea who I am? I'm your boss's father, for fuck's sake! Without me, there's no Daniela, no building,and no shit for you to guard! Now get the hell out of my way!"



The guard remained unyielding. "I'm truly sorry, sir.However, these are not visiting hours. If you genuinely are Ms. Harper's father, perhaps you could call her?" "I am her father!" Caiden's words came out in a rush,and for a moment, he almost let slip that he didn't have her number.



Seizing his arm, Katrina shot him a cautionary look.She then turned to the guard, her expression melting into a persuasive smile. "We truly are Daniela's family.We came in such a rush we forgot our phones at home.Could we perhaps use your phone? We know her private number."



The guard eyed them suspiciously, uncertainty flickering across his face. He hesitated briefly before reaching for his phone. Yet, before his fingers could grasp it,Lillian came.



The guard greeted her with respect.


Lillian's gaze sharpened upon seeing the visibly agitated Caiden and Katrina waiting outside.



"They claim they're Ms. Harper's parents," the guard informed her.



Lillian snorted derisively, her arms crossed as she faced Caiden. "Oh, so now you're her parents? Didn't you cut ties with her? What,you suddenly forgot your own bullshit?"



Caiden's face darkened with fury. "Quit screwing around. Bring Daniela here before I lose my patience."Unmoved, Lillian yawned, signaling her disinterest."She's resting. If you have something important, I'm here to listen."



Caiden spat, "Talking to you is pointless! You don't call the shots! Drag Daniela's ass down here immediately!"



With a dismissive laugh, Lillian countered, "You can say it or not, the choice is yours. But at this late hour,I'm the one you're dealing with."



Beside him, Katrina gave Caiden a gentle push and murmured, "Just tell her. She's working for Daniela,isn't she?"



Caiden cast a quick glance at Katrina before refocusing on Lillian. "Look, it's clear Daniela runs Dreamscape, and your lab has concocted some groundbreaking heart repair tech. I need one of those miracle pills. If you've got the authority, pass it here and spare me a trip to Daniela!"



"Well?" Katrina, previously jittery, now exuded a calm demeanor as she observed Caiden's escalating frustration. She offered Lillian a sly smile and queried,"Can you make that decision, or should we have Daniela come down here? Of course, if you're not inclined to help us, we're more than willing to purchase it. It would be interesting to see if Daniela still values family ties or if she's lost touch with her origins."


Lillian's gaze sharpened, her mind racing.



She recognized that meddling in Daniela's familial conflicts was beyond her role.



The thought of mishandling the delicate matter and complicating things for Daniela filled her with dread.


Yet, the urge to wipe that smug expression off Katrina's face was almost overwhelming.



With no other recourse, Lillian texted Daniela,receiving no immediate response. After a tense pause,she dialed Daniela's number.



The phone barely completed one ring before Daniela picked up.



Katrina perched on her tiptoes, straining to catch a snippet of Daniela's conversation, but her words remained elusive.



Nearby, Caiden paced, a mask of impatience and concern etched across his face.



Whirling around, Katrina faced the security guard and flashed a knowing smirk. "See? I was right. We're still her family. Your earlier display of authority was quite over the top, don't you think? To an outsider, it might even appear as though you owned the place!" The guard's jaw tightened as he fought to keep his composure under her taunts.



Unperturbed, Katrina's sneer deepened. "It's just the way things are, isn't it? Some folks, like you, draw the short straw-destined for a badge and a uniform.Meanwhile, we're cut from a different cloth, born to bask in the lap of luxury."



Caiden echoed her disdain with a derisive look towards the guard.



The guard, biting back his retort, knew better than to engage. After all, the pair had introduced themselves as the president's parents.



Just then, Lillian hung up and faced them with a composed expression.



Katrina straightened with an air of authority, fully prepared to storm in. But just as she moved, Lillian's hand shot up, stopping her in her tracks.



Katrina's smug expression evaporated, her features contorting into a scowl of rage. "What is the meaning of this?"



"Our boss was very clear. Everyone is te master of their own fate, and she refuses to meddle in someone else's destiny. It's best if you leave now." She then turned to address the security guard. "And just so you know, the boss wanted me to inform you -she considers herself without parents now. Handle this as you deem appropriate. If they become troublesome, don't hesitate to call the police. You're an Elite Lux employee, empowered to reject unwelcome visitors. There's a $10,000 bonus for your discretion. Stop by the finance department tomorrow to claim it."



With a stretch that betrayed a hint of nonchalance,Lillian sauntered off.


Caiden and Katrina were left rooted to the spot, their eyes locked on the closing doors of the elevator as Lillian disappeared from view.



She just walked away? Was Daniela really going to let them suffer without giving a shit?



Unwilling to concede, Katrina took a determined step forward, only to be met by the security guard, who now brandished his baton with an authoritative grip.



"This is Elite Lux, not an open house," he stated icily,blocking their path.



His stance underscored his formidable presence,and the palpable tension caused Katrina to falter.



Katrina begrudgingly retreated toward the entrance. As they stood in the chilling gusts of wind, she turned to Caiden, worry etching her face. "What do we do now?"
###Chapter 145 What A Joke



Caiden had never imagined that Daniela would treat him with such indifference. After all, he was the man who gave her life. Yet, it became painfully clear that he could not rely on Daniela.



He came to the realization that the only one he could truly depend on was the newborn child.



Beside him, Katrina, her body shivering from the chill,understood Caiden's thoughts intimately after years of being together.She stoked his growing resentment and remarked, "Daniela is truly ruthless. It's understandable she might disregard me, since I'm not her real mother. But you're her father. She should at least consider speaking to you for the baby's sake.How can she be so heartless? Then again, those in business often show no mercy. Remember how her mother treated you? Had she not died so unexpectedly, you likely wouldn't have seen a penny of the Harper family's fortune. And now Daniela is just the same. She's indifferent to your suffering, leaving you to freeze out here. Perhaps she's hoping you'll simply pass away, making it easier for her to claim the Harper family's fortune for herself."



Caiden stood silently, his teeth chattering from the  cold. His eyes, though he spoke no word,conveyed the depth of his chilI and bitterness.



He felt as if the entire world scorned him, offering him no genuine respect, except forthe child. To him,only this baby represented a pillar of future support.



Caiden gritted his teeth, his voice a harsh growl as he declared, "Fine, I'll camp out here all evening. Let's see if Daniela has the guts to ignore me tomorrow. If she can stomach seeing her father endure the cold,then so be it. But does she really believe she can escape the gossip? The whispers will start!"



His voice carried a veneer of toughness, yet he scarcely managed thirty minutes before his resolve began to crumble.



Donning a bulky coat that Alexander had offered,Caiden and Katrina braced against the biting winter gusts.



Clutching the coat close, Katrina turned to Caiden and remarked, "It's Joyce who still cares for you.Without her,would Alexander ever show such kindness?Iknow youI've been angry with me over that disagreement with your mother, but regardless of what anyone says,Joyce and I have always supported you without fail.Consider this-who else would willingly give you her child? And yet, you forced her to agree to that harsh contract. Do you truly deserve her loyalty?" Amid the piercing cold, Caiden clenched his fists, his teeth clattering as he made a vow. "As long as Joyce's child remains faithful to me, he will inherit the entire Harper family's fortune. I'm changing my will immediately. Daniela won't get a dime."



In the shadowy night, a smile crept across Katrina's face. Her usual warmth returned as she softened her voice, her words a gentle caress in the chill air,comforting Caiden with her nurturing presence.



Caiden was slowly coming to terms with the realization that he had been a complete idiot to waste even an ounce of compassion on Daniela.



What did it matter if Daniela was his own flesh and blood? She had callously left him to endure the cold outside alone.



As the night wore on, both Caiden and Katrina could no longer bear the chill. They sought refuge in Alexander's car, where they cranked up the heat to fend off the frostbite-inducing temperatures.With the arrival of dawn, they were back on their feet, calling out for Daniela across the sprawling parking lot.



Caiden had not anticipated the extent of Daniela's cruelty. Evening came again, yet there was still no sign of her.



Even Katrina, the architect of their scheme, started to unravel with worry.



The hospital was pressing for a critical treatment for the infant, pushing Caiden to the brink of fury right at the doorstep of Elite Lux.



The turmoil attracted a substantial crowd and caught the attention of numerous news channels.



In front of rolling cameras, Caiden exploded with rage,branding Daniela as heartless and vile.


Amidst it all, Katrina sobbed uncontrollably, claiming she was at her wit's end.


Onlookers gathered in the lobby, murmuring and speculating. But when the hospital set a stern ultimatum, Caiden recognized that his back was against the wall.


After all his screaming, insults, and public tantrums aimed at Daniela, he was left burnt out and stuck in the same damn place.



Left with no alternatives, he finally set aside his ego and approached Lillian. "Could you please tell Daniela I want to see her? I'm really asking here. I'll let go of my pride if I need to."


Lillian's smirk was unfaltering, her composure steady even wth the cameras capturing every moment. "Had you shown this courtesy from the start, you wouldn't  be in this predicament. Elite Lux has dealt with its share of troublemakers. You thought you could intimidate us? Look where that's gotten you."


Lillian's eyes burned with contempt as she spat, "Get moving. What, you think you're so important someone's going to beg you to walk inside?"


Exhausted from two sleepless nights, Caiden's and Katrina's shoulders slumped as they followed Lillian.


As they neared the doorway, Lillian halted them abruptly. "Keep yourself in the cafeteria. We don't let people like you anywhere near the upstairs."


Caiden closed his eyes, frustration etching deeper lines across his face.



Such an ungrateful daughter!



The phrase echoed in his mind, a cruel reminder ofhis past leniency towards Daniela, making him feel utterly foolish.



What an absolute disgrace!
###Chapter 146 Far Beyond The Age For Jokes
The meeting unfolded in the cafeteria on the first floor.



Daniela, fresh from leading a conference, treated herself to a bowl of pasta, savoring each bite with a serene composure.



Merely a few paces from her, Caiden and Katrina found themselves hemmed in by a quintet of imposing security guards.



Daniela's voice carried a cool detachment as she addressed them. "If you have something to say, make it quick. You've got ten minutes."



Caiden's expression blended shock and pain. "Daniela,is this how you treat your own father?"



Unperturbed, Daniela continued to ate her food.  


Midway through her meal, she asked casually, "Did you take that document severing our relationship as nothing more than a joke?"



Caiden opened his mouth to respond, yet words failed him. Daniela pressed on, her tone unyielding. "After you exploited our last shred of familial ties to secure a position for Joyce,why pretend there's a fence left to mend?"



Katrina, attempting to diffuse the tension, chimed in with an overly bright smile. "Come on, that was just a family spat. Sometimes people say things they don't mean in the heat of the moment."



"Is that so? That agreement is upheld by the law,"Daniela retorted, her voice slicing through the air."You're both well beyond the age of such jokes. If there's something pressing on your minds, state it clearly. Don't waste my time."



Caiden's gaze lingered on Daniela's face, seeing echoes of Brylee in her features, and his eyes narrowed with resolve.



"Fine. Just give me the cardiac-repair medicine.Then I'll go," Caiden declared, clenching his teeth as he felt his dignity being eroded.



Katrina maintained her sweet demeanor, her smile unwavering. "Daniela, since it's clear you've stripped all sentiment from this equation, we shall not owe you any favors. Just name your price, and we'll settle it."



She deliberately raised her voice, making sure the media clustered at the door caught every word,  painting Daniela as ruthless and opportunistic.



As Katrina's words hung in the air, Daniela flicked a glance towards her before turning her eyes to the media throng at the entrance.



She arched an eyebrow and allowed a small, knowing smile to play on her lips.



It seemed like the perfect moment to unveil Dreamscape's latest breakthrough to the world.



"Yes," Daniela responded evenly. "We indeed possess the treatment you're inquiring about, and if you're prepared to meet the cost, that's agreeable to me."



Katrina,seizing the moment, leaned closer to Caiden and murmured conspiratorially, "Told you, didn't l?Daniela's all about the money-nothing else matters to her. She'd overlook even the bonds of family for profit. Once she states her price, let's skip the haggling. We'll manage it, for our baby's sake."


Katrina spoke with defiance, as though completely unafraid. She meant every word, or so it seemed.



Caiden responded with a look filled with gratitude and whispered tenderly, "Katrina, marrying you was the best decision of my life."



Radiating warmth and serenity, Katrina smiled at him.In her mind, the cost wouldn't be steep; after all,how  expensive could the medicine be?



All she wanted was to ruin Daniela's image completely.



If Daniela dared to take money for the medicine,Caiden's wrath would be absolute, and public opinion would cast her as the ruthless villain who turned her back on her family.



In Katrina's eyes, her strategy was foolproof.



"Three hundred million," Daniela declared, placing her fork on the table. Her gaze met Katrina's. "Transfer that sum to Dreamscape, and you'll get the medicine."


Katrina froze, her expression one of sheer disbelief."How much did you say?"



"Three hundred million," Daniela reiterated firmly,maintaining eye contact. "What's the problem? A moment ago, you appeared quite eager. Does this mean you don't value a human life at three hundred million?"



The smug smile that had been playing on Katrina's lips suddenly stiffened.


"Daniela, don't you dare push it! We've bought medicine before, and there's no way in hell it costs that much!" She strode towards the entrance, signaling to the gathering reporters. "See this for yourselves,everyone. Daniela's trying to extort money from us.  Three hundred million!"



Daniela's lips curled into a subtle smile.



That twisted smile made Katrina's blood run cold.



Of all things, nothing terrified her more than seeing Daniela grin like that.
###Chapter 147 Defiant Yet Sorrowful
Daniela's smile sent a sharp pang through Katrina's heart, causing it to skip erratically. Recoiling, she asked, "Why are you smiling like that?"



With a serene composure, Daniela gently wiped her lips with a napkin before responding nonchalantly,"Because you're being a fool."



Katrina felt a flush of embarrassment heat her cheeks.Surrounded by a sea of reporters, the sting of being publicly ridiculed as foolish was too much. She yearned to snap back fiercely but, catching the eyes of the crowd, her resolve melted into tears of frustration instead.



Her visible distress instantly softened Caiden's heart.He glared at Daniela, accusation sharp in his tone."You're exploiting our desperate need for this treatment to inflate the price, aren't you?"



Daniela's smile remained unfazed, a picture of tranquility and poise-a stark contrast to the visibly perturbed Katrina and the incensed Caiden.



Ignoring their accusations, Daniela turned gracefully to the assembled reporters and began to outline the  journey of their heart repair technology-from the early stages of research, through substantial investments in equipment, to years of meticulous experimentation, and finally, the modest yet significant breakthroughs.


Her words, imbued with conviction and transparency,resonated with the reporters, touching them with the evident passion and challenges her team had faced.



"Our institute's dedicated professors have devoted their lives to this project. Don't they merit some acknowledgment for their dedication? Isn't it right to honor their hard work and sacrifices appropriately?"



Her poignant words resonated deeply with everyone gathered.


The reporters and onlookers, stirred by her plea,responded with vigorous agreement, their voices echoing in solidarity, "Absolutely!"



Daniela's features softened, a mixture of relief and sorrow playing across her face. Her eyes, brimming with tears yet unshed, met the camera lenses. "Initially,we intended to present this research at a grander affair. Yet, circumstances have compelled us to proceed otherwise. The sheer scale of investment in this technology is astronomical-top-tier equipment,legions of engineers, and endless nights dev/oid of sleep. Is it unreasonable, then, to seek 300 million for  treatment?"



"No, it isn't!" the crowd roared back, some attendees visibly tearful, moved by her heartfelt words.


Daniela then fixed her intense gaze on Caiden. "Mr.Harper, do you still consider it expensive?" ①


Caiden's hand tightened into a fist, every muscle straining as if he was fighting the urge to unleash hell.



Was it expensive?



Securing 300 million would stretch Harper Group's finances to their limits.



Was it excessive?



The funds would be his own-undeniably, it was a hefty sum.



However, Daniela had expertly swayed the crowd,turningthem into her staunch allies.



The term "expensive" almost escaped his lips, but he restrained himself, keeping it unspoken.



Daniela's face was a mask of seriousness, her eyes methodically scanning the audience. "I never planned to air personal grievances in such a public forum,yet here we are, surrounded by onlookers and the integrity of our research institute hanging in the  balance. As many of you are aware, Katrina is my stepmother, and Joyce is my stepsister. Over the years, they have basked in opulence, whereas I was ostracized. Harper Group, my mother's legacy,seems forgotten. I often ponder-would my mother regret her choice in a partner if she witnessed this today?"



Caiden's reaction was one of utter disbelief. He pointed to Daniela, his voice shaking. "What are you implying?"



Daniela faced the audience again, her smile tinged with bitterness. "I'm suggesting that everything changed with my stepmother's arrival. I was sidelined as others reveled in the fortunes that were rightfully mine. And now, after all my endeavors and successes,Caiden and his scheming spouse seek to strip it all from me!"



Emotion overwhelmed Daniela; she clasped her chest,her voice breaking from the strain. "Tell me, does justice even exist anymore? Or is this world just one big pile of shit?"



Lillian advanced, placing a supportive hand on Daniela's shoulder, addressing the gathered reporters "You all know Ms. Harper rarely justifies her actions Yet today,circumstances have driven her to these extremes. Her father has disowned her; her quest for justice rests upon your shoulders!" Daniela flicked her hand dismissively. "Come on, Lillian,let's get out of here."



Lillian, standing tall yet imbued with a subdued grief,assisted Daniela as they made their way to the elevator.
###Chapter 148 Brylee's Death



The crowd jeered,hurling insults at Caiden, calling him a pathetic failure of a father.



Daniela entered the elevator and glanced at Lillian."What did you think of my speech?"



Lillian responded with a thumbs-up.



Back in her office, as Daniela settled in, a new secretary timidly approached Lillian. "Do you think Daniela is upset?"


Lillian shook her head with certainty. "She is warmly kind to those she respects, but she's swift and decisive in cutting ties with anyone who disappoints her."



Katrina and Joyce had felt the sting of her resolve.And now Caiden and Alexander had been added to that list.



Daniela's public confrontation was a clear sign she had already put any past relations behind her. There was no point in feeling sorry. They weren't worth her time or a damn ounce of her concern.



Meanwhile,Caiden was stewing in the shame of being completely humiliated. Daniela's harsh dismnissal had caught him off-guard.



Even if he handed over the three hundred million,people would still think he was a worthless piece of shit.



Favoring his stepdaughter over his own, squandering his ex-wife's earnings to coerce his biological daughter into handing over her research-every accusation was painfully accurate, leaving Caiden defenseless.



Katrina, anxious and wary of the media, whispered urgently from behind him, "Caiden, what should we do now? The hospital's expecting us."



Caiden clenched his teeth tightly and announced with a heavy heart, "Three hundred million... It looks like we'll have no choice but to sell the company."


Katrina immediately objected, her voice laced with desperation. "Absolutely not!"


Her expression twisted into one of fury as she seized Caiden's hand with a fierce grip. "You can't possibly sell it!"



Katrina had spent half her life serving Caiden,so that she could get her hands on Harper Group. But the discussion about selling the company was on the table.She was not prepared to surrender without a fight. Caiden held her hand firmly. "And what? Allow the child to die?" His eyes, red and frustrated, bore into hers as he shook with anger. "We need to prioritize saving the child! Everything else can wait. I promise you, whatever Daniela ends up taking, I'll reclaim it.Trust me."



Katrina felt a deep conflict stirring within her.



Locking eyes with Caiden, she realized arguing was futile.



With a heavy sigh,she nodded in agreement.


Her lips quivered in anger, tears born of frustration trailing down her face. Her body tensed, her shoulders stiffening,yet she gave a reluctant nod.



While Caiden was on the phone with Daniela, Katrina stood aside, her fingers digging into the flesh of her thigh, the pain a sharp reminder of her resolve.



She silently swore to herself to recover whatever losses were to come, at any cost.



Caiden called Daniela.



"Have you made your decision?" Daniela responded in a tone of cool indifference.



Caiden clenched his fists and growled through gritted  teeth, "I'll hand over twenty percent of Harper Group's shares! Just give me the damn medicine!"



Daniela responded with a soft, derisive chuckle, her amusement clear.



A wave of panic surged through Caiden. He had gambled on her ignorance of Harper Group's precarious situation.



He silently prayed she didn't realize that the twenty percent stake was merely worth five million dollars.Unfortunately,his hopes were dashed.



"Twenty percent? You think that's sufficient?"Daniela's voice cut through the air, sharp as a knife."Or are you implying that the life of a child is worth merely a few million?"



Caiden's heart raced, skipping a beat at her words.



"If you insist on playing these games, I'm not particularly bothered, but I doubt the child can afford to wait," Daniela continued calmly,her voice steady yet chilling.



Caiden found himself gasping for air, his breath catching in his throat.



"Fine, let's not complicate things unnecessarily,"Daniela declared evenly. "I demand fifty-one percent of Harper Group's shares. Agree, and the child lives. Otherwise,you're merely wasting my time here."



It dawned on Caiden that Daniela was after true control of Harper Group.



"Deal," he choked out, the word tasting of bile in his mouth.



His eyes smoldered with deep resentment.



Lillian shook her head, her expression one of bewilderment. "Why not demand everything? They'd probably yield if you pressed them further."



Reclining in her chair, Daniela narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. "Perhaps. But I've just had a change of heart."
###Chapter 149 | Should Have Taken Your Advice
Daniela's phone vibrated, announcing a video message from Ryan.



In the footage, Katrina lingered near the bathroom entrance,gripping her smartphone.She whispered into the device, "Mom, I'm doing everything I can to handle this mess, but if Caiden's decided to sell the company, there's nothing more I can do."



The reply from the other end was muffled and indecipherable.



Katrina's expression contorted with vexation as she retorted, "Doesn't that just prove Brylee had it coming?Damn it, I should've listened to you and finished her too back then. Now she's become an immense threat."



Suddenly, Katrina stiffened, her eyes flickering anxiously towards the security camera overhead. Then,she terminated the call smoothed down her dress,and strode off.



Seated in her office, Daniela clutched a pen so fiercely her knuckles blanched.



Katrina's mother had been dead for years, hadn't she? 
What could Katrina possibly mean by those ominous words?



Meanwhile, Caiden returned to the hospital bearing the new medication. Remarkably, the child became the first in the nation to show clinical improvement with this treatment, sidestepping the need for surgical intervention.



The medical team buzzed with excitement, eager to document this breakthrough and glean insights that might benefit others facing similar predicaments.



Caiden dismissively rejected the pleas from parents with sick children. His face twisted into a sharp,disdainful sneer as he snapped, "This is the health we paid for! Fund it yourselves! Why should you benefit from our child's plight? Dream on! Our child is a treasure, not a public spectacle!"



Outside the hospital room,desperate patients begged for assistance, but Caiden strode past them, utterly indifferent to their suffering.



In his eyes, his own interests always took precedence.


Elsewhere in the hospital, Alexander was recovering from a skin graft surgery when he overheard a news broadcast.



Richard, his eyes wide with astonishment, gestured  towards the television. "300 million for a single pill?That's astounding!"



A bitter smirk crossed Alexander's lips, pulling painfully at his fresh stitches, making him grimace."Daniela's making quite the spectacle. She's using this to embarrass Caiden."



Richard nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. "But why didn't she just seize control of the entire company? It was her mother who established it, after all. What stopped her from going after the entire company? Is there still a part of her that cares about Caiden, even after everything?"



Alexander's scoff was tinged with scorn,his expression growing sterner. "That kind of emotion doesn't exist in Daniela's world. Look at my scars-do you really think a person capable of this harbors any kindness? Her beauty is merely a facade, a tool for devastation."



Richard cast a glance at Alexander. It sounded like Alexander had moved on from Daniela.



Yet, when the surgeon posed a question about whether Alexander desired his post-operative appearance to mirror his former self or to be altered,Alexander wanted it to be as it was before.



Richard believed Alexander still had lingering affections for Daniela. As Alexander and Richard ambled near the maternity ward, Caiden's loud curses came from within. The whole corridor echoed with his voice.



Richard and Alexander slowed their steps, drawn by the commotion.



"Daniela! What a fucking nightmare she is! If I'd known the hell Brylee was bringing, I'd have stopped it before it started!"



Katrina let out a soft sigh.



Caiden continued, "For fuck's sake, now that she's holding 51%, she thinks she's untouchable, turning Harper Group into a playground for her lackeys.What's her endgame? To push her own father out?"



On the other side of the glass door, Alexander observed as the veins on Caiden's neck stood out starkly,his fury palpable and filling every corner of the room.
###Chapter 150 Caiden's Grand Plan
A mischievous grin curled at the corners of Katrina's mouth. "Caiden,why fight Daniela for Harper Group?We've still got 49% of the shares, and look at her now -she's running both Elite Lux and Dreamscape. Even if a small slice of the profits from those companies flows into Harper Group, it'd be enough to revive it.Wouldn't it be smarter to just sit back and watch the money roll in?"


Upon hearing this, Richard and Alexander shared a meaningful look.



It was evident that Katrina possessed a more strategic mind than Caiden.



Meanwhile, Caiden sat stiff as a board,his bruised ego plastered all over his face. He detested the very notion. The company his late wife had established thrived under her direction but dwindled on his watch,now teetering on the brink of collapse. The senior executives' growing discontent with his leadership was palpable.



Was it the right move for Daniela to take control? Her cutthroat efficiency promised a swift resurgence for  Harper Group. Yet, the mere thought tormented Caiden.What would the public think?


They would label him a failure, a man devoid of personal achievement.


First, he had depended on his wife, and now on his daughter?



What a pathetic way to ruin his reputation!


Observing the turmoil etched across his face, Katrina leaned closer. "Why concern ourselves with idle gossip? Daniela is your flesh and blood. If she revitalizes Harper Group and fortifies it, our dividends by year's end will surely swell. Truly, what weight do the opinions of strangers hold? Ultimately,it is we who will enjoy the fruits of her labor."



Under Caiden's stewardship, the trajectory of Harper Group had nosedived, marking yet another dismal ###Chapter in its history.



Two years ago, a senior executive had walked out,shamelessly dragging an entire production line with him.



The following year, the company's top salesperson had resigned, taking their most lucrative client with them.



This year,the situation had deteriorated further. A slew  of key employees had defected, draining all business from the northern region. Caiden had spent hours furiously cursing and shouting, yet his efforts were futile against the rapid decline of Harper Group.


Daniela had offered to sell them medicine for three hundred million, but even if they sold the entire company, it wouldn't fetch that amount.


The factory workers had lost their drive, going through the motions without passion.



The machinery had been neglected since Brylee's demise.



Meanwhile, in the office,most employees were biding their time, eagerly anticipating bankruptcy to claim their severance.



For Katrina, Daniela's offer to salvage this floundering company seemed like a reasonable arrangement.


In her view, by taking on this challenge, Daniela would effectively be serving their cause.



After making this realization, Katrina's spirits lifted considerably, and she set about persuading Caiden."Why not show some generosity for a change? Pass the reins of the company to Daniela. With Elite Lux's backing, she'll bolster Harper Group effortlessly,Imagine us in the future, just relaxing at home while profits from Harper Group pad our bank account. Doesn't that sound wonderful?"



Stroking his arm lightly, she went on, "Daniela has everything she could possibly desire. She doesn't actually need Harper Group for herself. She's only interested because it holds sentimental value-Brylee built it from nothing. As long as that emotional tie remains,Daniela will never let Harper Group falter."



Caiden looked over at Katrina, skepticism flickering in his eyes. "Do you really believe that?"



"Yes. Let Daniela deal with the hard stuff while she works her ass off making us money!"



This reassurance seemed to ease Caiden's concerns somewhat.



Glancing down at the newborn cradled in his arms,his mood brightened even more, and he declared, "You're right! Let Daniela accumulate wealth for our little treasure-plenty of it! Tomorrow, I'll head over to the company.Honestly,these years in charge have been nothing short of grueling!"



He had always felt out of place in his role. His subordinates held little regard for him, and his series of missteps had led to a string of disasters.



After losing significant orders time and again, his standing in the company had deteriorated irreparably.Even he had to admit that he was in over his head and  it was time for him to move on.



With a renewed sense of resolve, Caiden took out his phone and composed a message to Daniela, asking her to join him at Harper Group the following day to discuss the management transition. He was prepared to relinquish his position as chairman and pass on the leadership.



Richard and Alexander walked away from the hospital room in silence.



As they strolled down the hallway, Richard broke the silence. "Katrina's cunning and manipulative ways are something else. And with Daniela's tenacity, don't be surprised if Harper Group makes a swift comeback,especially with Elite Lux in their corner. Considering Katrina's influence, Joyce's prospects are looking pretty solid. It's something you might want to ponder."



Alexander remained silent.



Richard glanced over at him, only to find Alexander's face devoid of any reaction, as if the words had passed him by unheard.



Richard let out a quiet sigh. It was clear Alexander still hadn't gotten over Daniela.



When they returned to Alexander's ward, Caiden burst in. "I'll be seeing Daniela tomorrow at Harper Group to wrap up the handover. Alexander, you have a knack for these negotiations. Could you join me? And about Joyce and the baby-we owe you so much,Alexander.Once things calm down, we'll throw a grand banquet in your honor. Would you mind accompanying me tomorrow? Daniela... well,you know her tactics. She's sly and full of maneuvers. There's no way I can take her on alone!"



Richard shot a look at Alexander.



With a nod, Alexander signaled his agreement.



Caiden departed with a joyful stride.



As soon as he was gone, Richard emitted a sharp scoff. "What an impudent request. If it weren't for your intervention, their baby would be undergoing surgery right now. And all they promise is a banquet in the future? He didn't even bother to bring a gift for you, and now he brazenly asks for your help again tomorrow? It's astounding!"



Turning to Alexander, Richard's expression darkened with fury. "Are you actually planning to go with that bastard tomorrow?"



Tugging the blanket over himself, Alexander settled into the hospital bed and replied, "Yeah." Richard opened his mouth to protest, but Alexander had already shut his eyes, cutting off further discussion.
###Chapter 151 Cedric's Confession
 Returning from his business trip, Cedric was met with the infuriating news-Caiden and his wife had once again made things difficult for Daniela.



He lingered in the doorway, his expression somber and contemplative.



It was only when Daniela emerged from her office that his demeanor softened into a smile.



Stepping towards her, Cedric asked, "Might I join you for dinner tonight?"



Daniela asked, "Has your grandmother driven you out once more?"



Cedric nodded, a rueful smile tugging at his lips."Indeed. She has forbidden me from returning home this evening. Since Lillian and Ryan are already under your roof,could you possibly spare a corner for me as well,just for tonight?"



As dinner approached, Cedric persisted with his request. Beside them, Ryan chimed in, "We'll play games in my room. We won't bother you." Daniela gave a nod of approval.



Her home was a frequent gathering spot anyway.Aside from the private floor for Daniela alone, the rest floors were filled with guest rooms.  



Although each member of Elite Lux had their own residence, they all had their respective rooms in Daniela's place.



Initially,Daniela was hesitant.Cedric seemed the least likely to need her hospitality, yet there he was,seeking solace in her home.



She was well aware of the true motive behind his questions, though she had never openly admitted or accepted it.



After the evening meal, Cedric made his way to her door and knocked lightly.



Without waiting for an invitation, he entered and quietly took a seat in a chair, his eyes fixed on her.



Fresh from the shower, Daniela was clad in a plain white loungewear set, her hair still damp. "What's on your mind?"



Cedric remained seated, his demeanor grave and thoughtful. He had not bothered to change from the shirt and slacks he had worn earlier that afternoon.



His intense gaze locked onto Daniela, unwavering and deep.



For a brief moment, Daniela averted her eyes, letting out a soft sigh before steeling herself to return his gaze,her expression unreadable.



The room was thick with silence for a tense few seconds.



Cedric's face grew even more somber as he finally spoke, his voice low and steady. "Daniela, it's been a year and a half since your divorce."



Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around the pen she was holding, betraying a flicker of emotion. "Yes."



"Things have changed a lot since then. I've restrained myself," Cedric admitted, his voice slow but firm."Fear has gripped me-the fear of pressing too hard,the trepidation of causing offense, and the anxiety that you might feel uneasy. I was petrified of upsetting you in any way. Thus, I chose to bide my time,considering perhaps you required space to heal and to discover your true desires. I tried to make my way into your life gently, like a soft breeze you wouldn't think twice about. My only wish was to become someone important to you, without you ever catching on to how  much it meant to me. Over the last eighteen months,I've carefully avoided overstepping. I refrained from actions or words that might seem too assertive. I've kept myself in check, abiding by my own boundaries,waiting endlessly for the right moment."



Daniela gave him a thoughtful look.



"I don't mind the wait. Yet, it breaks my heart to watch you suffer, knowing I'm stuck on the sdelines as just a friend. Daniela, I yearn to shield you. It pains me to witness anyone push you around. I want the world to recognize that you have an ally, that you are never alone. I've made up my mind-I won't wait for fate to decide. It's clear that you and Alexander are done, so I'm stepping forward now. I want to be the one who's there for you. Whether I succeed or not is irrelevant to me. From this moment on, I'm claiming my place in your world. And when you're ready to open your heart,I want to be the one you choose first."



Cedric laid his heart bare, speaking with a fiery determination he rarely allowed himself to show.



For a few moments, Daniela remained silent, her eyes narrowing as she evaluated him.



Realizing his forwardness might have been too much,Cedric's demeanor softened, his voice now/ carrying a hint of desperation. "Look, from here on out,consider me a suitor, okay? Don't shut me out. Just give me a  shot."



Cedric abruptly stood up, hoping to leave on a strong note, but in his haste, he knocked over the chair behind him.



Flustered, he righted the chair, his cheeks coloring with embarrassment, and he hurried out of the room without another word.



Shortly after, Lillian stepped in from the balcony,having just ended a phone call. With a quick,incredulous look at Daniela, she shook her head in exasperation. "Did Cedric actually just take off like that? After pouring his heart out like that, he doesn't even stick around for your response? Is he for real?Can you believe this is the same guy who pulled off that huge international deal recently?"
###Chapter 152 Daniela Takes Over The Harper Group
As dawn broke, Caiden made his way to Harper Group,accompanied by Alexander, whose recent skin graft was visibly healing.



They entered the CEO's office, where Caiden nonchalantly tossed his feet onto the desk and motioned for Alexander to make himself comfortable.



Alexander cast a scrutinizing glance around the room,his expression unreadable as he took everything in.



The desk was a chaotic stack of documents needing approval, official seals, and stamps-all disorganized and scattered.



His eyes then caught a piece of paper on the floor.Stooping to retrieve it, he realized it was Harper Group's business license.



Despite being aware of Caiden's lax approach to business, the level of disorder still shocked Alexander.



"Don't fuss over that," Caiden remarked casually, as he placed a steaming cup of coffee on a nearby table,settling back with a relaxed air. "Daniela will be here soon to sort out this disaster. I'm tired of managing  this circus; it's her turn to take the reins."



Flashing a self-satisfied grin, Caiden leaned back further. "If Daniela can elevate Harper Group to compete with Elite Lux, my remaining forty-nine percent stake could turn into a gold mine."



He smiled, basking in the glow of his imagined future riches.



Alexander sat across from Caiden. "Daniela has climbed her way to the top; she's clearly capable. Do you really think she'll accept defeat without a fight?"



Just moments earlier,Alexander had eavesdropped on the chief financial officer detailing a grim financial reality: the company was drowning under a debt exceeding seven hundred million dollars.



The only lifelines were bank loans and a handful of clients still loyal to Brylee.



On the outside, Harper Group maintained its majestic facade, yet internally, it was mere shadow of its former self.



Alexander found it astonishing how effectively Caiden had managed to run the corporation into the ground.



Engrossed in his thoughts, Alexander's contemplation was interrupted by the buzz of his phone. It was a message from Caiden containing a list of contacts. Puzzled, Alexander raised his eyebrows at Caiden.



With a sly grin, Caiden responded, "Your tip about Joyce's baby was a lifesaver, and I'm grateful you joined me here today. That list? It's our last batch of solid clients. Feel free to transition their accounts to Bennett Group. Tell them I approved the move."


Relaxed in the glow of the well-lit office, Caiden leisurely sipped his coffee, a subtle smile playing on his lips.



From where he stood, Alexander could see Caiden's blatant disregard for Daniela, his own daughter.


He couldn't help but remember the day Daniela was a drunken mess, and the Harper famnily treated her like trash left out on the curb.



Even now,it seemed like the whole world had turned its back on her.



Tucking the list-a generous offering from Caiden-into his pocket, Alexander sensed the tension in the air.



By nine o'clock, whispers of impending doom circulated among the employees.



Caiden remained detached, offering no reassurances.When they questioned him about what to do next,his  response was firm and clear. "Wait for Daniela.If she's truly capable as they claim, she'll prove herself. I'm eager to see if she possesses her mother's unshakable grit in crisis situations!"



As the clock struck ten, the secretary notified them of Daniela's arrival.



Moments later, the door to the CEO's office burst open. Daniela entered, her stride confident, her presence commanding.



She was not alone; accompanying her were Ryan,Lillian, Cedric, and a lead auditor.



Caiden rose from his seat, his eyes locked on Daniela in disbelief. "You've brought an auditing team to scrutinize your own father's company? How dare you!"



Ignoring the tension, Daniela walked over to the executive chair and settled into it with an air of authority.


Behind her, Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric lined up, their faces masks of unwavering confidence.


Daniela began, "We've legally dissolved any familial bonds. This isn't just a family matter; it's business. And with fifty-one percent of the shares in my possession,I have full authority here. I need you to hand over every financial record and key document now. After a thorough audit and the transfer of documents, I will assume leadership of Harper Group."



This poised declaration took Alexander by surprise.



It had never crossed his mind that Daniela might actually understand the intricacies of business affairs.



He had always presumed her accomplishments were more a stroke of fortune than expetise.



"And what if I refuse? The company's right here. Take it if you can, or walk away." A derisive smirk twisted Caiden's lips, the frustration of being trapped evident in his expression.



Daniela's tone was serene as she delivered her ultimatum. "Each day you resist, the company will be shut down. I can absorb such losses. Can you?"


Caiden glared at her, incredulous. "What the hell,Daniela? You're more vicious than I ever thought you could be!"



The cost of shutting down would bleed the company of hundreds of thousands daily. Caiden's stake in this venture was personal-he aimed to lay down a sturdy groundwork for Joyce's offspring.


"This is standard protocol during a takeover. You've been running this firm for a decade. Don't tell me you're clueless about how a handover works.Your ignorance has been apparent for too long." Daniela's  eyes then fell to the business license under Caiden's foot. "Under your leadership, Harper Group nearly crumbled from a titan to ruins. We know who's responsible."



Rising, Daniela exuded an icy demeanor that made Caiden instinctively recoil.



Without a flicker of emotion, she approached him,locking eyes briefly, her expression unreadable.



Caiden, reminded of Brylee by the intensity in Daniela's gaze, took a cautious step back.



Daniela's eyes then dropped to the license on the floor,her voice cutting through the tension. "Pick itup."
###Chapter 153 The Harper Group Is Changing Hands	 
As Daniela's words echoed in the air, a chill of fear raced through Caiden. He instinctively recoiled,taking a step back.



Under the relentless intensity of Daniela's gaze,Caiden realized she was no longer the person he once knew. When had she turned into this formidable figure,utterly independent and unyielding? With a fiery intensity, she hissed through clenched teeth, "Pick it up.Now!"



Caiden's throat tightened, visibly swallowing his apprehension.



Observing his hesitation, Alexander intervened. He leaned down, scooping up the fallen business license,and extended it towards Daniela. "There's no need to be so severe. Caiden is still your father." He spoke with a measured calm.



However,Daniela snapped her head up, locking eyes with Alexander. A scornful laugh escaped her lips. "Is that so? Go ahead and wait for Richard to drop dead,and when some bastard shows up to rob you blind,we'll see if you'll be singing the same tune." Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.


Daniela didn't wait for an answer. "You have one week.I expect every document and account to be in order by then. Fail, and I'll personally drag every one of you down with this sinking Harper Group."



With a decisive turn, Daniela marched out, her steps resolute.



Caiden, consumed by a surge of rage, opened his mouth to shout after her, but his fury choked the words in his throat.



Daniela strode from the CEO's office to the conference room, her heels echoing sharply against the floor.



Within five minutes, she had gathered the department heads around the polished conference table.



With the current employee roster clutched in one hand,Daniela briskly checked off several names, then handed the list to the HR representative from Elite Lux.Her voice was firm, her command unequivocal. "By tomorrow, anyone whose name is crossed out better be out of Harper Group. I don't want to see their faces again."



Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with  Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.

"By tomorrow, anyone whose name is crossed out better be out of Harper Group. I don't want to see their faces again."



Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with shock and  disbelief. One of them, his finger jabbed  towards Daniela in accusation, sputtered, "Who the hell do you think you are? You can't just fire us! Do you realize how long we've served here? Do you know how close your father and I are?"



Daniela, leaning forward with her palms flat against the cool surface of the table, met their gazes with a steady, unflinching look. "I don't give a damn about how long you've been here or your ties with Caiden.From this moment forward, I'm the only Harper who matters here."



She then snatched up the finance report, scanning its contents with eyes that seemed to burn with resolve.The finance manager quivered, his face a mask of anxiety as her scrutiny bore into him.


Addressing the visibly shaken manager, Daniela's tone was icy as she delivered her demand. "Inform Caiden that he needs to return every single penny he siphoned from Harper Group. If he fails to comply, I will not hesitate to press charges for embezzlement and ensure he spends his remaining days behind bars."



With a swift mental tally, Daniela concluded, "The total comes to precisely one hundred eighty million.Additionally, there's a villa on the east side of the city purchased under the company's name for Jack Harper.Liquidate it and return the funds to our accounts."



Leaning against the doorframe, Caiden felt as if a fist  had slammed into his stomach.



He watched, his eyes wide, as Daniela unleashed a torrent of sharp questions at the managers from operations, development, and marketing.


One after another, these seasoned players in corporate politics crumbled beneath her relentless interrogation.



In that instant, a grim, icy realization dawned on Caiden.



Daniela had him completely at her mercy.



When she finally exited, the conference room descended into a hushed silence.



Not a single soul dared to speak.



They exchanged wary glances before dispersing quickly to compile the information Daniela had commanded.



As they hustled out, they brushed past Caiden, giving him only fleeting glances before lowering their gazes and scurrying away to attend to their duties.



It was clear to everyone that the reins of Harper Group were being handed over.



The days of easy rides were decisively behind them. Caiden remained rooted to the spot, watching as those who had previously sought his favor now passed him by without a word.


A frigid weight pressed down on his chest, growing heavier with each passing moment.
###Chapter 154 You Remind Me Of Someone I Knew
"Whatdid you just say?" Katrina burst out, her voice seething with rage inside the hospital walls.


She had just ended a phone call and her first impulse was to unleash her fury on Caiden, but she restrained herself.


Taking several deep, calming breaths did little to soften the icy edge in her voice. "Caiden, my cousin just called. Have you really dismissed their whole family from the company?"


Caiden was seated on a bench, distress evident as he ran his fingers through his hair. "Daniela stormed into the office today and completely overran my authority!"



Katrina had braced herself for Daniela's bold moves against Caiden, yet the extent of the purge took her by surprise. All her carefully placed allies within Harper Group had been ousted overnight.



To the outside world, it might appear that only her cousin's family was tied closely to her,but she had strategically positioned individuals across crucial departments like finance, marketing, and public relations. Now, they had all been swept away wvithout exception.



Daniela's audacity left Katrina reeling. In that moment,she understood just how much she had underestimated Daniela's capabilities.



"Daniela even mentioned that the villa we acquired for Jack needs to be sold off and the assets liquidated,"Caiden continued, a mix of anger and disbelief in his voice. "She's also demanding that all the embezzled funds and transferred assets be returned to the company."



"How on earth does she know all these details about our business?" Katrina pressed, incredulity lacing her voice.



"How should I know? There's got to be a spy among us!" The very idea of Daniela tearing apart the company he'd nurtured for more than ten years hit Caiden like a punch in the gut,leaving him seething with unease.



In that regard, Daniela was a carbon copy of her mother-cold, calculating, and utterly heartless.



A deep frown creased Caiden's brow, his mind a whirlwind of disarray.



Daniela's assertive actions earlier had filled him with dread, planting seeds of profound anxiety within him "The funds have been transferred, and the villa's in our name now. You're still her father, Caiden. Even if she cuts you off, she wouldn't drag you into court.Just let her be!"



Katrina, ever the optimist, clung to the hope that Daniela would not abandon Harper Group.



Caiden's voice was a low murmur, tinged with certainty. "No, Katrina, you don't understand Daniela.She's relentless, just like her mother. If we don't meet her demands,she'll take legal action without a second thought."



Though Katrina scorned Caiden's timidity inwardly,she maintained a cheerful demeanor. "Alright, let's not rely on her then. What if I manage it? I can sell the villa and bring back the overseas funds. Would that work for you?"



This suggestion finally brought a sense of relief to Caiden.



Once Caiden had left, Joyce turned to Katrina with a hint of reluctance in her voice. "Mom, all this should be mine. Why should I have to return anything to Daniela?"



As she sat beside Jack's cradle, Katrina's gaze rested on the newborn, her lips curling into a soft, serene smile. "Don't worry; I know what I'm doing. What belongs to you will always remain yours. No one can take that away."



Katrina then leaned forward, engaging playfully with Jack,who responded with joyful giggles.



When Daniela returned from her meeting at Harper Group,her demeanor was noticeably subdued.



Observing this, Lillian turned to Cedric, her voice tinged with concern. "What should we do now?"



Cedric didn't respond; instead, he walked purposefully into the kitchen. Moments later, he returned, bearing a plate of Daniela's favorite pastries, and gently tapped on her office door.



Inside, the business certificate that had been tarnished and trampled upon lay cleaned and flattened on the desk.



Setting the pastries aside, Cedric picked up a damp cloth and began to cleanse every speck of dirt from the certificate.



Only after restoring it to pristine condition did he place it in a new frame and returned it to its rightful spot on Daniela's desk.



"Things that get dirty can be cleaned. What's  important is ensuring that what's taken is always returned."



Daniela looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the warm,ambient light of the office. In Cedric's serene expression,she recognized something deeply familiar."Cedric, you remind me of someone I once knew in my childhood."
###Chapter 155 Cedric Lost His Temper
The moment Daniela's words hit him, Cedric's shoulders went rigid, his tension palpable.



He remained hunched over for an extended period, his heart racing wildly in the oppressive quiet.



Then,he gradually straightened, his eyes locking with Daniela's for a brief moment before he could utter a word.



Abruptly, the office door burst open.



Katrina appeared in the doorway, her face buried in her hands,sobbing uncontrollably.



Daniela's brow furrowed in response.



Out of breath, the secretary burst into the room,her voice trembling. "Ms. Harper, I'm so sorry! I tried to stop her, but she pushed right past me!"



Katrina collapsed against the desk, her tears falling uncontrollably as she begged, "Daniela, your father is in a dire state! You need to go to him."



Shock rippled through Cedric's face, his features  twisting in disbelief.



Peering through her handkerchief, Katrina caught Daniela's gaze-cold, detached, her piercing eyes unflinching as they stared back.


A relentless pounding filled Katrina's chest, her heartbeat surging with raw emotion.



"Why are you looking at me like that?" Katrina demanded, her panic barely masked by a sharp edge in her tone.



She sensed an unspoken accusation in Daniela's steady gaze, an intangible something she couldn't identify.



"Oh dear!" Katrina's distress intensified, her actions becoming more theatrical. "Daniela, you can spew all the nonsense you want about cutting ties, but at the end of the day, his blood still runs in your veins. Your father's about to die, and you act like it's nothing What the hell is wrong with you? How can you be so ruthless?"



Daniela rose slowly, her eyes narrowing,scrutinizing Katrina as if she were a suspect under interrogation."Yes, I am ruthless. Knowing that, why bother coming to me?"



Katrina, taken aback, had not anticipated such calm composure from Daniela, nor such a chilling retort. For a brief moment, she was momentarily speechless,the thick layers of makeup unable to mask the crimson spreading across her cheeks. "You..."



"Funny how this works," Daniela declared, her voice sharp and emphatic. "Caiden was perfectly healthy before.Now,suddenly, when I take over the company,he becomes sick? Katrina, don't you think it's a little too convenient to be a coincidence?"



At her words, Cedric glared at Daniela, his mind racng.She had the chance to destroy the Harper family and turn the company inside out, but instead, she only took 51% of the shares.



Katrina's heart raced, yet she managed to maintain a composed facade. "Daniela, what exactly do you mean by that? Are you implying I harmed your father?Even if you refuse to acknowledge me as your stepmother, my devotion to your father is genuine.I couldn't possibly want any harm to come to him just for some minor profit. If you truly doubt his condition,perhaps you should verify it yourself."



Daniela's gaze was icy as she fixed it on Katrina."Harper Group means more to you than a 'minor profit,' doesn't it? You'd stop at nothing to get what you want,right?"



A luxury villa and offshore assets-how could anyone reduce those to minor profit? Daniela turned and made her way downstairs, Cedric on her heels.



As she approached the car, she swung the door open and found Cedric already waiting inside.



Daniela tilted her head slightly, a faint, amused smile playing on her lips. "Cedric, honestly, you don't have to follow me around like this. They wouldn't dare touch me."



Cedric's face was a mask of icy severity, contrasting sharply with Daniela's demeanor. He fixed her with a piercing gaze and questioned, "What are you suspecting?"



Upon hearing Katrina's mention of Caiden's illness,Daniela had remained unmoved. But Cedric's question made her hesitate momentarily. Then, with a faint smile, she responded, "What could I possibly suspect?Didn't Katrina accuse that I suspect she refused to return the money and decided to hurt Caiden over it?"



Cedric crossed his arms, his gaze unwavering and full of curiosity."And?"



Daniela blinked, chuckling. "And what more is there to say?"



"What do you think? Is there more?" "I'm not sure."


The car was gripped by a suffocating stillness, thiek with unspoken tension.



The driver stole glances at them through the rearview mirror, picking up on the charged atmosphere.



What exactly were they discussing?


He could grasp each word, but their conversation seemed like a puzzle, the pieces not quite fitting together.



Halfway through the rde. Daniela started to think Cedric had given up on conversation entirely.



However,Cedric exhaled sharply, turning to face her more fully. "Why did you only claim 51 percent of Harper Group's shares? Why weren't you surprised about Caiden's condition? And why did you confront Katrina in such a manner?"



Daniela was bombarded with questions, each one striking with increasing intensity.



The driver,eavesdropping with a mix of curiosity and confusion,found himself pondering the same things.



He stole another glance at her through the rearview mirror. This time, Daniela remained silent, her usual poise replaced by a visible unease.



For the first time, she seemed genuinely troubled,sparking a flicker of intrigue in the driver. He was about to look again when Cedric's intense gaze turned from Daniela's perturbed expression to the driver.



Sensing Cedric's scrutiny, the driver quickly straightened up, his attention snapping forward.


"Then..." Daniela began, her voice lacking its usual conviction. "Why do you think that is?"



"I don't know! But there must be a reason you're keeping from me!" Cedric's voice brimmed with frustration.



As someone who held a high position, he was accustomed to masking his emotions. But now, his fury was unmistakable,coursing through him alongside the sting of betrayal.



"Daniela, you don't need to explain yourself, but until I grasp your intentions, don't assume you can operate independently. I'll be keeping an eye on you!"



He was resolute about not leaving her side until he had neutralized any threats. His intuition hinted at the motives behind Daniela's actions, though he remained uncertain. Clenching his jaw, his grip tightened on his knee.



He turned to look at her, the interplay of light and shadows from the passing streetlamps casting her features in a dramatic relief. Her eyes,usually vibrant,now appeared dim and weary.



The sight softened his resolve momentarily, and he found himself reluctant to press her further.
###Chapter 156 Cause Of Death
The driver struggled to make sense of the conversation.



However,having worked for Phillips Group for years,he had seen Cedric evolve into an impressive and authoritative individual.


Was this really how he intended to charm a woman?



Miguel Powell, the driver, felt drained just observing the scene.



As Daniela stepped out of the car, Miguel let out a heavy sigh. "Mr. Phillips?"


Cedric stopped in his tracks. "Yes? What's wrong?"



Miguel massaged his temples. "Have you ever even tried to impress a woman? You're going about it all wrong! Seriously, did you just tell her, 'I'll be watching you'? To anyone else, that'd sound downright creepy -like a stalker!"



Cedric stared blankly, bewildered. "What?" Could his words really have been taken that way? Miguel sighed again. "You scared Ms. Harper so much that she stayed completely silent for the rest of the trip."



Cedric scoffed,rolling his eyes. "Her? Scared? No way.She's the most fearless person I know. Honestly,if anyone's scared, it's probably me, not her."


Without another word, he slammed the car door and strode off towards the hospital.


As he vanished into the hospital, MMiguel shook his head. To him, Cedric seemed less like a man wooing someone and more like someone ready to start a confrontation.



Daniela had barely stepped out of the elevator when Cedric came charging up the stairs, slightly winded.



Daniela arched an eyebrow, her frown deepening."Was it absolutely necessary to tail me so closely?You should at least think about your reputation."



Gasping for breath, Cedric placed his hands on his hips. "I'm only here because you left me no choice!"



Her stern expression eased as a hint of amusement glimmered in her eyes. "And how, exactly, did I force you? I haven't done a thing."



"Don't play innocent! I know how you are. You keep  everything inside and never open up. Fine, Daniela,"he muttered, flinging his suit jacket over his arm,frustration coloring his voice. "Mark my words-one day, you'll come to me and tell me everything on your own!"



Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile.



As she pushed open the hospital room door,Cedric trailed in behind her. By then, his entire demeanor had changed-his jacket was back in place, and his expression was icy and unreadable.



Alexander was seated inside the room. He hadn't anticipated Cedric tagging along, and the sight of them together left him with an odd feeling.



The one thought circling his mind was-could Daniela actually be thinking about being with Cedric?



Daniela's eyes flickered briefly towards Caiden.Without another word, she walked away.



The hospital belonged to Cedric, and as soon as he arrived, the director rushed to greet him in person.



The attending doctor started explaining Caiden's condition. "He's suffering from severe inflammation,though the exact cause remains unknown. We're treating it while conducting further investigations."



"Is it life-threatening?" Daniela asked, her tone measured.



The doctor shook his head. "It doesn't seem to be life -threatening at this point."



Daniela gave a curt nod, her voice polite but distant."I appreciate your efforts."



The doctor stole another glance at Daniela. Seizing a moment when no one was watching, he stood near the door and discreetly snapped a photo of her.



Cedric spotted it right away. He marched out of the room towards the doctor, reaching for his phone, but the man effortlessly evaded him.



Cedric let out a frustrated sigh. "Fine, keep the photo,but don't you dare post it anywhere."



Russell Steele, the doctor, smirked and waved his phone teasingly. "Too late. Quick fingers-I've already shared it in the group chat."



Grinding his teeth, Cedric grabbed his phone. As expected, his group chat was now flooded with endless notifications, his friends mercilessly teasing him.



Cedric's expression turned stormy as he typed a curt,icy reply. "Cut it out, or I'm leaving the group."


Russell laughed and shook his head. "Cedric, with a  temper like that, do you honestly think you'll win her over? No wonder you've been single for over two decades.At this rate, you'll end up growing old alone."



It was the second time that day his attempts-or failure-to woo a woman had been ridiculed.Cedric could feel his irritation boiling over.



Russell cast a look toward the hospital room,one brow lifting in amusement. "You've set your sights pretty high, haven't you? She's the head of Elite Lux, and her wealth could probably buy an entire nation. So, what's your angle? Marrying into her family or settling for the role of a hidden admirer?"



Cedric's mouth tightened in frustration as he murmured, "That's assuming she'd even consider letting me marry in."


Russell stopped in his tracks, his eyes going wide with disbelief. "Hold on, are you still Cedric? Did you seriously just say that? She must really be one of a kind."



He chuckled and began making his way towards the hospital room,but Cedric reached out and yanked him back by the arm.



Russell turned back, puzzled. "What is it now?"



Cedric clenched his jaw. "Don't go saying anything dumb. She's shy." Russell arched an eyebrow as he leaned slightly to peer into the room.



Daniela radiated authority, like a queen overseeing her domain, while two nervous women in the corner looked as though they barely dared to draw breath.



"Shy?" Russell asked, clearly unconvinced. "Are we even talking about the same person?"



"Not shy in that sense," Cedric replied with a weary sigh. "She avoids forming deep connections."



It stemmed from losing her mother at a young age.Deep down, she believed relationships were fleeting.So she naturally kept her distance.



Cedric had watched her closely for years. Daniela unconsciously maintained a distance from everyone.Beyond a select few senior members at Elite Lux, she rarely let anyone get close. She was always courteous but emotionally distant, never revealing her true self.



Her firm emotional barriers weren't intentional-they were instinctive, buried deep within her psyche.


That was exactly why he had held back from making any moves for so long.



If he hadn't picked up on the possibility that Katrina's schemes could endanger Daniela's life, he wouldn't have said what he did earlier.


"Russell, I need you to help me wwith something,"Cedric said.



Russell slid a piece of gum into his mouth and offered another to Cedric, who shook his head in refusal."What's it about?"



"I need you to pull up something in the system for me.Find Daniela's mother's file. I want to see what her official cause of death was recorded as."



Russell stopped chewing mid-motion,his eyes drifting instinctively towards Daniela. "Cedric, you're in for a tough journey."
###Chapter 157 | Don't Trust Him
After Cedric had gone, Katrina sat inside, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. "Daniela, just look at your father now, lying there like this. And all that money overseas..."



Daniela cast a glance at Caiden, lying in the bed with his mouth slack on one side. Her tone stayed even."That's not what matters right now."



She knew that if she pushed Katrina too hard, the woman might very well resort to killing Caiden.



Daniela's goal was to make Katrina expose herself-not to start fighting over the inheritance yet.



Hearing her response, Katrina couldn't hide the flicker of delight that lit up her face. She bobbed her head eagerly. "Yes, exactly! That's what family is allabout,Daniela. Blood is thicker than water, after all. I knew you still cared for your father. So regarding the villa..."


Daniela cut her off mid-sentence, her voice unwavering. "I'll arrange for someone to sell it."



Katrina's cheerful expression faltered. She forced an uneasy laugh. "Daniela, isn't it a little inappropriate to sell your father's villa while he's still unconscious?We don't even know when he'll regain consciousness.There's no urgency here. His belongings aren't going anywhere,are they?"



Despite her calm words, Katrina's thoughts were whirling. She had already begun contacting potential buyers for the villa, planning to funnel the money into a hidden account where Daniela would never trace it.



If her scheme unraveled, Katrina figured she could always pin the blame on Caiden and let him take the fall.



For now, she took Daniela's hospital visit as a sign that she still had some concern for her father.



Katrina had thought everything through, sure that Daniela would go along with her plan. But Daniela's reaction completely threw her off.


"Is that villa Caiden's own property? It was bought with the company's money. As the main shareholder,I have every right to manage it. What makes that wrong?"


At Daniela's biting response, Katrina's fists tightened in anger."Yes,but-"



Before she finish, Daniela interrupted, her voice turning icier. "Or do you expect me to handle the overseas assets as well?" The mention of foreign assets made Katrina's face contort with an involuntary twitch. "Fine. If you insist,go ahead. The villa isn't really worth much anyway. If the company needs the money, then..."



Her voice was composed, but inside,Katrina was seething with fury. Daniela! This scheming woman!


"But the villa is a huge property, and as a young woman,you might find it difficult to manage the sale.Alexander is here today, and you trust him,don't you?Why not let him take care of it for you? Doesn't that sound better?"



Katrina's plan was straightforward. If Alexander took charge,she could control the timing.



He could drag things out long enough for her to sell the villa and move the money before Daniela even noticed.



Alexander had remained silently in the corner,observing.



Katrina turned to him, flashing a sweet smile."Alexander, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a burden for you. Daniela trusts you implicitly, and if I handled it,she wouldn't feel comfortable."



Alexander nodded slightly, his tone collected and professional. "Of course, leave it to me. Bennett Group specializes in real estate, so selling a villa is no problem. Since both you and Daniela trust me, I'll..."



Before he could finish, a voice as cold and sharp as a blade interrupted him. "I don't trust him."



Alexander froze, his unfinished sentence hanging in the air. Slowly, he turned to face Daniela. "What did you just say?"



Daniela repeated her words, emphasizing each one."I said, I don't trust Alexander to handle this."
###Chapter 158 He Regretted It
Alexander stood motionless, his eyes locked on Daniela, unable to believe what he was hearing.



Her face remained impassive and her gaze never once met his. Her profile was serene yet cold, a detachment that sent a jolt of unease through him.



"Daniela..." Alexander inhaled deeply, trying to steady his racing heart. "You don't trust me?"



Katrina,thrilled by the drama, pretended to be stunned and covered her mouth dramatically. "Daniela! What did you just say? You don't trust Alexander? The man you loved for ten years! The man you married! And now you're saying you don't trust him to take care of this for you? You..."



She paused deliberately, her words suspended in the air,intensifying Alexander's discomfort.



Alexander's fists clenched at his sides, his pride stinging from the blow.



"Daniela, what are you implying?" he demanded, his tone sharp as his gaze bore into her. "Do you think I'll try to pocket the money? Or do you think I'd side with someone else?" Recently, Alexander had been reflecting on the past.


The memories resurfaced in quiet, unassuming moments, and with each passing thought, he realized how much Daniela had sacrificed for him. She had bent her own rules for him time after time, yet he had never truly appreciated it.



These revelations stirred something deep within him.He had come today hoping for a chance to repair their broken bond.



He had come with honest intentions. And what did he receive in return?



Alexander was stunned to find that his rare display of goodwill was met with this. He felt a deep sting of insult.He couldn't believe Daniela would turn on him like this.



Locking eyes with her, he pressed on, "Daniela, do you really think so little of me? That I can't tell right from wrong?" 



Daniela didn't actually think Alexander would embezzle.She simply wanted nothing more to do with him. After all, hadn't he always chosen Katrina and her daughter? And now, he was acting wounded? Who was he trying to deceiv/e?



Cedric stood behind Daniela, silently watching the  scene, his face betraying no emotion. But inside, he knew exactly what was unfolding. Men always had a way of seeing through each other.


So now, Alexander regretted it? He wanted to fix things?



Cedric's eyes darkened.



"Daniela, you're being too harsh," Katrina interjected,attempting to play the role of the peacemaker."Look at Alexander-you've hurt him deeply. You can't just erase the past because you have someone new in your life. Your father and I are family;no matter how much you hurt us, we'll accept it. But Alexander isn't.You're divorced,remember? Is it fair to target him?"



Cedric frowned and was about to speak when Daniela raised a hand to stop him. She then turned to face Katrina,her gaze sharp and cutting like a knife.



Katrina's confidence wavered, her heart pounding as Daniela's cold stare pierced through her.


"Katrina, there's no need for you to add fuel to the fire.I stopped caring about Alexander a long time ago.Don't think you can use the past to manipulate me.Let me be clear-I do what I want. As for you,you can plot all you want, but it'll be in vain. I tolerated you before, but not anymore. Soon enough, you'll long for the dayswhen I was more patient with you." Her words were sharp and blunt, leaving Katrina completely humiliated.



She opened her mouth to fire back, but before she could say anything, Daniela spoke first. "Just days after my mother passed away, you moved into my house. A woman like you has no right to talk about morals or decency. Honestly, I thought you'd lost any shred of shame long ago."



Katrina shook with fury, her finger accusingly jabbing toward Daniela. "Daniela! I'm still your stepmother!How dare you speak to me this way?"



Daniela's eyes fixed on Katrina's sharply pointed red nail, the bold gesture only fueling her anger. Slowvly her expression hardened and her gaze deepened with intensity.



From the side, Alexander scowled and snapped,"Daniela, have you lost it? Do you even hear what you're saying? Calling Katrina that way means you're calling Caiden indecent too. He's your father, andhe's lying in that bed!"



Katrina's rage exploded. It had been years since anyone had the audacity to speak to her like this.



Had she known Daniela would cause so much trouble,she would've taken care of Daniela along with her mother all those years ago. She thrust her finger even closer to Daniela's face and screamed, "Daniela! You ungratefuI little brat! You're nothing but a motherless orphan! I'll teach you a lesson for your father!"



The instant the words left Katrina's mouth, a loud crack rang out through the room.



And then, the whole room went completely still.


Even Katrina froze, her mouth agape in disbelief.



At the doorway, Joyce froze, her face drained of color in surprise. The thermos she had been holding slipped from her grip and crashed to the floor with a loud clang.
###Chapter 159 Daniela Doesn't Want Alexander...
A sharp crash rang out, shattering the silence,followed by a haunting stillness.



Daniela slowly lifted her gaze, her expression icy,before casually pulling a wet wipe from her bag and cleaning her hands.



The simple gesture jolted Katrina back to reality.A piercing scream tore from her throat, echoing through every corner of the room. Pain shot through her injured finger.



Daniela leaned in, and her lips curled into a sinister smile as she asked, "Doesn't it hurt?"



Katrina gasped, her body trembling in fear. She saw Daniela's smile, but it was as if Brylee was standing before her.



Daniela met Katrina's gaze with calm detachment,offering a smile that seemed almost innocent. "You pushed your way into the Harper family right after my mother passed.Do you remember how that made me feel? Did you think I was too scared to speak up, or that Caiden mattered so much to me that I wouldn't dare upset him?" 
Cradling her broken finger, Katrina's fear deepened with every step Daniela took closer. She mumbled incoherently, her body shrinking back in terror. To her,Daniela appeared utterly unhinged.


"Katrina, I normally couldn't care less about you. But since you all insist on harassing me, let me make one thing clear-I won't hesitate to fight back."


Daniela's voice was soft, yet filled with an unmistakable steel.



The calmness on her face made a chill run down Katrina's spine.



In that moment, Daniela seemed to resemble Brylee more than ever.



She was beautiful, merciless, and uninterested in speaking a word more when a single action would suffice.



Fear crept slowly into Katrina's heart, tightening its grip.



Seeing Katrina cornered,Alexander quickly moved to help her.



But just as he took a step forward, someone stepped in his way. 
"Cedric!"



Cedric crossed his arms nonchalantly. "That's me."



"Do you see what Daniela's doing?" Alexander asked,his voice rising, "She's hurting Katrina. Aren't you concerned she might call the police? Are you just going to stand by and watch this?"


Cedric's laugh was low and unhurried. "Relax, buddy.I've got top-notch lawyers and endless financial support. Unless someone dies, this isn't a big deal."


Alexander stared, stunned by Cedric's obvious favoritism. "You're just letting her do this?" he asked,unable to hide his disbelief. ①



Cedric grinned again. "I'm courting her."



Alexander's shock quickly morphed into something darker. He locked eyes with Cedric, emphasizing each word. "Daniela was married before. She was married to me."



Cedric chuckled. "Oh my God,really?"



Alexander had known Cedric's interest in Daniela was more than just business. But Cedric was one of the most powerfuI men in Olisvine.



If Cedric wanted to have a fling with Daniela, Alexander could understand.



But hearing Cedric claim he was actively pursuing her?
That felt completely surreal.


He thought Cedric had lost his mind.



They were all insane.



On the other hand, Joyce was frantic, screaming about calling the police. Daniela,however, didn't seem bothered at all. She simply shrugged, settling into a chair as if she had all the time in the world.



Katrina teetered on the edge of unconsciousness,overwhelmed by pain.



Joyce,her voice trembling with worry, rushed to her side. "Mom, are you okay?"



Daniela was busy playing a shooting game on her phone, the loud blasts from the game echoing through the room. She appeared completely unfazed by Katrina's suffering or Caiden's critical state.



Joyce stood, fury flashing in her eyes as she glared at Daniela. "You're just here to make our lives hell, aren't you?"



Daniela didn't flinch. She gave a simple nod. "Yes.Isn't that clear? I'd say you're not exactly known for your intellect if you have to ask." Joyce seethed at Daniela's cold attitude. "How did you turn into this, Daniela? Just because you have money doesn't give you the right to do whatever you please!"



Daniela let out a dry laugh, her fingers still tapping at her game. "Maybe you should work your way up to mny level before you start lecturing me about what's possible or not. But I doubt that'll ever happen. With your lack of initiative, you'll never know what it's like to actually hold power."



Daniela tilted her head, pretending to sympathize."Even if you did marry Alexander, I highly doubt you'd ever really control his family's fortune."



Joyce's anger flared. But, unfortunately, Daniela's words hit home. She had never been quick on her feet. The only time she'd ever gotten the upper hand over Daniela was when Alexander left Daniela for her.



Now that it was obvious Daniela had no interest in Alexander anymore, Joyce had no way to claim another victory.



Her fury made her voice shake, but it was clear she couldn't land a hit on Daniela.



She couldn't even get close to Daniela,with Cedric standing guard near her, relaxed yet protective, like a warning to anyone who thought to approach Joyce balled her fists, her voice rising in a sharp,high -pitched tone. "Just wait! The police are on their way!"she yelled, her finger stabbing the air, aimed at Daniela.



At the mention of the police, Daniela paused her game. She raised her eyes slowly, her calm gaze settling on the finger Joyce had pointed at her.
###Chapter 160 Had Daniela Figured Something Out
 Joyce's confident stance faltered the moment Daniela's piercing gaze fixed on the finger she had raised.



Daniela gave a faint, knowing smirk before lowering her head, resuming her game.



When the police finally arrived,representatives from both Phillips Group and Elite Lux had already shown up.



Joyce, lacking the wit to keep up, found herself tangled in the barrage of legal arguments.



Meanwhile,Daniela's words were clear and precise. "It was an unfortunate accident. I'm more than willing to make amends and settle this fairly."



Joyce stood stunned, watching Daniela effortlessly play the same pity game Katrina often used.



Daniela told the police, "My stepmother has always harbored resentment towards me. After my mother passed, she convinced my father to sever our relationship. She married him just days after my mother's death. Now that my father is critically ill,she's barred me from visiting him. Naturally, I became  emotional..."



This strategy quickly made the legal complications fade away, and the matter was resolved swiftly.



Still reeling,Joyce watched as Daniela transferred $20,000 into the hospital account. Then with a sweet smile,Daniela addressed Katrina, who was pale from the pain of her fractured finger. "This money is for you. Get some medicine and take better care of that brain of yours."



Katrina tried to respond, but before she could utter a word, Daniela's voice grew colder. "Oh, and just so you know, I've been feeling a bit homesick lately. I'll be moving back tomorrow."



Katrina's expression changed drastically at her words.



Joyce scowled, her voice laced with indignation."What right do you think you have? Dad already severed ties with you!"



"Do you even think? If not, you might want to consider getting yourself a brain." Daniela leaned back,completely at ease. "Yes, Caiden cut ties with me.But the villa was my mother's. Under inheritance law, I still have a stake in it. I can move back whenever I choose,and not even Caiden can stop me-certainly not you."



Daniela stood, stretching lazily, her eyes sweeping over Katrina and Joyce with clear contempt."You two  should probably start praying that Caiden doesn't die anytime soon. Otherwise, the portion of the villa left to you might be smaller than a bathroom."



Her words landed like a heavy blow. Katrina's eyes widened in disbelief. The doctor, misreading her response, murmured, "I'll be more gentle."


Katrina's face remained torn, her mind swirling with confusion. Then, Daniela added the final blow. "I'll be on my way now. I have a feeling Caiden will wake soon. Don't you think so,Katrina?"



Katrina was stunned into silence, her thoughts scattered.



Joyce stormed over to Alexander, slipping her arm through his with a sense of urgency. "Alexander! Did you hear the way Daniela was talking? So sarcastic,so cold! Anyone who heard her would think we were the ones who killed Brylee! It's a blessing you didn't stay with her; she's totally out of her mind!"


Alexander wasn't so easily fooled. Joyce might have missed the meaning of Daniela's words, but he didn't.What did she mean by Caiden waking up soon? How could she possibly know?



Alexander narrowed his eyes, a growing suspicion forming as his gaze turned to Katrina.


Meanwhile, Katrina,getting ready for surgery on her  fractured finger,stepped out of the ward to make a call before signing the necessary forms.


In the quiet hospital garden, she whispered into the phone, "Mom, do you think Daniela has figured something out? Why would she suddenly want to move back? She has a prime spot in the Elite Lux building with a city view. Why would she want to move back?"



On the other end, her mother was playing cards."You're overthinking it. Daniela was just a kid back then. She was only five. Who remembers things from that age?"



Katrina's unease persisted. "Then why did she snap so suddenly? She's always been so calm, never argumentative. But today, she was completely different."



Her mother let out a soft laugh. "Maybe it's because of Alexander. She's probably just holding a grudge.Think about it-she loved him for so long. What's the term? Oh,right, sunk cost. Alexander's her sunk cost.She's upset she lost him and can't do anything about it,so now she's taking it out on you."



Katrina muttered quietly, "Is that really what it is?"


 
But something didn't sitright. Daniela didn't appear bitter. In fact, she seemed to have grown quite close to Cedric. She had even entrusted him with the sales of the villa.



Didn't that imply Cedric was now more significant to Daniela than Alexander?



The thought made Katrina boil with anger.



Daniela had lost Alexander but gained someone even more valuable-Cedric.



How could she have such luck?



If Cedric had chosen Joyce, it would've been perfect.



Her mother's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.
"Sweetheart, I'm out of money again. Send me half a million. And stop worrying about Daniela. Brylee was tough back then, but she couldn't outdo you in the end,right? You've done fine since then. If you handled Brylee,Daniela will be a breeze. And if things go south,just take care of her too. Problem solved."



Katrina ended the call, but her mind was still swirling with uncertainty.



Upstairs,Joyce summoned her for surgery, and Katrina made her way back to the surgical ward.



Had Daniela figured something out?
What was her real reason for coming back this time?


Lost in thought, she missed a step and tumbled down.



There was a sharp crack, and her whole hand snapped.



Her piercing scream rang out, reaching the underground parking lot.


In the parking lot, Cedric stopped Daniela just as she was about to enter her car.



She glanced up at him, asking, "What's going on?"
###Chapter 161 Alexander, You Annoy Me


Cedric's gaze was piercing.

In the dim light of the underground parking lot, his expression was unreadable, like a mask that gave nothing away.

Daniela pressed her lips together, and sensing the tension, she quietly asked, "What's wrong?"

Cedric locked eyes with Daniela.

There were so many things he wanted to ask, so many questions that swirled in his mind.

But as he looked into her clear eyes and heard her cool, almost distant tone, he found himself unable to voice any of them.

Instead, after a moment of silence, he spoke with determination."|fyou're moving back to your father's place, I'm coming with you."

Daniela had anticipated Cedric would ask something. But his declaration left her momentarily stunned."What? Why?" she questioned.

"I've already told you, I'm courting you. It was difficult enough living on separate floors at Elite Lux. If you move to your father's, it'll only make it harder for me to find reasons to be around you. So, you can go, but I'm coming with you."

The moment the words left his mouth, Cedric realized how unlikely his request sounded.

Daniela studied him for a long moment.

Just as she was about to respond, footsteps echoed across the concrete. Upon recognizing the figure, her expression hardened.

It was Alexander. Alexander stode forward quickly, his irritation clear as he feached out to grab Dáníela's afm.

Cedric stepped forward, placing himself between them and blocking Alexander's path.

Alexander stopped abruptly, his gaze lifting to meet Cedric's. The two men stared at each other in silence for what felt like an eternity.

"l just need to ask Daniela a few things. Would you mind?" Alexander said, his tone controlled.

Cedric stood firm, hands in his pockets, his posture radiating defiance. "I'm not stopping you from speaking."

From behind Cedric, Daniela noticed for the first time just how tall he truly was. Being so close, she caught a subtle whiff of his cologne-cool and crisp. It was a stark contrast to his earlier blunt, almost aggressive demeanor.

Daniela glanced up, noting the broadness of his shoulders. For the first time, she thought of Cedric as a reassuring presence, someone who could actually make her feel safe.

"Say what you need to, or leave," Cedric said to Alexander, his voice sharp.

Daniela leaned against the car, silent and seemingly uninterested in getting involved.

Alexander immediately picked up on how unusual Daniela's reaction was.

She had always been distant and fiercely independent. She preferred to handle her own matters. But now,she was letting Cedric send him away without even speaking up.

She appeared calm, her lips curled into a faint smile.

This wasn't the woman he remembered.

The realization made Alexander uneasy. He moved to the side,reaching again for Daniela's hand.

Cedric pushed Alexander's arm aside, enough to make it sting.

Alexander could feel the tense energy radiating from Cedric, the sudden coldness in his manner.
He realized that if he kept challenging Cedric, he might end up like Katrina in the hospital.

"Daniela, I just want to talk. You don't have to treat me like I'ma criminal."

Sensing Cedric's growing tension, Daniela gently pulled at his sleeve. "Stay here with me. Right by my side."

Cedric, who had been glaring at Alexander, softened instantly. He nodded and stepped to stand beside Daniela.

"Go ahead," Daniela said, straightening up as her smile vanished.

Alexander's eyes darted between her and Cedric, confused by Daniela's sudden change in behavior."You really think I'm that dangerous? I won't hurt you. You can't even talk to me in private?"

Every bit of his behavior was for her benefit.

He had pursued her, only to end up humiliated like this?①

Alexander glanced at Daniela, his eyes revealing the hurt he felt.

"If you have something to say, say it now. Otherwise, I'm leaving," Daniela said.

Alexander pressed his lips together. "So, this is some kind of game, huh? You're showing off this cozy act with Cedric in front of me, hoping it'll stir some jealousy or anger. You think it'll make me reconsider pursuing you? Here's the truth-you're completely missing the point. This kind of behavior won't bring me closer to you; in fact, it's doing the opposite."

As always, he was confident that, no matter what, Daniela still wanted him deep down. He believed her seeming closeness with Cedric was merely to provoke him.

At first, he had tolerated her behavior, but now he admitted he could no longer ignore the growing irritation in his heart. So, he stated it plainly. He could no longer play this game of hard-to-get

Daniela squinted, almost laughing at how absurd it all seemed. She gave him a thumbs-up in response to his cold stare. "It's a real shame you're not writing novels with that kind of imagination."

Alexander narrowed his eyes, displeased. "What do you mean?" "You said I don't understand men. Do you understand women? I can't speak for other women, buf as for me..." Daniela looked at him, her eyes now empty of the passion they once held for Alexander. That passion had been replaced by cold indifference. "Once I make up my mind to leave, I never look back."

Daniela took pride in her straightforwardness. When she liked someone, she made it clear. And when she didn't, she simply walked away. She couldn't understand where Alexander's delusion had come from.)

Alexander stood frozen, taken aback by her response. For a moment, Daniela's words felt like a sharp stab to his chest.

He locked eyes with her, noticing the seriousness that lingered in her gaze. Panic crept in, a strange feeling that he wasn't used to, but one he knew he didn't welcome.

Against his own instincts, he couldn't help but ask, "You're really going to act like this?"

This time, Daniela let out a genuine laugh, her smile dripping with sarcasm."D。you really have to keep acting like this? Alexander, I've completely lost patience with your nonsense."
###Chapter 162 Love Me


A sudden, sharp pain jabbed at Alexander's chest. He stared at Daniela's emotionless face, desperately searching for any sign of feeling. "Daniela, do you have any idea why I came after you?"

Her face stayed composed, her eyes empty of any emotion, as if she were staring at someone utterly foolish -or maybe even a lunatic.

The look she gave him hit a nerve, and Alexander felt his emotions begin to unravel. His voice rose with frustration as he pointed to the stairs. "Katrina's in surgery, Joyce is falling apart, and your father is still fighting for his life. Yet here I am, after you. Do you know why? Because I'm worried about you, Daniela! You shouldn't move back. After today, Katrina will never let this go. Joyce may be a fool, but Katrina isn't. She's calculating, and you're too emotional. How do you think you stand a chance against her? And your father doesn't even care about you. Why return to a place where you're not wanted? Is it just for the villa? You don't need the money, Daniela. I don't understand. Why are you intentionally walking into danger? What do you hope to accomplish? Is it because of me?"

At first, Daniela thought Alexander might still possess some intelligence. But the moment she heard his last sentence, a wave of disgust washed over her. Without saying a word, she tuned, opened the car door, and climbed in.

"Daniela, is that a yes?" Alexander shouted, his frustration building as he slapped the car window in exasperation."Are you afraid I'll marry Joyce and you're trying to stop it? Are you worried someone else will take me from you? Is that why you're putting yourself in danger? Tell me, Daniela, is that what this is all about?"

Alexander was desperate to confirm his suspicions. He had spent so much time thinking about it upstairs,and this was the only explanation that seemed to fit. Why else would Daniela choose to move back? Nothing else made sense.

Joyce's earlier words echoed in his mind, cutting through his thoughts. "I bet Daniela still has feelings for you. That's why she's moving back!" In that instant, everything fell into place for Alexander. He was certain he'd figured it all out.

That was why he had followed her.

He needed to tell Daniela that there was no reason for her to risk herself on his behalf.

If she still wanted him, he would gladly marry her again.

What else could she possibly want?

Watching Daniela's car drive off, Alexander stood there in the parking lot and yelled after her,"Daniela,if you have a change of heart, come find me! I'll give you a few days to think it through!"

Daniela sat in the driver's seat, with Cedric beside her in the passenger seat.

He had been hoping that Alexander would ask the questions he had been dying to know.But...

Cedric came to a harsh realization-Alexander's mindset was no different from Joyce's. Two complete fools!

Despite himself, Cedric glanced at Daniela. Her lips were pursed, and a faint trace of anger shadowed her face.

After a brief pause, he nervously broke the silence with a question. "You don't like Alexander,do you?"

As soon as the words left his mouth, Daniela burst out laughing, taken aback by how ridiculous the question was.

She glanced at Cedric, a mix of amusement and annoyance in her eyes. For a brief moment, she entertained the thought of kicking him out of the car. But then, she shook her head with a sigh and said,"Cedric,I swear your brain works just like Joyce's."

"So,why are you angry?" he asked.」

Daniela went quiet, her thoughts momentarily drifting. She shut her eyes, releasing a long,slow breath.When she spoke again, her voice was soft, almost a whisper. "Because I'm embarrassed."

She felt ashamed of who she had been-someone so consumed by her feelings for Alexander.Now, confronting Alexander's twisted conclusions and selfish assumptions, all she could feel was regret.

As if that wasn't enough, Cedric, who was usually so perceptive, had just asked her if she still had feelings for Alexander.

Daniela closed her eyes once more, trying to calm the storm of emotions raging within her.

Just as she found a moment of stillness, Cedric's voice broke through, low and steady. "Daniela, love me. I'll be loyal to you for the rest of my life."
###Chapter 163 Telling Her What's In His Heart


Throughout the drive back, Daniela remained silent, her gazefixed on the passing scenery.

When they arrived at Elite Lux, she reached to unbuckle her seatbelt, only to feel Cedric's hand clutching the sleeve of her jacket.

Daniela glanced down at his hand. His fingers, long and tense, were gripping her sleeve so tightly that the tips were turning white.

Cedric noticed her looking and, for a brief moment, his fingers gave a small, almost hesitant twitch. But instead of releasing her, he gripped her sleeve even tighter, as if letting go wasn't an option.

Daniela lifted her eyes to meet his.

Beneath the bright lights of Elite Lux's grand entrance, she saw the resolute determination etched in Cedric's face.

With a quiet sigh, she said simply,"Letgo."

Instead of obeying, Cedric's grip grew firmer.

His jaw tightened before he spoke, his voice low but brimming with emotion. "Tell me, Daniela, what makes Alexander better than me? Why does he get a chance, and I don't? Whatever it is you don't like about me, I'll change it. Just tell me!"

Daniela remained quiet, her lips pressing into a thin line.

After a moment, he let go of her sleeve. His shoulders sagged, and in a softer tone, he muttered, "Never mind. Just go upstairs."	J

The sudden shift in his tone caught Daniela off guard.

It was clear Cedric didn't want to release her, but he couldn't bring himself to force her into an uncomfortable situation. He hated seeing her upset and refused to be the reason behind her distress.

Daniela thought about giving a simple excuse to brush him off. But when she looked at Cedric, with his quiet patience and sincerity, she realized she couldn't bring herself to lie. So she chose to tell the truth.

Sitting up straighter, she met his gaze and began to speak slowly. "Cedric, you're a kind person, truly. But you've seen everything that's happened to me, haven't you?"

Cedric lifted his head, his eyes searching hers.

The soft glow inside the car cast shadows across her face, leaving half of it obscured in dim light as she sat upright.

"I once tried with everything I had to chase after Alexander," she continued, her voice steady but distant."The entire city saw it, so there's no need for me to rehash the story. I thought I loved him, thought I wanted him more than anything. But the day our divorce was finalized, all I felt was relief. That's when I understood -no matter how much you think you love someone, those feelings can erode. Little arguments, tiny cracks,day by day, they break even the strongest connections. In the end, most relationships are built on shared goals, not passion or romance. Take Caiden, for example. He adored my mother. If she so much as took a sip of coffee, he'd fret over whether it was too hot. If she went to a party, he'd stand outside the villa all night, just waiting. I thought that was the greatest love anyone could ask for. But what happened? Not even a week after my mother died, Katrina moved into her room, took her spot, and sat at her dressing table like it was hers all along. I've seen all kinds of ugliness in life, but nothing compares to the darkness that people hide in their hearts. Mine's been empty for a long time. I have nothing left to offer. Cedric, you're special.I truly hope you find someone equally special, someone who can give you what you deserve. Do you understand?"

Daniela managed a faint smile as she looked at him."Let's just be friends for life, okay? Once the initial spark fades, what's left is just the wreckage of routine and boredom. Why go through all that trouble?"

With that, she reached for the door handle and pushed it open.

She stepped out of the car, but before leaving, she glanced back at him. Her voice was gentle, almost kind."Go home, Cedric, and get some rest. Tomorrow morning, we'lI still be friends who can count on each other.That's more than enough, isn't it? I've always been distant, Cedric. Loving someone is never come naturally to me. Alexander wasn't wrong when he said that. If I had truly loved him during those ten years, I wouldn't have walked away as easily as I did. That just proves my feelings were shallow. The truth is, l've always loved myself more than anyone else."

Daniela offered Cedric a faint smile, her voice gentle but firm. "Choosing someone like me, Cedric, would only mean settling for less than you deserve. Why do that to yourself? You're too smart for that, aren't you?"

Then she stepped out of the car and shut the door behind her with a soft, decisive click.

The weight of her parting words snapped Cedric back to reality. He leaped out of the car and bolted after Daniela.

At the building's entrance, his hands trembled as he fumbled for his keycard. When he finally got inside, the elevator doors were already closing.

He dashed up the stairs, taking them two at a time. But the second he arrived at Daniela's apartment, he heard the faint click of her door closing.

He knocked on the door, urgency in every pound.

After a moment, Josie appeared, her eyes heavy with sleep.′′Siriwhat's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Cedric didn't answer. His heart was racing, consumed by frustration and regret over his missed opportunity.

He raced upstairs and pounded on Daniela's door with renewed desperation. But the door remained firmly shut.

Cedric leaned against the door, his voice breaking as he spoke. "Daniela, stop lying to me! You're not Alexander-you're not heartless! And I'm not like you. I won't let misfortune dictate my life! You call me smart, but I'm not. I'm just a fool. When I set my heart on something, I don't let it go!Ever!"

Even after he finished speaking, his breaths came heavy, yet he stood his ground, refusing to budge.

At the far end of the hallway, Lillian and Ryan froze, their eyes wide with surprise.

After a moment of stunned silence, they exchanged glances and gave Cedric an encouraging thumbs-up For the first time, he was taking a stand for himself.

That night, Cedric remained resolute. He sat quietly outside Daniela's door, his back against the wall,waiting patiently.

He was determined to lay bare every emotion that had been bottled up in his heart.
###Chapter 164 Cedric, Don't Try To Charm Me


The following morning, Daniela opened her door to find Cedric crouched outside, looking like he hadn't moved all night.

The moment she stepped into the hallway, Cedric sprang to his feet and brushed off his pants.

"Daniela, I'm not scared," Cedric blurted, his voice breaking the silence.

Daniela didn't need him to explain; she understood the weight behind his words.

She gave him a brief nod and walked past, her expression calm and unreadable.

"You said yesterday that you and your mother went through it and things ended badly. But that doesn't mean my story will turn out the same! Is that why you rejected me? I can't accept that," Cedric pressed,following her.

Daniela made her way to the kitchen, her movements deliberate as she retrieved plates, knives, and forks from the cabinets. She began arranging the table, setting a place for Cedric as well.

Just as she reached for the bread to slice it, Cedric's hand moved faster, taking hold of it first.

"Sit down," he instructed firmly, nodding towards the chair.

Daniela didn't argue and took a seat.

While slicing the bread, Cedric said, "You can't push me away just because of what went wrong before. The past might be your excuse, but it's not a reason strong enough to convince me otherwise."

Once her breakfast was done, Danieļa placed her knife and fork neatly on the plate.

With her hands folded in front of her, she looked more composed than she had the night before in the car,her emotions now under control.

"Cedric, relationships involve two people. I don't want to be your girlfriend, and you can't force me into it, can you?" she said plainly.

Cedric,usually sharp and quick-witted, found himself momentarily at a loss for words.

"You're not afraid, and that's okay. It's because you haven't lived through it. I have, and that makes my fear valid, doesn't it? You, with no experience, can't just talk about probabilities like they're facts. That's not how it works. Love is something you only truly understand once you've lived it. Experience teaches better than theory,wouldn't you agree?"

Cedric sat there,stunned, as if exhaustion from the sleepless night had robbed him of his ability to respond.

Even after Daniela grabbed her things and left for work, Cedric remained frozen, her words echoing in his mind, unable to shake off their impact.

Outside, Lillian and Ryan shared a glance, both silently weighing the situation.

In unison, they murmured, "Daniela really knows how to leave people speechless."

Lillian's expression soured. "She's not giving him a break. How much has she really brought him down?"

Many had tried to win Daniela's heart, but she was a master at turning them away without hesitation.

While Daniela was busy at work, Cedric brought his computer into her office and was now quietly sitting at the desk.

Daniela stopped typing for a moment and glanced at his cold expression. After a few seconds, she went back to her work.

Cedric didn't say anything either, and the office remained quiet.

At the door, Ryan leaned in and whispered to Lillian,"Do you think Daniela's going to be upset?"

Lillian peeked inside the office, shaking her head. "It's hard to say."

To those who didn't know Daniela, she might appear quiet and reserved.

But those familiar with her knew that when she was angry, her words could cut so deeply that anyone on the receiving end would wish they could disappear. Ryan and Lillian worried about it throughouIt the day, but nothing seemed to change.

As the workday came to an end, Daniela stood up, and without a second thought, Cedric folfowed her lead.

Daniela arched an eyebrow at him. "What's happening?"

Cedric met her gaze and said earnestly,"|may not have much experience, but P'm willing to give it a shot.The only person I want to try with is you. If you're not ready to date now, that's fine. I can wait. When you're ready,I'll be here to show you where it leads."

Daniela had intended her words earlier to distance herself from him, but she hadn't expected Cedric to take them so literally.

She shook her head, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Alright then, you wait,"

As she spoke, Cedric's eyes brightened, a trace of smugness mixed with a joy that was hard to describe.

Daniela couldn't help but find it amusing. Was he really that happy about it?

After finishing work, she went upstairs for dinner before packing a few clothes to return to her father's place.

By the time she came downstairs, Cedric was already waiting by the car with his luggage in tow.

Daniela sighed. "Cedric, let's not complicate things. It's not right for you to come along."

Cedric knew it wasn't exactly appropriate, but as Alexander had pointed out, Daniela had money, and her father's villa didn't hold much appeal for her.

Why was she moving back there?

Was there a danger he wasn't seeing?

With the company now under her control, the tension with her family was bound to escalate.How could she handle all of it?

These concerns weighed heavily on him. “Just give me a guest room， and I promise 1 stay out of your way onless there＇s a safety lsnue． is fh时okay?" he pleaded.

Fearful that she might say no， hre dulckty added， ＂＃ you don＇t agree， Pl find another way 称“

Cedric's worry was clear, his nerves on full display. He walked up to Danlela, holding his luggage. "Please,let me come with you.141 be your bodyguard, alright?

Cedric stood tall, his buzz cut accentuating his sharp, angular features. When he wasn't falking, he had a way of giving off a cold, distant aura, making him seem unapproachable.

Even when he did speak, his low, icy voice was enough to make anyone hesitate.

But in that moment, with his gaze lowered and his face relaxed, he appeared almnost vulnerable, like a child hoping for reassurance.

Daniela gave him a helpless smile as she glanced his way."Cedric, don't try to charm me."
###Chapter 165 Three Rules


Cedric thought back to how Lilian always teased Ryan with that playful, almost innocent charm.

Without any trace of hesitation or shame, he fixed his cool gaze on Daniela's eyes and said the last thing she expected to hear. "I'm begging you!"

The driver overheard and, by accident, honked the horn several times.

The sharp honking echoed through the quiet underground parking lot.

Cedric, throwing all caution to the wind, added with a wry smile, "Now even the driver's laughing at me.How am I supposed to face people if you don't agree?"

Daniela watched him, unfazed by his supposed embarrassment, his cool demeanor still firmly in place.

With a sigh, she finally gave in. "Alright, let's set some rules."

Cedric's face brightened, his excitement obvious. "Sure."

Daniela started, "First, if you're coming along, you're just my bodyguard. Unless I'm in real danger, you'll be out of sight."

"Deal!" Cedric agreed instantly.

"Second, if I decide it's time for you to leave the house, you'll listen to me and leave."

Cedric's brow furrowed in confusion. "Why?"

Daniela's tone grew firm. "Third, no guestions asked."

Cedric was momentarily at a loss for words.

Without waiting for him to respond, Daniela slid into the car. "If you agree, get in. You've got five minutes to make up your mind-" Before she could finish her sentence, the door was already open, and Cedric slipped in.

The familiar scent of Cedric's cologne filled the air, replacing the cold tension between them.

As Daniela arrived at the Harper family's residence, she found Joyce and Katrina already waiting for her.

With a forced smile, Katrina greeted her. "Daniela, I've got good news. Your father is awake. I told him you were moving back, and he insisted on being discharged. He's waitingfor you inside now."

Daniela wasn't surprised in the least. She curved her lips into a faint smile and replied, "Really? The hospital must be quite something.Someone who couldn't wake up yesterday is discharged today. I'm curious if it's due to the doctors' skill or something else."

Katrina's smile stiffened, but Joyce, oblivious as usual, furrowed her brow."Daniela, what are you getting at? Shouldn't you be happy that Dad's awake? Or do you secretly wish something had happened to him, so you could take control of the Harper family's fortune?"

"Shouldn't I?" Daniela asked with a faint smile. "Harper Group was entirely built by my mother. This land you're standing on? It was my mother's villa, purchased with her own money. Joyce, you should be thankful I'm showing any kindness at all. If not, you'd have been out of here ages ago."

Joyce stood frozen, taken aback. In her memory, Daniela rarely spoke out, let alone argued, except for that one outburst at the hospital.

"Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?" Joyce muttered under her breath.

Daniela didn't even bother to respond. She reached for her luggage, only to find Cedric already carrying it for her.

Katrina figured Cedric was only there to drop Daniela off.

Daniela moved ahead with Cedric right behind her,while Katrina and Joyce followed, their heads bowed.

Once inside, Daniela instructed the servants to place Cedric's luggage in the guest room before heading upstairs.

Fresh out of the hospital, Caiden was so furious at Daniela's coldness that he almost needed emergency assistance.

A short time later, Daniela descended the stairs and, with icy calm, addressed the trio seated in the living room."Why did my room become a nursery?"

Before anyone could respond, Caiden exploded, breathless with anger. "Daniela, why did you bring Cedric here to stay in the guest room? Are you trying to use him as a weapon against me?"

"You're overreacting. Do I really need Cedric to handle you? He's just a friend, visiting for a few days. What's wrong with that?" Without giving anyone a chance to reply, Daniela went on, "Since my room has turned into a nursery, I won't take it back from the baby. Joyce, your bedroom has the best light, so I'll take that room instead."

Hearing that, Katrina sprang to her feet. "Absolutely not!"
###Chapter 166 I Won't Be Making Any More Sacrifices


"How is this possible? That room gets the best sunlight in the whole house. It's the biggest and the most comfortable! Joyce has always stayed there," Katrina protested.

"I think it's high time we fix that mistake," Daniela said without missing a beat.

"But..." Katrina paused, fists clenched, "Joyce just had a baby! What do you expect her to do now?"

Daniela's tone stayed calm. "She can share a room with the baby. What's the problem with that?"

Katrina quickly shook her head. "That's out of the question! Joyce has always had everything she wanted.She can't stay in that small room with bad airflow. The baby is still so young, he can put up with it. And once the child gets older, we'll need more space. Joyce simply can't stay there."

Daniela just smiled lightly.

Just then, Cedric came out of another room, dragged a chair over, and took a seat next to Daniela.His calm presence felt like a shield of reassurance.

Katrina's usual confidence seemed to wither under his piercing gaze. She glanced at Cedric, then forced a stiff smile. "Mr. Phillips, this is a family matter."

Cedric returned her look with a playful grin.′′|sthat so?" He didn't even move, staying completely still.

Feeling uncomfortable, Katrina turned to Caiden with a look that begged for help.

Caiden was about to ask Cedric to leave when Daniela interrupted in a cool, collected tone. "This house was part of my mother's inheritance, and I'm her only child.In my mother's house, I can invite whoever I want. If )some people aren't happy with that, they're welcome to leave."

Her words hit hard, and Caiden's face twisted in anger.

Daniela, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to his reaction. Katrina, irritated but trying to maintain composure in front of their guest, forced another smile, though it didn't quite reach her eyes.

"Alright, Daniela, if you're so determined. But Joyce can't move out of the room just yet. How about this?There's a nice guest room downstairs. You can stay there for now. Once the baby's a bit older,we can switch. Surely, you wouldn't take a room from a newborn and her mother, right?"

Her suggestion was cleverly made.

Joyce clapped her hands in approval.

After all, who needed more protection than a new mother and her baby?

Katrina had a plan in mind.

Daniela would settle into the guest room for now, and later, whether she moved back or not would be entirely her choice.

If she found the guest room uncomfortable and chose to leave, that would be ideal.

Daniela wasn't one to make a fuss over things.

She had always accepted the smallest, stuffy room upstairs without a word of protest.

Katrina was sure this time would be no different.

She believed that as long as she offered Daniela a half-hearted excuse, she'd quietly comply.

"Alright, let's leave it here," Caiden said, clearly agreeing. At least, in his eyes, Daniela never stirred up trouble. "Now, everyone go get cleaned up for dinner."

Caiden stood up, and everyone thought the matter was done.

But then Daniela spoke again, her tone cold and composed. "Feel free to eat if you want, but I'll be clearing out that room this afternoon."

Her words took them by surprise, quickly erasing the smug expressions from their faces. Joyce blinked, staring at Danielá in shock. "What did you just say?"

"I used to stay silent," Daniela said, her lips curling into à cold half-smile. "But I've realized there are fights worth engaging in. Otherwise, some people around here might start thinking they have control."

The disdain in her voice was unmistakable.

Caiden's face turned bright red with fury. He hissed, "You're such an ungrateful daughter!"

"Ungrateful?" Daniela's eyes narrowed as she turned to Caiden, her expression sharp and unwavering. "If l were truly ungrateful, would you have ever married Katrina? When my mother passed,who swore he'd never marry again? Were those tears of yours ever genuine? And who, in the dead of night, staged a dramatic display of sorrow, saying the senior shareholders didn't value you and your shares were too small? Who manipulated me into signing that share transfer agreement? And after that, what happened? Just days after my mother's funeral, you married Katrina. Do you have any idea what people were saying about my mother at the time? They claimed she was too controlling, that you'd drifted apart from her long before. They said her strong personality wastoo much, and if she'd stayed alive, you'd never have achieved anything. You heard it all, didn't you? But you never said a word in her defense. Not once. So what do you really have to show for yourself? Everything you have now came from my mother. I tried to be the bigger person, tolerated your new family, and never caused any trouble here. And what did I get for it? A cramped, windowless room.And I couldn't eat at the table. I was given threadbare blankets in winter and had to walk in the rain without a ride.Joyce, on the other hand, always had a driver ready. But me? | couldn't even get someone to hold an umbrella for me."

Her voice dropped to a frigid tone. "You call me ungrateful, but l've given up enough for your second chance at happiness. From now on, I won't be making any more sacrifices."
###Chapter 167 Trading Brylee's Life's Work For A Lollipop


Daniela spoke with a stark directness. "I'm usually not one to make a fuss, but my patience has its bounds.If you all wish to continue residing here, I advise you steer clear of me. Otherwise, I won't hesitate to ask every single one of you to vacate the premises."

After dellvering her ultimatum, Daniela turned to the maid and instructed firmly, "Marilyn, empty Joyce's room upstairs.Within the hour, I plan to relocate my things there."

Marilyn Stout returned Daniela's directive with a piercing gaze of evident disapproval. She retorted sharply,"Your overbearing ego is too much to handle. Rebuking your own father? That's a whole new level of disgrace. Honestly, fighting Joyce over tat room is stupid. You were fine in your tiny little roomn before.What's the big deal now? If you're so determined to move upstairs, I suppose | could prepare the baby's room instead."

Marilyn had barely finished her statement when Joyce nearly burst into applause.

However, the room was suddenly stilled by the sharp sound of a slap.

Everyone halted, caught off guard by the unexpected echo of the strike.

Cedric, who had been observing quietly, relaxed his clenched fists and allowed a small, knowing grin to cross his face.

Marilyn faced Daniela, her hands shaking with indignation. "What the hell is wrong with you? You actually had the audacity to hit me?"

"Why not? Did you honestly think you were above it all?" Daniela shot back with a frosty glare.

"I am Katrina's aunt, and I am considerably older than you! How dare you!" Marilyn exclaimed,her hand raised in anger.

Cedric was just pulling himself to his feet when another slap resounded in the room.
Daniela picked up a napkin from the table and wiped her hand. "I've already made myself clear. From today onward, I'm not holding back. I don't give a damn who you are. To me, you're just another nobody. I have a short fuse, and I tend to hold grudges. Anyone who has wronged me shouldn't be surprised when I pay them back in kind."

Marilyn shivered under the intensity of Daniela's cold stare, feeling suddenly shaken.

Was this really the girl who had silently endured hunger whenever she refused her food? The sarne girl who had meekly apologized to her even after being slapped?

Daniela then turned her focus to Joyce, who instinctively stepped back. A slight smnile played on Daniela's lips. "You have one hour to remove your belongings from that room. Otherwise, I wvill discard them myself."

Rage lit up Joyce's eyes, a fiery intensity taking over her expression. She turned desperately to Katrina."Mom!"

However, Katrina, visibly disturbed by Daniela's outburst, remained silent. Caiden clenched his jaw tightly."Are you freaking crazy, Daniela? What's gotten into you?" he blurted out, his voice strained with disbelief.

Indeed, Daniela's earlier claims were not without merit. When Brylee had unexpectedly passed, she bequeathed her estate equally between Caiden and Daniela. Brylee's generosity and kindness had made her beloved among the company's veteran employees, who in turn showed Caiden the same respect.

Yet, Katrina contended that entrusting so many shares to a child was imprudent. She argued that a daughter would eventually marry, diminishing her need for such extensive assets.

By reclaiming those shares, Caiden could fortify his position within the company. Furthermore, he would need to amass a considerable dowry for Joyce in the future.

Katrina insinuated that Daniela, still mourning Brylee's demise, was overly reliant on Caiden for emotional support.	J

She craftily suggested that if Caiden appeared sufficiently pitiable, Daniela would be unable to deny him anything.

Following Katrina's manipulative advice, Caiden acted accordingly. Predictably, Daniela relinquished all her shares in the company.

Back then, Daniela was merely a child, easily duped by Caiden, who deceitfully exchanged Brylee's lifelong achievements for nothing more than a simple lollipop.
###Chapter 168 A Show Of Power


If Daniela had not brought up the past, Caiden wouldn't have remembered it at all.

Now confronted with the undeniable truth, he remained tight-lipped.

Katrina caught the weight of his silence, her teeth gritting as she realized there was no escaping the task of moving Joyce from her current room today.

With a contrived tenderness, she turned to Cedric, softening her expression in a bid to seem reasonable.

She coaxed Daniela in a sugary tone dripping with insincerity. "Daniela, think about what you're saying.Accusing your father over something as trivial as a room? Very well, if the room means so much to you,consider it yours. Marilyn, would you please start packing Joyce's belongings and take them out?"

Marilyn, still clutching her cheek, stormed upstairs in frustration.

Daniela's lips twisted into a subtle, sconful smile. "I see you haven't lost your touch. Your words glide as smoothly as ever, and your skin seems thicker than stone."

Her words were piercing, sharp enough to cut through the air.

Katrina's hand, resting lightly on her lap,curled into a tight fist.

Her face held a serene, amiable smile, but underneath, a storm of fury raged within her.

She had always known handling Daniela was a challenge. Looking back, she regretted not having killed Daniela.

Joyce began to voice her objections, but Daniela's frosty glare instantly silenced her. With her head bowed,she meekly withdrew to stand behind Katrina, her resolve completely evaporating.

An hour later, Ryan and Lillian pulled up with a moving van in tow. A flurry of movers bustled in and out,hauling an assortment of furniture and boxes into the house. Katrina watched the procession wih a growing sense of annoyance churning in her stomach."Really, is afl this necessary? Just look at all these things! Caiden, is Daniela planning to stay here for good?"

Caiden watched, his face clouding over as he saw movers hauling in a bed, a desk, a piano, and various other pieces of lavish furniture. A wave of irritation squeezed his chest, yet he felt powerless to intervene.With a frustrated snort, he spun around and retreated into the house.

Joyce,on the other hand, gaped in astonishment as the movers hauled a brand-new bed upstairs. Unable to contain her frustration any longer, she called out to Daniela, "Daniela, this is absurd! The bed in my room is almost new. Was there really a need to replace it with another?"

Daniela, leisurely peeling an orange that Cedric had given her, didn't even bother to glance her way."l′′ma bit obsessive when it comes to keeping things clean."

Just then, Josie arrived,accompanied by a squad of professional cleaners. She addressed Daniela with deference before ushering the cleaners upstairs.

Joyce stared in disbelief at the unfolding chaos. She turned sharply, her eyes blazing with fury as her voice exploded. "What the hell is this supposed to mean? They've got disinfectant tools! Are you implying that I'm filthy?"

Daniela didn't even glance up from her task."NO,"she responded flatly.

A wave of relief washed over Joyce, but it was short-lived.

"I'm merely concerned that you might be carrying some contagious illness," Daniela continued, her tone indifferent.

"Daniela, that is beyond inappropriate!" Joyce exploded in outrage.

For the first time, Daniela met her gaze squarely.′′YS1, I am being inappropriate. So, what are you going to do about it?"

It was a question that cut straight to the core.

Joyce stood rooted to the spot, her thoughts scrambling for a comeback.

Eventually, she had to accept the hársh reality-she was powetless to change Daniela's course of actior.

Once the upstairs room was arranged, Caiden and the others thought the chaos was finally over.

Suddenly, Daniela's crew burst into the kitchen, commencing a ruthless dismantling of the space.

Caiden and the others were shocked, their disbelief written all over their faces.

Katrina demanded, "What in the world are you doing?”

Josie,standing confidently with her sleeves rolled up and overseeing the workers, pivoted to face her."Daniela prefers not to share her kitchen space with you. She requires more room. Thus, we are enlarging this area."

She pointed to a modest sink nestled in the corner and assured,"Don't worry, that area is designated for your use."

Marilyn, who was visibly agitated, advanced with determination, her sleeves also now rolled up in readiness."Why does she get all this space? Joyce has just welcomed a new baby and needs wholesome soups! How do you expect me to manage in such a cramped spot?"

"That's not my concern. Why are you bringing this to me? If you're struggling with your responsibilities,maybe you need to reconsider your position here. Sort it out on your own." Josie's loyalty to Daniela was unwavering. Despite her son's substantial financial success, she had opted to remain steadfastly by Daniela's side.

She often said that Daniela had faced many challenges in life, and she was willing take care of Daniela.

Furthermore, Tyler's prosperity was deeply intertwined with Daniela's encouragement and support. Filled with gratitude, Josie had committed herself to always protect and support Daniela.①

Every so often, tales about the Harper family's mistreatment of Daniela would reach Josie through whispers from Ryan or Lillian. These stories invariably ignited a fiery anger within her.

Upon learning of Daniela's return, Josie wasted no time in rushing to her aid, anxious that Daniela might once again fall prey to the family's cruelty. Her worries were slightly alleviated when she saw Cedric standing protectively by Daniela's side, yet Josie remained vigilant, her defenses firmly up.

Marilyn, Katrina's aunt, had made herself quite at home in the residence. She savored the best foods,claimed a prime spot at the family dining table, and enjoyed the comforts of their lavish home.Now,with her dominance challenged by an outsider, her patience was wearing thin.

"Who the hell do you think you are, talking to me like that? This is the Harper family!" Marilyn snarled, her voice trembling with rage.

"Oh, so you do know this is the Harper family?" Josie responded with a piercing, mocking laugh. "That's amusing. From the way you've been comporting yourself, one might assume we're in your home. You've leeched off your employers for so long, you've completely lost sight of your actual standing here."

Marilyn, incensed, drew her hand back, poised to strike.

But before her hand could meet its mark, the sharp sound of a slap rang out, stopping her in her tracks.

Marilyn stood there, utterly speechless, her body rigid with shock. In that moment, the world seemed to mute around her, leaving her enveloped in a disorienting buzz.

The shame of Daniela's slaps earlier was still fresh-a deep, stinging humiliation. But now, struck by a mere servant? It was utterly unthinkable.

Overcome with fury, Marilyn lunged towards Josie, her face twisted in anger.

However, Josie, with her years of laborious service sculpting her into a formidable force, did not retreat.With a swift and skilled motion, she delivered a series of sharp, echoing slaps to Marilyn, each one leaving her more dazed and unsteady.

Katrina noticed the escalating chaos and stepped in, hoping to defuse the tension.

Daniela, lounging on the couch with her eyes fixed on the television, finally spoke. "If it's just the servants quarreling, let them handle it. Katrina, if you interfere, you force my hand as well. And don't come crying to me if l act against you." Her casual tone belied the gravity of her words, which seemed to linger heavily in the air.

Katrina halted abruptly, her body quivering slightly with the weight of Daniela's warning. She found herself unable to move forward.

On the floor, Marilyn, now subdued and pinned down by Josie, broke down completely. Her cries filled the room as tears streamed down her cheeks. "Katrina! Katrina! Help me!"

Katrina, caught in a tumultuous internal struggle, remained still. Her eyes darted from Marilyn, lying battered and crying on the floor, to Daniela, who remained disinterestedly on the couch, seemingly oblivious to the commotion.

Though her jaw was locked with strain, Katrina made the deliberate choice to remain still, unwilling to get involved.
###Chapter 169 Play The Sympathy Card


Katrina mustered a smile that was far from genuine. "Daniela, you really should have a word with your people.Look at Marilyn-she's my aunt. If word gets out, it might tarnish the Harper family's reputation."

Daniela remained focused on the television. "Katrina."

"Yes?"

"Perhaps you're misunderstanding something?"

"What do you mean by that?" Katrina asked, her confusion evident.

"Marilyn is aservant in this family. If you can't grasp such a simple fact, how can you possibly be fit to oversee anything in this household?"

Katrina's smile stiffened, her face freezing as her words failed her."Daniela, you've really changed. You've become quite cutting with your words."

"That's right," Daniela answered, her smile calm and unwavering."It's a pity I didn't figure it out sooner.I used to believe that maintaining family harmony was paramount. But actually, I don't even have a family anymore. I tolerated all the bullshit for years, and it was all for nothing. Reflecting on my former self, I can only laugh at how naive I was. But that's behind me now. Now, l've realized the most important thing in life is to seek my own happiness. And for that lesson, I have you to thank you. After years of observing you, l've finally caught on. Honestly, I'm embarrassed it took me so long to learn from such a perfect example."

Ryan and Lillian, standing a short distance away, couldn't suppress their laughter any longer.

Daniela spun around to face them, her brow furrowed in confusion. "What's so funny? I'm merely stating the obvious."

Their laughter grew louder, almost contagious. "Absolutely, you couldn't be more right."

Katrina looked at Daniela's people. The tension made her hesitant to speak further, fearing any misstep might have her ending up on the floor like Marilyn.

Just then, the wail of an ambulance cut through the chatter, and soon, paramedics were escorting Marilyn out on a stretcher.

Joyce caught sight of Marilyn's severely swollen face and gasped in horror. For the first time,genuine fear of Daniela crept into Joyce's heart. Daniela's behavior was wildly unpredictable-bordering on madness.

Joyce's eyes darted from the kitchen to Daniela. She asked, "Dad, surely Daniela isn't thinking of staying here for good, is she? You promised-every asset of the Harper family was meant for Jack! What is she doing here? Is she challenging Jack for the inheritance now? How could Daniela act so shamelessly? Trying to claim what you vowed to give the child?"

Katrina added, "It's unbelievable how Daniela has worsened over the years. After relinquishing everything and walking away, why return now to snatch it away? She's well aware that you dedicated it all to Joyce. And not just the company-now she's eyeing the house too? Isn't that going a bit too far? Despite her wealth,she seems indifferent to our modest assets. It's as if she's driven purely by the desire to spite us."

Caiden's face clouded over, his gaze turning icy with displeasure. Daniela's antics were a constant thorn in his side! He was baffled by her motivations. What compelled her to disrupt their tranquility so persistently?

Life could've been simple, but no, she just had to screw it all up like a goddamn tornado.

Katrina cast a wary glance to the living room, now bustling with the noise of Daniela's people reorganizing the area.

With each change, it seemed their family's living space dwindled even more.

Pressing her lips together in frustration, Katrina turned to face Caiden. "Honey, it's clear Daniela isn't taking our concerns to heart. Maybe you could have a word with her?"

d Caiden responded with a harsh, cynical chuckle, "Do you honestly believe she'll pay any heed to what I have to say? Just look at her, parading around as if she owns the place. If I confront her, she's likely to rip into me!"

The truth was, Caiden harbored a deep-seated guilt over his previous dealings with Daniela, which now deterred him from facing her.

Daniela's aura was one of formidable resolve, a stark contrast to anyone who dared challenge her-a trait that deeply unnerved him.

Back when Brylee was around, she kept Caiden under her wing, protecting him from the world. He was nothing more than a coward who preyed on the weak and cowered before the strong.

At first, Daniela looked like a pushover, the perfect victim who wouldn't dare fight back. He had taken full advantage of that, treating her like shit. But now...

As Daniela put on a display of bravado, Caiden visibly recoiled.

"Caiden!" Katrina exclaimed, her voice tinged with exasperation. "This isn't just about me or Joyce anymore.We're talking about securing our family's future! What about Jack? Are you really willing to just leave him in the lurch?"

With a heavy sigh, Caiden dismissed her concerns with a wave of his hand. "The company shares are intact.The portion Brylee left me-Daniela can't lay a finger on that. As long as she's at the helm, Jack will continue to receive his cut of the profits. Just look at Daniela-she looks like she's ready to tear someone apart. Do you honestly believe confronting her will help? It'll only backfire on us."

After all, Daniela was Brylee's own flesh and blood, endowed with the same formidable acumen. How could Caiden not feel intimidated?

Katrina was far from appeased. She stared at Caiden with a mix of disappointment and frustration. "You need to have a word with her. Don't make it a confrontation. Just keep it calm. Talk to her the same way you did when you negotiated for the company shares."

Her emphasis on "talk to her" hung heavily in the air, brimming with hidden pressure.

Caiden swiveled to face Katrina, a skeptical frown creasing his brow."You want me to act all pitiful again?What if she sees right through it this time?"

Back when Daniela had first grappled with the loss of her mother, she had clung to him, utterly vulnerable.

However, years had trickled by since then, and the bond they once shared had frayed, delicate as tissue.

What could he possibly reap from dredging up old tactics?

"Just give it a shot! How will you know unless you try? You're still her father. If you approach her with sincere tears and express your remorse, surely she can't disregard you entirely," Katrina coaxed.

Caiden's eyes dropped, weighed down by resignation. "Alright. I'll give it a go."

After all, what did he have to lose?

Persuading Daniela to go could just be the key to bringing back the quiet harmony they once had.
###Chapter 170 Still His Daughter


Daniela's gaming startup had recently rolled out a new mobile game, now in lts beta phase.

She was engrossed in testing it, lounging comfortably on the couch with her phone in hand, when Caiden entered, fresh from the garden.

As he neared Daniela, he couldn't help but throw a cautious glance over his shoulder. Cedric, who was standing a short distance away, caught themovement with his keen eyes, missing nothing.

A chill ran down Caiden's spine as he met Cedric's icy stare, which seemed to pierce right through him. The air thickened with tension.

"Do you need something?" Cedric pressed, his voice cutting through the quiet with an icy sharpness that caused Caiden's heart to race.

Caiden responded with an awkward chuckle, his laugh sounding more strained than he intended.He had hoped to join Daniela on the couch, but before he could make his move, Lillian swept into the spot with a triumphant grin. Annoyance flashed across Caiden's face at being preempted.

Where did Daniela even come across these freaks?

To Caiden, they were simply a band of eccentrics, sorely lacking any semblance of common courtesy or respect.

With a click of his tongue, Caiden fetched a small stool and took a seat beside Daniela. "Daniela, your company is flourishing, but you really shouldn't spend your entire day immersed in games. They're not good for your eyes, you know." Peering over at her phone screen, Caiden caught a glimpse of the game title-Shadow Strike. The name alone prompted a frown to crease his brow; it hardly seemed like a meaningful or productive way to pass the time.

He clicked his tongue once more, a gesture of his disapproval, as he awaited her response.

Time ticked by, and yet Daniela continued to ignore him as if he weren't even there. Caiden felt his patience dwindling and his irritation intensifying.

What sort of behavior was this?

Then,he recalled Katrina's advice to adopt a gentler method.

Suppressing his irritation, Caiden managed a smile and gently tapped on Daniela's hand.

This action finally prompted Daniela to tear her gaze from her phone, fixing him with a chilly look. "What do you want?"

"It's nothing urgent. I was just hoping we could have a chat. It's been ages since we've had a real heart-to-heart,just you and me."

Daniela emitted a sharp, scornful chuckle. "Really? You're always so busy. It hardly makes a difference whether we speak or not, does it?"

Caiden's features contorted slightly, a flicker of irritation crossinng his face.

He let out a nervous chuckle, but the edge of bitterness in his voice was hard to miss.f course, we can talk. Let's put the past behind us, shall we? You're still my beloved daughter, after all."

Daniela offered no reply, her indifference clearly evident, not bothering to mask her lack of interest.

The heavy silence that hung in the air was stifling, leaving Caiden feeling exposed and humiliated. Still, he forced himself to push forward. "Sweetheart, you can't imagine how tough it's been for me. Do you think my life has been a walk in the park? When your mother passed away, you were just five. I was left to juggle a huge company and contend with senior executives who made my life hell. And Seth Elliott-let's not even go into that! He led the first group to break away from Harper Group. Do you have any idea how many assets he took with him? That man was nothing short of a-"

He was cut off mid-sentence as Danjela's hand moved abruptly.

Caiden's brow furrowed, his confusion palpable as he watched her closely."What's the matter? Am I wrong?"

"Just so you know, I've been in touch with Seth recently." A trace of panic flickered across Caiden's features, his face momentarily frozen.

"It wasn't Seth's choice to leave, was it? He and the others were devoted to you, yet your mistrust pushed them away from the company. Seth confided in me that once i stabilize the operations, he's prepared to return everything he took upon his departure."

A wave of redness washed over Caiden's face, leaving him visibly flustered. "He really mentioned that?1hadn't realized he still held such regard for you. But then again, could It be because of your mother? Seth had a soft spot for her. They maintained a facade of friendship, but the glances they exchanged were telling.It wasn't appropriate. And Daniela, you persistently fault me for marrying Katrina shortly after your mother passed, but how can you be so certain your mother was faithful to me first? This city is teeming with businesses led boy men. But your mother had to be the exception, venturing into the business realm herself.Do you honestly believe a woman could succeed alone in such a world? Who knows how many men..."

Daniela slammed a hefty ashtray down onto the table with all her might. The glass shattered, sending shards scattering across the room.
###Chapter 171 More Merciless


The broken glass sliced through Daniela's hand, but she didn't react in the slightest.

She stared coldly at Caiden. He had gotten so used to badmouthing Brylee in front of Katrina that he never considered the bitterness in his words.

As expected, today was no different-he didn't hold back.

What he had forgotten, however, was one key detail-sitting across from him was Daniela, Brylee's daughter.

Daniela's laugh echoed, cold and unsettling, sending a chill down Caiden's spine. Slowly,he stood up from his seat.

Katrina and Joyce, realizing that Caiden had messed up, hurried into the room, clearly desperate to defuse the situation.

Before either could speak, Daniela's voice cut through the silence. "Caiden, if it weren't for my mother's efforts to build this family, do you think you'd even have the privilege to sit here, spewing such garbage?Who do you think you are,talking about my mother like that?"

Caiden's face flushed with anger, his eyes flickering with fury, but he remained silent, not daring to respond.

"Oh,you've had a tough time, have you?" Daniela sneered, her voice thick with sarcasm. "You struggled to tear down everything my mother built. You were scared that Harper Group might actually succeed-scared people would see you for the failure you really are. Let's get one thing clear. Nothing will ever change the fact that you're nothing but a parasite, a freeloader, a pretty face who used his looks to marry my mother.You've spent your whole life hiding behind a mask of false respectability, desperately clinging to a fragile ego. But it's all laughable. Everyone sees through it. You're not fit to be a husband, and you certainly don't have what it takes to be a father."


Caiden's face contorted with humiliation. Daniela's words had torn apart his pride in front of everyone. Consumed by rage and desperation, he lifted his hand, aiming to slap her and silence her once and for all.But before he could do it, an iron grip seized his wrist.
A sharp jolt of pain surged through his wrist as he tried to break free, but the hold only tightened.
Then came the sickening sound that echoed through the room. The unmistakable snap of bone broke the tense silence.
Cedric stood there, under the harsh light, his expression unreadable. His cold gaze bore into Caiden, as though looking down at something insignificant. "I recommend you don't try that again. Because next time,it won't stop at just a broken bone."

Katrina and Joyce stood paralyzed, their faces drained of color.
Katrina didn't dare to challenge Cedric, so she fumbled for her phone, dialing for an ambulance.
As she waited for the connection, she shot a look at Daniela."Daniela, no matter what, he's still your father.How could you allow someone like him to be hurt like this?"

Katrina's thoughts seethed with frustration. What a pack of brutes! They couldn't have a civil conversation without resorting to violence.
Daniela, however, just smiled as she sat back down. "Save your breath. I've outgrown the need for father-daughter heart-to-heart talks. Your old tricks don't have any power over me anymore. Maybe it's time you come up with something new. By the way, I've already sold the villa you recently purchased. The money's been deposited into the company's account. As for your offshore holdings, you've got one week to bring them back. If you fal, I won't hesitate to have you arrested. Since the company's been running inefficiently,I've already terminated all those 'family favors' staff members to cut expenses. I suggest you find a way to bring in some revenue quickly. Personally, I don't mind if the company keeps bleeding money-I can take the hit. You, on the other hand, might not fare as well. If the company collapses, you'll be responsible for forty-d nine percent of the debt. That includes losing this villa. When that happens, perhaps you'll finally grasp the reality of having nowhere to call home."

Caiden's body was drenched in cold sweat, the searing pain from his broken wrist almost too much to endure. Fighting through the fog of agony, he managed to lift his eyes towards Daniela.

Her cold, unfeeling stare cut through him like a blade. The steady authority in her demeanor sent shivers down his spine. In that moment, it was as though Brylee herself had come back to life and was standing before him.

That chilling thought hit him like a ton of bricks, confirming his deepest, darkest fear.

The very nightmare he had spent years avoiding had finally become a reality-Daniela had grown into the spitting image of her mother.

No!

Daniela wasn't just like Brylee-she was colder, sharper, and even more merciless!
###Chapter 172 Daniela Sees Through Everything


While en route to the hospital, Katrina expressed her bewvilderment. "Why were you fighting again? Didn't I tell you to be nice to Daniela?"

Caiden felt unjustly treated and had the urge to counter. He parted his lips to speak,yet no words formed.

After a brief pause, he sagged and said in a bitter tone,"You don't get it. When Brylee had just died, I could easily cry and act the part in front of Daniela. I played the submissive role, and she bought it at the time. But years of comfort have made me forget how to bow down. Daniela's too perceptive-she saw through my act."

Katrina's expression darkened with frustration. "Even if she did see through you, you shouldn't have angered her so much! Do you understand the implications? Our living costs have always been managed by the company. But just today, the finance team of Harper Group reached out to me. They declared that the company's money will now only fund business operations-no personal spending allowed. And with the company in financial trouble, there won't be any dividends for at least a year. Our money is all tied up abroad, and we're left with nearly nothing here. How do you propose we manage our living expenses now that you've completely alienated Daniela?"

Hearing this, Caiden struck his thigh in vexation, his teeth clenched. "I can't stand it! I used to be under Brylee's control when I was young. Now, Daniela is doing the same at my age! It's intolerable and utterly humiliating!"

Katrina let out a deep sigh and added, "I heard Daniela mention that Seth is bringing resources back,right?If that's the case, the company might rebound soon. However, Daniela has instructed that we return the funds from abroad. What's your plan?"
 
Caiden's expression turned icy. "I'm not sending the money back. What can she possibly do to me?"

Katrina remained silent.

Caiden shut his eyes tightly. "She wouldn't dare do anything to mne, would she? Daniela has completely lost it!”

He then sighed reluctantly. "Alright, I'll send some of it back. If we don't, she might actually send me to jail.But I'll distribute the rest across various accounts. She won't be able to track all of it down."

Katrina agreed. "You need to try and mend things with Daniela. Otherwise, her temper will only make our lives more difficult. You managed to deceive her out of her shares before. When we're back in a solid position, we can deal with her firmly."

Caiden grimaced, his forehead creasing deeply. "Fix our relationship? Did you miss the way she glared at me? She looks like she wants to devour me!"

For reasons unknown, Caiden grew more fearful of Daniela by the day.

Katrina, her heart seething, labeled him a coward silently."She's your daughter! What scares you so much?Even if you're frightened, do it for me, for Joyce, for Jack! You need to gather your strength and try harder!"

Katrina looked to Joyce, hoping for her support. Yet, as she looked over, Joyce was bent over her phone,deeply absorbed.

Caiden's expression grew darker as he realized Joyce was engaged in Shadow Strike, the same game Daniela had played earlier.

"Dad, you're missing the point. This game, although still in beta, is already extremely popular. Its graphics,sound, and gameplay are far beyond anything else in ouur country. Are you aware of how valuable this game is right now?"

Irritated, Caiden muttered, "It's merely a game. What could it possibly be worth?"

Joyce, oblivious to his irritation, continued,"Dad, you really don't understand. Today's youth have money and are eager to spend it. Gaming is a perfect way for them to unwind and alleviate stress. Did you know this game made over ten million dollars through in-game purchases in just three days of beta testing?Experts in the industry foresee its profit margins reaching the billions. It's closely watched by everyone in the gaming community. I managed to join the beta test. Only a select few have this access, and it required some connections in the industry."

Katrina was taken aback and stared at her daughter. "A single game valued higher than Harper Group?"
"Exactly! I've spent fifty thousand on it just today. The revenue potential in gaming is enormous. It includes tournament earnings, merchandise sales, licensing deals, and virtual goods. And since it's all online, most of the profit directly benefits the developers."

Intrigued, Caiden leaned in to glance at Joyce's phone.
The screen looked somewhat familiar yet different from what he had seen on Daniela's phone. He pointed to the upper-left corner. "What's 'Host Mode' mean?"
Joyce glanced up, a playful smile on her face. "Wow, Dad, are you starting to take an interest in gaming?""What does it mean?" Caiden asked again, frowning.

Joyce casually explained, "Host Mode indicates that a member of the development team is internally testing the game. If there's a number 1 next to it, it means the CEO of the company is the one testing it personally.The team uses their feedback to refine the game."

Katrina looked at Joyce with pride. "Joyce, you really know your stuff! Your father should help you start your own gaming company. Imagine how jealous Daniela will be when you make a fortune."
Katrina's face lit up as if Joyce had already become a billionaire.
Joyce flashed a big smile. "Really, Mom? I've always dreamed of starting a gaming company! Just provide me with 800 million, and I promise I'll make it big!"
At the mention of the figure, Katrina's smile stiffened. She turned to Caiden for support and found him lost in thought, his eyebrows furrowed. "What's wrong?" she inquired.
Caiden did not reply immediately. Gradually, he raised his eyes, his expression serious as he looked at Katrina and Joyce. "I saw Daniela playing this exact game."
Joyce, taken aback, lightly scoffed, "Really? Daniela managed to get a beta spot? That's hard to believe.They're extremely rare."
Caiden said, "In the upper-left corner of her phone, it displayed 'Host Mode.'" Joyce's mouth fell open, her expression a mix of shock and disbelief.

But Caiden wasn't done yet. He turned to Katrina and said somberly, "Behind 'Host Mode;' there was the number
###Chapter 173 An IOU


Upon their return from the hospital, Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce were greeted by the sight of Daniela, who was still engrossed in her game, oblivious to their presence.

Josie, always perceptive, quickly sensed a change in Caiden's demeanor.

Katrina and Joyce also appeared unusually subdued, thei typical arrogance replaced by what seemed like obsequiousness.

"Daniela," Caiden called out, making his way towards her with his arm in a cast. He leaned over for a closer look at her phone screen.

This time, he clearly noticed in the upper-left corner of her screen the words 'Host Mode,' followed by the number 1.

Joyce also approached, peeking at the screen. When she saw it, she gasped, her expression one of thrilled surprise.

Caiden's laugh echoed, softer and more conciliatory than before. "Sweetheart, I admit I was wrong.The harsh words about your mother were unjustified. I deserve the fallout. But remember, Daniela, we're family,and there should be no enduring resentment between us, right? Please, don't hold a grudge."

Daniela looked up from her phone, a mild surprise registering on her face, followed by a look of confusion.

She had anticipated Caiden would brood for weeks, if not months, given their earlier conflict.

Previously,when Katrina joined the family, Daniela's mere refusal to eat Katrina's cooking had led Caiden to shun her for a full year.3

Back then, Daniela was just five years old, mourning her mother's death and yearning for her father's affection.

His detachment had left her feeling abandoned and heartbroken, which eventually led her into a deep depression.
Now, with his arm in a sling, Caiden was unexpectedly showering her with attention.
This change in his behavior was quite astonishing.
"Caiden," Daniela addressed him, her eyebrow raised and a faint, sarcastic smile playing on her lips.
Caiden,all too familiar with that unsettling smile, tensed up, sensing that the conversation might take an unpleasant turn.
What were his options,really?
He had decided-in matters of wealth, pride was expendable.
Hadn't he compromised his own pride time and again for Brylee?
If he could flatter her, surely he could do the same with Daniela.
Moreover,Daniela was unmarried. If her fate mirrored Brylee's and she passed away young, her vast wealth would naturally revert to him.
From Caiden's perspective, Daniela was more than just his daughter-she was a veritable treasure trove,especially if her single mobile game could potentially rake in billions.
He marveled at her knack for amassing wealth.
Attempting to ingratiate himself, he flashed a nearly subservient smile and inquired, "What do you need from me,Daniela?"
Daniela's response came with a soft chuckle, her smile razor-sharp. "You have mastered the art of subservience."
 
Caiden's smile abruptly vanished.
"I had assumed you retained some pride," Daniela said mockingly.′′Clearly, I was mistaken. My grandmother once called you spineless, and I thought she exaggerated. Yet here you are, proving her point. No wonder my mother was deceived by you." At this point, Caiden was unáble to even feign a smile.

Daniela had a cruel way of striking precisely where it hurt most.

Her words, sharp and cutting, left him feeling stripped of any remaining dignity.

If her words were tangible weapons, he would have been sprawled on the floor,fatally wounded.

Katrina quickly intervened, trying to alleviate the tension. "Daniela, consider what you're saying. Your father genuinely cares for you. Isn't it normal for a father to want the best for his daughter? We're all delighted that you've decided to stay with us!"

Daniela's face remained impassive and distant.

Katrina turned to Joyce, hoping she would contribute something positive.

However, Joyce was engrossed with Lillian's phone, her eyes wide with excitement. "Lillian! This skin is incredible! Could you gift me one? I had no idea so mnany beautiful unreleased skins existed. Please, I'm literally begging,just one!"

Her zealous, flattering manner made Caiden's and Katrina's earlier, more genuine attempts seem downright hollow by comparison.

Katrina was mortified.

Caiden clenched his jaw and continued,′′Aharmonious family is what we all want, right? Daniela, I know l've been neglectful in the past, and | accept full responsibility. But I'm getting older, and it's time to leave the past behind. I promise to make amends."

He paused, watching Daniela's expression, which remained unaffected. Emboldened,he added,instructed my team to transfer the overseas assets back. Daniela, that money was being saved for your wedding. It was always intended for you."

Daniela's eyebrows lifted slightly,her lips twisting into a faint, sarcastic smile."Oh,you were setting aside a wedding gift for me with the company's operating funds?"

Caiden was momentarily at a loss for words. Daniela continued, "So, to clarify, if this money earns any future profits, i can subtract those from your share of the company dividends?"

Caiden stood dumbfounded, questioning her implication.

"What's the problem?" Daniela inquired, her tone sharp.that not acceptable? Or are you rétracting your promise already?"

Before Caiden could muster a reply, Katrina intervened with a forced smile."Of course it's acceptable! Why wouldn't it be? Daniela, you're family. What's yoursis yours. We're just short on cash right now, but rest assured, you'll receive everything you're entitled to."

Daniela nodded slightly in acknowledgment. Then, as though it were the most logical step, she reached under the table and produced a blank sheet of paper. "In that case, let's formalize it. Write me an lOU."

Katrina's smile stiffened. "Daniela, is that really necessary among family? It feels so impersonal, doesn't it?We're united in this, and our word is solid. You don't need a document to confirm that."

The idea of issuing an IOU-a binding acknowledgment of debt to Daniela-was intolerable for Katrina.

It had merely been a placating gesture, a temporary solution.

But Daniela's insistence on formalizing it marked a serious shift.
###Chapter 174 Joyce Knelt Before Daniela


Katrina maintained her plastered smile, barely managing to navigate through the tension.

Just as she was concocting an excuse, Joyce, without a glance away from Lillian's phone, said nonchalantly,"Mom, there's a pen in the cabinet. Fetch the black one-it leaves a clearer mark."

Katrina's heart nearly stopped. She gawked at Joyce, her mind whirling in disbelief. Was this dumb girl truly her flesh and blood?

Caiden, seeing no escape, reluctantly picked up the pen and started to write the IOU.

When it came to specifying the amount, he hesitated.Instead of the staggering 80 million, he penned just 1million.

Daniela caught the figure and chuckled.′′Amillion? How lavish!"

"Daniela, you're aware of my plight. I'm not getting any younger, and funds are tight. This is all I could muster-saved penny by penny."

Daniela hardly batted an eyelid. She hadn't returned for their wealth. With a dismissive wave, she turned and called,"Josie."

Josie emerged promptly from the kitchen, her smile radiant as she presented Daniela with a plate adorned with fruit. "What's the matter?"

Daniela then handed her the IOU.

Josie glanced at the paper.

"This is one million," Daniela stated plainly. "Spend it on snacks for Dodo!"

Caiden's mind short-circuited. "Who?" he blurted out, flabbergasted.

Who was Dodo? Spending a million on snacks? Absurd! Joyce, still engrossed in the game, added without looking up, "Dodo is Daniela's dog."

Caiden's face flushed a deep red with anger, but before he could erupt, Katrina seized his arm, pulling him back with a cautionary squeeze.

Taking a deep breath, Caiden composed himself but remained planted in his spot, his pride wounded but intact.

Daniela sensed his lingering urge to speak.

Sure enough, after a tense silence, Caiden ventured cautiously, "Daniela, now that you've accepted the money, it shouldn't matter what it's for-what matters is that it's yours. About that contract we signed to dissolve our father-daughter bond-can we declare it null and void?"

Daniela paused, a slice of fruit poised halfway to her lips. She met his gaze, her smile tinged with sarcasm."Oh? Having second thoughts? Realized that your daughter knows her way around money, and now you want her back after casting her aside?"

That was exactly how it went down, though Caiden would never admit it.

But Daniela's words always had a way of slicing to the core, and he couldn't see why. This wasn't the same sweet, wide-eyed little girl he once knew.

"Daniela, how can you be so cynical about your father?" Katrina interjected hastily, her voice dripping with insincerity. "You're his blood. He's regretted severing ties ever since. Regardless of your financial status, he would've welcomed you back."

Daniela nodded. "Is that so?" Her response dripped with disinterest, barely indulging Katrina's plea.

Katrina persisted, undeterred. "You're not yet wed, Daniela, and don't understand. A daughter needs her kin. The support of your family is your shield against mistreatment in marriage." Her words were calculated,cloaked in concern.

Daniela let out a soft laugh."Oh,really? I was married once, remember? And wasn't it around that time Caiden chose to cut me loose?". Katrina was at a loss for words. How could she have overlooked that? She fidgeted with her hair awkwardly."Well,perhaps there were some misunderstandings back then."

"Enough!" Daniela státed, her voice cold as she tossed a pomegranate onto her plate. "Misunderstanding or not, it's immaterial to me. But if you want me back in this family, it has to be on my terms. I'm not the unknown I once was. I'm now CEO of Elite Lux. You can't just cast me aside and pick me up when it's convenient."

Katrina's eyes sparkled at Daniela's declaration. "Absolutely, Daniela! You've not same anymore-truly a tale of triumph. You deserve every bit of respect. We'll do everything to reclaim your place in the family. I'll have your father contact a lawyer to draft a reinstatement agreement."

Internally, Katrina was already plotting. If she orchestrated this agreement, she might manage to carve out a share of Daniela's wealth for the family. That would be the real windfall.

But before Katrina could revel in her scheming, Joyce, still tethered to Lillian's phone, spoke up without raising her head. "Mom, you're overcomplicating things. Elie Lux has top-notch lawyers. If Daniela wants,they can draft that agreement in no time. Why bother with all this fuss?"

Joyce remained fixated on her game, oblivious to Katrina's machinations.

Daniela gave a small smile, and before Katrina could object, she chimed in, "Joyce is correct. Let Elite Lux's legal team handle it."

Katrina stiffened, her features hardening. Elite Lux's legal team would take over? How could she manipulate the situation then?

Before storming upstairs, Katrina shot Joyce a venomous glance, who remained blissfully unaware of her mother's turmoil.

Joyce, meanwhile, was kneeling beside Daniela, grinning like an ardent admirer."Daniela, could you grant me a glowing skin? Please?"

Katrina inhaled sharply, appalled at the scene. Was this really her daughter?

Daniela responded by simply handing over her phone to Joyce. Joyce was stunned. "You're letting me use your phone?"

Daniela nodded nonchalantly.

After all, this was merely a beta test-the more user feedback, the better.

Joyce nearly dropped to her knees in gratitude. "Can I share this on my social media?"

Free advertising? Why not? Daniela nodded again.

Later, as Katrina descended for a drink, she was met by the surreal sight of Joyce kneeling before Daniela.

Daniela sat regally before her, her cold gaze radiating authority.

"Joyce! What are you doing?"

Katrina had devoted her life to boosting Joyce's status, yet here was her daughter, discarding it all to grove before Daniela.

It appeared as though she was atoning for some dire transgression.

Katrina felt her sanity slipping away.
###Chapter 175 Be Kinder To Yourself


As Daniela made her way back to her bedroom, Joyce offered a saccharine smile and cooed,"Sweet dreams,Daniela."

Katrina fixed Joyce with an icy stare and declared, "You're coming to the hospital with me tomorrow!"

Joyce blinked, taken aback."What?"

"We're getting a DNA test!" Katrina declared vehemently.|refuse to believe that someone as witless as you could share my blood!"⑨



The house lay wrapped in silence, deep in the clutches of the night.

In the stillness, soft footsteps whispered along the stairs.

A gentle knock sounded at the grandest door on the second floor.

Daniela swung the door open, her eyes locking with Cedric's, who lingered in the dimly lit hallway.

"What's up?" she queried.

Cedric clutched a medical kit, her expression was a mix of sorrow and slight indignation. HHe gestured towards Daniela's hand.

Following his gesture, Daniela's eyes fell on the faint red mark marring the back of her hand. Fresh from her bath, her damp skin made the mark all the more pronounced.

"You're wounded," Cedric observed,,his tone tinged with a blend of accusation and concern. "I saw it earlier.Now that we're alone, let me attend to it."

"It's really just a scratch," Daniela dismissed. "I've weathered far worse storms."

Over the years, she'd suffered her fair share of nicks and cuts from pencil tips while immersed in herdesigns. Those injuries had been more severe than this minor scrape.

Cedric's jaw clenched."May l come in?"

Daniela stepped back, granting him entry.

Inside, Cedric made his way to the sofa and set the medical kit on the coffee table. Without a glance, he commanded,"Sit."

His voice carried a note of grievance, as if he bore the injury himself.

Amused, Daniela complied, rolling up hersleeve and presenting her hand.

Cedric maintained silence as he cleaned her wound with iodine. "Keep this dry," he instructed softly.

"Got it."

"Steer clear of spicy foods, and lay off the soy sauce-it might darken the scar."

As Daniela was about to acknowledge it, Cedric was already extracting a tube of ointment. "This should work wonders. Apply it once the wound closes to prevent scarring. You shouldn't worry about any lasting marks."

His voice was gentle, laden with an undertone of self-reproach.

"This was my fault today. I failed to protect you. It won't happen again."

After he finished, he discarded the used swab in the trash and stoodto leave.

But before he could, Daniela instinctively caught the hem of his shirt. Her action was spontaneous.She looked up and froze at the sight of his reddened eyes."You..."

"I'm alright," Cedric muttered through gritted teeth.1-should go now."

Daniela's grip on his shirt didn't waver."Why are you beating yourself up? Today's mishap wasn't your fault.That ashtray-I flung it myself.How does that implicate you?"

She paused, then handed him a tissue. "Honestly, I wouldn't have even noticed the scratch if you hadn't shown up."

Cedric's frown deepened at her words.

When he finally met her gaze again, his eyes conveyed deep censure. "Daniela, can't you be nicer to yourself?"

In that instant, Daniela was taken aback.

It had been ages since anyone had cared enough to say that to her.

She remained still for several seconds before managing a weak smile.

"Cedric, you make it sound like I'm some porcelain doll. I'm not that fragile," she teased.

At her words, Cedric's eyes lifted, flashing with irritation. With a snort, he picked up the medical kit and stormed out of the room.

A moment later, Lillian entered, her expression puzzled. "What's got into Cedric? Did he wake up onthe wrong side of the bed?"
###Chapter 176 The Tenth Company Going Bankrupt


Lillian hadn't even finished speaking before Cedric stormed back into the room. His expression was shadowed, and when he spoke, his voice was tight with restrained anger. "To me, you're fragile, Daniela."

Both Lillian and Daniela were stunned.

Once Cedric had left, Lillian breathed a deep sigh and looked at Daniela with a teasing glint in her eye."Maybe you should consider giving him a chance. He's so agitated."

Daniela groaned and tugged Lillian farther into the room."Cut it out, will you? You've seen what I'm dealing with. Why would I drag him into this mess? Let him live his own life. What's so wrong with that?"

As Daniela spoke, she glanced at the beta data Lillian had just handed to her.

"The problem is he doesn't want a life without you. What are you going to do about that?" Lillian responded with a shrug.




The Bennett family's gaming company filed for bankruptcy shortly after launching Shadow Strike, marking it as the tenth Bennett company to go bankrupt this year.

Joyce, absorbed in her phone, burst into laughter upon reading the news. Turning to Katrina, she remarked without any sympathy, "Looks like Alexander is no match for Daniela."

Katrina looked at the news briefly, her face unreadable. She then walked out to the courtyard to call Alexander.

By the time Caiden stepped outside, Katrina had already ended the call.

"What did you say to him?" Caiden asked.

Katrina glanced at Josie bustling around the spacious, well-equipped kitchen, then turned to their own cramped and barely stocked kitchen, feeling a surge of irritation. "I've arranged for us to dine with Richard and Alexander tonight. And you're joining us."

Caiden scowled, disliking social events and preferring the solitude of tending to his garden. "Why bother dining with them? It's merely squándering money."

With Daniela controlling the finances of Harper Group, Caiden was no longer able to tap into the company's funds as liberally as before.

"If we can't bring Daniela down, we'll engage others who can," Katrina said, her tone sharp and her eyes gleaming with determination.

That evening, Caiden arrived at the restaurant with Katrina and Joyce to meet the Bennetts for dinner.

As soon as they stepped inside, Joyce was completely absorbed in her game.

The previous night, she had pleaded with Lillian to help her unlock two rare weapons. Now, armed with her flashy new upgrades, she was crushing her opponents and soaking up the admiration of her in-game teammates.

Her excitement was almost tangible.

Caiden's frustration flared. He opened his mouth, readyto lecture her about playing her game in public.However, Katrina intervened before he could get a word out.

He stopped short, staring at her in confusion.

Katrina, looking radiant with her hair styled into a sleek updo, carried herself with elegance as she tookher seat.

When the Bennetts arrived, Katrina welcomed them warmly. She engaged them in conversation with a practiced ease that gave no hint of the financial difficulties the Harpers faced under Daniela's influence.
 
Her smile didn't waver as she said, "No matter what, Daniela will always be part of the Harper family.She's accomplished so much, and we couldn't be prouder of her. Just the other day, she was telling us that Caiden shouldn't push himself too hard with his work. She's taken over the company to give him a break,and now all we have to do is enjoy the benefits. If there's one thing she does exceptionally well, it's making money. I think we can all agree on that."

Katrina's words painted Daniela as the perfect daughter, effortlessly erasing past grievances. It was as though the conflicts of the past had never existed.

"Is that really the way things are?" Richard raised an eyebrow as his gaze shifted between Katrina and Caiden,whose arm remained in a cast.

"Absolutely," Katrina replied, her voice steady and composed. "We're a family, after all. Holding grudges doesn't make sense. Whatever happened in the past, Daniela is still our daughter. She's even moved back in with us. If that doesn't prove where we stand, I don't know what does."

Richard's expression was unreadable, but his eyes lingered on Alexander for a moment.

Alexander remarked casually, "So, is this dinner about her? If it is, I'm not interested. I've already divorced Daniela, and what she does now is no concern of mine. Let's move on to another topic."

Katrina's smile didn't faIter. With practiced charm, she steered the conversation towards lighter topics.

As she spoke, she turned her attention to Joyce. She placed some food on her plate and said gently,"Joyce,sweetheart, all you ever seem to do is play games. Why don't you take a break and eat something?"

Her tone was filled with warmth, though the word games carried a pointed emphasis.

Alexander's expression darkened, the change in his demeanor subtle but unmistakable.

Katrina caught the shift immediately and smiled inwardly.

Moments later, Richard leaned forward and asked, "What's this game Joyce is so invested in? She hasn't looked up once."

Joyce perked up at the mention of her game. Still glued to her phone, she beamed and replied,"It's called Shadow Strike! It's amazing!"

Her excitement bubbled over as she held up her phone for everyone to see. "Look at this! Daniela gave me two exclusive skins. They're super rare! I can't believe how lucky I am to have a sister like her!"

 Her voice carried across the table, brimming with enthusiasm and pride.
Katrina's smile faltered. Her expression tightened, revealing an awkward tension she couldn't fully mask.
She looked like she wanted to say something, but with the Bennetts seated across from her, she remained silent.

Two rare skins, and now she called Daniela her sister?

The room seemed smaller to Katrina. The air felt heavier, as if it was pressing down on her chest.
Richard exchanged a quick glance with Alexander before turning back to Joyce. His tone was measured, but his words carried a sharp edge. "Daniela gave you rare skins?"
As someone who had been part of a gaming empire, Richard understood that rare skins weren't just expensive-they were a symbol of insider privilege.
Unease settled over him like a dark cloud.

Oblivious to the rising tension in the room, Joyce grinned and nodded. Her excitement was unshaken."Yeah! Daniela owns the company that makes this game."
The clatter of a soup bowl breaking the silence startled everyone.

Richard's hand had slipped, tipping its contents across the table.
He paid no attention to the mess. His sharp eyes remained fixed on Joyce as he demanded, "What did you just say? Daniela owns this game company?"
Finally, Joyce tore her eyes away from her screen and looked up. Richard's face was tight with tension, and Alexander's cold glare seemed to pierce through her.
Still oblivious to the weight of her words, Joyce nodded again and said, "Yeah. Didn't you know?"
###Chapter 177 Who Wouldn't Want To Marry Her


Katrina's expression changed as if a thought had just struck her. "I happened to catch the news earlier. It said you announced the closure of your gaming company today. Would that have anything to do with Daniela's game?"

She gasped, covering her mouth as though in disbelief.

Richard and Alexander realized why Katrina had arranged the dinner tonight. Both men's expressions darkened, the weight of the situation evident.

Katrina, noticing the change in their demeanor, smiled sweetly as if she hadn't noticed a thing. "Daniela really crossed the line this time. The divorce was one thing, but this? All that money you poured in-it must have been so hard-earned. You must have lost quite a bit, didn't you?"

Her words made Richard push himself abruptly from his chair, his face taut with frustration. "Katrina, what exactly are you trying to say?"

Katrina,still calm, gave him a measured smile, her expression radiating calculated charm.

She didn't respond immediately. Instead, she reached for Joyce's plate and began serving her food with deliberate slowness. When shefinally looked back at Richard, her smile remained inact.

"Why are you so upset, Richard? Why direct your anger at us? Daniela made her decisions all on her own.We couldn't have stopped her, even if we'd tried."

Her smile widened, and she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Her eyes glimmered with an unspoken agenda.

Richard and Alexander remained quiet, their focus entirely on her. They both knew she wasn't done speaking.

Sure enough, Katrina continued after a brief pause,I mentioned before, Daniela is part of the Harper family, and that's not going to change. Even if we wanted to step in and fix this, our hands are tied. I've watched Alexander grow into such a fine young man. I truly hope everything works out for him."

Richard frowned. Something about her words didn't sit right withhim.

Katrina's tone grew even gentler, almost coaxing. "Richard, don't you think it's time you considered settling down and focusing on the next generation? Isn't that what really matters at this stage in life?"

Richard's eyes narrowed as suspicion crept into his expression. "What exactly are you getting at?"

Katrina's smile turned sly. "It's simple, really. Daniela's decisions are a reflection of our family. We stand by her no matter what. If, for example, Alexander were to marry into the Harper family, wouldn't that naturally strengthen the bond between our families? It would benefit your businesses as well."

The implication of her words hung in the air.

Everyone at the table, except for Joyce, understood her underlying message.

Katrina had just proposed a marriage alliance.

Richard lowered his gaze, clearly unsettled.

Alexander, however, kept his expression blank. "I want nothing to do with Daniela. That's never going to happen."

Katrina chuckled lightly, her composure unshaken. "Wo said anything about Daniela? I was talking about Joyce. You and she grew up together. It would be such a waste if the two of you didn't end up together."

Alexander opened his mouth to refuse, but Katrina stopped him with a well-timed, disarming smile."Alexander, you need to think ahead. Look at Daniela. She's already brought Cedric home. Young people these days don't waste any time. For all we know, she might already be expecting. You don't want to fall too far behind her, do you?"

Her gaze stayed fixed on him, studying his every movement with calculated precision. She searched for any sign of unease or hesitation, knowing that even the smallest crack in his composure would be a victory.

What she got, however, was far beyond what she had anticipated. Alexander's hand froze mid-motion, the knife he was holding suspended in his grip.

His pupils narrowed, and an icy storm of emotions flickered in his eyes-confusion, resentment, and something far darker.

Under the harsh glow of the chandelier, his gaze locked with hers. He parted his lips as though to say something, but the words never came. Instead, he lowered the knife to the table, his expression drained of warmth.

The rest of the dinner passed in tense silence.

Katrina leaned towards Alexander before stepping into her car.′′A|lexander, it doesn't matter whether it's Daniela or Joyce. Marrying into the Harper family is all the same. If Cedric can make himself at home with us,so can you-especially given your history with Joyce. Take your time to think it over, and let me know."

Her tone was calm, yet her words carried a quiet authority that left little room for argument.

That momentary crack in Alexander's composure gave Katrina all the confidence she needed.

She was certain he would come around-whether because he still carried feelings for Daniela or because his pride wouldn't let him walk away entirely.

On the drive home, Caiden finally broke the silence. "You said Joyce and Daniela are alike. Do you really believe that? Do you think Alexander will agree to this?"

Katrina's expression darkened, and her voice turned sharp. "What exactly are you suggesting? Do you think Joyce is somehow inferior to Daniela? Is there a reason marrying Joyce would be such an impossible idea?What are you trying to say?"

Katrina knew Joyce better than anyone, but she still defended her daughter firecely. "Just wait. Alexander and Richard will call us soon enough,"

In her mind, Alexander's personal feelings didn't matter. The only thing that counted was ensuring Joyce married him.

There was no way she would allow her daughter to live a life that paled in comparison to Daniela's. "And if Alexander refuses?" Caiden asked.

"Then we'll find someone else," she replied without hesitation."Joyce is the sister of the Elite Lux CEO. She could have her pick of suitors, no matter what. Even if she had a dozen kids, there would still be men líning up to marry her."
###Chapter 178 Strangers


Alexander drove in silence, the car enveloped in an oppressive quiet.

Richard didn't say a word either, his frustration palpable.

When they arrived, Richard stepped out, his expression betraying the anger simmering beneath the surface.

He couldn't fathom how everything had gone so disastrously wong.

Joyce, with her foolishness, had even gone so far as to have a child. How could someone like her have the audacity to position herself as a match for Alexander?

It didn't make sense.

He shook his head. How could Daniela-brilliant, capable-be replaced by someone as unremarkable as Joyce?

Regret gnawed at him. He had been too hard on Daniela, too blind to what she had offered in the past.

If only he had intervened when Alexander and Daniela's marriage began to unravel. Perhaps if he had spoken up, he could have kept them together. Back then, Daniela's devotion to Alexander was clear. She would have stayed if she had thought there was still hope.

And if she had stayed? He could only imagine the success they'd be sharing now. Elite Lux, the gaming company,the research institute...

The thought was unbearable. Richard stopped himself from following that train of thought any further.Every time he thought about the immense value of what had been lost, a fresh wave of regret hit him like a blow.

It was like holding a winning lottery ticket, only to realize he'd missed the deadline to claim the prize.

The sting of losing something so priceless, something that had been in his grasp, was almost too much to bear. In the stillness of the night, Richard glanced at Alexander. His voice, low and strained, carried a tinge of desperation."Is there really no way to fix this?"

Alexander didn't respond. He sat motionless, the silence stretching between them.

Was there still a chance?

He honestly didn't know.

Daniela had moved on-Cedric's presence in her life made that clear, whether their relationship was official or not. Cedric's place in her world was undeniable.

Alexander realized that, in the past, he had never truly noticed Daniela.

But he had always seen her. After Brylee's death, she had carried herself with a quiet, unapproachable air,as if she had built a fortress around herself.

There was a detachment about her, a boundary that no one-not even him-was allowed to cross.

Alexander didn't answer Richard's question.

Instead, he started the car and drove away, leaving his father behind. He could hear the faint, weary sigh Richard let out.

The car sped into the night.

When Alexander reached the bar, Keith was already there, waving cheerfully as soon as he spotted him.

"What's this? You actually called me out for drinks? What's going on?" Keith teased, his voice light and playful.

Alexander strode past him, his face devoid of expression. Without saying a word, he grabbed a glass, filled it with wine, and drank deeply.J

Keith's eyes widened in alarm. "Hold on! That's wine worth tens of thousands of dollars, and you're drinking it like it's water."

Alexander didn't acknowledge the comment. His gaze dropped to his glass, watching the wine swirl lazily inside.

Without meaning to, his thoughts drifted back to Daniela.

Her large, expressive eyes. The graceful curve of her nose. She had always been reserved, speaking only when necessary.

When she smiled, faint dimples appeared at the edges of her lips, softening her usually serious demeanor.

Had she truly loved him for a decade?

The world often labeled him as cold, distant, even heartless.

But was that really who he was?

Only he knew the answer to that. He remembered a time when he had tried to take their relationship to a deeper level-both emotionally and physically.

In truth, he had wanted to have sex with her. But he hadn't been direct with her.

Their dynamic had always placed him in the position of being pursued. She was the one who chased, and he was the one who stood untouchable on his pedestal.

When he finally broached the subject, it was laced with pride and an air of superiority.

Her response, however, was not what he had anticipated. She didn't seem to understand himn at first-or perhaps she chose not to. Either way, her face reflected shock and confusion.

It was almost as if the idea of physical intimacy had never even occurred to her. It seemed as though the thought of them being that close had never once crossed her mind.

The next day, she had handed him an expensive watch.
 
"What's this supposed to mean?" he asked, already knowing the answer.

The gift wasn't just a gift. It was her unspoken attempt at compensation-for turning him down.

Yet Daniela couldn't bring herself to explain. She had stood by the doorway, deliberately keeping her distance. In that moment, Alexander noticed something he hadn't seen before.

She had gone to great lengths for him. Her delicate, piano-trained hands had mastered racing cars just to impress him. But those same hands had never reached for his.

She would drink well past her limits to match his reckless energy. She had risked her life speeding through dangerous tracks at night just to share his world. Yet she never stepped closer. Never gave him even the slightest hint of affection beyond her actions.

She would show up at dawn to drive him home after his nights of heavy drinking when he could barely stand. But she had never once tried to be intimate with him while he was drunk. Never crossed that unspoken boundary between them.

To everyone else, Daniela's love for him seemed undeniable.

It was something people said over and over.

Everyone believed it.

But Alexander felt lost in the middle of it all. Was this really/love?

A love so pure, stripped of emotional or physical closeness, felt out of place between a man and a woman.Could something so distant truly be called love?

The question tormented him. He couldn't make sense of it. He tried dropping hints, subtle and not-so-subtle, hoping she'd notice, hoping she'd finally respond.

But Daniela never did. Instead, she would hand him yet another expensive gift, each more extravagant than the last.

And as others looked on with envy, marveling at what they thought was devotion, Alexander began to see the truth more clearly with each passing day. Daniela didn't love him.

She wasn't looking at him at all. It was as though she were searching for something beyond him, something he couldn't understand. What was it? He couldn't say.

Not until the day he stumbled across the sketchbook in her closet. That was when everything made sense.

And so, he molded himself into the person he saw in that sketchbook.

Outwardly, nothing seemed to change. He maintained his pride, his poise, and his carefully crafted demeanor. But behind the facade, hestarted spending more time with Joyce, curious to see how Daniela would react.

Yet when she caught sight of him with Joyce, her expression was calm. In fact, it seemed more at ease than when he had once tried to hold her hand.

Now,seated at the bar, Alexander poured himself another drink. The bitterness of his thoughts ran deeper than the wine's burn as it slid down his throat.

Daniela had deceived everyone. But most painfully, she had deceived him. And the worst part was that he had known it all along.

He took another long sip before suddenly turning to Keith. "Have you ever loved someone? The kind of love where you'd give up everything-maybe even your life-for her?"

Keith's eyes widened in surprise.

Alexander, the man known for his cold indifference, was asking about love?

Though startled, Keith assumed Alexander must be drunk. He decided to humor him. With a faint smile, he said, "Not to that extent. But yeah, I've loved someone before. Someone | thought I'd be with for the rest of my life."

There was a wistful undertone to his words. It was clear Keith, still unmarried, was speaking of a love that had long since ended.

Alexander leaned forward, pressing surther. "And after it ended, did you two become strangers? Like none of it ever happened?"

Just like how Daniela acted now.

As though she had never loved him. For reasons even Alexander couldn't fully grasp, this question consumed him tonight. He needed an answer.
Desperately.
###Chapter 179 He Must See Daniela Today


After pondering for a moment, Keith slowly shook his head. "No."

Alexander hesitated, his hand frozen mid-air, holding his glass.

Keith distinctly observed a fleeting look of discomfort cross Alexander's face after a brief moment of surprise.

"Really? After a breakup, aren't you supposed to move on as if you never knew each other?" Alexander queried.

Keith shook his head once more."If you truly loved someone, turning into strangers isn't an option. There was a time when your heart genuinely skipped a beat for her, and you earnestly wanted to be together.Unless it was all a facade, how could you so easily cast aside someone who once meant so much? Even if you're apart, the moment you reunite, the old sparks will reignite. Seeing the one you love again is akin to reliving the exhilaration of falling in love over and over."

Alexander took a deep draught from his glass.

Keith continued, "There are only two scenarios when you treat a past love like a stranger-either you loved too deeply and hid your feelings well, or you never truly fell in love."

Keith noticed that after his last words, Alexander's face turned pale for a moment.

Alexander, looking intently into Keith's eyes, posed his question. "If someone claimed to have loved you for ten years but then behaved as though she never cared, do you think she's hiding her feelings?"

Keith paused, momentarily hesitant.
 
He recognized he had presented two possibilities.

Why was Alexander focusing solely on what he wished to hear?

It dawned on Keith that Alexander was reflecting on his own situation. He offered some advice. "Alexander, that's all behind you. Why linger on it? Daniela appears to be happy now, especially with Cedric. Did you ever think perhaps Cedric is the one she was meant to find in her youth?"

At that instant, Keith felt a sudden, tight grip around his neck.

Alexander's face darkened, his eyes turning icy as he stared at Keith like an enemy. "I warned you!" he declared.

Keith struggled to breathe as Alexander tightened his grip.

"I warned you! Never mention that Cedric is the man Daniela always wanted to meet," Alexander seethed,oblivious to the veins popping on Keith's forehead.

Keith felt as though he was on the brink of death.

Frantically, he nodded, patting Alexander's arm in desperation.

Just as he was about to black out from the lack of oxygen, Alexander released his hold.

Keith doubled over, racked with coughs.

Looking up, he saw Alexander leaving the bar with a menacing aura.

Keith massaged his neck, whispering to himself, "Didn't you claim to have no feelings for Daniela? What's with the heartbroken expression now?"

Alexander's car tore down the street, driven by a single urgent thought.

He needed to see Daniela immediately.

He planned to tell her that he accepted her love and that she no longer needed to conceal her feelings.

Daniela was watching TV when Alexander, smelling strongly of alcohol, stormed into her home.

Cedric rose, positioning himself protectively in front of Daniela.

The sight ignited fury in Alexander's eyes. He stared at them, convinced Cedric was seizing the moment for his advantage.

Unsteady and intoxicated, Alexander looked past Cedric and fixed his gaze on Daniela.

"I have a question for you,"he stated.
###Chapter 180 Daniela, Did You Ever Love Me


Katrina observed Alexander, her smile widening as she lounged comfortably, nibbling on a snack, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding drama.

For her, it was inconsequential whether Alexander wound up with Joyce or not.

Her true intent was simply to agitate everyone involved.

Daniela had relished her triumphs for far too long, and Katrina was eager to watch her wrestle with her emotions, torn and indecisive.

Cedric or Alexander? The choice was anything but simple-one embodied a love from her past, while the other was her unwavering confidant.

Regardless of Daniela's choice, one would inevitably feel the sting of rejection, and even the chosen one might begin to harbor doubts and mistrust over time.

Wherever there were fissures, there lay opportunities for manipulation.

Katrina relished the thought of shattering Daniela's seemingly flawless existence.

"Oh my," Katrina exclaimed, her tone oozing with feigned concern as she ushered Alexander into the room."Alexander, it seems you've had a bit too much to drink. What could have possibly brought you here so late,and in that condition? It must be serious!"

Katrina turned to Daniela with a layer of mock sincerity thick in her voice. "Daniela, perhaps it's best if you step outside to talk with him. For Alexander to come unannounced like this, it must be something crucial he's desperate to share with you." a

Under the warm,deceiving glow of the lights, Katrina's lips twisted into a sly smile, her face a mask of pretended goodwil, masking intentions far from benevolent.

From the moment Alexander entered the room, his gaze had locked onto Daniela with an unyielding intensity.

In his mind, Katrina's manipulative words had backed Daniela into a corner. Certainly, she wouldn't deny him the decency of a private conversation.

"Whatever it is you want to say, you can say it right here," Daniela replied, hervoice firm, though she kept her eyes averted.


That simple declaration almost drove Alexander to the brink of fury.

His gaze flicked to Cedric, who stood by Daniela's side, quiet yet exuding a calm confidence. Then, his eyes shifted to Ryan and Lillian, who had both stood up the moment he had walked in, their postures tense, like warriors braced for confrontation.


The truth came crashing down on him, as if he'd been struck by an invisible force.

Daniela was no longer the woman he once knew.

She was no longer the vulnerable, isolated girl who had nobody to lean on-one who could be easily swayed and taken advantage of at his convenience.

A wave of unease gripped Alexander, his hands curling into tight fists that trembled slightly at his sides.

"I just need a moment with you. Just the two of us."

Unmoved, Daniela replied, "I'm sorry, but I don't engage with those who've had too much to drink.Furthermore,there doesn't appear to be anything of such immediate concern that we should discuss this privately. If there's nothing more, Josie, would you mind showing him out?"

Her flat refusal felt like a cold, stinging rebuff-not only to Alexander but to Katrina as well, who had been secretly thrilled about the potential spectacle.

Was this the same woman who had once been utterly smitten with Alexander?

Maintaining an air of icy politeness, Josie held the door open and muttered, "Mr. Bennett, please be careful as you leave." Her brisk dismissal was clear and final, leaving no space for protest.

A mix of disappointment and shock washed over Katina. She had anticipated a fiery exchange, yet the anticipated drama had dissipated before it truly began.

How could she just stand by?

"Daniela, this seems quite harsh. Alexander dragged himself all the way here to talk to you, and you're just brushing him off like he's nothing? You didn't used to be this cold. What's gotten into you? Did Alexander somehow offend you?" Katrina raised her voice.

From across the room, Alexander's gaze locked onto Daniela.

He stood in silence, his anticipation palpable, craving an explanation.

What had changed her so profoundly?

Daniela felt like a stranger to him now.

He began to navigate through the crowd towards her, his intent clear. He extended his hand, eager to bridge the distance with a touch.

However,Cedric intercepted,stepping in with a posture that shielded her from Alexander's advance.

His expression remained inscrutable, his voice low yet resolute, laced with an unmistakable caution.′′She made herself clear-if you've got something to say, say it right here."

Alexander's patience snapped, frustration sharpening his tone into a piercing rebuke. "How dare you try to stand in my way? Who the hell do you think you are in her life?"

"And just who the fuck do you think you are to her? You're nothing but an ex. How many damn times do we have to go over this? She's not meeting you alone. If you've got something to say, then fucking say it right here."

Cedric's demeanor was icy, his authority palpable. His voice never rose, yet it filled the room with a commanding,dangerous energy that reminded everyone of his power. His presence alone was enough to command attention, a chilling reminder of the formidable figure Cedric truly was.

Cedric's polite charm and devoted actions towards Daniela had led everyone to believe he was a completely different person.

Yet, the core of Cedric's character remained unchanged-ruthless, scheming, and relentless.

Alexander's muscles tensed, his hands shaking slightly as he clenched them at his sides.

Cedric's mouth twisted into a sly, provoking smirk. He tilted his head dismissively, regarding Alexander as if he were an insignificant bother. "Or you'd prefer to discuss things with me one-on-one first?"

While speaking, Cedric nonchalantly snapped his fingers, the crack echoing ominously, a clear signal of his thinning patience.

Katrina had half-expected Daniela to intervene and calm the storm brewing between the two men.

But Daniela acted as though she didn't notice the drama unfolding before her eyes.

With a long exhale, Katrina felt the weight of her growing anxiety settle over her.

This was the Harper family's residence, and if Cedric decided to unleash his fury on Alexander here,Richard's anger might very well be redirected at her.

Attempting to lighten the heavy air, Katrina forced a laugh, though a hollow one."Oh, come now! What's all this fuss about? It's freezing out there. Surely whatever it is, we can talk about it here, can't we? Alexander,go ahead. What do you need to say?"

Alexander's gaze remained unwaveringly on Daniela.

He scrutinized her features, desperate to decipher any trace of emotion beneath her composed, distant demeanor.

Yet, he found nothing-no warmth, no hint of regret, nor the slightest glimmer of the affection that once filled her eyes when she looked at him. As he continued to stare, his disappointment deepened, fueled further by the alcohol swirling through his veins, intensifying his emotions. He knew he was supposed to walk away, salvage the remnants of his pride.But he was compelled to stay, driven by ar insatiable need for answers.

The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension, palpable to the silent spectators gathered around.

Alexander's frustration reached a boiling point. Never had he imagined a time when they would communicate across such a void-she seemed utterly unattainable now.

"Daniela, did you ever love me?" His question lingered, suspended in the heavy air.

A hush descended over the room.

Even Joyce, previously absorbed in her game, halted and turned to gaze at Alexander, her eyes wide with shock and disbelief.
###Chapter 181 Daniela Is Unwilling





Joyce's brow furrowed in confusion. She tugged at Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander, what are you implying? Why would you ask Daniela that? Aren't you supposed to have feelings for me?"


Was it because of the child she had with someone else? Was that why Alexander stopped liking her?



Disheartened, Joyce pressed on, seeking clarity in her turmoil. "But Alexander, weren't your feelings for me meant to be everlasting?"


Her innocent inquiry struck a chord with Alexander,sparking a harsh realization.



Didn't Daniela promise to cherish him endlessly,holding on to that love forever?



Yet,reality often scoffed at such ideals.



A sudden pallor washed over Alexander's face as the weight of the moment settled on him. Nonetheless, his eyes remained steadfastly fixed on Daniela.



Since he asked the question, he was determined to get an answer.


Alexander pulled his sleeve free from Joyce's grasp,turned to Daniela, and demanded, "Tell me, Daniela,was there ever truly love for me in your heart?"


Silence enveloped the room once more.


Alexander braced himself for her possible answers.



"Yes,I loved you."


"My love for you was profound."


"Why else would I have married you?"


Alexander's heart held a secret hope: to see a flicker of struggle, a flash of regret cross Daniela's face, or even provoke her to a point of exasperation so intense she might strike him in a fit of passion-anything to give voice to the storm of emotions he believed raged within her.


At times, a question was nothing more than a desperate search for affirmation.


Alexander longed to hear Daniela confess, "I loved you."


Yet,her response was nothing but silence.


The room, crowded with silent onlookers, mirrored her quiet stillness.


All eyes in the living room fixated on Daniela,who remained wordless.


Alexander's expression grew cold and distant.


He attempted to bypass Cedric, but Cedric stood firm,an immovable barrier.


Thus, Alexander could only edge closer to Daniela,his fists balled in frustration, his voice nearly breaking as he demanded, "Daniela! Tell me the truth! Did you ever truly love me?"


Daniela offered no response, holding on to her silence.



Alexander's body shook with the force of his suppressed rage, threatening to break through his carefully maintained facade.11SO1it was all a lie?"


Daniela continued to stay silent, leaving the question unanswered.


Even Cedric, usually so composed, appeared taken aback.



He turned slightly, casting a glance at Daniela.


She stood a full head shorter than him, her lips sealed, her eyes hidden under the shadows cast by her lashes.



"So, that's why you refused to sleep with me!"Alexander blurted out, his words slurred slightly by the alcohol. He didn't care about decorum; he was desperate for the truth.



His accusation once again drowned the room in a heavy silence. At that moment, not only were Katrina and Joyce taken aback, but even Ryan and Lillian found themselves caught off guard, their heads whipping around to gaze at Daniela in astonishment.


Their minds buzzed with unanswered questions.


Ten years, and they never slept together? Not even once?


Rumors had long circulated that Daniela harbored a ten-year unrequited love for Alexander, while he seemed utterly aloof.


It was said that Alexander harbored a phobia of germs, and despite Daniela's persistent affection,he had never allowed even a simple handhold.


However,Alexander's recent reproachful tone hinted at a different truth-not that he was unwilling, bout rather that Daniela herself had held back.


Cedric, equally taken by surprise, couldn't conceal his reaction.


Gradually, the corners of his mouth began to turn upwards, his eyes sparkling with mirth as a genuine smile spread across his face, its brightness undeniable.


Finally, Daniela spoke. "I'm very sorry about that.1admit I never had desire for you. As for whether ever loved you..."


Daniela's voice trailed off momentarily.
###Chapter 182 You've Lost





The entire room went silent, the air thick with anticipation as everyone waited.


"I'm sorry, but I don't have a clear answer." Daniela's steady voice cut through the stillness. "I've never truly understood what it means to love someone. So,I can't say if I ever loved you."


"Then why did you treat me so well?" Alexander's eyes brimmed with pain, staring at her as if she were a coldhearted liar-a woman who had played with his feelings just to leave him broken.


Daniela let out a quiet sigh. There wasn't a trace of guilt or remorse in her expression, only a calm sense of finality.


"I'm not sure if what I felt for you was love, but the care I showed you was genuine, Back when we were kids, you treated me with kindness, so it was only natural for me to want to give that back. I also believed that marriage wasn't built on fleeting emotions like passion-it needed effort, dedication,and commitment. Passionate love fades fast. By marrying you, I thought I was proving my sincerity and my desire to create a life together. But it hasn't been that long since we divorced. Do I really need to remind you why it ended?"


Her tone remained steady and calm,each word chosen with care. "You had an affair with Joyce.You were the one who gave me an ultimatum-either kneel and apologize or walk away. Maybe I didn't know if I loved you, but I do know one thing: love means loyalty; love means taking someone's side. If I didn't love you, then you didn't love me either. And because of that, Alexander, you have no right to point fingers at me."


Daniela's logic was unshakable.


At that moment, the reality hit everyone in the room like a cold gust of wind.


There was no denying it-Daniela had never really been in love with Alexander. After all, true love-wild, messy, and consuming-never lets anyone escape unscathed. Sure, Daniela might have been hurt. But without love, the pain didn't stick; it didn't carve any lasting wounds.


Now, she could discuss it with absolute ease,treating it like it was a trivial annoyance rather than something meaningful.


Daniela wasn't certain if she ever loved Alexander.


Yet, anyone who had ever been in love could see that Daniela truly didn't love Alexander.


And this truth was even more painfully obvious to Alexander.


He couldn't put into words the ripping sensation inside him when Daniela spoke.


His gaze towards Daniela was icy.


"Daniela! I can't believe you! All this time, you've been making a fool out of me!"


He had never claimed to have feelings for Joyce. He was just fed up with Daniela's unshakable composure-the kind that made it seem like nothing,no matter how big, could ever faze her.


Everyone thought Daniela loved him, but Alexander had always sensed there was something off-something he couldn't quite put his finger on.


All these years, he had struggled to figure out what it was.


So,he'd tried to provoke her jealousy.


He thought being around Joyce might awaken the feelings Daniela had kept locked away.


Yet, even after their divorce, he was left with nothing.


Today, he finally realized the truth. The barrier between them wasn't something he could fix. It was her heart, unreachable and distant.


Even so, he wasn't willing to let go. He opened his mouth, prepared to voice the one question that had been consuming him: If he offered to start over, would she take him back?Love or no love, he was determined to make her fall for him this time!


This time, he'd do it right.


Cedric noticed the resolve and the storm of emotions building in Alexander's gaze.


But before Alexander could say a word, Cedric stepped in, his imposing figure blocking Alexander's view of Daniela completely. "Haven't you said enough?"


Alexander's head whipped towards Cedric, his jaw tightening.


"If you're done, then get out!" Cedric added.


Alexander glared at Cedric, who stood a full head taller. "This is between Daniela and me."


Cedric gave a small nod. "If you two were still married, I might have stayed out of this. But you're not. She's not your wife anymore, Alexander. You made your choice, and it was the wrong one." The harsh lighting above threw shadows over Alexander's pale, tense features.


Then Cedric dropped the final bomb, his voice cold and firm. "Once you make your move, there's no going back. You've lost."
###Chapter 183 Men Are Naturally Possessive Of Their Women
Alexander's head jerked up in alarm upon hearing those words.



He met Cedric's gaze firmly. Then, he attempted to see Daniela, but she was completely obscured by Cedric.



This unfamiliar sensation unsettled him.



In a rough voice, he called out, "Daniela?"


Silence followed.



He called again, "Daniela."


Raising his voice, he shouted, "Daniela!"


Yet, there was no reply. And there never would be.


Daniela had always been emotionally distant, like a block of ice. No action of Alexander's could stir any reaction from her.She remained indifferent.


Alexander realized it was futile. Daniela was unmoved by anything he did.


She had openly admitted she did not understand love. She could not love.


Her responses were limited to polite apologies and logical rebuttals, nothing more.


Feeling heartbroken and defeated, Alexander abandoned the pretense he had maintained for so long, only to be met with acold "Sorry."


He bowed his head, releasing a bitter chuckle.


Looking up once more, his expression resumed its usual detachment. He turned to Cedric and spoke evenly. "Cedric, do you see what I mean? How many years can you afford to waste on someone like her?"


Alexander was not jealous but spoke with conviction."Your passion now will become a joke. Or perhaps it won't bother you. But Daniela is unchangeable.She's too cold. And why would you try? She grew up in a loveless environment, losing her mother early. How much genuine love can remain in her heart? Cedric,understand this: Daniela loves only herself. No one else matters. Do you see what I'm saying?"


Daniela had been chasing Alexander for a decade.


Ten whole years!


Yet, her feelings never deepened. She simply went through the motions to marry him.


Common belief held that the Bennetts were coerced into agreeing to the marriage by the overpowering influence of the Harpers.


What remained unknown was that without his consent, the marriage would not have occurred.


Suddenly, Alexander yelled, "Daniela!"


Lightning flashed across the sky, thunder booming immediately after.


Alexander's voice, deep and menacing, blended with the thunderstorm. His face contorted in rage, and his cry seemed almost cursed. "You are destined to be alone and unloved forever! You have no heart!"



As he spoke, lightning struck a massive tree outside,which then toppled over.


Cedric quickly covered Daniela's ears as Alexander's furious voice escalated.



Dazed, Daniela looked up.


The thunder was overwhelming, and Cedric's hands firmly covered her ears, blocking out Alexander's tirade.



In the brief illumination, Daniela's gaze met Cedric's bright, unwavering eyes.


"Don't be scared," Cedric whispered, his voice soft and soothing as a melody on a warm summer night,filled with promise. "I'll never leave your side. You'll never be alone."


Daniela blinked slowly, meeting his gaze. Cedric reassured her, "Do what makes you happy.Pursue what you enjoy. Love isn't crucial. Just focus on your happiness, and I'll handle everything else."


In the reflection in Cedric's eyes, Daniela saw herself.She blinked again and said, "I feel as though I've known you from a distant past."


Cedric offered her a tender smile, reserved only for her.



Leaning in, he tapped her nose playfully. "What's with the puzzled look? You're not as sharp as everyone thinks."


Curious,Daniela tilted her head. "Really?"


Cedric chuckled, stood up straight, and gently tousled her hair.


Alexander stood a few steps away, observing their intimate exchange with fists tightly clenched.


Internally, he was consumed by rage and despair,eagerly awaiting the day Cedric would face disgrace and abandonment as he had. Alexander was convinced of one thing-Daniela was incapable of true love.


Turning away, he addressed Katrina. "I accept your proposal."


Katrina was visibly taken aback by his abrupt agreement. "What?" she gasped.


"I have one condition," Alexander stated, his voice as detached as ice.


"Anything!" Katrina responded eagerly, nodding."Whatever you desire, I'll consent!"


Katrina presumed Alexander would demand a portion of the Harper family's fortune.


Instead, Alexander, eyeing Daniela speaking with Cedric, declared, "As Joyce's fiance, it's appropriate for me to move in early-to acclimate to married life."


Katrina beamed at the mention of "fiance.""Absolutely," she agreed cheerfully.


Alexander's face remained expressionless. "Then kindly prepare a room adjacent to Cedric's. I'll be moving in tonight."


He was eager to personally witness Cedric's ruin.


He yearned to see if Cedric could withstand a decade of loving a woman who was incapable of returning his affection.



Having stated his intentions, Alexander returned home to collect his belongings.


Joyce, phone in hand, watched his resolute departure and tugged at Katrina's sleeve.


Brimming with joy, Katrina exclaimed, "Darling, did you hear? Alexander has agreed to marry you!"


Joyce's response was devoid of joy. "But he never once looked at me when he proposed."


His gaze had been fixed on Daniela the entire time.


Katrina brushed a strand of hair behind her ear and comforted Joyce."Marrying into the Bennett family is now your best course. Alexander is astute and capable. Your future is secure. He may seem distant,but your father and I are here to support you.Remember, men are straightforward beings. Don't emulate Daniela's stubbornness. There's a time to concede. Men inherently want to dominate in relationships, craving that control. It's essential to distinguish between being merely someone's partner and truly integrating into their life. Don't hesitate to fulfill his needs. Otherwise, he might seek them elsewhere. Men operate this way. You must learn how to appeal to him, how to captivate his heart.Daniela's inability to grasp this led to her failure.Take this as a lesson, okay?"
###Chapter 184 | Thought You Never Liked Daniela
Alexander headed home and started throwing his belongings into a suitcase.


Richard asked, "So, it's decided, then?"


Alexander, his anger still simmering, forcefully zipped up the suitcase. "Yes! I'll be there to witness Cedric's downfall myself. When it happens, Daniela's real face will be exposed."


Without another word, he grabbed the suitcase and stormed out.



Richard stayed where he was, releasing a long,exhausted sigh.


Questions swirled in his mind, ones he wished he could throw at Alexander. Was it really worth it?

 
Hadn't Alexander himself claimed he never even liked Daniela?



So why on earth would he take things so far as to marry Joyce-a woman with another man's child?


The Harper family's wealth was securely under Daniela's control. Richard couldn't come up with any logical explanation for Alexander's choice to marry Joyce.



Was it for power?


Or wealth?



Neither seemed like a prize worth such a costly trade.





For a man like Alexander, renowned for his shrewdness and relentless pursuit of profit, this was the most irrational and loss-ridden decision he'd ever made.



Richard's weary sigh reverberated through the vast emptiness of the villa, a sound swallowed by the cold silence. Meanwhile, after Alexander left, Daniela sat down on the sofa with an air of calm.


Without sparing Caiden a glance, she stated in an indifferent tone, "The full audit reveals that three hundred million in assets have been transferred out.Caiden, I'll need the remaining two hundred fifty-two million, three hundred ninety thousand dollars returned to the company at once."


Caiden's face darkened immediately at her words.A flicker of panic flashed in his eyes, and he nearly stammered, "How could you possibly know?"


He had diverted the money through a web of companies, paying hefty commissions to middlemen who swore the transfers were untraceable, even to the sharpest auditors.


And yet Daniela had uncovered it.


How could she have known?


The audit had just started a day earlier, so how had she uncovered not just the missing funds but the precise amount?


"You..." Caiden began, but before he could continue,Katrina quickly grabbed his arm.


Turning toward her, a bit confused, he caught her glance, and she smiled gently at Daniela, her voice soothing. "Daniela, you've got it all wrong. Your father didn't take the company's assets. It was just an investment. You've heard the saying, right? Don't put all your eggs in one basket? Joyce is going to marry Alexander. One day, you'll marry too. All your father ever wanted was to make sure there would be enough wealth for everyone. Sadly, the investments didn't turn out as hoped, and this is all that remains.Let's not make this a bigger issue than it is."


While speaking, Katrina's hand slid behind her back and pinched Caiden sharply on the thigh.


Caiden gasped, his eyes reddening as he bit back a cry of pain. His face twisted into a forced expression of regret. "Daniela, you've done so well for yourself now. Do you really need to make a fuss over this small amount with your father?"  Daniela's lips curled into a smile. "You're wrong.This is the company's money, not mine. Everything that was taken needs to be returned, in full."


Caiden gritted his teeth, the sound of his jaw grinding clearly audible. "And what do you expect me to do about it? I don't have the money! Even if you beat me senseless, I can't pay that much. So, what's next? Go ahead, call the police, and have me arrested!"


He crossed his arms and leaned back, his posture full of defiance.



Lillian couldn't stay quiet any longer and raised her hand. "Hey! You stole from the company, and now you're acting all high and mighty? What's with that attitude?"



Caiden rolled his eyes dramatically. "Yeah, this is how I am. What are you going to do about it?"


"Oh, so now you're not going to return the money?"Daniela held a small fruit knife in her hand. The back of her hand was wrapped in a bandage, one Cedric  had carefully put on earlier that morning.


She flicked the knife casually, and its small blade shimmered in the light. Caiden's heart raced.


"Alright. There's a way out." A slight smile tugged at her lips, her dimples softly appearing on her cheeks.She appeared innocent, almost like a harmless college student. For a brief moment, Caiden felt his tension ease-until her next words struck him like a blow.



"I'll offer you three choices. First, treat the money as Joyce's final dowry payment. From now on, she's considered married off, and she won't claim a single cent of the family's fortune."


Katrina jumped up from her seat, her face burning with fury."No chance!"


True, the Harper family was in decline. But they still possessed more wealth than most.


Besides, with Daniela running the business now, who could say Harper Group wouldn't bounce back and reclaim its fortune?


Two hundred million, and cutting off Joyce completely? That was simply unthinkable!


Daniela nodded without a hint of hesitation. "Okay,then here's the second option. Use Caiden's shares in the company to settle the debt. I'm not asking for anything more-just give me his shares, and we'll consider it settled."


Caiden shook his head firmly this time. "That's impossible!"


Daniela nodded once more, her smile unwavering.


Caiden asked, "What's the third option?"


Daniela slowly lifted her gaze to meet his. Her eyes held something-sharp, cold, and unyielding.It made Caiden feel as though the very air around him had frozen.



Daniela didn't break eye contact as she spoke again."If you can't accept one of the first two choices, then I hope you're ready for jail."  Caiden's fury surged, and he was about to shout,ready to accuse her of being ungrateful and disrespectful.


But before a word could escape his lips, a cold, shiny object appeared in front of him. In one quick,graceful movement, Daniela lifted the fruit knife and drove it straight into the watermelon on the fruit platter.


The knife hit the fruit with a sharp thud, sinking deep inside. Red juice began to spill from the cut, running down the blade and dripping onto the dark wooden table. The deep red color of the juice resembled fresh blood in a way that felt unsettling.
###Chapter 185 Bad News




As Alexander entered with his luggage, Daniela gave a sharp clap, rising to her feet, her face as cold and distant as always.


She glanced at the clock and stated calmly, "It's 10:50 p.m. now. If the remaining funds aren't in by this time tomorrow, don't say I didn't warn you."


With that, she turned and began to ascend the stairs at a deliberate pace.


Caiden's rage boiled over as he pointed at Daniela's retreating back, shouting,"Daniela! You ungratefu brat! After everything I've done for you, you expect me to pull this huge amount out of thin air? Are you trying to break me? Fine! If you want a choice, I'll pick prison! Call the cops, arrest me, I don't care! I'm done with this!"


As his words echoed through the room, Daniela paused midway up the stairs, slowly turning to face him.


With an expression of innocent curiosity, Daniela looked down at him, her eyes wide and sincere, as if asking, "Are you sure about that?"


For a moment, Caiden faltered, his bravado slipping away.


The words caught in his throat, and he couldn't manage a reply.


After Daniela vanished upstairs, Caiden exploded,his voice rising. "Did you all see that? Did you see what just happened?"


Standing with his hands on his hips, he seethed in frustration, pointing angrily at the stairs. "This is the daughter l've raised for over ten years. Look at her!She's just like Brylee-heartless. Now she wants to send me to the police!"


Looking at Alexander, Caiden added bitterly, "You were right all along. Daniela has no heart. Divorcing her was the right choice! Who knows what kind of chaos she'd have caused your family!"


Alexander observed with a chilling detachment,fully aware this was only the beginning.


Daniela had distanced herself from her family, then it would be her friends, and finally Cedric.


Ultimately, she would find herself as isolated as she had been when she once pursued him.


He was biding his time, anticipating the day Daniela would return, groveling for his forgiveness.


She would face the consequences of her sharp words from today.


Katrina remained calm and pursed her lips before turning to Alexander. "What do you think we should do? Daniela expects us to find this massive sum, all at once, and we..."


She shot a meaningful look at Caiden before turning back to Alexander. "We honestly can't manage it."


Carrying his luggage, Alexander inquired of a servant, "Where is my room?"


The servant gestured towards a guest room.


Alexander nodded and turned to Katrina. "This is between Caiden and Daniela. I've divorced her, so I'm not involved. It's getting late, so I'm going to bed.Goodnight."


Without another word, he walked away, ignoring Katrina's desperate calls for him to stop.


Her voice softened with frustration as she muttered,"Aren't you going to marry Joyce? Shouldn't we handle this money problem together? The Bennett family surely has enough to cover this."







Getting the money was like asking Caiden to give up his very existence.


After his shower, Caiden made his way to Alexander's door, knocking sharply.

 
Alexander's expression remained neutral as he spoke. "I've spoken to my family about your situation. My father suggests we hold off on the engagement ceremony until things settle down. If Joyce marries me without a dowry, she'll be ridiculed by other families, especially with a child in the picture. My family isn't bothered, but you wouldn't want to see Joyce face that kind of embarrassment.My father thinks we should wait until the Harper family is back on solid ground, ensure Joyce has a proper dowry, and then he'll personally come to arrange the marriage with you."



His words cut down Caiden's plans, effectively delaying the engagement until Harper Group was stable once more.


This was, without a doubt, disastrous news for Caiden.


Katrina,however, seemed undisturbed. "Living under the same roof, it's inevitable that feelings will grow.Once Joyce has Alexander's child, he'l have no choice but to marry her." Caiden cast a glance at Alexander's door, his voice barely audible, "Really? Do you think it'll go the way we planned?"
###Chapter 186 | Am Not As Strong As You
Caiden's anger raged on, his furious voice carrying up from downstairs, barely softened by the thin walls.


"Daniela! If I had known things would end up like this,| would have never brought you into this world!You're just like your mother-cold and heartless.You're doomed to be alone forever!"


Daniela sat cross-legged on the floor in her room,engrossed in a puzzle.


Cedric had gifted it to her, urging her to take a break and indulge in some relaxation instead of working nonstop.


She found peace in the quiet, and Cedric had brought over eighty thousand pieces, now scattered across the floor. When Cedric knocked and stepped inside, he found Daniela on the floor, fitting pieces together.


Her face stayed blank, void of any emotion.


Daniela usually had a bright, cheerful demeanor, and when she smiled, her eyes sparkled as if they could light up the entire world.


But now, with her silence and lack of expression, it felt as though time itself had come to a halt.


Cedric was in his casual clothes and sat down beside Daniela, crossing his legs as he joined her in the puzzle.


The two worked in quiet harmony, exchanging pieces wordlessly until Lillian knocked on the door and announced,"Time for bed."



Only then did Daniela glance up and give a small nod.


Her gaze met Cedric's, and his face softened into a smile.



"What is it?" Daniela inquired. Cedric leaned in slightly, and for a moment, Lillian thought he was about to kiss Daniela.


But he didn't.


He stopped just in front of her, and Daniela stayed still, unmoved by his proximity.


"What's going on?" Daniela blinked, the overhead light casting a delicate shadow over her eyelashes.


Cedric stayed silent and rubbed his hands together before gently pressing his warm palms against Daniela's ears, a soothing gesture to warm her up.


Daniela remained motionless, her eyes locking with Cedric's, their faces just inches apart.


She couldn't help but notice the sharp, straight line of Cedric's nose and how appealing his lips looked.


"Just trying to warm up your ears," Cedric said with a smile. "Don't let those harsh words affect you."


Daniela's eyes were fixed on Cedric's smiling lips, her mind free of any distractions. All she could think was how charming his smile was.His voice was soft and pleasant. Why did people speak of him as someone to fear? He didn't seem that way at all.


"Daniela." Noticing her distraction, Cedric pressed his forehead against hers. "Many people say I'm lucky.Lucky to glide through life on my own, lucky to thrive in business, lucky that every investment has worked out. I never used to believe in luck, but now l think I do. I actually feel like I'm really lucky, and I realize why."


He paused, feeling the luck of meeting Daniela again.


Cedric grinned. "I'm passing on some of that good luck to you. From now on, each day will be smooth and safe for you, Daniela. You won't be alone forever,I promise. No matter what others say, I'll always be by your side. Don't be afraid."


Daniela blinked slowly at his words.


In that instant, Cedric felt the delicate brush of her long eyelashes against his heart, sending a small flutter through him.


"I'm not afraid," Daniela replied. "I've never been afraid of being alone. Those words don't affect me."


Cedric's smile widened at her words.


Taking a bold step and risking being rejected, he nudged his nose against Daniela's.


It was cool to the touch, but more than that,it sent a stirring warmth through his chest.


Cedric responded with a smile, "Then you're amazing. I'm not as strong as you. I was worried you might be scared."


After speaking, he slowly pulled back from her,adding, "But I'm absolutely terrified."


Daniela wasn't used to offering comfort or saying the right things. Maybe she used to be good at saying kind things, but over the years, as she was repeatedly ignored, she gradually realized that no one would acknowledge her efforts, so she forgot how to do it. In this moment, however, she clearly felt Cedric's reassurance.



She lowered her gaze, then, copying Cedric's earlier gesture, she rubbed her hands together before leaning forward to cover his ears. "Don't be afraid,"she whispered.
###Chapter 187 He Looked Sad




Bathed in the soft light, Cedric's smile was gentle.His eyes locked on Daniela's, he murmured, "Alright."


In the entryway, Lillian and Ryan came to a sudden halt. Moments later, they shared a glance, quickly covered each other's eyes, and sidestepped away in discomfort.


Downstairs, Lillian murmured, "What's the story with Daniela? Does she not feel love, or does she simply choose not to, or is she just clueless about it?"


Ryan, typically a man of few words and a devoted admirer of Daniela, paused silently. He then leaned in, his gaze sharpening with an intensity rarely seen."I'm not sure. But I think Daniela was flirting with Cedric just now. Did you catch that scene earlier?"


Still shaken, Ryan made wild gestures. "She just covered Cedric's ears. And his cheeks turned red!Can you believe it? And yet she says she doesn't know anything about love? If she can soften Cedric,the famously unshakable, there's nothing she can't do!"



Lillian was quick to agree. "Exactly! She's clueless about the effect she has! Imagine if she tried that on Alexander. He'd be overwhelmed. She's in a league of her own. An absolute master at this. Her charm is undeniable."


Upstairs, Alexander was on his way to get water from the living room.


The moment he opened the door, the chatter from below reached his ears.


His hand stiffened on the doorknob, his face clouding over.





He thought Cedric was fooled by Daniela's tricks.


He himself wouldn't be duped so easily. Nor did he have any interest.


Yet, he lingered in the doorway, tightly gripping his glass, hanging on to their every word.

When Lillian returned upstairs later, she noticed Cedric's ears still bore a flush of red.


With a smirk, she leaned on Daniela's door, took a deep drink of water, and asked, "Daniela, can I ask something?"



Daniela, stretched out on the floor working on the puzzle, seemed as peaceful and unfazed as ever.


Lillian watched her closely, searching for any hint of emotion. But there was nothing.



"Hmm?" Daniela murmured without looking up."What is it?"


In the spacious, quiet room, her voice took on an almost surreal echo.



Pausing briefly, Lillian finally said, "Did you ever treat Alexander the way you did Cedric just now?"


Daniela stopped, a puzzle piece pinched between her fingers. She straightened up and turned to Lillian,her face full of confusion. "How exactly?" Lillian covered her ears.


With a shake of her head, Daniela responded, "No."


Lillian pressed further. "Why not?"


Pondering for a moment, Daniela tilted her head,her brow creased in contemplation. "Why would l?Alexander didn't require that from me."


"Is it really that he didn't need it, or you didn't want to provide it?" Lillian asked. "Consider this. Had Alexander been in Cedric's situation just now, would you have offered him the same comfort?"


Daniela paused to think, then said again, "NNo. That's not how Alexander operates."


"Why then, did you comfort Cedric?"


"Because he looked sad just now," she admitted.It was as if something precious to him had been hurt.In his eyes, she had noticed a momentary, hidden hint of sorrow.


Lillian went on. "And concerning Alexander..." "Lillian, you constantly mention Alexander," Daniela retorted sharply, crossing her legs. "He's not suitable for you. He's cold, manipulative, and obsessed with profit. He's involved with Joyce. Although we're financially stable and could manipulate him with money, I would never recommend someone like him as a partner."


Her attempts had taught her well.


Alexander was simply too distant, too gloomy, and too inconsistent.



He was not a viable candidate for marriage.


Stunned, Lillian blinked in silence.


Ryan, who had been casually leaning against the railing,looked equally astonished.


Breaking the silence, Lillian exclaimed, throwing her hands up, "When will you apply that brilliant business acumen to other areas of life? You're always so logical and strategic at work. Yet, with personal matters? How can all your genius just vanish so completely?"
###Chapter 188 Make Plan In The Prison




Daniela stayed up until after one in the morning working on the puzzle, then finally headed to bed.


She had always found sleep elusive.


The puzzle Cedric gave her had helped burn off some energy, letting her fall asleep somewhat earlier than usual.


Daniela rose around six.


After a morning run with Cedric, she returned to find Katrina waiting for them, beaming. "Daniela, your father is facing severe financial difficulties. Is it possible to extend the repayment term?"


Drying off with a towel, Daniela asked, "Do you intend to repay the debt?"


Katrina nodded earnestly."Yes."


Of course, they intended to return the money Joining Elite Lux would bolster Harper Group considerably.


Pulling out now would be tantamount to throwing away a fortune.



Daniela responded, "Alright."


Katrina took this as a sign of Daniela's agreement to delay the payment, but Daniela's next words took her aback. "Plan your payments from prison then."


Katrina's smile stiffened, and she was speechless for a long moment.


Caiden was venting his frustration again. Cedric gave him a chilling look, causing Caiden's complaints to diminish to a whisper.


The situation was overwhelming for Caiden! Daniela's return had irritated him, and bringing the influential Cedric made him too intimidated to speak up.


Despite his grievances, Caiden managed to gather the necessary funds. This effort drained their savings completely. They had investments abroad, yet the losses were significant. Caiden had to sell eight private properties to barely manage the shortfall.


After resolving the finances, Caiden was utterly exhausted.



His bank account dwindled to just ten thousand dollars.





Once again, Caiden felt the sting of poverty he had known before his marriage to Brylee.


"I asked for Alaskan sablefish. What is this? Have you tried to deceive me with fake seafood?" Joyce complained.



From the kitchen, the servant responded meekly,head bowed, "Miss Harper, your father has reduced the food budget. We can no longer afford luxury items."



Joyce voiced her displeasure immediately. Turning to Katrina, she exclaimed, "Mom, you promised that marrying into the Harper family would ensure a good life. What's going on? I demand Alaskan sablefish,not this garbage!"


Katrina, clenching her teeth, soothed her gently."Sweetheart, just a bit longer. Once Daniela stabilizes the company and it begins to yield profits,our situation will improve."


Katrina and Caiden had researched and discovered that even the least profitable of the companies Daniela managed was generating over ten billion a year.


Despite Harper Group's unstable foundations,earning five billion annually was more than sufficient for a lavish lifestyle.


This rationale led Caiden to comply and hand over the money without further fuss.


Joyce sulked. "We only see dividends at year's end!That's months away! How do you expect me to endure until then? Did you know the caviar Tasha prepared yesterday had dirt in it? How can I possibly  eat that?"


Katrina shared her frustration.


Recalling her past in the countryside, she had faced numerous challenges.


Yet, over the years, she had grown accustomed to comfort and found hardships unbearable now.


Quietly, Katrina advised Joyce, "Ask your father to request an advance from the finance department later. Also, have him ask Daniela to switch to monthly dividend distributions. That way, he can secure ten million for you immediately."


Joyce muttered, "Alright, but Dad needs to speak with Daniela soon. I'mn tired of this lifestyle! It would be embarrassing if people learned I was served dirty caviar!"
###Chapter 189 Pride Doesn't Pay The Bills
Caiden was reluctant to talk to Daniela.He perceived that she had turned from the obedient daughter she once was into someone ruthless, now even rivaling Cedric in her methods. It seemed she was intent on cornering him, her own father.


But he didn't have much money left. Ten thousand dollars barely covered the cost of essential nutritional supplements, much less their escalating expenses.


Katrina's frequent beauty salon visits had completely exhausted their financial reserves.


Pride was of no use in paying the bills.


Resigned, Caiden muttered to himself and hesitantly took a seat next to Daniela.


She appeared engrossed in testing a new beta  version of a video game, which greatly annoyed Caiden.



He couldn't see the purpose of her busyness. It wasn't as if she was actively working to salvage the financially hemorrhaging Harper Group. Daniela was merely at home playing games, while the company's operational costs continued to deplete their resources rapidly.


He never thought that he'd actually have to start worrying about the company's operations after taking it over from Brylee.


He sighed deeply, his frustration evident. Trying to mask his feelings, he forced a smile and addressed Daniela. "I've transferred all the funds to Harper Group's account. Can the company resume normal operations now?"


Daniela didn't look up from her game. She nonchalantly sucked on a lollipop Lillian had given her earlier and murmured, "Hmm."


Overwhelmed by frustration, Caiden exclaimed, "Then why don't you take some action? You just sit here all day playing games. When will you start worrying about Harper Group's survival?"


Daniela paused her game momentarily and gave him a fleeting look. Then she resumed her game and responded in a detached tone, "If you had been concerned about the company's survival earlier,we wouldn't be in this predicament. I was informed by the finance department this morning that Harper Group has been losing money all these years."


Caiden's expression hardened. He was well aware of the situation. But he had Brylee's savings supporting the company in the past.


"You should turn things around! Revive your mother's legacy!" Caiden exclaimed, trying to sound encouraging. "After all, you are her daughter. You have her looks, her talents, and skills. Now that Harper Group is in your hands, it'll recover in no time!"



Daniela completed her game and started another. Meanwhile,Caiden was growing increasingly anxious."Say something!" he implored. He had invested heavily in the company, depleting his savings. He needed a return on his investment.



"Say what?" Daniela responded, without looking up,her voice calm.


Taking a deep breath, Caiden tried to compose himself, adopting a compassionate demeanor. "|know you've got a lot on your plate, and perhaps Harper Group's minor assets don't seem appealing now. But this was your mother's life's work. Surely you don't want to see it fall apart, right?"


Daniela gave a light nod. "Hmm. Don't worry, it won't go bankrupt."


Relieved, Caiden quickly asked, "So, you have a plan?"




Daniela shook her head. "No, I've never managed a company that's this deep in the red, with such outdated equipment, lackadaisical employees, and lax management. I'm just as lost as you are." "What?" Caiden exclaimed, jumping from his seat."What did you just say?"


Daniela paused her game and looked up at him, her gaze steady and her tone slightly amused. "Since you're one of the major shareholders, I'm eager to hear your proposals for resolving the company's crisis. After all, you've managed it for years. You should have plenty of insights and experience to contribute."



Her words struck Caiden profoundly. If he spoke further, he would have to confess that his mismanagement had led the company to ruin. Yet,as Daniela's father, his pride remained intact. He couldn't bring himself to admit that his inadequate leadership was the reason Harper Group was teetering on the edge of failure. ###Chapter 190 It Gets You Nowhere





Caiden was furious. "So, you're telling me the company won't be handing out dividends right now?"


Daniela remained focused on her phone and didn't even spare him a glance. Caiden's frustration boiled over at this. He wanted to smash her phone.


"If there's any profit, we'll distributing dividends of course," Daniela answered, her voice calm and steady.


Caiden was left frozen, speechless. Profit? With the company losing money hand over fist, the idea of making a profit seemed absurd.


Realizing he wasn't getting through, he changed his approach. "In that case, I'll need to borrow money from the company."


To his shock, Daniela agreed right away."Sure Caiden blinked, taken aback. He had expected a firm rejection, not this.


Her response left him momentarily stunned.


A wide grin spread across his face as he decided to push further. "I need to borrow ten million."


"Sure," Daniela replied again, her tone still casual.


The smile on Caiden's face quickly faded, a sense of unease creeping in. There was something about how easily she agreed that didn't sit right with him. He furrowed his brow, his voice tinged with suspicion."Why are you being so generous all of a sudden?"


Daniela glanced up at him briefly, herlips curling into a small, almost playful smile. "You're running low on cash. How could I be so heartless, right? You were my father."


For a brief moment, he felt a glimmer of relief. Just as he was about to thank her for showing some compassion, Daniela continued, "And since you likely won't be able to repay it, it's no problem-you can always use your shares to cover it. Of course,borrowingfrom the company requires a promissory note, and the interest rate will be higher than what the bank offers. Just so you're clear."


Caiden's face darkened, his momentary relief evaporating, replaced by fresh anger.


Meanwhile, Cedric sat across the room, absorbed in a game. As he listened to Daniela's words, a faint smirk curled on his lips.


Caiden clenched his fists, the tension in his body growing as his frustration surged. He was itching to lash out, to let his anger explode, but Cedric's presence kept him in check. "Cedric, it seems like you're quite at ease making my villa your personal space."


Cedric, unbothered, gave a slight nod. "Exactly. I'm thinking about buying this villa once you put it on the market. For now, I thought I'd stay here and get a feel for the place. With your business sense, I doubt it'll be long before this villa goes to auction." Caiden instantly picked up on the mocking tone in their voices. His face flushed with rage and he stormed out with a forceful snort.


As he left, Cedric's calm and measured voice followed him. "If you're truly in need of money,feel free to borrow from me. I quite like this villa."


The words struck Caiden like a slap to the face,causing his anger to explode. He stormed downstairs, grabbed a vase, and hurled it to the floor.


Unfortunately, it was a vase that Daniela had brought.





When the bill for the vase came, Caiden's face turned red. He couldn't even scrape together enough money to pay for it.


In the end, he had no choice but to sign a promissory note and reluctantly hand it over to Lillian before slinking back to his room in shame.


Living without any money was torture.


Since Katrina had offended his mother and brothers, Caiden couldn't borrow a single cent from them.With no other options, he had to venture out himself to drum up business for Harper Group.


Katrina stood on the balcony, her brow furrowed in frustration. Holding her phone to her ear, she sighed and said, "Mom, can you ease up on your spending?Caiden's out of money."


The voice on the other end was cutting and full of mockery."Caiden? That man can't even take care of his own daughter. What good is he to you? Katrina,you married him to have a better life. If he can't provide that, then maybe it's time for you to start considering your options."


Katrina bit her lip, her voice hesitant. "Mom, it hasn't reached that point yet."


"If things don't improve, you'll need to make a move.Caiden's nothing but a freeloader. Haven't you figured that out after all this time? He had a golden opportunity and blew it. Do you really think you can count on him in the future? Like l've said before,there's a rich man who likes you. If Caiden doesn't work out, why not move on? Why waste your time?"


Katrina pressed her lips into a tight line. "I've been living with Caiden for so long. I can't bring myself to divorce him and marry another."


The voice on the other end scoffed. "Being kind to a man gets you nowhere, Katrina. You've endured enough, and so have I. Caiden isn't someone you can rely on. Marrying him was your first step toward a better life. Now,it's time to move forward. Don't let him hold you back any longer."


Katrina stared out at the trees swaying gently in the distance, her mind racing. For a moment, she was unsure of what step to take next.
###Chapter 191 Don't Make It Sound Worse Than It ls
Katrina had no idea that someone was watching her in the shadow.



Caiden felt as though he was losing his mind.



He had never felt so trapped in his life;ever since Daniela came back, it felt as though he was choking.


All for the pursuit of money, he was being crushed beneath its heavy burden.



It dawned on him that Daniela had no plans to run the company, and it was hemorrhaging money each day.



The basic expenses were draining their funds rapidly,and Caiden experienced a gut-wrenching pain as he watched everything fall apart.


Any hope of seeing dividends was gone. Worse still, Daniela refused to lend him any money.


One day, as Joyce insisted on having caviar, Caiden,feeling completely powerless, managed a forced smile and stopped Alexander in the parking lot.


"Alexander, you're going to marry Joyce. Shouldn't you pitch in to help cover some of her expenses?"


Alexander deftly avoided the question, replying,"Joyce and I aren't legally married yet. If people found out that the Bennett family is already paying her bills, they'd laugh at you for not being able to support your own daughter."


Caiden was momentarily stunned, then asked, "So when are you planning on marrying Joyce?"


To him, one less person in the house meant one less expense to worry about.


Alexander responded coolly, "Are you really that strapped for cash these days? Is that why you're so eager to marry off your daughter?".


"No. How could you think that?" Caiden quickly denied, his voice desperate. "But you and Joyce have known each other for years, and your bondis strong. It would make sense to marry sooner. For young people like you, starting a family early is the way to go,right?"


Alexander spoke casually. "Joyce just had a baby,right? Let her rest for a little longer."


Although Alexander's tone seemed thoughtful,Caiden couldn't shake the feeling that he didn't love Joyce at all.


For a moment, Caiden was caught off guard, and before he could respond, Alexander had already gotten into his car and driven off, leaving Caiden to exhale a heavy sigh.


Feeling desperate, he turned to Cedric for help.


But instead of inviting him home, he approached Cedric on his way back from work and suggested they talk at a cafe across the street.


"Cedric, do you like Daniela?" Caiden asked without beating around the bush, driven to the edge by money troubles.


Cedric studied Caiden's calculating expression and didn't reply immediately.


Caiden didn't wait long, pressing on. "Don't try to deny it. l've noticed the way you look at Daniela.Cedric, winning her over won't be simple, will it?She's got a unique personality, and no ordinary approach will get through to her."


At those words, Cedric's brow furrowed slightly.


Caiden let out a low chuckle. "But I have a way.That's how I won over Daniela's mother all those years ago. She was a stunning beauty, with countless wealthy suitors, but she chose to marry me. Do you know why?"


With a smug look, Caiden raised his eyebrows and whispered, "Because I have a secret weapon."


Cedric narrowed his eyes, his tone skeptical."And what exactly is this weapon?" Caiden extended his hand, a sly smile creeping across his face. "I can show you the way to Daniela's heart, locking in a lifetime of wealth and luxury. You could live just as I do, enjoying a life of comfort.Daniela's even better at making money than her mother. But I'm not offering this for free. Don't you think it's only fair to offer something in return? It wouldn't be right for me to give you advice without some kind of reward,would it?"


Cedric's expression tightened, his brows knitting together. "So, is this a business proposition you're making?"


"Come on, don't put it like that. If you win Daniela over, we'll be family. I'll be your father-in-law. A little cash for me isn't a deal, it's just fairness. That's not something I'd call a deal. Don't make it sound worse than it is."
###Chapter 192 You're The Boy WhoPlayed With Daniela,Right
Caiden, seemingly offended by the term "business proposition," conducted himself in a completely transactional manner.


Taking a sip of his coffee, Cedric asked, "How much do you want?"


Caiden's face brightened at the question. Laughing lightly, he said, "You're more generous than Alexander, Cedric. I'm not asking for much,just this amount."



He raised a finger.11Ahundred million. That's reasonable,right?"


Cedric didn't say a word, casting a calm glance at Caiden.



Caiden tried to read Cedric's impassive expression but found no clues. Was the price too high? Uncertain, Caiden averted his eyes. "If that's too much, I'm open to negotiating."


Cedric took another slow sip of his coffee,maintaining his composure.


Caiden, watching Cedric's unhurried movements,pressed his lips together. "How about eighty million,then?"



Cedric glanced at him, a faint smile playing on his lips.


Hesitating, Caiden added, "Still too much? Cedric,Daniela is worth more than that, isn't she? I wouldn't be proposing this if I didn't urgently need the money.I could offer this opportunity to many others, but I'm giving you the first chance because | think you're a good man."


As his situation grew dire, Caiden became visibly more desperate. The luxurious lifestyles of Katrina and Joyce had left him under significant financial pressure. "Then my final offer is fifty million. Consider it,Cedric. Daniela is beautiful, and nothing significant occurred between her and Alexander. She's still pristine. Isn't fifty million a modest sum for someone like her? Raising Daniela wasn't easy. For what I'm asking, it's a bargain."


Cedric's face turned colder, his displeasure evident.


Caiden, overly eager, didn't notice the shift in the conversation.


"So, you're suggesting this is like a payment for marriage?" Cedric broke his silence, attempting to clarify.


Caiden paused momentarily, not fully grasping Cedric's subtle change indirection. He dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. "Cedric, you're reading too much into it. How could this possibly be a payment? No, this is entirely different. Marriage and business deals should not be conflated."



Cedric responded with a thoughtful "Okay," as his expression turned serious. "Let's be clear, Cedric. If you're genuinely considering a future with Daniela, fifty million won't suffice." It dawned on Caiden that he could benefit not just from Joyce but from Daniela as well.


Excited by the prospect, Caiden engaged more intensely. "You have feelings for Daniela, don't you?I've seen how you've always cared for her since your childhood."



Cedric's gaze slowly lifted, his face unreadable.


In the sunlight, Caiden's features appeared calculating and cold, his attitude opportunistic as he chuckled. "You're the boy who grew up playing with Daniela in the garden, right?"


From a distance, Lillian observed Caiden lead Cedric into a cafe at an intersection.


She quickly went to inform Daniela.


Without delay, Daniela set aside her phone and made her way to the cafe.


Lillian guided her through the back,seating her at a table adjacent to Cedric and Caiden's.


The tables were separated by a thin partition wall,which obscured their view but allowed every word to be distinctly heard.


When Caiden said, "you're the boy who grew up playing with Daniela in the garden," Lillian noticed an unusual reaction-Daniela, typically calm, clenched her coffee cup tightly.
###Chapter 193 Make A Deal





Lillian stood up, ready to step in and stop Caiden from speaking any further.


But Daniela stopped her with nothing more than a look.



A shiver ran down Daniela's spine, creeping through her entire body.


The whole situation was almost laughable, but there was no humor in it.


On a bright, sunny afternoon, her own father was haggling with Cedric, trying to settle on a price to sell her.


For years, she had given her all to Alexander,and Caiden knew why.


And yet, he watched her fall even further, knowing full well that the person from her past was Cedric,


but he never said a word.



He constantly reminded her to return Alexander's favor, even taking satisfaction in her marriage to him.


He saw her chase after Alexander, only to be rejected, and eventually, he watched her go through the divorce.



Caiden, someone who knew the whole truth, had seen it all unfold.


He was supposed to be her father, the one who should have protected her. Yet, he remained utterly cold and detached.



The whole thing was pure nonsense.


Everything about it made her want to scream.


But Daniela couldn't find the strength to laugh at it;instead, she felt a deep, bone-chilling cold that seemed to freeze her from the inside out.


She turned to look out the window, her gaze falling on the large tree outside, its shadow shifting with the breeze as sunlight scattered across the ground.


She had never felt more foolish than she did now.


And all these years, what had Caiden thought as he watched her tirelessly chase after Alexander?


Did he find it entertaining? Or simply laugh at her expense? Or perhaps he took a twisted satisfaction in the idea that Brylee had given birth to such a fool.


In that moment, Daniela only wNanted one answer: did Caiden truly see her as his daughter? How could he treat her like this?


Daniela's hands tightened into fists, her grip becoming almost painful. She remained seated,subtly signaling Lillian to stay down as well. A bitter,self-mocking smile tugged at her lips as she realized that any further questions would only make her appear more foolish.


She looked out the window in despair. Her eyes, once warm, were now void of all softness, replaced by a cold emptiness. Behind Daniela, Cedric and Caiden continued their conversation, unaware of her silent presence.


"Cedric, when I first saw you, I knew you were the boy who helped pull Daniela out of her depression all those years ago," Caiden said, pointing to a spot near his eye. "You have this little mole, and that's how l recognized you right away."


A smug smile spread across his face. "But I kept it to myself. I thought it was quite amusing. Isn't Daniela always so proud? Isn't she wealthy? Yet she couldn't even recognize you. No matter how successful she is, she's still blind!"


Cedric's fingers tightened around his coffee cup, his restraint barely keeping him from hurling it at Caiden.


Cedric's voice remained calm as he asked, "But Daniela isn't Brylee. She's your daughter."


"Is she?" Caiden's face remained emotionless."The only one who truly counts as my daughter is the one who'll take care of me when I'm old. Can Daniela do that? I once felt sorry for her. I even thought about telling her that Alexander wasn't the one who was with her back then, hoping it might ease her pain after the divorce. I showed her kindness, only to be met with her indifference. Can I really trust someone like that when I'm older?"


Cedric's eyes narrowed, his voice taking on a sharper edge."So your idea of a good daughter is someone who will take care of you in your old age?"


"Of course, we raise children, hoping they'll care for us in our old age. But now I see things clearly.Daniela is just as cold and ruthless as her mother.I can't depend on her, and frankly, I don't care what happens to her or who she marries. Cedric, since we're being honest, let's strike a deal."


By now, Caiden had dropped all pretense. He had revealed his true, selfish self, his expression cold and calculating. A sharp laugh escaped his lips. "Cedric,name your price. Daniela's life or death no longer matters to me. Consider her sold to you. It's a one-time deal. You can take her home, treat her however you want, and make her serve you as you please.I have no objections."
###Chapter 194 How Much Would Alexander Pay
Lillian stole a quick glance at Daniela.


After the brief flicker of emotion at first, Daniela's face became calm again. There was a coldness about her that felt almost icy.


Lillian, despite having no family of her own, couldn't help but feel a stab of pity for Daniela's situation.


She didn't want Daniela to listen to another word of what was being said.


Rising to her feet, she hoped Daniela would take the hint and follow, but Daniela stayed rooted to her spot.


Meanwhile, the discussion behind them carried on without pause.


"Cedric, what's your answer?" Caiden's voice was steady, almost clinical. "I'm not asking for much. One  hundred million, and she's yours. After that, the Harper family and Daniela will have no further ties.How does that sound to you?"


In families like theirs, even something as trivial as buying a pet could set them back millions, with upkeep easily climbing into the tens of millions.


To Caiden, the offer was perfectly reasonable."That's my final offer. If you think it's too steep, I can always approach Alexander. I'm confident he'd pay even more to claim Daniela."



He took a slow sip of his coffee, exuding an air of composure that bordered on smugness.


In his mind, Cedric would surely pay.


Daniela no longer considered him her father. She was divorced, yet Cedric continued to protect her, all while living under the Harper family's roof, bearing no title or official status.



Cedric not care about Daniela? Refuse to pay the hundred million? That was impossible! Daniela moved slightly, ready to intervene. But before she could act, a firm, calm voice sliced through the charged atmosphere of the cafe.


"I'll pay the money."


Daniela went rigid, her body frozen in place.


Cedric spoke with an unshakable calm. "Daniela is priceless. I hope that's clear. I'll offer you three hundred million-but there's one condition. You are never, for as long as you live, to tell Daniela what you just said to me. Never let her know you're aware all along that I was the boy from her past. Never let her find out that you've watched her endure so much,indifferent to her pain. And don't you dare belittle the sacrifices she's made for Alexander."



Caiden's smile wavered for a fleeting second before returning, broader than ever. He let out a laugh and quipped, "That's it? You'll still pay a bride price when you marry her later? So this isn't just a complete buyout,huh?"

 
Cedric's face remained as composed as ever. "No,  it's not."



He set his coffee cup down and leaned in, his voice low and icy. "But you need to promise me-you'll take this secret with you to the grave. If Daniela ever hears a word of this, I won't demand my money back.Instead, I'll make sure you pay with your life."


Sunlight poured in through the cafe's windows,painting Cedric in a soft, golden light.


But Cedric himself was the opposite of warm.An unyielding frost seemed to envelop him, his chiseled features and piercing eyes radiating a lethal intensity.


In that instant, Caiden felt a chill run down his spine as he realized he was treading on dangerous ground.The man sitting across from him wasn't just anyone-this was Cedric, a name that carried fear wherever it was spoken.


Caiden hesitated, opening his mouth as if to defend his disgraceful actions or ease the tension. But Cedric cut him off. "Leave." Caiden rose to his feet, an oddly cheerful grin on his face, as if Cedric's icy warning hadn't pierced him at all.


Three hundred million!



The figure rang in his mind, sending a wave of satisfaction through him.


It was more than enough to ensure his family could continue their extravagant lifestyle for years to come.


The thought that Daniela held such value in Cedric's eyes made Caiden chuckle quietly to himself.


Yet, a reckless idea suddenly darted through his thoughts.


If Cedric could shell out three hundred million to keep Daniela in the dark about the past, then how much would Alexander fork over to hide the truth that he wasn't the boy from her childhood?


Better still, how much would Alexander be willing to offer to swap the bride in his forthcoming wedding-from Joyce to Daniela? The idea took hold of Caiden, and a wave of greed surged through every corner of his mind.
###Chapter 195 ls It For Joyce Or For Daniela
Since Cedric had promised to give him three hundred million dollars, Caiden approached his meeting with Alexander more casually.



Instead of arranging to meet at a cafe, they met at the Harper family's pavilion.



Caiden wasted no time and went straight to the point, just as he had with Cedric.


"Alexander, how much are you willing to pay to keep it quiet that you weren't the one accompanying Daniela when she was a child?"



The question caught Alexander off guard. He froze for a moment, clearly stunned.


He hadn't anticipated that Caiden knew about this secret. What made it worse was realizing that Caiden had likely known for a long time.



Alexander hesitated, his silence stretching on.


Caiden smirked. "Look, I know you don't have any feelings for Daniela. And honestly, you probably don't care much if I spill the truth to her. But think about it -it could still work in your favor. Daniela is now the CEO of Elite Lux. If she thinks more favorably of you,it wouldn't hurt your position, and it might even help the Bennett family, wouldn't it?"



Caiden's grin widened as he added, "We're practically family now, Alexander. I'm not asking for much-just five hundred thousand. What do you say?"



Alexander's brows furrowed as he considered the offer. After a brief pause, he nodded and replied,"Alright."



He made the transfer on the spot. With the transaction complete, he left without another word. Caiden watched him leave, staring at the empty space where Alexander had stood moments before.He muttered to himself, "I should've asked for more."The ease with which Alexander had agreed was infuriating.


Later that evening, Katrina listened intently as Caiden recounted the incident. She folded her arms and tilted her head slightly. "So you're saying Alexander handed over the money without a fight?"


Caiden nodded, placing his glass of water back on the table. "Exactly. And Cedric's three hundred million should arrive tomorrow. The bank staff already confirmed that the transfer's been initiated,but it's a huge sum, so they're double-checking it with Cedric."



Katrina's eyes lingered on the screen displaying the money Alexander had sent. Her fingers drummed lightly against the table as her mind wandered.


Was Alexander being generous to rebuild his relationship with Daniela, or did he still harbor feelings for her? Could it be that Alexander hadn't fully moved on from Daniela while he was going to marry Joyce?


Katrina walked downstairs and spotted Joyce lounging on the couch, playing a game on her phone.Approaching her daughter, she asked, "Joyce,Alexander's been staying home for a few days now.Have you two had any meaningful conversations in the evenings?"


Joyce understood the implication behind her mother's question. She shook her head and replied casually, "No. Alexander's been tied up with a merger deal lately."


Katrina let out a sharp breath, her patience wearing thin. "Busy or not, he still has to take breaks. You should find a way to talk to him!"


Joyce frowned and pouted in response. "What's there to talk about? Honestly, I didn't notice it before,but now that we're living together, it's clear how dull Alexander's life really is. All he ever does is work.I can't even hold a decent conversation with him.Honestly, chatting about e-games with Daniela is more entertaining than trying to talk to him."


Katrina's jaw tightened as she gasped in disbelief.She struggled to comprehend how her daughter could be so apathetic.


"You think Alexander is boring? Have you even considered where your luxurious lifestyle comes from? The money for your expensive meals, designer clothes, and endless comforts doesn't just appear out of thin air. If you married someone incompetent,you'd have to work for a living. Do you think you could handle the realities of working life?"


Joyce set her phone down and looked up at Katrina."I have you, Mom. You've always ensured I have a good life.Why would that ever change?"


Katrina's frustration boiled over. She glanced to Alexander's room, the door firmly closed since he had returned home.



An uneasy thought crept into her mind. Ever since Alexander had moved in, he seemed to pay little attention to Joyce. Yet, whenever Daniela was in the living room, Alexander suddenly made himself present.





Was he here for Joyce,or was it for Daniela?


Katrina's fists clenched tightly, her nails pressing into her palms. Her eyes narrowed, dark with determination.



No one would stand in the way of her daughter's happiness.
 ###Chapter 196 Why Hasn't The Money Arrived Yet
Caiden and Katrina spent the whole day glued to their phones, eagerly waiting for the three hundred million Cedric had promised to appear in their account.



They called the bank again and again, hounding them for updates on the transfer.


They stared at their phones, obsessively refreshing the balance page, doing nothing all day but waiting for that transfer notification.



Across the room, Daniela watched them with a smile that was cold and indifferent, as if she found their behavior amusing.


As night fell and the money stll hadn't come through,Katrina's frustration reached its breaking point.Unable to hold back any longer, she stormed to the door, determined to confront Cedric as he returned home.



"Cedric, you're a man of great wealth and influence,yet I never thought you'd go back on your word."


Cedric had just returned from a meeting. His brow furrowed at the sight of her, and his gaze darkened with irritation.


Beneath his calm exterior, fury simmered, and he spoke coldly. "Are you out of your damn mind?"


The money had already been transferred from Cedric's personal account; there was no reason it shouldn't have arrived.



Earlier that day, the bank had assured him the transaction would be completed by morning, and Cedric had trusted their word.



Now, with another meeting looming in just thirty minutes, he was running out of time-and patience.The Harper family's nonsense was the last thing he wanted to deal with. Just seeing them made his fists clench in frustration.


He brushed past Katrina and made his way inside.


Katrina instinctively stepped forward to block him once more, but then she saw Daniela sitting in the living room, playing games, and froze in her tracks.


Katrina realized that Cedric's forced politeness towards them was driven solely by his relationship with Daniela.



If they pushed him too far and angered him,they might not get a penny.


To Katrina and Caiden, it didn't matter who had been there for Daniela in her childhood.


What mattered now wasn't the past. What mattered was getting the money into their account to secure their own luxurious lives.



Katrina gave Caiden a quick, calculating look.


Caiden hurried after Cedric up the stairs and into his room. Once inside, he forced a grin and handed Cedric his phone, displaying his bank account details. "I really didn't want to trouble you, but the money hasn't come through yet."


Cedric opened his mouth to speak when a knock echoed at the door. Daniela leaned casually against the doorframe, her cool eyes locking with Cedric's."Would you like to have a meal with me?"


Cedric could never say no to Daniela. He gave a slight nod."Sure."


Daniela raised her chin towards the living room."Come on."


Without a second thought, Cedric left the room and followed her.



Caiden followed closely behind them.


Daniela knew how to indulge. Rather than ordering takeout, she always arranged for private chefs to create extravagant meals at home.


Tonight's menu featured king crab, fish, tender lamb chops, and more.

The living room table was covered with an array of gourmet dishes, filling the room with tempting aromas.



This extravagant setup was nothing new; Caiden and Katrina often indulged without hesitation. Daniela never said no to them. She wasn't the type to care much about food.


But tonight, as soon as Caiden tried to sit down,Daniela's sharp gaze rose to meet his. "Hey."


Caiden reflexively looked up. "Are you calling me?"


Daniela's face remained unchanged. "Did I invite you to eat?"


The room went still. Every pair of eyes turned to Caiden, including Josie's.


Caiden felt a rush of humiliation wash over him.Even the servant got to sit at the table, but he was not allowed? His face flushed with anger. He stood up sharply, his voice laced with irritation. "Fine! I don't care!"  He stormed upstairs, muttering under his breath,"Once the three hundred mnillion arrives, I can eat whatever I want."


Despite his angry outburst, Caiden didn't head to his room. Instead, he lingered on the second-floor balcony, watching the living room below, waiting for Cedric to finish his meal so he could confront him again about the money.


The tantalizing aroma of the food wafted upstairs,irresistible to even the most hardened hearts.Enticed by the scent, Joyce couldn't resist and made her way downstairs.


A few moments later, she came running back upstairs, tears streaming down her face. She rushed to Caiden, exclaiming, "Dad! Can you believe how petty Daniela is? It's just food. Why does it matter so much?"


Caiden's face darkened as he listened to her tearful complaints.


Joyce wiped her eyes. "Dad, did you upset Daniela somehow? She's never told me not to join her for meals before. Seriously, Dad, you and Mom shouldn't be pushing her like this. You're not going to win."


Caiden,who had been holding his temper all day,finally snapped. "Upset her? What did I do to upset her? Daniela's the one being unreasonable. What's that got to do with me? Look at yourself and then look at her! She's achieved more than you'll ever manage. Instead of facing your own shortcomings,you're here blaming me? If you had even a fraction of her skills, I wouldn't be stuck living like this every day!"


He kicked a vase in the hallway in frustration,sending shards flying across the floor.


Joyce shrank back, too frightened to speak.


Hearing the noise, Katrina emerged from her room.She saw Joyce's tear-streaked face and immediately turned her fury on Caiden. "What? You can't deal with Daniela, so now you're taking it out on Joyce?You think you're so impressive? Then why didn't you go downstairs to eat? Oh, right-because Daniela put  you in your place, and now you're hiding upstairs like some scared little kid! Sure, Daniela's doing well now,but don't forget who your real family is. You can't rely on her for anything! Stop acting like you're in charge here! If you were worth anything, we wouldn't have to put up with this from her!"


With that, she grabbed Joyce and dragged her back to the room, slamming the door shut behind them.


Caiden stood in the hallway, fuming with anger. After a while, he managed to calm down and apologized to Joyce, promising to buy her a limited-edition handbag once the three hundred million arrived.


It was only then that her sobs finally stopped.


After offering Joyce some comforting words, Caiden and Katrina positioned themselves at the top of the stairs, waiting patiently for Cedric to finish his meal.


Tonight,they were determined to get the money.
###Chapter 197 Why Hasn't It Arrived





After they finished their meals, they retreated to their respective rooms.


Daniela lingered in the living room, playing a game on her phone. Cedric, unbothered by the late hour,began his meeting on his laptop.


Upstairs, Caiden yawned and glanced at Katrina,who was leaning against the banister, her eyes half-closed.



"It's already two in the morning. Are they planning to stay up all night?" he muttered, stifling another yawn.


Katrina blinked slowly, her mind too clouded with fatigue to muster a proper response.


Downstairs, Daniela remained engrossed in her game until three in the morning. It wasn't until Caiden heard footsteps creaking up the stairs that he stirred,groggily getting up from the hallway floor. "Daniela, you're finally going to bed," he muttered,rubbing his eyes.


Holding her phone loosely, Daniela stopped and tilted her head with a faint smile. "What? Were you waiting for me?"


Caiden chuckled awkwardly, brushing off her question. "No, no. I just thought you should get some rest. Staying up this late isn't exactly healthy."


Without a word, Daniela smirked, a trace of mockery in her expression, and walked off to her room.


Caiden rushed downstairs and knocked hurriedly on Cedric's door.


Cedric, freshly out of the shower, opened the door and gave Caiden an unimpressed sideways glance.


Looking desperate, Caiden held out his phone,shoving it towards Cedric. "Look at this! The money hasn't arrived!"


Cedric frowned slightly and retrieved his own phone.

Pulling up his banking app, he pointed at the screen, showing the transaction record. It was processed at eight this morning.


Caiden stared at Cedric, his frustration bubbling over.11|swear, I didn't receive it!"


Cedric, unfazed by Caiden's panic, called the bank manager.


"Mr. Phillips, I can confirm that the transaction was successfully processed on our end."


Cedric had put the call on speaker, and Caiden heard it too.


Before Cedric could reply, Caiden interjected, "But I didn't get it! My account balance is still the same-it's not there!"


The manager replied, "Let me review the transaction logs in detail. This may take a few moments."


While the call continued, Caiden clung to Cedric's phone as though it were his lifeline, rambling nervously about his situation. Cedric, on the other hand, appeared utterly unconcerned. He returned to the sofa, opening his laptop to resume his meeting without sparing another glance at Caiden.


As Caiden's gaze wandered to Cedric's phone screen, he caught a glimpse of Cedric's bank balance and realized three hundred million dollars was laughable compared to the wealth Cedric possessed.He should have asked for more.


Even after a lengthy wait, the manager couldn't find out the problem.


Cedric, visibly exhausted and ready for bed, took the phone back with a calm but firm tone. "If the funds are stuck in processing, can you reverse the transaction? I'll transfer another three hundred million."


"Mr. Phillips, I advise you not to. I'm not sure if I can reverse the transaction successfully."


Caiden, now panicking, blurted out, "If I receive six hundred million, I'll send half back to you. I swear!"


Cedric was confident that Caiden wouldn't dare pocket more than his share.


Without further hesitation, he nodded in agreement.


He entered another three hundred million on his phone, typed in his password, and confirmed the transfer.


Caiden clutched his phone, his breath caught in his throat.





One second.



Two seconds.


A minute.


Five minutes.


Ten minutes! The silence stretched unbearably.


Finally, utterly deflated, Caiden turned to Cedric with a bewildered expression. "Why hasn't it arrived?"


Cedric frowned slightly, his patience waning. He didn't have an answer.

 
Neither did the manager, who had been silent on the line, likely just as puzzled.


Frustrated, Cedric tried sending funds to Katrina's and Joyce's accounts, but every attempt failed inexplicably.


Caiden's emotions teetered between exasperation and awe. Cedric must be ridiculously wealthy-to still have enough for all these failed transfers.


"Let me try sending it to Daniela." Finally, Cedric processed the transfer.


Not a moment later, Daniela's message appeared on Cedric's phone."?"


Caiden froze, his face draining of color.


Cedric's expression darkened as realization hit.Sending money to Daniela, of all people, had been an impulsive and foolish move. He shook his head in quiet disbelief. Taking a step back, he distanced himself from Caiden, as though sheer proximity to such absurdity might somehow infect him.


On his phone, Cedric quickly typed out a curt reply. Apologies, sent by mistake."


The response from Daniela came almost instantly."Come to my room."





Cedric stared at the message, his jaw tightening.
###Chapter 198 Are You Hiding Something From Me
Cedric shot Caiden a cold, piercing glare. "Look what you got me into!"


Caiden shrank back instinctively, his frustration and grievance palpable.


As Caiden trudged upstairs, his gaze caught Cedric knocking hesitantly on Daniela's door. Cedric looked uncharacteristically subdued, as though unsure of his place.


It was a stark contrast to the authoritative warning he had delivered downstairs moments earlier.


Without lingering, Caiden retreated to his room, his mind swirling with unease.


Cedric remained at Daniela's door, his expression softening into an unconvincing smile. "What's up?" Daniela, fresh from a shower, exuded an effortless allure. Her long, damp curls framed her face,cascading over her shoulders with a natural elegance. Draped in pristine white loungewear,she looked both ethereal and serene, as though she belonged in a dream.



She was seated cross-legged on the plush carpet,her fingers deftly working on a half-completed puzzle. With a casual gesture, she pointed to the space opposite her. "Have a seat."


Despite her gentle demeanor, Cedric couIdn't shake the feeling that her sharp gaze saw straight through him,peeling back layers he hadn't meant to expose.


He remained rooted to the spot. "It's late. I won't intrude.Is there something you need?"


Daniela didn't reply immediately. She lowered her gaze, her fingers picking up a stray puzzle piece from the floor. With a practiced ease, she slid it into its rightful place. "Why did you transfer money to me?" "I told you, it was just a mistake."


Daniela didn't reply immediately.


The longer the quiet lingered, the more Cedric's unease grew.


His guilt churned, swelling into something he could no longer suppress.


"Really?" Daniela finally asked, her voice cool and detached.


Her eyes lifted slowly, and she glanced at her.


"Y-Yes!"


"In the middle of the night, you transferred three hundred million. Can I ask why?" Daniela picked up another puzzle piece and fitted it effortlessly into the growing picture.


Cedric felt the sweat trickling down his back. His earlier shower now seemed utterly pointless.


He couldn't explain it, but he had a sinking suspicion that Daniela already knew the truth. Her calm exterior didn't waver. When she finally glanced up again, her expression was gentle, devoid of judgment, and yet it carried a weight Cedric couldn't ignore.


It felt as though she was just asking casually.


Cedric pressed his lips together, struggling to concoct a believable excuse.


Before he could speak, Daniela's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Forget it, it's nothing. I've already transferred it back to you. Go get some rest."


Even as Cedric turned to close the door, Daniela remained on the floor, her focus on the intricate puzzle pieces spread before her.


The door, which should have clicked shut, stayed slightly ajar.


Cedric knew he should leave. Staying any longer might unravel the carefully guarded secrets he was trying so desperately to conceal, leaving him exposed-ridiculous and foolish in her eyes. But his  feet refused to move.


His hand lingered on the doorknob, the weight of his guilt pressing heavily on his chest. It was an unbearable torment, gnawing at him with every passing second.


The door, instead of closing, slowly opened wider.


Cedric stood at the doorway.


Daniela didn't even glance up.


Cedric moved forward, sinking onto the carpet where she had motioned for him to sit earlier.


The tight knot of anxiety twisting in his stomach began to loosen, albeit only slightly.


There were reasons that Cedric couldn't share.Secrets that, if revealed, might tarnish the fragile trust Daniela held in her family.


He could become Daniela's family if she was okay with that.


He didn't want Daniela to become cold and indifferent because of someone like Caiden. It wasn't worth it.


But even with his resolve, he couldn't bear to see Daniela unhappy. So, he stayed.


When Daniela finally looked up, her eyes met Cedric's.




She noticed the turmoil etched into his features. The tight furrow of his brows, the rare flicker of regret shadowing his otherwise composed eyes.


For a few seconds, she just stared, her expression unreadable. "Are you hiding something from me?"


Cedric flinched at the question. "What? No,no."


Daniela didn't push. Instead, she placed the puzzle piece she'd been holding onto the floor and stood,stretching gracefully. "I'm tired. You should get some sleep too."


Cedric remained on the floor, his posture stiff.


Daniela didn't acknowledge him further. With an air  of quiet detachment, she lay on the bed, pulling the blanket over herself before turning off the main light.


The room plunged into a comforting darkness,softened by the faint, warm glow of a bedside lamp.


Cedric's gaze drifted to the figure in the bed, and he didn't leave.


He leaned against the bed, reached for the scattered puzzle pieces, and began piecing them together.
###Chapter 199 Give Me A Reason





The following morning, as Caiden stepped out of his room, he caught sight of Daniela leaving hers.


Moments later, Cedric appeared, his head lowered and his entire demeanor radiating frustration.


Caiden paused for a brief moment before walking over to Cedric. "What's wrong? Did you get chewed out last night? Why the sour face so early?"


Cedric shot him a sharp, icy glare, his whole being emanating cold hostility. "Get lost," he retorted coldly.


The issue with Cedric's money stilI not reaching Caiden's account remained unresolved. With no other options, Caiden reluctantly turned to Alexander for help.


As Caiden explained the situation, Alexander's face twisted in disbelief. "Three hundred million?" Then, as realization set in, a smirk tugged at his lips."Ah,so you're playing both sides? You asked me for fifty million, while trying to squeeze Cedric for three hundred million?"


Caiden scratched his nose, his embarrassment evident on his face.


Alexander didn't seem overly bothered by the fifty million. He'd long been aware of Caiden's despicable nature. What confused him, though, was why Cedric would so willingly hand over three hundred million to Caiden.


Was it to keep the truth buried?


Logically, Cedric should have been the one desperate for Daniela to know who had been there for her as a child.


So why would Cedric be willing to pay to keep that secret?


Alexander couldn't wrap his head around it.


He tried to press Caiden for more answers, but Caiden wasn't interested in discussing it further. All that mattered to him was when the money would finally show up in his account.


Reluctantly, Alexander agreed to assist Caiden but laid down one condition: Caiden had to return the fifty million he had given him.


Caiden's frustration bubbled over. "Is it any wonder Daniela left you? You can't even compare to Cedric when it comes to generosity. Last night, he ended up moving more than three billion! And here you are,bartering over fifty million like it's a fortune!"


Caiden assumed Alexander's request was rooted in concerns about security or some other bureaucratic nonsense, but to him, it just seemed petty.


"Fine, fine! I'll return it. With three hundred million coming my way, your fifty million won't even be noticeable."



Caiden handed the money back to Alexander and reached out to Cedric's secretary to settle the issue. Cedric had received notifications that the failed transfers had been refunded. Annoyed, he handed the matter over to his secretary.


This time, the secretary double-checked Caiden's account details and initiated the transfer once again.


But, just like before, the money left Cedric's account,but it never made its way into Alexander's.


Stunned, Caiden could hardly believe it.


In his desperation, he turned to Alexander, pleading for the return of the fifty million, only to be met with a firm refusal.


At his breaking point, Caiden stood in the courtyard,hands on his hips, and said to Cedric's secretary,"Withdraw it in cash! Tell Cedric to come to the bank with me when he's free!"


When the secretary passed this message to Cedric,he soon received a text from Lillian.


Cedric turned to the secretary. "Forget the transfer.Head back to the Harper family." By the time Cedric reached the Harper family villa,Lillian was already standing at the door,suitcase in hand.


"What's going on?" he asked. "Didn't she agree to let me stay here?"


Lillian quickly looked away, shaking her head.


"Where is Daniela?"


Lillian pointed to the villa, and Cedric breathed a sigh of relief.



Inside, Caiden was trying to smooth things over."Daniela, this is going too far. Cedric's been nothing but kind to you. He's wealthy, but he's willing to stay in this shabby house with you. How could you push himn away like this?"


Caiden opened his mouth to say more, but Daniela turned her head slowly, her cold gaze sweeping over him like a sharp wind.


The sheer intensity of her gaze silenced him instantly. He shrank back, wisely choosing not to  speak another word.


Cedric stepped into the living room, then knelt down on the floor, facing Daniela.


Daniela didn't look up. Her head tilted slightly as she sat on the plush rug, absently scrollingthrough her tablet, lost in the news.



"Why? Just give me a reason," he asked.
###Chapter 200 One Last Time





Cedric's voice quavered as he spoke,his words laced with fear.



The possibility that Daniela might remain silent,withhold an explanation, and simply dismiss him was a terrifying prospect.


Thus, when Daniela finally broke her silence, Cedric released a deep, audible sigh of relief, grateful that she was at least open to conversation.


With a cool, detached lift of her eyes, Daniela posed a chilling question. "I'll ask you one last time-is there something you're hiding from me?"


Cedric's heart skipped a beat, freezing him in place.


Caiden, visibly unsettled, quickly took a seat, his smile fading as his anxiety took over. "Daniela, why are you talking like that? Cedric isn't your boyfriend.Why does he owe you an explanation for everything? Why can't you mind your own business? He's merely a guest in our home. Let him be. After all, Cedric is an adult-he should be free to make his own choices."


Daniela, ignoring Caiden's pleas, maintained her unwavering stare at Cedric. "Is that how you feel?"


Cedric vehemently shook his head, his response immediate. "No, that's not it at all."


Turning her attention away from him, Daniela's gaze drifted back to the television.



Her expression was one of calm indifference, but Cedric's heart hammered against his chest.


He knew well that Daniela was a woman of compassion, yet a single act of betrayal could irreversibly turn her cold, unforgiving.


At that moment, terror seized him completely.


"Do you have anything you want to tell me?" Daniela pressed on, her tone unwaveringly composed. "I'm asking for the third time now." Caiden, too, was shivering with fear. The thought that Cedric might spill the truth was unbearable; it would mean waving goodbye to his 300 million dollars.


What a catastrophic turn of events!


How did he ever come to have such a troublesome daughter?


She was bound to wreck everything!


Cedric clamped his mouth shut, his resolve hardening. Daniela rose abruptly, seized his arm with a firm grip, and pulled him outside, slamming the door shut behind them.


Cedric lingered by the door, a somber figure lost in his thoughts.


Caiden hastily exited the villa and approached Cedric. "First, we'll head to the bank and grab the money. Once it's all settled, I'll help you coax her."


However, he knew no matter what, Daniela wouldn't budge! Her icy demeanor was impenetrable! His true agenda was to get the funds at all costs. Yet Cedric remained rooted to the spot, unmoving.


The rain cascaded down in torrents, punctuated by the stark flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder.


Initially, Caiden had left the door open, but the wind was fierce. Josie, thinking quickly, handed Cedric an umbrella and closed the door against the storm.



Caiden was settled on the living room couch, his eyes glued to Daniela as she engrossed herself in her game.


Her intensity was unyielding.


He couldn't fathom what Cedric found so appealing about her.


Outside, a storm unleashed its fury, but Daniela remained indifferent.


"If you're that concerned about him, why not join him outside?" Daniela stated in a frigid tone.


Caiden hesitated briefly before resigning himself to the comfort of the sofa, not daring to counter her suggestion.



As the rain relentlessly pounded against the windows throughout dinner, Caiden grew visibly anxious. He leaned towards Katrina and confessed in a low voice,"You know, Daniela actually intimidates me a bit."


Katrina stole a glance at the raging storm outside,then turned her gaze to Daniela. She instinctively pulled her feet back, feeling a twinge of fear towards Daniela as wvell.


By the time midnight rolled around, exhaustion had overtaken everyone, and they made their way upstairs to bed.


Before Lillian disappeared into her room, she paused by Daniela and remarked, "Cedric is still outside."


Ryan added, "The rain's really coming down hard.Shouldn't we bring him inside and let him leave tomorrow?"



Daniela didn't look up from her game. Her face gave nothing away as she continued to tap at her phone.


Throughout the night, the storm raged on, a symphony of relentless rain, brilliant flashes of lightning, and deep rumbles of thunder, only subsiding as dawn approached.
###Chapter 201 Why You Care About Cedric More Than Daniela


The living room was empty.

Caiden was deeply concerned with Cedric's well-being, more than anyone else in the family.

He had spent a sleepless night, tormented by the fear of losing his three hundred million.

At dawn, he picked up an umbrella and went outside.

Cedric was still out there, enduring the torrential downpour.

The stormy weather felt harsh, with the wind driving the rain like needles against his skin.

Caiden tried to persuade Cedric earnestly. "Cedric, listen to my advice. Don't be so stubborn. The world is full of wonderful women. Why are you so fixated on Daniela?"

Cedric remained silent, his stance unyielding in the rain, his suit completely drenched.

"How about this, Cedric?" Caiden yelled over the roar of the rain. "You give me the three hundred million,and I'll introduce you to a woman even more beautiful than Daniela, someone who shares her charm.How about that?"

Cedric did not reply.

Frustrated, Caiden returned inside, casting a reluctant glance back at Cedric.

At breakfast, Joyce questioned her father,"Dad, why do you seem more concerned about Cedric than Daniela?"

Just then, Daniela descended the stairs.

Joyce addressed her. "Daniela, Cedric is your friend. You left him outside, and Dad had to check on him with an umbrella. Aren't you embarrassed?"

Daniela's expression turned icy, making Joyce recoil slightly Today, Daniela appeared quite formidable.

She then looked at Caiden with a half-smile and questioned,11SO1why are you more worried about my friend's well-being than lam?"

Caiden, caught off guard, was unable to respond.

Daniela wasn't interested in hearing Caiden's explanations. After breakfast, she went outside to dispose of the trash.

As she passed by Cedric, his rain-soaked hands reached out and grabbed her sleeve.

"Are you still mad?" Cedric's voice was low, unusually humble.

Daniela held the umbrella and asked, "Have you decided whether to tell me or not?"

Cedric pressed his lips together tightly.

He suspected that Daniela might have discovered the money he transferred to Caiden, and he felt the chances were significant. However, he wasn't willing to risk telling her himself.

He reasoned that his lack of honesty, compared to Cáiden's deceit, might seem more forgivable to Daniela.

He always prioritized Daniela's needs over his own.

"I was wrong. Please forgive me, I'm begging you," he admitted, offering his apology first.

Daniela simply glanced at him, said nothing, and returned to the villa.

Lillian, observing anxiously from upstairs, mouthed to Cedric, "Don't hide it anymore. The secret is already out!"

Without hesitation, Cedric pushed open the villa door.

As Daniela started uup the stairs, Cedric, soaked from the rain, followed her.

Daniela left her room door open. Cedric apologized. "I was wrong. I didn't mean to keep it from you. I just thought I could handle it myself.Please don't be mad at me."

His apology did not seem to have an effect.

Noticing a puddle of water on the floor, Cedric added, "I'll take a shower and come right back to make a sincere apology!"

With that, he quickly went downstairs, took a rapid five-minute shower, and hurried back upstairs without even wearing slippers.
###Chapter 202 Settle The Accounts


Cedric was in such a rush that he didn't even have time to straighten his collar.

Danielá cast a glance his way, handed him a towel, and settled down to tackle her puzzle.

The entire evening passed without a word from Daniela.

Cedric stood off to the side.

As usual, Daniela engaged with her puzzle until midnight. When weariness overtook her, she rose to sleep,disregarding Cedric as if he were a shadow.

Cedric stood there, torn between staying or leaving as Daniela turned her back on him, leaving him staring at her receding figure.

The room was bathed in the soft glow of a dim yellow lamp. Daniela's even breathing signaled her deep slumber.

Head bowed, Cedric held the towel Daniela had given him.

Instinctively, he raised his hand to dry his hair with the towel, only to realize it was already dry.

When Daniela woke the next morning, Cedric was prepared to clear the air.

However,Daniela retreated to the bathroom. When she emerged again, she simply told him,"Go wash up and come have breakfast."

Everyone thought Daniela had brushed off the incident, but Cedric sensed a shift in her demeanor.

On the surface, she offered him smiles, but they never reached her eyes; they were just a facade.

She allowed him to stay but rarely inquired about his well-being.

When he came home late, the warm milk that Josie used to prepare at Daniela's behest was conspicuously absent. On rainy days, Daniela no longer had someone pack an extra shirt and suit in the car for hím.

Only when these courtesies vanished did Cedric realize how much he had taken for granted the closeness between him and Daniela before.

Caiden seemed blind to the change in Daniela, consumed with the three hundred million dollars, only to be chased off by Cedric.

As time passed, everyone started to notice Daniela's growing distance from Cedric.

It wasn't just a physical distance but a breach in the silent understanding that once connected them.

Alexander was secretly pleased with this development.

He felt his time with the Harper family had been fruitful.

No matter how charming Cedric appeared, he had reached an impasse with Daniela.

The difference was that Daniela had once doggedly pursued Alexander for a decade, which gave him a sense of superiority.

So,when Cedric was no longer welcomed in Daniela's room, Alexander could almost feel Cedric's dismay.

Holding a beer, Alexander joined Cedric in the pavilion, seating himself next to him.

"Didn't I tell you?" Alexander scoffed. "Daniela doesn't know the meaning of commitment. She's just in it for the thrill of the chase, then she coldly casts aside her conquests."

Cedric took a sip of his beer, his tone flat. "Really? So, you're admitting you were caught in her net?"

"That's ridiculous," Alexander sputtered, his face contorting. "I was never like you. I never harbored feelings for Daniela, It was all her doing-a one-sided obsession."

Cedric's laugh was scornful. "Is that so? Well then, I hope you and Joyce find everlasting bliss."

Alexander couldn't even muster a smile.

From the corner of his eye, he saw Cedric's composed, assured demeanor and attempted to emulate it by stretching out his legs.

Cedric stood up.

Alexander, observing his profile, felt a mix of relief and smugness. "Cedric, just give up. You'll never win Daniela over. She revels in manipulating emotions. You can't outsmart her."

Cedric tilted his head back and finished his beer in one gulp.

The empty bottle sailed through the air in a perfect arc as he tossed it aside.

"Alexander, haven't you gained from all this?"

Alexander stiffened, gripping his beer.

Cedric's smirk was cutting. "Just because Daniela doesn't vocalize it, don't think we're all blind. She stays quiet because she doesn't care enough to comment. But if you keep slandering her, don't blame mne for coming down hard on you!"

Alexander turned, his face a mask of shock. "What are you implying?"

"You say Daniela played with your feelings? When the financial crisis hit, the Bennett family wasn't spared.Then,out of nowhere, you landed a massive overseas order paid in full upfront, which saved Bennett Group from collapse and led it to flourish, becoming the wealthiest in Olisvine."

At these words, Alexander felt a cold shiver as he regarded Daniela anew.

"After becoming the richest in Olisvine, Richard grew too confident and faced a liquidity crisisthe following year.Who persuaded the bank to extend a substantial loan to the Bennett family?

Bennett Group stabilized, but during the year you married Daniela, Richard's careless remarks nearly caused your downfall. Who crafted the PR strategy that not only salvaged your reputation but turned a crisis intoa J triumph? That move is still celebrated as a masterstroke by PR experts."

Cedric's gaze on Alexander was unyielding. He concluded, "Everyone sees you, Alexander, as the savvy CEO who steered Bennett Group through troubled waters. But is that the reality? Alexander,Daniela might not bother keeping tabs on these favors with you, but I'm someone who remembers every detail. If you continue to be ungrateful and spread falsehoods, then rest assured, I'll account for everything, including the grievances you aired during your divorce from her!"
###Chapter 203 Don't Leave Me


Alexander lingered in the courtyard for what felt like an eternity.

It was only Joyce's voice, calling his name, that snapped him out of his reverie.

Time had slipped by unnoticed.

Daniela had always been a vault when it came to the past.

If Cedric hadn't unearthed those details today, Alexander could have continued to believe all those triumphs were his own craftsmanship.

In that revelation, Alexander recognized that he had been the primary beneficiary throughout their relationship.

For years, he had deluded himself into thinking that Daniela had married into the Bennett family out of avarice, using their wealth and influence as stepping stones to cement her status within the Harper family.

Now,reflecting on those thoughts, he realized how naïve and absurd they had been.

Even after their separation, Daniela had kept her silence about her contributions. Was she protecting his fragile ego?

The realization stirred a maelstrom of shame, regret, and vexation within Alexander.

Then it dawned on him-when Bennett Group teetered on the brink of another crisis post-divorce,and he found himself floundering for solutions, it was because Daniela was no longer his hidden ace.

Disoriented, Alexander shuffled bagk into the villa. As he passed through the living room, Joyce's voice echoed a few times, but it fell on deaf ears.

Lillian questioned Daniela, "What's gotten into Alexander?"

Alexander deliberately slowed his steps,straining to hear Daniela's reply. Yet, there was only silence.When he turned back, he saw Daniela seated serenely on the sofa, engrossed in her game, utterly aloof.

In that instant, Alexander understood. Daniela had completely severed ties with him-just as she had with Cedric.

Cedric, who had never been daunted by anything, now stood frozen in fear.

He lingered silently in front of Daniela's door, paralyzed. Words failed him.

The divide between them wasn't merely physical-it felt as though he had been relegated to the outskirts of her universe.

Despite living under the same roof and crossing paths daily, an invisible barrier seemed to isolate him from her.

During this period, Cedric left on a two-day business trip and found himself embroiled in a trivial yet annoying scandal.

It was an unfounded rumor-utter drivel. Normally, Cedric would have shrugged off such nonsense.

But this time, he panicked. He dialed his team, demanding they quash the trending topic at once.

Upon his return to the villa, Cedric was slightly breathless from hastening back. In the living room, Caiden waved his phone, making snide remarks.

"Cedric's still quite the heartthrob. Even in a meeting, he sparks a romance."

"Exactly! Cedric's got the looks, the clout, and the cash. Who in Olisvine even comes close? And check this out-he's practically glued to that actress in this picture!"

"Oh, I've seen her! She's starring in that buzzed-about drama. It's no surprise she's climbed the ranks so quickly with these kinds of connections. Guess Cedric's her benefactor, huh?" Katrina chimed in.

At that moment, Joyce looked up at Cedric, who had just entered, and blurted out,"Cedric, is it true? Are you really that actress's benefactor?"

The room fell silent, the question hanging in the air like a storm cloud. All eyes turned to Cedric, all except Daniela's.

Cedric stood still, his gaze lingering on Daniela as he eventually muttered, "I can explain."

"What does that mean?" Caiden jumped in, eager to fan the flames.′′SO1you're his sugar daddy?"

Alexander glanced briefly at Cedric, then redirected his gaze to Daniela.

She remained composed, her focus glued to her phone. She continued playing the beta version of the game, occasionally issuing debugging instructions into her headset.

Cedric set down his luggage and stepped towards Daniela.

Before he could speak, Daniela stood and turned to Lillian and Ryan."Let's go."

Only then did Cedric notice the luggage near the door. His confusion intensified. "Where are you going?"

Daniela didn't reply. She brushed past him, phone in hand, answering a call as she approached the door."Yes, I understand. I'm heading out now."

Lillian and Ryan lifted the luggage and followed her. Outside, the sound of an airplane engine revving up filled the air, the rumble resembling thunder.

Panic clutched Cedric's heart. He sensed that if he didn't clarify things now, he could lose her forever.

He hurried after Daniela, desperate to join her on the plane. But she halted him.

She removed her earbuds, facing him. "I have to go abroad for work. It's not convenient for you to come.Besides, you wouldn't be comfortable staying here alone while we're away. Just return to your own home."

Cedric's eyes reddened instantly, his voice cracking as he pleaded, "You're not letting me come with you anymore?"

Daniela offered a faint smile, her expression gentle yet distant."Why would you want to come with me,Cedric? You have your own company, and I have my responsibilities. You were never obligated to stay by my side."

"No, that's not it!" Cedric's voice was frantic, his composure shattered. He was overwhelmed, his words tumbling out in a desperate scramble. "There's no scandal. That actress is my cousin-I'm not backing anyone! And the money I transferred to Caiden-I didn't mean to deceive you. I just didn't want you to be hurt."

He took a shaky breath, struggling to articulate his plea. "Daniela, I'll heed your advice from now on. I swear -this is the first and last time. I'll never keep anything from you again." In a last-ditch effort, Cedric reached out and clutched the hem of Daniela's coat, his hands trembling."Please don't leave me."
###Chapter 204 Thank Daniela


The roar of the airplane reverberated across the heavens.

Cedric remained rooted to the spot.

Alexander sauntered over, hands tucked in his pockets, eyes tracing the ascent of the plane.

He was about to unleash a snarky comment when Cedric cut him off sharply.hold my tongue if I were you."

Alexander halted, a bit taken aback. "I didn't poke the bear, you know."

Cedric's voice was an icy warning. "Push me further, and I might just lose my cool in a way you'll regret."

Alexander let out a nervous chuckle, but before he could retort, Cedric's fists descended on him like a hailstorm.

Soon after, an ambulance whisked Alexander away, the doctor confirming he had fractured ribs and wouldn't be rising from his bed for a month.

Caiden observed Cedric with a newfound trepidation.

In that moment, following Daniela's departure, Caiden suddenly see Cedric's true nature. It was an authority that tolerated no backtalk, a display of violence that was bone-chilling to its core.

Caiden was so on edge that he even moderated his breathing; he tiptoed around his own home, ensuring his activities were silent, and even resorted to watching TV on mute.

The Harper family had never felt Daniela's absence more acutely.

"Since Daniela isn't here, and our space here is a bit cramped, perhaps you'd be more comfortable at your place?" Caiden ventured cautiously, his voice tinged with the fear of provoking Cedric.

Cedric continued to eat his meal, casting a steely glance that froze the room, radiating a daunting, Katrina, finding it difficult to swallow her food, hurriedly interjected, "It's just that we thought you might prefer the comforts of your own home. Caiden, come sit closer. Cedric is perfectly capable of deciding for himself."

Caiden retracted further into his chair.

Cedric tasted nothing of his meal, and a palpable tension swathed the villa.

As soon as Cedric departed, Joyce exhaled a long-held breath. "Having Cedric around was like walking on thin ice.Absolutely terrifying!"

This same suffocating atmosphere had seeped into every corner of Phillips Group.

Within just half a mnonth, the HR department had seen eight different organizational charts.

The finance department was already preparing financial forecasts stretching three years into the future.

The marketing department underwent a comprehensive restructuring of all market strategies.

During this upheaval, everyone felt they were treading on eggshells, sitting ramrod straight, dreading getting swept up in Cedric's tempest.

A finance staff member pleaded with Cedric's secretary. "Please, any word on when Daniela will return?"

A marketing team member added, "Honestly, just catching a glimpse of Mr. Phillips is enough to trigger a stress response!"

An HR representative chimed in,"You're telling me! I keep my eyes glued to my paperwork during meetings,terrified to make eye contact with Mr. Phillips!"

The collective sigh from the staff was palpable. "Daniela's prolonged business trip is stretching us thin!Please,we need a reprieve!"

Perhaps the universe was listening to their prayers.

The grueling Elite Lux project that had extended over half a month was finally wrapping up. After a conversation with Lillian,Cedric's relayed the news to his boss.

At Phillips Group's subsequent summary meeting, the finance department concluded their presentation,all eyes on Cedric for further directives.

Cedric stared vacantly at the tabletop.

The finance director held his breath.

The marketing and HR staff exchanged nervous glances.

The manufacturing and production teams mirrored their anxiety.

All eyes inevitably landed on the unlucky secretary.

Bracing himself, the secretary ventured, "Mr. Phillips..."

Cedric asked, "Isn't there an auction tonight?"

The room was puzzled.

Cedric pressed on, "I recall there's a bracelet called Blue Sea Mystery up for grabs, right?"

The secretary confirmed, "Yes. It features eight diamonds, with a starting bid of three hundred million."

At this, Cedric's expression clouded momentarily.

He seemed particularly averse to the number three at that moment.

Cedric inquired further, "Isn't there also a brooch adorned with sixteen sapphires?"

The secretary nodded affirmatively. "Yes, the opening bid is eight hundred million."

Cedric breathed a sigh of relief. Altogether, securing it would cost around two billion.

He surveyed the astonished faces around the room, raised his hand decisively, and declared, "Meeting adjourned."

Everyone was visiby relieved.
###Chapter 205 A Ridiculous Idea


It was evening when Daniela arrived in Olisvine.

The Harper family residence was aglow, seemingly in anticipation of her return.

From her vantage point on the plane, she noticed two figures below.

The plane landed.

Before Cedric could utter a word, the secretary was already in tears, "Ms. Harper, welcome back! On behalf of all Phillips Group employees, we wvelcome you!"

Daniela was overwhelmed by such an unexpected reception.

With a look of genuine concern, Cedric asked,"Are you tired?"

She shook her head.

The rare joy of reunion lit up his dark eyes after such a prolonged separation.

Daniela felt slightly uncomfortable with the intensity of his stare.

Once Daniela was inside the house, Caiden and the others let out a collective sigh of relief.

"Why did it take you so long?" Caiden voiced his impatience.

Glancing upward, Daniela caught sight of Alexander, who was bandaged from head to toe and resting on the sofa.

She then looked away and headed straight upstairs to unpack.

Daniela headed upstairs without bothering to ask about his condition, which made Alexander irritated.

What was going on? Didn't she see him? Didn't she notice the thick bandages on him? He was disappointed by her lack of a simple greeting despite the fact that they were sharing the same space. Alexander felt both initated and bitter. He watched Cedric fotlow her upstáirs, then turned his head away.He scoffed internally, dismissing the thought of pursuing a woman like her, convinced that only a man lacking ambition would do such a thing.

Daniela took a shower and, unusually, ddn't go downstairs afterward.

Exhausted from her flight, she sprawled on the sofa, absorbed in the documents from the recently acquired Al development company.

Daniela had dreamed since her childhood of building a smart home where everything responded to voice commands.

The curtains would open with a blink.

A mere glance at the food would cook it.

If she opened her mouth, delicious food would present itself to her.

By lifting a foot, the room would clean itself.

Robots were to adjust the indoor lighting and display work on the TV screen through brainwave signals.

The entire home would operate fully automated, needing no manual inputs and being completely intelligent.

Daniela was captivated by this idea and had even bought a research lab to develop this technology, aiming to introduce it in wealthy neighborhoods.

She was deeply engrossed in these materials and didn't notice Lillian walking past her door, her voice floating in. "Cedric, why are you loitering at Daniela's door without knocking?"

Opening the door,Daniela found Cedric standing there, his head bowed. She was unsure of how long he had been waiting.

"What's going on?" she inquired.

Looking down, Cedric presented two gift boxes.

Daniela, puzzled, opened them. At that moment, Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce came. Katrina exclaimed, "Wow! These are the items from tonight's auction, valued at two billion! So the mysterious affluent buyer was you, Cedric! Youintend to give these to Daniela?"

Stunned by such lavishness, Katrina felt a surge of envy.

Two billion just for a bracelet and a brooch! Katrina's eyes turned green with envy.

Cedric, wealthy and magnanimous, contrasted sharply with Alexander, who had once given half a million and later demanded it back. Cedric truly shone like a star.④

No wonder everyone regarded Cedric as the genuine article, à truly eligible bachelor! It was no overstatement.

Katrina gazed at Cedric intensely, her desire evident, wishing she could be the one to marry him.

"Cedric, you are indeed generous." Joyce was mesmerized by the sparkling green stones, feeling her worldview expand.

Although they always knew Daniela and Cedric were wealthy, witnessing such opulence firsthand was an entirely different experience.

Joyce was clearly impressed. Who wouldn't admire such dazzling objects?

Without a moment's hesitation, Daniela snapped the boxes shut, shielding them from covetous eyes, and handed them back to Cedric. "Keep them yourself."

Cedric had yet to speak when Joyce's voice cut through the air. "Daniela, don't! If you don't want them,then 1..."

She reached out her hand, only for the boxes to be pushed back into Daniela's arms.

 
Cedric, looking disheartened, confessed, "I bought them just for you. If you don't want them, I might as wvell throw them away."

Katrina's eyes sparkled immediately, her gaze piercing Daniela with a silent question. "Where will you throw them? I'll get them back!" Daniela exhaled deeply and invited Cedric inside. "Come in."

Turning, she entered the room with Cedric close behind, the door closing to block the view of all the covetous onlookers.

Once inside, Daniela turned to Cedric with a frown, took a deep breath, and questioned, "What exactly are you trying to do?"

In a subdued tone, Cedric replied,"I just want to make you happy."

Daniela raised her hand, her expression skeptical. "With these?"

Cedric found himself at a loss.

He had considered many options, but Daniela's wealth made it difficult to decide what to give her.

These were the best gifts he had managed to come up with.

He had never wooed a woman before and was completely inexperienced in such matters.

Money was all he had to offer.

He selected and presented only the items that were yalued highly by society.

However,Daniela did not seem impressed.

Looking dejected, Cedric retrieved the gift boxes from Daniela's hands.

Suddenly,an unexpected idea came to him.

He contemplated giving Caiden three hundred million dollars, so that Caiden Would tell him how to make Daniela happy.
###Chapter 206 You Can Invest Money


In the midst of the burgeoning Al project, Daniela was buried under an avalanche of work.

Unbeknownst to her, Caiden stumbled upon her deep financial commitments while tuning into the evening news.

As the anchor relayed the staggering figures invested, a seed of resentment sprouted in Caiden's heart against Daniela.

That night, long after the witching hour, Caiden perched in the living room, awaiting Daniela's return. The moment she stepped through the door, his greeting sliced through the silence. "Busy night?"

Daniela paused, noting his presence-a rare occurrence. A slight smile played on her lips."What an odd surprise."

Caiden detected the undertone of sarcasm and clenched his fists, only to relax them with effort and muster a smile. "Odd? You're spouting nonsense. It's late. How about I whip up something for you to eat?"

Massaging her temples, Daniela sensed an ulterior motive."Cut to the chase."

Caiden's face felt slapped by her directness.

Though he aimed for friendliness, her cold response stung him. He ruminated on the bitterness of nurturing such an ungrateful daughter.

Although Caiden was cursing in his head, he forced a smile. "Daniela, the news today mentioned your massive investment in that robotics venture. Billions, right? It's a bold stroke that even paints me in a good light."
 
Daniela took a slow sip of water, her eyes locking with his, awaiting the inevitable twist.

Caiden lacked subtlety; his intentions were plain for anyone to see.

But Daniela chose to feign ignorance, remaining silent for a few moments longer. Caiden blurted out, "If you're pouring money into some speculative Al project, why not redirect some into Harper Group? It's our own company."

"I'm swamped," Daniela replied, her voice cold as she took another sip.

Caiden struggled to mask his irritation, hls jaw tight as he tried to keep his smile. "I get you're swamped. But consider this: you invest, and I'H run the ship. What do you say?"

His eyes gleamed with hopeful anticipation, hoping she would say okay.

Instead, Daniela's response was cutting. "You think you can manage? Harper Group was once a titan here.Its decline under your watch isn't a mystery. I'm biting my tongue now, so don't push me, or I might just spell it out."

Caiden's face froze.

She was clearly pointing to his failures at steering the company.

He never truly desired the helm; the business bled money, and daily he was pecked at by Katrina and Joyce for more.

He realized, perhaps too late, that Brylee had been the backbone of their finances.

This thought was discomforting, and he brushed it aside, fixing Daniela with a look of faint indignation."If you won't trust me, take the reins yourself. Throw billions at Harper Group like you did with that tech firm.I can't see why we can't resurrect it."

As he spoke, his eyes darted to the staircase. He thought the gesture went unnoticed. But Daniela caught it instantly.

Turning towards the stairs, she spotted two elongated shadows. Her smirk was frosty. "Very well.If that's your wish, I have no objections."

Caiden was taken aback by her swift acquiescence. After a pause, he asked in disbelief, "You agree?"

Daniela nodded. "I just said so." At that moment, the front door swung open, and Cedric entered, bringing a chill with him. His tense expression softened upon seeing Daniela."Daniela."

Caiden's unease intensified with Cedric's arrival, fearing a disruption to his plans. He rushed to continue,"So,how much are you thinking of investing in Harper Group?"

Caiden noted Cedric positioning himself beside Daniela.

Cedric's gaze fixed on her as if deciphering a puzzle.

Her tone remained composed. "Whatever you deem necessary, I'll provide."

Caiden's spirits soared.

Cedric added casually, "And if that's insufficient, I'll contribute too."

Caiden's eyes sparkled with the prospect. It felt like an unexpected windfall.

When he spoke again, his voice quivered with excitement, his thoughts spiraling with endless possibilities.Fixing his eyes on Daniela, he said, "Dear, not too much. A billion or so? Harper Group once stood as a colossus. A billion shouldn't be excessive,right?"

A billion!

At present, both Caiden and the entire Harper Group wouldn't fetch nearly that if sold outright.

He was essentially shooting for the stars.

Then,turnng to Cedric, Caiden said, "We won't trouble you. My daughter can manage on her own."

It wasn't that Caiden didn't desire Cedric's funds. His distrust for Cedric's cunning was simply greater,fearing a single false step could see him lose Harper Group entirely.
###Chapter 207 Cedric Was Tempted


Daniela's smirk carried a hint of sarcasm.

Caiden caught it and felt a sting, yet he reminded himself of the stakes involved.

Hundreds of millions were on the line here!

With that amount locked in, Harper Group could thrive again, leaving him to sit back and enjoy the incoming profits.

"Daniela, are you planning to put the money into the company tomorrow?" Caiden asked, his eyes alight with anticipation.

"Absolutely," Daniela responded without hesitation. Elated, Caiden was just about to dash upstairs to relay the thrilling news to Katrina when Daniela's next words halted him. "I'm planning to put in a billion, and based on our current share distribution, you'll need to match nearly that amouunt. When can we expect your contribution?"

Caiden's smile abruptly solidified on his face. He swiveled, disbelief etched across his features. "I'm sorry,what was that?"

Daniela offered a nonchalant smile."What? Are you having second thoughts about investing?"

Caiden had not foreseen Daniela raising the topic of additional funds; he had assumed she would simply inject the money herself.

"You're not required to contribut111Daniela continued calmly. Relief washed over Caiden, and he was just about to express his agreement when she added, "However, should I invest such a hefty sum alone, it would inevitably dilute your shares to the point where Harper Group might slip from your grasp."

Her words lingered in the air, and before Caiden could muster a response, Katrina burst into the scene from upstairs. "Daniela, you're so utterly ruthless! Are you aiming to seize complete control of Harper Group?" Katrina accused her sharply, her tone frigid with displeasure.

Daniela played along, her voice dripping with sarcasm, "Ruthless? Wasn't it you who begged me to invest?And now you're calling me ruthless for following through?"

Caiden's face flushed a deep crimson. He stumbled over his words. "I didn't mean it like that. I just meant for you to contribute the cash, nothing more. Not to bring in any investment funds."

Daniela's reply was laced with a biting edge."Ah, so you expect something for nothing?"

Her words struck a sharp chord.

The truth in her statement was harsh but inescapable.

Caiden's lips tightened, and he found himself momentarily speechless.

Katrina's expression shifted from a frown to a look of understanding. She tried to smooth things over."Daniela, you're misunderstanding your father. We never intended to exploit you. It's just that our business has been struggling, and profits are down. Your father wanted to secure dowries for you and Joyce,but his investments backfired. Now, our finances are in ruins. We've resorted to eating patatoes daily. Joyce and l are accustomed to living modestly, but your father, having been pampered all his life, finds this lifestyle unbearable. You might not hold much love for Joyce and me, but Caiden is your father by blood. You wouldn't want to see him suffer, would you? We're family after all. Why should there be any boundaries among us? By investing in Harper Group, you'd be supporting your father. Doesn't that make sense to you?"

From the sidelines, Cedric's frown deepened as he listened. His voice was icy as he cut in,"So what is it really-an investment, or just financial support for the family?"

It was blatantly obvious this was just,ascheme to extort money by exploiting Caiden's predicament.

Caiden,still a relatively young man, was already entangled in conversations about support payments.

Katrina was poised to interject, but Daniela cut her off. "I recall you formally ended our father-daughter relationship. So, why are we discussing support now?" The memory of the slap Caiden had delivered to Daniela lingered vividly in her mind.

It was astonishing that he dared to seek financial aid after everything.

Caiden was filled with profound regret.

If only he had foreseen these circumstances, he would have never let go of his paternal bond with Daniela!

Now,stripped of any justification, he shot Katrina a look filled with frustration and silent accusation.

As the family drama unfolded before her, Daniela remained disinterested in further debate. She stated plainly, "I'm sticking to my original stance. Yes, I can provide the funds. Consider it either an investment or a loan. Should it be a loan, I expect monthly repayments-no exceptions. I'm exhausted; let me know your decision."

With those words, Daniela retreated upstairs.

Caiden's voice, steeped in irritation, resonated through the room after her departure. "See, I warned you about pushing too hard. Daniela has the means and the willingness to help, yet she has no obligation to.She's not my legal daughter anymore. This mess is on you. If only I had known, I would have never agreed to your plan. One mistake just leads to another."

Katrina vented her frustration, lamenting, "How could I have guessed Daniela would turn out to be so adept?You're her father, and yet, you pale in comparison to her. She's amassing wealth, while what do we have?Day after day, you leave me and Joyce surviving on nothing but potatoes. Doesn't that embarrass you? Even poor Jack has to endure this misery with us!"

Caiden noticed Cedric hadn't left the room. His gaze was sardonic, his demeanor detached and frosty.

A cunning glint sparked in Caiden's eyes as he broached an offer."Cedric, I'm aware of the ongoing issues you have with Daniela. How about reconsidering my earlier proposal? The secret to gaining her favor, now just for fifty million-a real steal. What do you say?"

Cedric wrestled with a palpable temptation.

Caiden, observing Cedric's hesitance, pushed confidently. "Well? At fifty million, it's a steal. Don't want it? I'll find someone who does."

Cedric, pointing upwards, made it clear.′′Myfinances are under Daniela's control. She calls the shots on how it's spent, not me."

Caiden's expression darkened as he silently berated Cedric's lack of backbone and his susceptibility to Daniela's influence.

As Cedric turned to leave, he paused briefly, his tone even and measured. "I'd suggest you hold off on selling that secret. You know her reach. If she discovers your scheming, she won't hesitate to gain full control of Harper Group, and that will be the end for you."
###Chapter 208 Joyce Can't Compare To Daniela


Caiden was a bundle of frustration and helplessness.

Katrina, studying Caiden's tense profile, ventured cautiously,′′|sthere truly no way to salvage the situation with Daniela?"

A shadow of a thought flickered across Caiden's eyes as they unintentionally caught Joyce's figure nearby.

Katrina's heart momentarily skipped a beat.

Caiden suddenly said, "It's high time you considered marriage, Joyce. We've given you enough time to bounce back after your childbirth. You should be back on your feet by now."

Katrina stared at Caiden, her expression a mix of shock and confusion."What are you implying?"

"I mean precisely what I articulated," Caiden countered. "Haven't you always harbored hopes of Joyce tying the knot with Alexander? Well, perhaps now's the moment to make it happen."

Indeed, Katrina had harbored such hopes for Joyce to marry Alexander. But not under these circumstances.Not when the Harper family coffers were echoing emptiness.

With their business teetering on the brink, they had no leverage to engage the Bennett family seriously.Moreover, Joyce's circumstances, having a child out of wedlock, had already marred her standing.

Katrina's original blueprint had been to endow Joyce with the entirety of Harper Group. Now, with the group floundering, it was more of a liability than a legacy. Wouldn't this only serve to diminish her stature in the eyes of the Bennett family even further?

Richard was a man known for his opportunism, and Joyce, marrying without a dowry or a robust backing,would undoubtedly endure significant strife.

Katrina's gaze upon Caiden was cold, as if she was truly seeing the man he had become.

A man who could patiently navigate the shadows under a formidable woman like Brylee for years and eventually climb to the pinnacle was inherently cutthroat. Naturally, in times of stability, his kindness flourished, but when the seas turned rough, his true colors bled through.

Katrina was still strategizing.

Joyce broke the silence. "I agree to marry Alexander. I'm tired of scraping by here. Just the other day, I was out with friends and couldn't afford a thing. They ridiculed me. If I married Alexander, I wouldn't have to endure this humiliation."

Katrina attempted to soothe her. "Joyce, just a little longer. Daniela's taking the reins of Harper Group; she won't let it sink. Once we stabilize, you'll have the wedding you deserve."

But Joyce's mind was made up, her decision to join the Bennett family was unwavering.

She stormed upstairs, her displeasure clear, leaving Katrina to exhale in frustration before turning back to Caiden. "Let's give it some time."

Caiden shrugged. "Fine. She's your daughter. If you prefer to wait, then we wait. But if Daniela doesn't turn this around, soon there won't even be a shell of a company left. That will make Joyce's prospects with the Bennett family even slimmer."

Katrina clenched her fists, whispering sternly,"Just a bit longer."

Meanwhile, Daniela's robotics company was unveiling its latest innovations at a grand launch event.

The facility buzzed with the showcase of fully automated systems.

Richard was visibly awestruck by this modern tide of technological prowess.

Among the exhibits was an advanced domestic robot that left the crowd spellbound. Richard was eager to acquire one, but the staff explained it was still undergoing trial phases, reserved only for selected VIPs.Richard wasn't on that list.

One of Richard's acquaintances had snagged a trial unit.

Noticing Richard and Alexander, Trevor Greville beckoned them over. The robot, matching a human in height, was a mnarvel of engineering, equipped to cook, clean, and even tutor children. It could engage in games like chess. Its versatility was simply astounding.

"This is revolutionary," Trevor exclaimned, admiring the machine. "Crafted from steel yet capable of managing myriad tasks. I hear it can even conduct basic health diagnostics."

He glanced at Richard, noticing his somber expression, and inquired, "With your family's clout in this city,you didn't receive a trial model?"

Richard compressed his lips, casting a longing glance at the robot."No."

Trevor nodded. "That's unfortunate. Had Alexander stayed married to Daniela, your doorstep would probably be swamped with these robots. No trial list needed."

Trevor sighed. "Wasn't there talk that Alexander was seeing that Joyce? Are they engaged? Planning to marry?"

Richard managed a rueful smile. "They're not engaged. Just dating."

Trevor shook his head. "Richard, we groom our successors to uphold and fortify ourlegacies.Severing ties with Daniela was a grave error. Joyce doesn't hold a candle to Daniela, not in looks, not in brains, not in grace. Caiden might dote on Joyce, but is she really suitable marriage material? Today's youth might be liberal, but have you seen anyone rise to prominence with a past like Joyce's? She got pregnant without even knowing the father. What does that say about her judgment? That's just lacking discernment. If you welcome someone like that into your family, do you honestly think you'll find peace?"
###Chapter 209 Don't Stop Me For Your Selfishness


Richard was already consumed by regret.

Hearing Trevor's words only deepened his frustration.

"What can we do now?" he asked, his tone carrying a weight of grievance.

Trevor glanced at the robot beside him, a smug smile spreading across his face. "You know, don't you?Plenty of families with eligible young men are eager to pair them with Daniela. Why not let your son give it a shot?" She had chased Alexander for a decade. How could she have moved on so suddenly? Sometimes,the heart simply refuses to be controlled. Besides, everyone remembers her marriage to Alexander. A second marriage might draw a few raised brows, but rekindling an old flame is bound to turn heads.Alexander hasn't married Joyce yet. Why not let him try to win Daniela back?"

Alexander stood to the side, his expression bitter. "Things ended badly between us. Daniela says she's not interested anymore." His face darkened as the words left him.

Trevor noticed that Alexander was reluctant to accept the divorce. "If things ended badly, you should make amends, Alexander. The real test is swallowing your pride. If you do that, you're ready to handle the worst life throws at you. Make your choice."

These words reminded Alexander of the times Daniela had given him advice during crises at Bennett Group.He remained silent, considering her astute business acumen and how effortlessly she rivaled her male counterparts.

For a moment, Richard kept quiet. Then, he shared his concerns with Trevor. "I've seen Daniela since the divorce. She doesn't seem concerr'ed about us anymore. If she actually ends up remarrying Alexander, I doubt her intentions will be genuine."

Trevor laughed. "Once you're all family, why would she treat you poorly? Daniela is kind-hearted.How bad could she be? Could she be worse than Joyce?" Richard glanced at Alexander.

Trevor shook his head. "You'll regret holding back if Daniela marries another man. Did you know an influential figure from the capital visited the exhibition today just to meet her? If you keep hesitating,she'll choose someone else. I don't have an unmarried son, or I wouldn't be telling you this."

Richard pursed his lips, wondering if he was being too cautious.

Trevor went on. "Daniela is a good person. I've heard about her helping many lonely, elderly people. How could that be bad? Besides, at our gatherings, shealways insists on paying the bill. Doesn't that show she respects us a lot? Have you forgotten?"

Richard remained silent for a long while. As Trevor was about to leave, Richard suddenly spoke up."Why don't you help us as a go-between? We're all friends. If we reconcile with Daniela, wouldn't that benefit you too?"

Trevor laughed. "I'd like to help, but Daniela is out of my league now. She's a prominent figure in the business world and wouldn't notice me. You should find Marlin. Didn't his grandson get excellent care at your hospital? Marlin was quite happy with the treatment. He has a strong relationship with Brylee. Maybe if you ask him to speak to Daniela, she might respect him enough to consider a meeting."

Richard nodded and called his secretary to prepare a generous gift for his upcoming visit to Marlin.

Caiden, who was nearby, overheard everything.

As Richard left, Caiden's expression darkened with thought.

If Daniela married Alexander, he wouldn't see a penny of her wealth, and his ties to the Bennett family would be severed.

He pondered how he would support Joyce and the rest of the family.

Concerned, Caiden called Joyce.

When she heard Caiden's news, Joyce became anxious. She changed her clothes and was about to leave when Katrina intervened. "Joyce, think about this. Marrying into the Bennett family without the Harper family's wealth might not be wise.Let me devise a plan."

Joyce,visibly upset, responded, "What plan? I love Alexander. Don't you want me to marry him? Are you using me to fight for the Harper family's fortune?"

Katrina was taken aback. "What are you implying?" She hadn't realized her daughter would view her actions in such a light.

"Isn't it obvious? Dad said the Bennett family wants to be close to Daniela and invited Marlin to mediate.Alexander is amazing, and since Daniela's divorce, she's been trying to win him back. Can't you see what's happening? If I hesitate, I'll end up with someone else, perhaps a divorced man. Remember, you didn't have a dowry when you married into the Harper family, and you brought me into it. How am I different from you back then? Haven't we lived well for the past decade?"

Joyce was resolute, her frustration evident. "I'm following my heart. Don't try to stop me because of selfishness!"

Then she ran out, her skirt billowing behind her like a whirlwind.
###Chapter 210 He Has Liked You Since Childhood


As Joyce stepped onto the scene, she spotted Caiden already there, awaiting her arrival.

He guided her across the street to a vantage point opposite a lavish restaurant.

Peering through the glass, Joyce caught sight of Richard fawning over Marlin, while Alexander maintained a facade of courteous subservience nearby, his smile strained yet polite.

In that moment, the fragile fabric of Joyce's romantic fantasies tore apart, leaving her confronted with a stark reality.

One thought consumed her entirely: she had to become Alexander's wife.

Despite her seeming defeat to Daniela in many aspects, in the matter of Alexander, Joyce had triumphed decisively.

She had even compelled him to divorce Daniela, a victory that she considered the pinnacle of her life's narrative.

True,she was born out of wedlock, a simple girl from the countryside, often the subject of scorn whispered by the elite women of high society. Yet, what did their derision matter when she had bested their paragon,Daniela?

This triumph alone could fuel her pride for a lifetime.

And now, the mere thought of Alexander returning to Daniela sparked a fierce jealousy and resolve within Joyce.

Joyce stood on the bustling street, her fists clenched and eyes alight with a fierce determination.

Caiden, lingering nearby, silently watched her reaction unfold.

For a brief moment, Joyce's look of displeasure and reluctance stirred memories of a younger Katrina in him. Back in those days, Katrina had been plagued by the fear that his affections might drift towards Brylee.And then, tragedy struck-Brylee passed away.

Caiden rested his hand on Joyce's shoulder, his tone dripping with feigned concern. "Everything I do,I do for your benefit. Trust me, I want your happiness even more than your mother does."

Cedric was already aware that Huntley Lambert, the young heir of the Lambert family, was due to meet Daniela.

Thus,when Huntley made his appearance at Harper Group, Cedric was there to stop him.

"Cedric, you're absolutely ridiculous. I've just arrived, and here you are, blocking my path," Huntley remarked, a playful smirk on his face as he crossed his arms.

Cedric's gaze sharpened, his voice laced with impatience. "Why aren't you back home looking after your family's affairs? What brings you here?"

The relationship between Cedric and Huntley stretched back over ten years, both as classmates and close friends. Now, seeing Cedric lose his usual calm demeanor only served to increase Huntley's enjoyment of the moment.

"What's wrong? Is it that you can chase after Daniela, but no one else is allowed to?"

"You're not her type," Cedric stated, his voice laced with a chill.

Huntley sneered, "Oh, come on. I've heard she's not too picky. After all, she fell for a guy like Alexander-the ultimate piece of trash. And how could she resist a charming prince like myself?"

Laughter erupted from Huntley as he watched Cedric's stern face twist in annoyance. His boisterous laughter filled the entryway.

What a delightful scene it was!	J

Throughout their enduring friendship, Huntley had never seen Cedric so visibly shaken.

"She's naturally reserved, but she's earnest and respectful with everyone. Your usual antics won't work on her," Cedric warned as they stepped into the elevator together. You think so?" Huntley replied, shrugging nonchalantly. "Perhaps she'll find my antics appealing.Besides,you haven't won her over yet, have you? If your approach isn't working, why not let me try? At the end of the day, we're friends. If one of us gets her, it's like we both win, right?"

With that, he flashed a confident grin.

Cedric's expression remained stoic, not a hint of amusement.

Always the showman, Huntley had breezed through life with his charismatic, laid-back attitude. A self-proclaimed slacker, he had managed to sail through their educational years by leeching off Cedric's hard work. Their continued companionship from high school to university was largely thanks to the influential Lambert family.

Yet, for all his carelessness, Huntley possessed a genuine knack for making connections.

He could easily engage a stranger on a park bench and find himself sharing snacks and stories within the hour.

Despite everything, Cedric remained in the dark about what Daniela's opinion of Huntley might be.

However, as Cedric observed Huntley engaging Daniela in animated conversation, a realization dawned on him-Daniela harbored no ill feelings toward Huntley.

Huntley's charm was undeniable. Whether he was making light remarks about the splendid weather or delving into complex discussions on international affairs, he navigated any topic with remarkable flair.

With the workday drawing to a close, Huntley waved Cedric off with a laid-back gesture, requesting he book a romantic dinner with Daniela.

A shadow crossed Cedric's face, his expression souring.

Huntley half-joked that if glares could be lethal, he would have been long gone.

That evening, at the restaurant, Cedric was about to seat himself when Huntley dismissively motioned him aside, claiming he needed a private moment with Daniela.

Cedric's gaze towards Daniela was laden with sorrow and a silent plea for understanding. Daniela, sensing that Huntley had something on his mind, opted to go along with his playful charade.A subtle smile tugged at her lips, but she remained silent.

Heartbroken yet resigned, Cedric nodded quietly and relocated to a distant table, where he ordered a flavorless salad that mirrored the emptiness he felt inside.

Huntley thrived in his element, outshining his academic limitations with exceptional talent in other areas.

He serenaded Daniela with a soulful violin solo, then seamlessly transitioned to the piano, transforming the evening into a vibrant spectacle.

Seated at a distant table, Cedric clenched his cutlery with a white-knuckled grip. He made a silent vow-if Huntley had the audacity to invite Daniela to dance, he would send his fork flying in Huntley's direction.

As the last notes of the piano resonated, Huntley flashed a mischievous smile at Daniela and remarked, "Did you catch Cedric squirming in his seat? I'll cherish that image forever."

Daniela returned the smile effortlessly, her gaze never drifting towards Cedric. "Was tonight's grand act all about unsettling him?"

"Absolutely. My entire life, I've been overshadowed by him. My parents lavish him with praise, wishing they had a son like Cedric. So when they sent me here to forge an alliance through marriage, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to outdo him at something."

Daniela's smile remained steady. "But your heart belongs to someone else. It's obvious I'm not the one you truly want."

A look of curiosity crossed Huntley's face before he chuckled. "Oh really? And wheredid you pick that up from?"

"You've glanced at your phone eight times since you entered Harper Group. It's obvious you're anticipating a message."

"What if it's something as simple as a message from my family? Not everything's about love,you know."

With a knowing smile, Daniela replied, "That's not it." The reason was clear-throughout the day, Huntley's nervous demeanor had mirrored Cedric's usual anxiousness.

It was the kind of concern that revealed a deep connection.

A worry so pervasive, it consumed his thoughts, yet he struggled to voice it.

Huntley's grin widened as he flashed a thumbs-up. "It's obvious why Cedric has liked you since we were kids. You're both sharp and insightful!"

Caught off guard by the revelation, Daniela's expression turned to one of surprise. After a moment's hesitation, she asked, "What did you just say? He's had feelings for me since we were kids?"

Startled, Huntley raised his hands. "Whoa, wait a second-you didn't know? Cedric's been crazy about you for at least ten years!
###Chapter 211 She Agreed


"I do harbor feelings for someone special, yet I'm prepared to compromise. As the heir of an illustrious family, basking in the opulence and prestige bestowed upon me, I am ready to uphold my family's legacy without hesitation."

As Huntley spoke, his eyes carried the weight of an unspoken sadness.

Daniela paused to take a sip of water, her gaze drifting to Cedric, who was absorbed in his salad, seemingly oblivious to the conversation. A subtle smile graced her lips.

Turning to Huntley, she responded, "However, I refuse to coerce myself into anything."

Huntley's eyebrow arched in surprise. "Haven't you done exactly that in the past? Surely, you didn't actually have affection for that scumbag,Alexander?"

Daniela's smile persisted as she responded, "Indeed, I had compelled myself before, but I've grown less willing to do so now."

Having tasted true freedom, it was difficult to relinquish.

Huntley was momentarily taken aback by her candor, then his lips curved into a thoughtful smile.

As the meal, Cedric's gaze lingered on Daniela while Huntley accompanied her home. He then casually slung his arm around Huntley's shoulders, steering him away.

"What exactly do you mean?" Cedric's tone matched the intensity in his steady gaze. The memory of Huntley and Daniela laughing together lingered in his mind, stirring a sense of unease. "Are you really considering pursuing Daniela?"

Huntley folded his arms, nodded thoughtfully, and stretched out his long legs across the plush sofa in the dimly lit bar. "This was my family's decision. To me, the pursuit of any woman is much the same.Daniela is stunning. Not to mention wealthy. Her robotics company is burgeoning with potential, and my family holds her in high esteem." Cedric's expression grew shadowy, his brows knitting together.

Leaning back, Huntley took a leisurely sip of his drink and continued with a dismissive wave of his hand,"They've pretty much written me off as unable to forge my own path, so they're banking on me using my charm to land a successful partner."

Turning to catch Cedric's sullen profile, Huntley bit back a chuckle. "In my opinion, Daniela is a perfect fit.With her abilities and resourcefulness, the Lambert family will be in good hands."

At these words, Cedric whipped his head around, his voice laced with a hint of reproach. "You've prattled on enough but haven't once mentioned actually liking her. Marriage isn't a game. She's been through a divorce;it would be cruel to risk her getting hurt again."

Huntley's smile was tinged with nonchalance. "Is that your worry? But who says I don't have feelings for her,or that she doesn't care for me? We had a splendid chat tonight. In fact, I've invited her to breakfast tomorrow, and she's accepted. Cedric, you've been into Daniela forever. If you don't take your chance and win her over, you can't blame others for stepping in, can you?"

Cedric's frown deepened, his anger momentarily quelled by Huntley's calm retort. "I'm not interested in your justifications. I want to know what she thinks, what she feels."

"Daniela said..." Huntley paused deliberately, savoring each word as he observed Cedric's mounting frustration. "I brought up the topic of marriage, and Daniela didn't dismiss it outright. I even ventured that since we're headed towards a family-arranged union anyway, it's perfectly acceptable. I vowed to honor 'till death do us part' and not to meddle in her pursuits thereafter."

Cedric's jaw clenched tightly as he demanded, "What did she say?"

With a mischievous chuckle, Huntley reached for a slice of watermelon from the spread before them."Hold on, I'm not done yet. I proposed to Daniela that if she doesn't find someone suitable within the next month,she might as well take a chance on me. It's not unusual these days for love to blossom after getting married."

Cedric scoffed, finding the idea ludicrous.

He burst into laughter, ready to retort that Daniela would never consent to such a plan. Marrying into wealth was the least of her concerns-she already had billions to her name.

The decision to marry was hers alone to make.

But before he could voice his thoughts, Huntley, still nibbling on his watermelon, muttered, "She agreed."

Cedric turned his head sharply, the smile frozen awkwardly on his face as if etched in place. "What did you just say?" he asked, disbelief tinting his voice.

Huntley's expression was the picture of innocence. "I said she agreed."

Cedric chuckled, disbelief morphing into amusement. "That's impossible, utterly impossible."

Huntley remained silent, his attention turned to leisurely enjoying his watermelon.

Often,silence served as a gentle nudge for the other to regain their composure.

Cedric's laughter faded, no longer able to mask his astonishment.

Huntley bowed his head, his fingers dancing across his phone's screen. "I'm just sending a message to my family,sharing this good..."

He paused midsentence as Cedric abruptly stood, the wooden chair screeching loudly against the floor as he pushed back.

Huntley turned just in time to catch a glimpse of Cedric's departing figure.

For a moment, Huntley sat stunned, then a soft smile played on his lips.

In their circle, if joy was to find a home with any of them, Huntley wished it would be with Cedric.

###Chapter 212 You're A Tool Daniela Uses To Needle Me


Daniela was testing the medical capabilities of the robot.

Just as she was monitoring its heart rate and blood pressure metrics, Cedric's sudden knock echoed through the softly lit room. He appeared, unusually drenched in sweat.

"What's got you looking like you've run a marathon?" Daniela inquired, noticing his sweaty brow and extending a paper towel his way.

Cedric looked at Daniela.

Barely holding his anxiety at bay, he felt a familiar pang of despair-he was reminded of the heartache he endured when she had married Alexander.

It was almost too much to bear.

He knew that life wouldn't grant him a second chance.

If he lost Daniela now, it would be a loss for eternity..

"Daniela, marry me," he blurted out.

The device in Daniela's hand slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor at his sudden proposal.

"You..." Daniela paused, her words trailing off. "What did you just say?"

A desperate plea was etched across Cedric's face. If he could see his own reflection, he imagined it would look both haunted and fraught.

"I said, let's get married."

Daniela, struggling to gather her thoughts, repeated, "You said..."

"Yes. Marriage. You and me!" Fumbling in his pocket, he produced a ring. "I've been holding onto this for some time. If you were willing to give Huntley a chance, why not me? Anything he promised, I can offer too. Remember the boy from your past who mattered so much? That boy was me. Choose me, Daniela."

Under the gentle illumination of the lamp, Daniela appeared to glow softly. "Why didn't you tell me sooner that you were the boy from my childhood memories?"

Cedric mopped the sweat from his brow, his words tumbling out in a rush. "I wanted to. But you had already married Alexander by then, and I wasn't sure how much you still held on to those memories. I feared it might seem like I was trying to manipulate your feelings. Besides, I left without saying goodbye."

Daniela studied his troubled features. "So why did you leave without telling me?"

Cedric's heart dropped.

Her demeanor was calm and unexcited even after discovering he was the boy she had once cherished. She was composed, unshaken.

He felt as if his heartfelt revelations could never sway her.

"My family was in turmoil. We moved away suddenly, and then, I ended up in an orphanage. When I finally came back, your relatives told me you had gone overseas."

Daniela was silent for a moment. "You've never mentioned this before. Why now?"

Cedric clenched his jaw. "Because you set a trial period with Huntley, didn't you? I'm scared, Daniela. I'm terrified that someone else might sweep you away from me."

Cedric gripped the ring box tighter. "If you gave Huntley a chance on day one, can't you do the same for me? We don't have to rush. Let me court you properly. When you're convinced, we can marry. Daniela,marriage shouldn't be impulsive. I want to offer you everything you deserve."

His voice conveyed a palpable urgency.
J
He was desperate, grappling for more persuasive words.

All he had was his sincere heart.

"I only have my grandmother left," Cedric continued, hastily pulling out a plastic folder. It was stuffed with property deeds. "Here's a list of my assets. I own eight top-tier estates, plus three hundred more properties across different cities. I also control nine companies and maintain over fifty active investments. It's all worth just over ninety billion. It's not much, but I promise to strive for more."

Just then, Lillian and Ryan stepped out from their respective rooms, freezing at the sight of Cedric laying his soul bare.

Ryan mouthed to Lillian, "What's happening?"

Lillian could only shrug, her eyes wide. "No clue. Looks like he's reached his breaking point!"

Cedric, driven by a sense of urgency,blurted out,"|promise, the secrets I kept before will never resurface.I swear to never lie to you again for as long as I live!"

Cedric's face was a mask of earnest sincerity, his heart pounding urgently. "Please give me a chance to prove how much I care."

Cedric felt he had laid everything on the line, yet Daniela showed no signs of immediate acceptance.

He was on the verge of despair when he finally heard her soft voice. "Okay, you got it."

Joy washed over him like a tidal wave. He blinked in disbelief, then asked hesitantly, "You'll let me court you?Really?You mean?"

Daniela hadn't expected to make such a decision.

From simply dating, to trying it out, or diving straight into marriage, he had chosen the most challenging path. Yet, he seemed genuinely elated.

Daniela offered a smile and nodded.-"Yes."

Cedric hurriedly pushed all his documents into Daniela's arms, then paused, realizing she was still busy."You're working, right? Carry on. I'll make sure to be a considerate suitor!"

He exited quietly, even closing the door softly behind him like a true gentleman.

Ryan and Lillian remained, squinting in puzzlement.What the hell was he thinking?

He had chosen to court out of three possible paths rather than rush into marriage.

Was Cedric joking?

As they were about to inquire further, they noticed someone standing at the staircase.

"Alexander?"

"Isn't it just agreeing to let you pursue her? What's there to be proud of?" Alexander smirked. "Do you know why Daniela didn't agree at first but suddenly did?"

Cedric turned to him. "What do you mean?"

With hands in his pockets, Alexander replied, "Because she saw me standing at the staircase. That's why she agreed. She doesn't like you. She agreed just to spite me. Cedric, you're celebrating too soon. You're a tool Daniela uses to needle me."
###Chapter 213 Alexander Regrets It


Cedric no longer bothered with the careful attitude he used to have around Daniela.

Now, he stood up straight, looking serious but still showing some of the excitement from earlier. "Daniela uses me to needle me? Alexander, you give yourself way too much credit."

His eyes flicked to Alexander's ribs. "What? Back in shape already? Did you show up just to get hurt all over again?"

At those words, Alexander instinctively stepped back, his voice trembling. "Cedric, you're out of your mind!"

He couldn't wrap his head around Cedric's obsession with Daniela. The man had given all his wealth to her.It was absolute lunacy.

Could Daniela really be worth such a wild leap?

For Alexander, the answer was crystal clear-she wasn't.

But a moment later, his thoughts clouded with a subtle sadness.

He had lied to Cedric. Daniela hadn't seen him just now.

He didn't know when it had started, but somewhere along the line, he had become invisible to her-just another face in the crowd she no longer cared to recognize.

He'd uttered a clumsy lie without understanding why he'd even said it.

Was it just because Cedric's presence grated on his nerves? Yes, that had to be it.

Daniela stood motionless in the room. The health monitor on her wrist blinked unevenly, a silent echo of the tension filling the room.

Alexander retreated to the empty garden and dialed Richard.

"Are you sure we don't need Marlin's help?" Richard asked. "Yes. Daniela has granted Cedric the chance to woo her."

Confused, Richard asked, "It's just a chance to pursue her. Why does he need her permission for that? If he wants to go after her, heshould just do it."

Alexander stared at the city lights far in the distance, his tone steady but laced with thought.-"Do you really think anyone could approach Daniela if she didn't want them to? Since Elite Lux came into power, how many people have tried to win her over? And how many has she ever given the time of day?"

Richard stayed quiet for a moment before finally asking, "So, do you really think there's no point in asking Marlin to step in for you?"

Alexander's eyes wandered towards the faint outlines of the grassland in the fading light.

He felt the urge to respond firmly,′′NO1, it's not necessary."

But deep down, he wondered if saying that might mean he and Daniela would end up drifting apart, just like that.

Alexander's pause gave Richard the chance to chime in. "Give it one last shot. Caiden's pushing for your marriage to Joyce, and with Elite Lux now aligned with Harper Group, their future looks promising.People are already asking Katrina about Joyce. In our world, alliances and gains always take priority."

In a composed tone, Alexander replied, "Fine. Make the arrangements."

Marlin wasted no time and showed up at Daniela's office the following day.

Cedric was tending to a plant in Daniela's office, having sent Huntley off on an errand earlier that morning.

He looked visibly pleased with himself.

Marlin stopped in his tracks when his eyes landed on Cedric, surprise flickering across his face.

"Mr. Phillips? What brings you here?" Marlin asked, visibly stunned. Could Cedric and Daniela be in a relationship?

If that were the case, speaking up would be a challenge. Besides, next to Cedric, Alexander didn't even come close to matching his stature.

Cedric recognized Marlin immediately; he was a man held in high regard. He flashed a polite smile and declared, "I'm here because I'm courting Daniela."

Cedric, feeling invincible, was bursting with pride, ready to tell anyone and everyone that he was pursuing Daniela.

Normally, courting someone wouldn't warrant such a grand proclamation, but Cedric's enthusiasm made it sound like he'd already swept Daniela off her feet and they were preparing for their wedding.

"Ah...courting," Marlin echoed thoughtfully, glancing at Daniela.

She gave him a smile and asked, "Marlin, was there something you wanted to talk about?"

Before he could respond, Cedric passed Daniela a glass of water and reminded her, "You haven't had anything to drink this morning. Take a sip."

Daniela gave a small nod, took a sip from the glass, and then turned her gaze to Marlin.11|sthere something you want to talk about?"

Marlin suddenly felt out of place. The way Daniela and Cedric interacted didn't feel like casual courting-it carried the ease and understanding of two people already in a relationship.

Marlin found himself at a loss for words. After sipping his water and forcing a polite smile, he decided to get straight to the point.

"The Bennett family asked me to pass along a message," Marlin began."Alexander would like a chance to pursue you, Daniela. What's your opinion on that?"

Cedric's grin disappeared in an instant. It was as if the whole universe had set its sights on the woman he held dear.	J

Once Marlin finished, he could feel the icy intensity of Cedric's glare. It was uncomfortable, especially for someone his age, as he'd rarely been in such an awkward position before.

With an uneasy laugh, he stood and said, "Well, I've done my part. The decision is yours. My apologies for the sudden visit today."

Saying no more, Marlin hurriedly left the office.

Daniela stared at the closed door for a brief moment, her expression unreadable, before glancing at Cedric.
He stood there holding the plant, his gaze downcast as if deep in thought.

"Alexander regrets it."

Cedric had always known it would come to this. He'd seen it on the horizon long before now.

Alexander was filled with regret.

If he wasn't, he wouldn't have swallowed his pride and had Marlin act as his messenger.
###Chapter 214 Are You So Considerate To Everyone Who Pursues You


As the words left his mouth, Cedric immediately wished he could take them back.

Despite what Daniela might feel, he had never planned to bring up Alexander in her presence.

The regret gnawed at him, fueled by his irritation at not having secured the title of Daniela's boyfriend sooner-instead, he lingered as just another hopeful contender.

Daniela, after all, wasn't short of admirers; lacking the official status of her boyfriend, how could he possibly shield her from the wave of persistent suitors?

His frustration knew no bounds, yet the words, once uttered, were irrevocable.

He tightened his grip a bit as he turned to look at Daniela.

Daniela offered him a smile. She was quite occupied today; an issue had cropped up in the Al development project she was overseeing.

Cedric asked, "Are you tied up? If so, I'll leave you be:"

Setting aside the documents she was reviewing, Daniela looked up at the person poised to exit the office."Where are you going?"

With a quick look back, Cedric remarked, "I'll go see how the orchard is doing."

With a keen eye on the quality of his produce, Cedric had taken to leasing an orchard on the city's outskirts,making daily personal inspections a part of his routine. His attention to detail was meticulous.

Just as Daniela was about to respond, the office door burst open, and Alexander made his entrance.

The secretary, wearing a look of regret, addressed Daniela. "Sorry, Daniela. I failed to hold him back."

Alexander lingered at the doorway, his eyes locked on the vanishing smile that once graced Daniela's lips.It disappeared, leaving a void that pulled his spirits down withit. He cleared his throat, his voice a mix of hope and hesitation. "Daniela, can we talk?"

"Mr. Bennett, the world does not orbit around your family's whims. We all have our own burdens to bear.Next time, consider scheduling an appointment." Daniela was clearly not in the mood to entertain interruptions, especially with her work piling up.

Alexander's hands balled into fists at his sides, his knuckles whitening. "I'm sorry, I was thoughtless.Please accept my apologies."

Despite his earnest apology, Daniela remained unmoved, her expression stoic.

Cedric, who had been observing quietly, turned to look at Alexander with raised eyebrows.

He was taken aback by Alexander's apology. Something was amiss-Alexander must be driven by some ulterior motive today.

Cedric's gaze sharpened, skepticism coloring his watchful eyes as he scrutinized Alexander.

Standing with the poise of a true gentleman, Alexander persisted. "Then, may I schedule a meeting for this evening? How about Midnight Bar?"

The suggestion seemed out of place-more suited for clandestine romances than serious discussions.

Cedric opened his mouth to object, but Daniela interjected, "I am neither your friend nor interested in any personal entanglements. Meeting at a bar is wholly inappropriate." She glanced at her watch. "You have five minutes.I have another meeting shortly."

Alexander cast a glance at Cedric, his eyes silently pleading for him to take his leave.

However, Cedric seemed.oblivious to the subtle cue, continuing his task of watering the plant without interruption.

The office was hardly the ideal setting for personal discussions, and Alexander had planned a meaningful conversation with Daniela for today.

The pressure was mounting from Joyce to finalize the engagement ceremony details, and Alexander felt the urgency to clear the air before the day ended. "No worries, take your time," Alexander responded, his tone soft and accommodating-a stark contrast to his usually assertive manner. "I'Il wait for you. If the bar isn't a good spot, l've also booked a table at a lovely restaurant for lunch. We could go there."

His preparation was evident, and without waiting for Daniela's consent, he offered a polite bow and exited.

Lillian,who had just walked in, watched Alexander's smooth exit in surprise and turned to Daniela, curiosity piqued."Is he trying to mend things?"

Daniela bowed her head, her expression unreadable. "It doesn't matter."

Acknowledging the response, Lillian simply nodded and retreated to her game, leaving the room to return to its usual quietude.

As Daniela wrapped up her data work, Cedric's plant wvas dangerously close to being overwatered.

With a gentle smile, she approached, relieving him of the watering can with a graceful gesture, "Everything okay?"

Cedric glanced upward, his eyes meeting Daniela's. "Are you going to lunch with him?"

Daniela gave a slight nod in affirmation. Just as Cedric's gaze began to drop, laden with disappointment,she went on. "Katrina is not the type to just sit around; she won't keep Joyce waiting much longer.Alexander's invitation is merely a desperate attempt to influence my decision, hoping I'll repeat past mistakes."

Cedric was taken aback by Daniela's pragmatic tone. "And you're still planning to go?"

"Yes. Otherwise, it would only lead to more complications. Once he realizes it's futile, I'll finally be free.Moreover, if I don't clarify things, it might just spark a hint of jealousy."

At her mention of jealousy, Cedric involuntarily coughed, his fingers brushing against the watering can Daniela had just put down. "Who would be jealous?"

Noticing the redness creeping up Cedric's ears, Daniela let out a gentle laugh. She then reassured him,"Lunch might not fill me up. I'll cook for you once I'm home." Cedric felt a wave of relief wash over him. "Do you show this kind of consideration to all your suitors?" he asked, a note of hope in his voice.

Daniela was about to answer when Lillian burst into the room, waving her phone energetically."Daniela, it's time for the meeting!"

After Daniela had hurried off, Cedric was left alone, pondering whether Daniela extended this kindness to all her suitors or if it was something reserved just for him.
###Chapter 215 You Are Nothing Alike


Cedric held back his question, reluctant to hear the answer.

If Daniela admitted that she treated all her suitors in the same manner, Cedric feared he wouldn't withstand such a revelation.

But it didn't take long for Cedric to know the answer.

Due to a tight schedule, Daniela couldn't venture far for lunch and met Alexander at the restaurant just below.

"How unfortunate. The cuisine is superb at the other spot. Perhaps next time, I can show you."

Daniela's eyes drifted momentarily to a nearby table, spotting Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric. Her lips twitched into a fleeting smile. "The quality of a meal depends on the company. Also, there's no need for small talk.Just say what you need to say."

Alexander's usual stern facade softened into a look of mild regret. "So I guess I'm no longer the one you love?"

Daniela was aware that if she didn't settle this now, Alexander would undoubtedly revisit the topic.

Letting the silence linger, she leaned back slightly. Cedric's image surfaced in her mind, quietly stealing her focus.

Alexander detected Daniela's indifference, and a wave of disappointment washed over him, mingling with a sense of loss. "Daniela, do you remember-"

He was cut off mid-sentence as Daniela subtly raised her hand, her demeanor courteous yet detached."Let's drop the nostalgia and get straight to the point."

Alexander's expression changed, the smile dissolving as a trace of tension settled into his features. "Of course. I merely thought those days held some charm worth revisiting. I didn't intend to make you A slight, icy smile crept onto Daniela's lips. "I'm fine. It's just that reflecting on the past seems somewhat pointless."

Alexander clenched his jaw, a subtle indication of his inner turmoil.

He sensed her dismissive tone and knew pressing the issue could only lead to embarrassment. Yet,a bitter resolve bubbled up within him, prompting him to attempt another topic.

"Very well, no more about the past then. Marlin visited you today, didn't he?"

Daniela gave a brief nod.

In a voice that carried a hint of desperation, Alexander continued, "And what do you think?"

Daniela's gaze locked onto his, unwavering and cold. Her voice carried a sharp edge, each word deliberate."I don't make a habit of revisiting old relationships. And you shouldn't either."

Alexander's jaw tightened, his expression hardening further. "Haven't you given Cedric the chance to pursue you? If you can accept his advances, then why not mine? Isn't our history deeper than yours with him? Tell me,Daniela,why him and not me?"

A bitter chuckle escaped her lips, cutting through the tension in the room like a knife.

Her eyes flicked momentarily to Cedric, who had just stepped away to speak with his secretary."Alexander,we're both seasoned players in the business world. While I've never held Bennett Group in high regard, I've tried to show you some basic civility. But since you're so determined to push, let me be brutally honest."

Her eyes narrowed, her words laced with icy disdain. "You and Cedric couldn't be more different.When Cedric says he wants to pursue me, he's genuine-his intentions are clear, without pretense. But you? What you're after isn't affection. It's a guarantee, a partnership you can later exploit for your own business gains.That's not pursuit, Alexander; that's strategy. And it's pathetic. So no, you're not like Cedric. In fact, you don't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath."

Her words landed like a slap, precise and merciless. Caught by the way the sunlight lit up Daniela's features, Alexander's gaze lingered, and then, without warning, he let out a low, hollow laugh. "Isn't that interesting? I've been saying all this, and you've been calm this whole time. But the second I brought up Cedric, you got worked up."

Daniela lifted her glass of water, taking a sip before setting it down.

"So,things have changed, haven't they?" Alexander probed, his voice low and steady, a stark contrast to the intensity in his gaze as he searched her face for any sign of contradiction.

Instead, Daniela offered a slight, enigmatic smile. Her response was serene, almost detached. "Wasn't it clear all along? In terms of looks, Cedric's sophistication and allure make you look downright ordinary.In terms of talent, his brilliance outshines your own. And when it comes to power, prestige, and wealth-really,in which aspect do you think you could possibly outdo him? You wish to rival Cedric? Please, do tell-what do you possess that might possibly surpass him?"

With a faint tilt of her head and a sarcastic edge to her tone, she pressed on. "What could I possibly gain from you? Your inconsistency? Your egotism? Or perhaps it's the deceitful guise you don today, dredging up bygone days as if they hold any relevance? Alexander, save your breath. If you're searching for someone who can endure your presence, try Joyce. She's still in the dark about you, after all."

The shadow of anger swept across Alexander's face, a tempest lurking just beneath his stoic facade. Each of her scathing words struck deep, challenging his self-control, yet he anchored himself in his seat,determined to reclaim her affection without losing his composure.

Tension coiled tightly within him as he leaned forward, his voice strained but deliberate."IfI'm the villain you paint me to be, what drew you to me in the first place?"

Daniela answered without hesitation, "I've explained this before. But it seems you've forgotten, so I'll remind you. I mistook you for the boy during my darkest days of depression in youth. Does that make things clear enough for you?"	J

The color drained from Alexander's face, his eyes searching hers for a sliver of the past warmth. In a voice edged with desperation, he pleaded, "And now? There's nothing left?"

"Nothing at all," Daniela shot back with an edge to her voice. "The day I asked for a divorce, I wiped away all memories of what we once were. We should be strangers from now on. The only reason we're meeting today is that your endless persistence exhausted what little patience I had left. And maybe because..."

Her voice trailed off as she lifted her eyes.

The person who had been talking to his secretary outside appeared, his tall frame backlit by the light flooding in.

Alexander's gaze drifted, following her pointed look, and his heart clenched painfully as he spotted Cedric.

Cedric, with his usual aloof and frosty demeanor, strode towards them, his presence as imposing as always.

Yet when he talked to Daniela, a soft smile played on his lips.′′Are you ready to leave? If so, let's head upstairs and have lunch."

Without a moment's delay, Daniela rose andaccompanied Cedric, leaving Alexander to stew in solitude at the table.

He watched their receding figures, a sense of finality washing over him.

It was then that realization struck him with the force of a thunderclap.

He had lost her. Completely.

Just as Cedric and Daniela were about to vanish from view, Alexander's emotions boiled over. Leaping to his feet,he bellowed after her,"Daniela! You'll regret this!"
###Chapter 216 Everyone Had Their Own Motives


Daniela didn't even look back at Alexander.

The restaurant's guests gazed at Alexander with a blend of shock and pity, their faces a canvas of sympathy.



Without a word to Richard, Alexander went straight home and impulsively set a wedding date with Joyce for the coming month.

However, Joyce was anything but elated.

She was well aware that Alexander had sought Marlin's help in bring Daniela and him back together, only to be rejected at the restaurant earlier that day. Their clash had not only been captured but also plastered across the news.

Biting her lip, Joyce stewed in silence. So, after Daniela's rejection, he returned to her as if she were merely a fallback option?

The urge to create a scene was overwhelming!

But Katrina, ever the voice of reason, urged restraint."Hold your horses, Joyce. Until that marriage certificate is signed, you're not yet a Bennett. Push Alexander too hard now, and you might lose everything if he flies off the handle."

Joyce seethed with frustration.

Why should she settle for this?

She had once thought herself the sole keeper of a special place in Alexander's heart. Was that belief now just a faded memory?

Katrina offered a comforting pat on her hand."Oh, my dear, don't be so quick to doubt. Remember,Alexander divorced Daniela for you. Now, he's ready to walk down the aisle with you. Daniela's just athorn in your side, nothing more."

Fists clenched, Joyce's anger simmered. "Daniela! Itried to bridge the gap between us, but you're hell-bent on stealing my man! I won't let you get away with this."

Meanwhile, Alexander drowned his sorrows at a local bar. Shaking his head, Keith remarked, "You're a mess.You had Daniela but took her for granted, and now it's too late. Just because you can't have Daniela back doesn't mean settling for Joyce is your only option. Remember her mother? That's a window into the kind of drama Joyce could bring. Are you sure she's the right choice?"

Alexander slouched over the table, tuning out Keith's words.

Visions of Daniela departing with Cedric haunted him repeatedly.

Did he regret it?

Not a chance!

He was not one to harbor regrets.

The following morning greeted Alexander with a throbbing headache. As he descended the stairs, he found Richard waiting, his expression clouded with fury.

"Dad."

"Got a call from the Harper family this morning," Richard began icily. "They say you're marrying Joyce next month. Is that true?"

"Yes, it's true," Alexander replied, rubbing his forehead.

"Have you lost your senses? Even if you're dead set on marrying Joyce, shouldn't you at least discuss what she's bringing into this union? If you don't iron out these details now,how will you manage future disputes?"

Richard was beside himself with frustration, convinced Alexander was becoming more reckless by the day.

Unruffled, Alexander responded, "Elite Lux is making significant inroads with Harper Group. Caiden seems to favor Joyce, and whatever she brings to the table won't be trivial. We have nothing to worry about." Richard remained irked. Just yesterday, he haddreamt of Daniela enriching their family with her wealth and status. Now, those dreams were pinned on Joyce.

"And what about Daniela? Are you simply going to write her off?"

"Dad, drop it. She's history. I'm moving forward with Joyce. Daniela and I are done."

Richard's dreams of wealth shattered in an instant. He let out a heavy, defeated sigh. "I just hope you don't come to regret this."

That struck a nerve.

Alexander's calm demeanor cracked. "Regret? It should be Daniela filled with regret! I swallowed my pride to make peace, yet she chose Cedric over me. She's dead to me now, and I don't wwant to hear her name again!"

Richard sighed once more.

What a fiasco!

The wedding was hastily arranged.

In their social circles, weddings demanded elaborate planning well in advance.

Katrina fretted over potential hitches before the big day.

Caiden was keen to secure the financial perks tied to the union.

Despite his bitterness towards Daniela, Alexander was adamant about proving he could move on by marrying Joyce next month.

Everyone had their own motives.

The sole beacon of genuine happiness was Joyce, buoyed by the belief that her love with Alexander was both deep and destined to endure forever.
###Chapter 217 Joyce's Dowry


Word of the Harper and Bennett families' alliance swept through Olisvine like wildfire. Soon, every tongue in the city was wagging about Joyce and Alexander's impending nuptials.

The social elite were abuzz, their discussions a fiery mix of gossip and speculation.

Joyce, radiant with anticipation, dived into the online comments, expecting a cascade of blessings and congratulatory messages.

Instead, the harsh reality of public opinion shattered her buoyant mood.

"Joyce is marrying Alexander? Can my eyes be deceiving me?"

"No deception here. Both Harper Group and Bennett Group have broadcasted it on their websites. The wedding's on the calendar for next month's end."

"Alexander's decisions are a riddle wrapped in a mystery. He divorced Daniela only to marry her stepsister?What a tangle."

"Has Alexander lost his marbles? Trading Daniela for Joyce seems like a poor swap!"

"The lot of you are missing the point. Weak men choose partners they think they can dominate. Daniela is too much of a titan for Alexander-he probably feels dwarfed by her. Joyce, on the other hand, is cut from the same cloth as her mother. Both are completely dependent on their men-a type far easier to sway."

"Remember, Joyce comes with a child already in tow. Alexander's standards can't be very high, canthey?"

"It's clear as day, isn't it? She must be bringing a hefty dowry. With enough money on the line, the Bennett family would overlook just about anything."

Joyce's face flushed a deep crimson as she scrolled through the comments. In a fit of rage, she slammed her laptop to the floor.

Her fists clenched, eyes aflame with cold anger. Why?

Why was she seen as lesser compared to Daniela?

Fine.She would prove them wrong!

Her wedding day would unveil a dowry so lavish, a procession so grand, they would all be left speechless.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, she whirled around to face Katrina. "When is Dad transferring his shares into my name?"

Katrina hesitated at the question. After a while, she responded, "I've discussed this with yourfather.The family coffers are thin right now, so we can't afford much. And his shares can't be transferred just yet-not until the company's fortunes improve."

Joyce froze. "What do you mean? Are you saying Caiden isn't planning to give me the shares?"

"It's not that he won't ever give them to you; he just plans to delay it a bit," Katrina replied evasively.

Katrina recalled Caiden's words. "We're strapped for cash right now, depending on Harper Group to stay afloat. If we hand everything to Joyce, what's left for us? What about Jack? Honestly, Joyce isn't Daniela.She knows nothing about running a business. It'd be like throwing good money after bad."

Joyce stood, stunned, staring at Katrina. "Mom,you agreed to this?"

Katrina's cheeks colored with embarrassment. "I didn't want to, but we really are strapped."

Joyce's voice sharpened, cutting through the excuses. "Then sell the other half of Harper Group to Daniela!You said because I was a mother before marriage, I needed a generous dowry to appease the Bennett family.Now you're backtracking? All this talk about being broke-it's just an excuse!"

Katrina attempted an explanation, but Joyce, too wrought with emotion, was beyond listening. In her fury,she shoved Katrina to the floor. "You're all liars! Every one of you!"

The venomous online comments echoed in her mind, mocking her, diminishing her, constantly comparing her to Daniela. Her resentment boiled over, spilling out in unchecked torrents. She glared down at Katrina. "If you can't sort this out, I'll hate you all forever!"

With that, Joyce stormed off.

She had no constructive outlet for her emotions. When she felt aggrieved, she turned to retail therapy.If the world insisted she wasn't Daniela's equal, she would submerge herself in luxury, basking in the obsequious attention of sales associates.

Shopping always bestowed a fleeting sense of control. The ceaseless flattery from staff bolstered her ego and soothed her wounded pride.

Meanwhile, Richard also stumbled upon the online comments about Joyce.

The mention of "dowry" struck a chord, stirring his concerns.

"Alexander, did the Harper family clarify the dowry Joyce is bringing?"

Alexander was preparing for a business trip that wvould last over a month, and by the time he returned,it would be time for the wedding.

He replied nonchalantly, "Didn't they outline it during our last talk? They promised all their assets to Joyce.Now, even though they own just half of Harper Group, with Daniela's prowess, that half is likely more valuable now than the whole company once was."

Richard's brow furrowed. The answer did little to alleviate his worries.

He opened his mouth to probe further, but Alexander had already grabbed his suitcase and was heading out the door.

Alexander left with a definitive stride, showing scant interest in the wedding details. He left it all in the Harper family's hands, indifferent to theirplans.

Richard, however, couldn't shake a nagging unease.

Resolved to gain clarity, he arranged a meeting with the Harper family over dinner.

At the dinner table, Richard cut straight to the chase. "As for the bride price, we're planning to provide Joyce with 30 million in cash, a mountaintop villa, and a few other tokens. All told, it sums up to about 50million."

Joyce, soured by days of discontent, finally saw a spark of joy flicker across her face.

The Bennett family still valued her.

Deep down, she had always believed that despite the world turning against her, Alexander would remain her steadfast champion.

The Harper family's promises were of littleconsequence to her.

Once married, she resolved to devote herself entirely to the Bennett family-to those who truly valued her.
###Chapter 218 Joyce Could Never Be Daniela


Joyce flashed her brightest smile.

But then Richard asked, "So, what about Joyce's dowry?"

The question caused Katrina and Caiden to hesitate momentarily, their polished expressions cracking ever so slightly.

Before Joyce could tell the truth, Katrina stepped in, masking any tension with a light laugh. "Richard, you're as thorough as ever. Joyce is our daughter, after all. There's no question we'd give her the best in the world."

Richard, a veteran in the business world, was far too sharp to be placated by empty reassurances.

He wanted a straightforward answer. With a polite smile, he lowered his gaze slightly and said, "Of course,it's not about the amount Joyce brings. We value her as a person. But, as you know, we move in high-society circles. If Joyce's dowry falls short of expectations, it's not just Joyce who would face criticism. The Harper family's reputation would also be at stake."

Joyce's heart swelled with happiness at the phrase "we value her as a person."

In that moment, she felt even more assured of the Bennett family's genuine regard for her.

Deep down, she resolved to repay Richard's thoughtfulness someday.

However, Katrina and Caiden weren't fooled. Beneath Richard's courteous tone, they recognized his subtle probing.

They also grasped the true reason why the Bennett family had welcomed Joyce, even with her child. It wasn't about Joyce as a person-it was the advantages that came with her.

Katrina's smile didn't waver as she responded seamlessly, "You're absolutely right. Joyce means the world to us. We'd never allow her to be a subject of ridicule. As we mentioned earlier, our shares and villa will all At this, Richard's expression eased, appearing satisfied for the moment. "And when can we expect the paperwork to be finalized?" He wasn't the kind of man who could be swayed with vague promises.

"It's all taken care of!" Katrina said with a reassuring smile. "The shares have been in Joyce's name for quite some time. We just kept it quiet to steer clear of any unnecessary issues. Don't worry; wve'd never cut corners when it comes to Joyce. At the wedding, you'll have all the documents-the equity transfer agreement and the villa's deed."

Richard looked like he was about to ask more, but Katrina quickly added, "Come on, we're about to be family.Do you honesty think we'd lie to you about something so crucial? Do you want to come home with us and inspect the safe? Joyce is our one and only daughter. There's no way we'd treat her unfairly."

At this stage, there wasn't much more Richard could say. Reluctantly, he let the matter rest.

At the table, Joyce clenched her fork so tightly that her knuckles turned pale.

Everything had been a lie.

They had deceived Richard the same way they had deceived her. Caiden had never planned to hand over the assets.

It was nothing but a charade!

Anger seared through her, but she kept it buried deep. She knew that making a scene now would mean throwing away everything she had.

Later that evening, Richard picked up his phone and called Alexander.

The background noise of lively music and voices made it clear Alexander was at a bar. Richard's brow furrowed in disapproval. "Are you there for business, or are you just out enjoying yourself?"

Alexander's voice sounded muffled and distant. "What do you need?"

Richard explained everything from the dinner, including Katrina's assurances about Joyce's dowry.Alexander responded with a dismissive laugh, "Katrina dotes on Joyce. She won't let her go into marriage empty-handed. Stop worrying about it. Let them sort out their problems. If they can't, they'll come crawling to Daniela eventually. We'll get what we need, one way or another. And let's face it, no matter how hard you push, Joyce will never be Daniela."

And with that, he ended the call.

Richard stared at the phone, regret shadowing his features.

Alexander was right.

No matter how things went, Joyce could never be Daniela.
###Chapter 219 Legacy


On their ride home after dinner, Joyce's voice cut sharply through the silence. "You promised to hand over Harper Group, and if that's not possible right now, I'll accept its cash equivalent. Converting it into money is fine by me."

Caiden,clearly frustrated, responded, "How do you expect me to come up with such an amount? You know the situation with Harper Group. People think that Elite Lux's partnership with Harper Group has been a huge success, but the truth is, it's been losing money this whole time. Your wedding with Alexander was only secured because outsiders don't know the truth yet."

Turning her head away in frustration, Joyce exclaimed, "Richard just said he and Alexander valued me as a person. What are you implying? Do you genuinely believe Alexander is after our fortune? Why must you see things so superficially? Do you think everyone is as manipulative as you are?"

Her voice escalated with each statement, and she instructed the driver to stop the car.

Once the vehicle halted, she exited, turned back to Caiden and Katrina, and declared, "The Bennett family has promised me a bride price of fifty million dollars. You need to provide an equivalent amount for my dowry."

With a forceful slam of the car door, Joyce stormed away.

Caiden remained seated, stunned, staring at Katrina. "What sort of attitude is that? Joyce has changed completely. What happened to the obedient, thoughtful daughter we once knew?"

Katrina let out a deep sigh.

The dynamics within the Harper family had once been peaceful, yet now as Joyce was about to integrate into another family, her allegiances were evidently changing.

Joyce had harbored resentment towards her ever since she had spoken unfavorably about Alexander. Joyce had seemingly forgotten that she, her mother, was the very person who brought her into the world and would never intend harm.

Overwhelmed by the flattery at dinner and her existing grievances, Joyce's allegiance had firmly shifted towards the Bennett family.

"What should wve do now?" Katrina inquired, a look of despair on her face.

Caiden, lighting a cigarette, felt the burden of financial woes heavy upon him, reminiscent of the days before he met Brylee.

After a pause, Katrina suggested, "Perhaps we should speak with Daniela. She remains a member of the Harper family, and as Joyce's stepsister, it wouldn't be proper for Joyce to marry without some support from her."

Looking into Katrina's eyes, Caiden retorted, "Daniela? Do you think she'd accept such a simple explanation,given her astuteness?"

Frustration colored Katrina's eyes as she spoke. "What do you suggest then? Should we allow the dowry issue to push Joyce further away?"

Katrina was aware that Harper Group had lost its value. Selling it would mean depleting their savings.

Furthermore, if they transferred Harper Group to Joyce and Daniela eventually exited, Joyce would undoubtedly find herself swamped with debts-an outcome Katrina dreaded.

Katrina always wanted what was best for her daughter, but Joyce was blind to this.

Her affections had completely shifted to the Bennett family, leaving Katrina feeling both exhausted and heartbroken.

The situation seemed insurmountable.

Caiden had not cultivated strong or reliable connections in his professional circle over the years. The prospect of him seeking financial assistance as Joyce's wedding neared could lead to public disgrace.Rumors might spread, potentially causing the Bennett family to reconsider the marriage.

Upon reflection, Caiden understood that Daniela was his only option.
As they approached the villa, their car detoured to Elite Lux.

En route, they stopped at a pastry shop where Caiden stepped out to purchase some snacks.

Daniela was engrossed in her work. The smart robot sector was thriving, and her latest models were so sought after that they could barely meet the demand. Despite the chaos, she remained focused,meticulously inspecting the production materials.

Her office was a hive of activity. Design plans littered her large desk, and the design team filled the room.Noticing Daniela's workload, Cedric had sent additional designers from Phillips Group to assist.

When Caiden pushed the door open, all eyes in the room turned to him.

He was taken aback. It was past 11 p.m., yet Daniela and her team were still diligently working.

The secretary, clearly overwhelmed, hurried over. Recently, it had become common for people to enter without knocking, and now it was Daniela's father's turn, which meant she couldn't just turn him away.

Daniela dismissed her secretary with a brief look and addressed Caiden. "I'm currently too busy to talk."

Katrina chuckled and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. "That's alright; we'll wait."

She figured that despite Daniela's apparent busyness, it was getting late, and they wouldn't be kept waiting much longer.

Nevertheless, they settled into the chairs by the door.

But the wait wasn't brief.

Hours ticked by.

Now,past 2 a.m., Katrina and Caiden found themselves fighting to keep their eyes open, overwhelmed by fatigue.

While Daniela and her team delved into complex discussions sprinkled with technical terms that flew over both Katrina's and Caiden's heads, the term"smart robots" stood out as a comprehensible snippet.

A plan began forming in Katrina's mind. She leaned in close to Caiden and murmured, "Dear, have you heard? The smart robot sector is yielding huge profits. Daniela has poured billions into it, unlike the languishing Harper Group. Handing it over to Joyce won't really benefit her at all. Perhaps we should consider..."

Her voice faded, yet Caiden grasped her drift instantly.

Considering the minimal value of Harper Group compared to Daniela's thriving robot venture, why not suggest that Daniela allocate shares of her robot company to Joyce?

They could present it as a lavish wedding gift. Joyce would reap financial benefits without any effort on her part.

Why cling to the fading prospects of Harper Group when they could claim a stake in a much more lucrative venture?④

Katrina observed the room brimming with designers and engineers, her instincts affirming that this sector was the technological wave of the future. She covertly signaled a figure to Caiden with her fingers.

Caiden's eyes widened. "Really, that much?"

With a mischievous grin, Katrina whispered,"Oh, you're so naive. We'll allocate a portion to Joyce as her dowry, and we can set aside the rest for our golden years. We can propose swapping Harper Group for a stake in Daniela's robot company. After all, isn't that her mother's legacy? How could she possibly reject that offer?"

Caiden gazed at Katrina, her shrewd gaze holding his silence for an extended period before he finally nodded in agreement. "We should go ahead with your plan."
###Chapter 220 Show Some Support


As the first light of dawn spilled into the room, Daniela and her team capped off their marathon session.

Throughout the night, she had barely acknowledged Caiden and Katrina's presence.

When she finally turned to them, she was taken aback to find them not only still there but also surprisingly chipper.For their age, their vigor seemed to outshine even the younger team members. Their eyes, alive with excitement, were fixed on her.

Daniela blinked in disbelief.

The office slowly emptied, leaving the trio in a quiet hush.

Caiden was the first to break the silence, setting a breakfast on Daniela's desk with a flourish of faux affection. "Dear, you must be famished. Eat something."②

Daniela eyed the food container, recognizing it instantly as Josie's.

She sneered.

How cunning-using someone else's gesture to play the doting father.

Yet, her stomach rumbled. After a quick freshening up in the restroom, she returned and opened the container.

At that moment, Cedric reappeared, bearing side dishes to complement her meal. He arranged them meticulously on the desk.

As she began to eat, Cedric took a seat next to her, his demeanor grave and commanding.

Caiden, clearly unsettled by Cedric's imposing aura, paused briefly before attempting a smile. "Cedric,have you eaten yet?"

Cedric's reply was icy, his stare piercing as he responded, "I'm not hungry." His implication was unmistakable-his distaste for the duo was enough to spoil his appetite.

Caiden's smile wavered, and he stiffened.

"Daniela-"

Cedric interrupted him sharpoly. "Let her eat first!"

Caiden and Katrina recoiled, nodding hurriedly. "Right, right! Eating comes first. We'll wait."

It had been ages since Caiden had shown any paternal concern for Daniela.

His sudden display of warmth only underscored how forced and unnatural it felt.

Daniela, for her part, seemed unaffected.

She continued her meal while Cedric's glare turned even frostier, fixed intently on Caiden and Katrina.

Cedric now embraced his role more boldly.

Previously, as just a friend, he had treaded lightly around Daniela's personal issues, even his past confrontation with Alexander had been a cautious move.

But now, he was more than a friend; he was her suitor-her guardian, her knight. He embraced his duty to protect her without hesitation.

Under Cedric's watchful, authoritative gaze, Caiden and Katrina squirmed like schoolchildren caught in a misdeed.

Daniela remained poised,her cool composure unshaken by the unnecessary drama.

After finishing her breakfast, she closed the lid of the container.

The weariness of the all-nighter began to settle in.

With little emotion, she inquired, "You've been here all night. What do you want?"

Katrina shot Caiden a meaningful glance, urging him forward. He plastered on a smile, though it lacked sincerity. "It's nothing major. I just realized I've never really looked around your office before. And I must admit, it's quite the sight. The layout, the space, and that view-standing at those floor-to-ceiling windows,it feels like Olisvine is at your feet."

As he spoke, Kátrina's nods were overly enthusiastic, her smile painfully forced.

Daniela was unimpressed. "The last time you visited, you were too preoccupied with lecturing me and fishing for favors for Joyce.How could you have noticed the view?"

Caiden's smile froze. He laughed awkwardly after a tense pause."Ah,you always had a sharp wit, dear."

Daniela rubbed her eyes, clearly growing weary of the charade."If you have something to say, say it. I have a meeting this morning."

Caiden sighed inwardly, a stark reminde of the demands of wealth-nights rolled into mornings of relentless work. He could never live like that. He preferred a leisurely morning in the garden, basking in the sunshine.

"Daniela, it's about Joyce-she's getting married soon. You're aware of that, right?" Katrina cut in, unable to contain her impatience any longer.

Daniela nodded slightly. "I'm aware."

"Since you're her sister, don't you think a small contribution to her wedding would be appropriate? Just as a gesture?" Katrina suggested, her smile straining.

Daniela saw right through them. They were here for money.

She understood the financial dynamics of Harper Group better than anyone. Since taking the helm, she had overhauled the company,sidelining Caiden completely.

"Joyce isn't my sister. I was my mother's only child," Daniela stated flatly.

Caiden's expression darkened, and he looked as though he might explode, but he caught himself as his gaze met Cedric's casual yet alert posture, a fruit knife casually in hand.

Swallowing his rage, Caiden forced a smile."Daniela, Joyce is your stepsister. Now that she's entering a new ###Chapter, isn't it worth showing a little support, even symbolically?"
###Chapter 221 You Can't Destroy Joyce's Marriage
Daniela nodded. A gift was customary, even for an acquaintance. Even if it was one of her employees getting married, she would send a gift.


Caiden caught her gesture and quickly shared a satisfied glance with Katrina. "So, Daniela, have you thought about what you'd like to give?"


Daniela's lips curled into a subtle smile."What would you suggest as a fitting gift?"


Even $1, 000 felt more than generous in her mind.


Katrina let out a practiced chuckle. "Oh, Daniela you're heading Elite Lux now. Of course,you'd want to maintain a certain standard, but don't worry-we wouldn't dream of asking for too much. Just a small token,something modest."


Daniela's smile widened, though it carried a sharp  hint of mockery. "Katrina, you have quite the knack for dressing up your true intentions with polished words."



Katrina's expression hardened instantly. Had she not come here asking for money from Daniela, her temper would have flared without hesitation.


Daniela, however, seemed uncharacteristically tolerant today. Normally, she would have ended this conversation by now.


Instead, she leaned back slightly, her faint smile suggesting she was watching a cheap performance put on by a pair of desperate clowns.



"Daniela," Caiden finally said, his tone losing its usual warmth. "Here's the thing. Joyce is getting married,and as her stepsister, you shouldn't be to0tightfisted. We're not asking for a lot, just $20million. What do you say?"



He barely finished before Cedric's eyes turned cold,a sharp glint of danger flickering in them. Caiden caught the change in Cedric's demeanor and gulped audibly. Hastily, he added, "If $20 million seems excessive, maybe a small percentage of shares in your robotics company instead? Surely that wouldn't be asking for too much, right?"


Daniela looked at them both. "Are you even aware of the current valuation of the robotics company?"


Caiden faltered, his lips tightening briefly. He knew the answer,of course.



Daniela had invested hundreds of millions into the company-a fact widely recognized within the industry. Her bold, ambitious investments had earned her a reputation for taking calculated risks that few others would dare.



The company's profitability was no secret either;even in its early stages, it had made significant waves in the market. Experts were already speculating that Daniela's robotics venture could cement her position as the wealthiest individual in the world for decades, if not an entire century. This was exactly the prize Caiden had been eyeing all along.


But, of course, he couldn't let that show. He needed to keep up the act of being an uninformed, innocent parent.


Putting on a naive smile, he replied, "Oh, I wouldn't know. I've heard the robotics field is a challenging one, with massive investments and minimal returns.That's why we felt it was reasonable to ask for just a small share for Joyce. It wouldn't hurt you much, and it would certainly earn you plenty of admiration for your generosity. Don't you think that sounds fair?"


His smile grew wider, the creases on his face becoming more pronounced as he worked to seem completely harmless.


Daniela sat in silence, observing him. The sunlight poured into her bright, spacious office, illuminating everything except the man before her. Try as she might, she couldn't recall a single instance when Caiden had treated her with genuine kindness. Whatever fleeting image she had once clung to of him as a loving father had long since disintegrated-just like Brylee's once-beautiful face, now erased by the unforgiving passage of time.
A faint trace of sadness surfaced in Daniela's heart,but it was swiftly devoured by a wave of disgust.
Caiden had lingered in her office the entire night,fully aware of the true worth of the robotics company. Yet, he had the audacity to demand shares -for Joyce.
"If you won't part with shares, then just hand over $20 million," Katrina chimed in without hesitation.
Daniela laughed then, a genuine sound laced with biting mockery. "Oh, so this is a multiple-choice test now? What happens if I gve you nothing? What leverage do you think you have over me? You strolled in here, brazenly demanding money. If people heard about this little extortion attempt, what do you think they'd say about you? Do you honestly believe you can take anything from me just by holding out your hands?" Katrina's face flushed red with anger. She opened her mouth to retort, but Daniela was quicker. "And one more thing. Does the Bennett family know you're broke? That you came groveling to me like beggars?Alexander and his family don't care about Joyce.What they're after is what they think Elite Lux can offer Harper Group. That's the only reason they agreed to this farce of a marriage. If I were to inform the Bennett family that I have no plans to support Harper Group, do you think Alexander would still go through with marrying Joyce?"



Her words landed like a bolt of lightning.


Katrina started to tremble, her body shaking with a mix of fear and fury.


She stared at Daniela, finally recognizing that the woman before her was no longer the meek little girl she had once manipulated with ease.


That once-shy girl had transformed into a queen-crowned and commanding her power with unwavering authority. "Daniela! You can't destroy Joyce's marriage!"Katrina's expression was a far cry from the smugness she'd shown when she first learned Joyce had sabotaged Daniela's wedding with fire. Now, she looked completely defeated.
###Chapter 222 Complete Strangers Now
Daniela felt a quiet sense of satisfaction as she offered a faint smile. "Oh, really? I wasn't planning to get involved, but since you kept pushing, what else did you expect from me?"


Caiden's complexion turned ashen. "Do you even care about your family? It's just a small portion of shares! Joyce won't have anything to do with managing the company, so it won't affect you. And yet,you still refuse?"


Daniela tilted her head slightly, her voice steady."That's correct."


Caiden was momentarily speechless. He didn't want to drag the conversation on, but the idea of Joyce getting married without any support or assets from her family seemed unthinkable. He could already picture Katrina's fury once they returned home.



Caiden was completely out of options-Daniela was his final hope.


Never in his life had he imagined that, after all these years,it would come down to her.


Slowly, his expression began to soften. "Daniela,whether you admit it or not, I'm still your father."


Daniela's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Oh, is that supposed to guilt-trip me? Let me remind you-l lost my mother when I was five, and at the same time, I may as well have lost a father. I feel nothing for you."


Caiden gave a tired nod. "What about your mother,then? What about the love between your mother and me? How do you justify ignoring that?"


Cedric, attuned to Daniela's slightest changes,noticed a subtle shift in her demeanor. He turned to look at her. She still seemed calm on the surface, but something in her eyes struck him-a deep,almost undetectable hatred that sent a chill through him.


"Daniela, I wouldn't bring this up if I weren't truly at the end of my rope today," Caiden started, his tone carrying an unusual weight of sincerity. "I know you've always held me responsible, believing me to be cold and heartless, but | want you to know-l genuinely loved your mother. She had many suitors,but she chose me because I treated her with care and respect. When her company was gearing up to go public, she pushed herself relentlessly, and I was there,staying up with her night after night. I didn't let the servants take over the household chores-not because they couldn't, but because I didn't trust them to do it right. When she was pregnant with you,I read every book on prenatal care. By the time you were born prematurely, even the nurses admitted was more knowledgeable than they were. You were both in fragile health, and it was me who nursed you both back to strength, step by step. I gave it everything I had."



Caiden's voice trembled with emotion as tears streamed freely down his face. Daniela remained seated, her expression a perfect mask, hiding any trace of her thoughts.
Caiden continued, "From the time you were one until five, I was the one who made sure the water you drank at school was just right. When your mother's skin became sensitive with the changing seasons,l was the one who cared for it. And every time she came home late from those social events, I was always there at the door, waiting for her, day in and day out. Daniela, I've worked hard, truly hard."

Katrina listened, her face showing a mix of emotions.She'd never been on the receiving end of such intense attention.

Daniela, however, remained stone-faced. Slowly,she rose from her seat and told her secretary, "Please show them out."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and made her way to the door. Caiden quickly stood up, knowing these words might not always get the result he hoped for.


He was aware that Daniela wouldn't soften towards him, but perhaps there was still a chance for Brylee's sake.



Brylee represented the one thing in Daniela's heart that could still be touched-an irreplaceable softness.



"Daniela, please! If not for me, then for the years l spent caring for your mother-help me out of this mess. Just five percent of the robotics company shares, that's all | ask!"


But Daniela didn't stop. As she continued walking away, a sudden loud sound echoed behind her.


She paused and turned around, her eyes landing on Caiden, who was kneeling in the middle of the office.Tears of regret streamed down his face as he pleaded, "Daniela, this is my apology to your mother.I failed her. I cared for you, I held you close. Now,I beg you. Please have mercy!" Caiden's voice rang through the empty office, heavy with regret.


Daniela's gaze fell on Caiden, her eyes distant as if she were looking past him to the version of him she had known before she turned five.


Her face remained icy as she spoke with finality. "I'll give Joyce the shares, but now on, you will never speak of my mother again-not a single word."


Caiden was frozen for a moment, taken aback by her words. After a long pause, he finally muttered,"Alright."


He understood that by offering the shares, Daniela was cutting all ties between him and Brylee for good.


It was just like when Daniela allowed Joyce to join Elite Lux-it would cost him their father-daughter relationship.


From that moment on, Daniela never referred to him as her father again.


For her, once a decision was made, there was no space for regret. It was final-no further entanglements, no second chances.


In the past, out of respect for Brylee, Daniela had stil offered him a shred of kindness.



But after today, they would be nothing more than strangers.


Caiden clenched his fists, a bitter ache settling in his chest.


The legal team from Elite Lux worked efficiently,soon bringing in the contract for him to sign.


Before Caiden could sign, the lawyer asked, "Mr.Harper, are you sure about this? Once you sign, it's final."



Caiden hesitated for a moment, his mind racing.


Katrina, standing by his side, urged impatiently, "Sign it! Five percent of the robotics company shares-that's a fortune for us!"
###Chapter 223 Joyce's Wedding





Katrina's greed was evident in every line of her face.


She urged Caiden on relentlessly, her face contorting into something unsettling, her desperation tearing away any trace of composure or dignity.


Caiden stared blankly at the woman before him,lost in deep thought.


The lawyer remained by the side, showing no urgency to push them along.


Caiden lingered in hesitation, his mind clouded with doubt. After a prolonged pause, he spoke to Katrina."Maybe we should..."


"What?" Katrina barked, her eyes flashing with venom as she glared at him. "What do you mean,maybe? Why the hesitation now? What's there to think about? Don't tell me you still have feelings for Brylee! Remember, Caiden-Joyce and I are all you have now!"



Her words lashed at him like a whip, leaving Caiden to press his lips together tightly in silence.


Before he could even react, Katrina grabbed his hand and signed the contract herself.



Caiden gazed at the document, his signature glaring back at him. After a long pause, he exhaled a heavy sigh.



Daniela headed straight for her bed, totally exhausted.



Cedric was troubled. He stood vigilantly outside her door, watching over her. It wasn't long before Ryan and Lillian joined him, both clearly agitated.



Lillian seethed with fury. "Caiden's a bastard! He knows exactly how to exploit Daniela's weaknesses,and he does it every time. He's despicable!"


Ryan's eyes were icy, his face dark and filled with barely contained anger. Cedric, overwhelmed by his frustration, reached into Ryan's pocket and pulled out a cigarette. He didn't bother lighting it; instead, he just held it between his fingers, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn't seem to quiet.



He was completely fed up with the people who kept draining Daniela.



He knew that if she didn't have someone solidly backing her, these leeches would just keep coming back, trying to take everything they could from her.


Lillian sighed. "This is Daniela's family issue, and it's not our place to interfere. But if it were Alexander, I'd have smashed his head by now! Honestly, if Daniela had a real family to rely on, none of this would even be happening."


She said it casually, without thinking much of it.


But then Cedric suddenly turned to face her.


"What?" Lillian blinked, momentarily confused. Then it dawned on her. Ryan straightened, finally understanding the direction this conversation was taking.



Lillian's face brightened. "That's it! Cedric, you should marry Daniela! I know it might sound a bit bold, but your family's not complicated-it's just you and your grandmother, right? No messy relatives or hidden agendas. And if you marry Daniela, you'd have the right to handle all of Caiden's issues. As her husband, everything would be above board!"



The word "husband" rang in Cedric's mind, and his expression softened.①


Husband...


Daniela's husband?



Ryan and Lillian both watched him expectantly,waiting for his answer. After a pause, Cedric spoke seriously. "I'll do my best. I'll work hard to marry her as soon as I can."


Yet, as the words left his lips, he knew this wasn't something he could rush. He didn't want to handle something so crucial with haste or carelessness.



To Cedric, every moment of their relationship mattered. The small, quiet moments where trust grew, the gradual deepening of their feelings, the meeting of families, and eventually, marriage.



It was a journey he was determined to take with care and purpose.



Daniela deserved far more than a rushed decision made out of convenience or external pressure.



She was exceptional. She deserved nothing but the best, and Cedric was committed to making sure she got exactly that.


"5% of the robotics company's shares?" Joyce's face lit up in excitement as she looked at the contract. Unable to hold back, she wrapped her arms around Caiden, kissed his cheek, and laughed. "I can't believe Daniela was so generous this time. Dad,what did you do to change her mind?"


Caiden remained silent. He couldn't bring himself to admit what had truly happened.


The deal was sealed, and Katrina couldn't hide her joy. She patted Joyce's hand, saying, "Sweetheart,your father put in so much effort. He begged Daniela for ages. They've had a complete fallout over this.From now on, your father has no one but you."



Her words held a subtle double meaning, directed at both Caiden and Joyce.



But Joyce missed the implication. She simply nodded, flashing a bright, carefree smile. Gripping the share contract tightly, she skipped off to find Alexander.



Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief when he saw the contract. For a moment, he even questioned if it was real. "Daniela gave you 5% of the shares? Just like that?"



While 5% might not sound like a lot, given the market value of the robotics company, it was worth well over a hundred million dollars. And Daniela had just given it to Joyce?


"What's so odd about it?" Joyce responded, her tone casual but with a touch of arrogance. "No matter what problems Daniela has with the Harper family,she's still Dad's daughter. I'm getting married; is it really so wrong for her to give me a little something?"



Alexander frowned. This wasn't just a little gift. Deep down, he couldn't believe Daniela would part with something so valuable without a deeper reason.


If Daniela still had any vulnerability regarding the Harper family, there was only one possibility-Brylee.



The very thought unsettled him. The idea that they might be exploiting a deceased woman's memory,squeezing out the last of her legacy's worth, was revolting.


Richard, however, was unfazed. "Didn't Joyce say it herself? They're family. Stop overthinking this."


As the wedding day arrived, Alexander's doubts lingered in his mind. The five percent shares filled Joyce with a newfound sense of assurance. At the wedding, she radiated pride. Her smile was wide and beaming as she referred to Daniela as her "sister" whenever she could, her voice soft and warm, as though their bond had always been flawless.


But as the ceremony unfolded, Daniela's absence became more and more noticeable.



Joyce's enthusiasm slowly faded into worry. She pulled Caiden aside, her voice laced with concern."Dad, did you invite Daniela to my wedding?"


Caiden couldn't bring himself to confess that he had knelt and begged Daniela for the shares or that Lillian had discarded the wedding invitation.


Instead, he mustered a faint smile and answered,"She's probably tied up with something.Maybe she'll show up later."


Despite everything, Caiden held on to a sliver of hope. He told himself Daniela couldn't possibly be that harsh-she wouldn't sever their bond entirely. But as the ceremony drew to a close, Daniela's absence remained constant.
###Chapter 224 A Complete Joke





Weddings in high society were often seen as more than just celebrations. They were opportunities to make valuable connections. Joyce's wedding was no different. The grand hall was filled with influential figures from Olisvine's business circles, all eagerly awaiting the arrival of Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux.



Guests craned their necks, glancing towards the entrance in anticipation. But as the wedding drew to a close, Daniela was still nowhere to be found.


Whispers of discontent began to circulate among the guests. Finally, one man approached Caiden, his tone sharp. "Ms. Harper isn't coming, is she? You promised she would be here."


The wedding had attracted all the big players from Olisvine's business world. Even a hardware mogul,still recovering from a broken leg, had managed to hobble in with an extravagant gift.But why? They had come for Daniela. Not for Caiden.Not for Alexander.


Caiden was fully aware of this. Yet, to help Alexander build connections, he had shamelessly used Daniela's name to attract the guests.


With a forced smile, Caiden responded, "Of course,she'll be here. Daniela is always so dedicated to her work that she's probably caught up with something.In the meantime, if there's anything you need to discuss, you can always talk to Alexander. It's pretty much the same thing."


He motioned for Alexander to come over. The young man approached with a wine glass in hand. Caiden gestured toward the guest and introduced him."Alexander, this is one of the top export distributors in the country."


Alexander offered a polite smile and raised his glass in greeting. But the guest's expression instantly hardened.



The guest refused to clink glasses with Alexander,cutting straight to the heart of the matter. "Mr.Harper,this is unacceptable. Using your daughter's wedding to boost your son-in-law's status is one thing,but claiming Daniela would attend when she's not here? That crosses the line."


Another guest, who had been quietly watching from the sidelines, stepped forward. "Exactly. We're not here for the wedding-we came to meet Daniela. The gifts we brought weren't for Joyce; they were investments in forging a connection with Daniela.If this was just any wedding, I would've shown up with a thousand bucks. But instead, I brought a priceless antique. If Daniela doesn't show up, you'd better return it to me."



The murmurs in the crowd grew louder.


"Exactly!" someone chimed in from the gathering crowd. "Isn't this straight-up deception? Everyone knows the Harper family doesn't get along with Daniela. Before I came, I asked multiple times if she'd be here, and you assured me she would. You said she's family and wouldn't miss her sister's wedding. So where is she? Where is Daniela?"



Caiden's face turned red with embarrassment.



He had warned Katrina that this plan was bound to fail.


These were people who couldn't be easily fooled. If Daniela didn't appear, there was no chance they would simply let it go.


But Katrina had brushed off his worries, saying,"They've already brought the gifts. Do you really think they'll take them back?"


Caiden wanted to retort, "Why wouldn't they?" A thousand-dollar gift was one thing,but a priceless antique worth millions was another. Did Katrina think they brought these gifts for Joyce out of generosity?No, they were here for Daniela. Now, realizing that Daniela's bond with them had become so strained that she wouldn't even show up to the wedding,how could they possibly accept this without protest?


Seeing the growing chaos, Katrina rushed over to Caiden, leaning in close. "Call Daniela. Now!" she whispered urgently.



What should have been a joyous celebration was quickly turning into a public spectacle, all due to Katrina's insatiable greed.



Meanwhile, Alexander and his father sat with blank expressions, clearly humiliated. They had never felt so ashamed. The Bennett family's relatives around them kept their heads down, whispering quietly.



"Alexander was meant to be the pride of the Bennett family. How did he end up marrying someone like her?" one of them muttered.



"Who knows? She's nowhere near as impressive as Daniela. Joyce looks like trouble-mark my words,the Bennett family will regret this in the future."


"This is a disgrace. Should we leave now? We're all businesspeople. Imagine the fallout if word gets out that the Bennett family used deceit to collect expensive gifts. Who would trust us then?" The relatives shared looks of agreement before quietly slipoping out through the back door.


Watching this, the Harper family's relatives did the same,quickly leaving the wedding in large numbers.


By the time two-thirds of the event had passed, the majority of both the Harper and Bennett families'relatives had already left. The tables in front of the stage now stood eerily empty.


Caiden hadn't expected things to spiral so badly.Even reporters had arrived to cover the unfolding chaos.



In his panic, he rushed to the hallway, desperate to reach Daniela.



But his calls were met with silence-his number had been blocked. Growing more desperate, he flagged down a passing waiter and borrowed his phone.Dialing again, he held his breath as the phone rang.


After a few rings, the call finally connected. Daniela's voice came through the line, sharp and clear. "Hello?"


For a moment, Caiden couldn't find the words. The silence stretched on until he felt Daniela's growing impatience. He swallowed his hesitation, forcing a stiff "Hello" from his lips.


"What do you want?" Daniela replied, her tone cold and distant.


Caiden finally managed to ask, "Can you come to your sister's wedding?"
###Chapter 225 | Have No Sister





Daniela was sitting at the dinner table, surrounded by a crowd. Without raising her voice or stepping away,she stated coolly, "I have no sister."



Caiden hesitated before replying, "But blood is thicker than-"



"Caiden Harper!" Daniela cut him off, her tone calm and indifferent. She didn't raise her voice, nor did she show any anger, but the mere mention of his name made everyone at her table glance up, their eyes narrowing. "My mother passed away long ago,and I have no one to protect me. Do you think that makes me weak?"



Caiden was struck speechless. After a long pause, he managed to say, "That's not what I meant. But so many people came to the wedding because of you.Your absence is causing a lot of trouble for me." Daniela replied coolly, "I thought I made myself clear the last time you came to see me. But since you seem unable to grasp it, let me be blunt. I don't go looking for trouble, but I am not afraid of it. I have no ties to you anymore. So don't call yourself my 'dad'again-it's revolting. Also, the matters of the Harper family have nothing to do with me. Stop involving me in your mess. You wouldn't like the fallout."



She paused, letting her words sink in before continuing again, "Yes, I have no one to protect me.I've known that for years. But that doesn't make me an easy target. It doesn't matter how many shares I've given her. Taking you or Joyce down would be simple. And if you doubt me, feel free to try. I can make you smile one moment and have you in tears the next."



Her words were sharp, and her gaze emotionless.



There was no anger in her voice, no personal grudge.

This was simply business.



"Caiden, are you willing to try?" she asked. Caiden opened his mouth, struggling to find words."But I'm still your-"


"I see," Daniela said,cutting him off with a slight nod."So you do want to try. Fine. Let's use Joyce's wedding to make an example."


Her words sent a chill of panic through Caiden.


"No!" he blurted out, but the call had already ended.


Caiden stood motionless, staring at the phone in his hand, his face drained of color. Daniela's cold tone echoed in his mind, her words heavier than he could comprehend. He realized, with a sinking heart, that she truly didn't care about him anymore.


Regret ate at him. He regretted asking for that 5%shares of the company.


He regretted bragging to the guests earlier that Daniela would show up.



Katrina sneered, seeing the lifeless expression on his face. "Seriously, Caiden? Is it really that bad? What's the worst she could do? Kill you? Look at you-pale as a ghost. What a joke! When has a daughter ever humiliated her father like this?"



Caiden hardly registered her words. Slowly, he lifted his head, his eyes drifting to the increasing crowd of irate guests, all demanding their gifts in return.


A chill of dread washed over him. His chest constricted as a heavy, sinking sensation settled in his stomach.



Katrina didn't have timne to deal with Caiden. She walked over to the ones asking for their gifts back,standing with her hands on her hips.


"Alright! Anyone who wants their gift back, come over here!" she snapped, her voice oozing with arrogance.



The 5% shares in the robotics company had given her a sense of power, and she looked down at the group with utter disdain. "But let me make one thing crystal clear-if you take your gifts back, don't even think about building any connections with our family ever again! Whether Daniela showed up or not, she's still a Harper. She's a busy woman-we get it. But here you are, causing a scene at Joyce's wedding.Do you think Daniela will forgive you for bullying her sister like this? And you still think you'll make ties with Elite Lux? Dream on!"



Katrina had never been particularly close to Daniela,but she had no hesitation when it came to exploiting Daniela's reputation.


She spoke with such strong confidence that everyone was left stunned into silence.


Seeing their frozen expressions, Katrina allowed a smug smirk to spread across her face.


She never missed an opportunity to press her advantage, even when it was clear she was in the wrong.


Without a hint of shame, she pressed on. "You all really lack foresight. Let's forget Daniela for a moment. Let's talk about Alexander-his name holds weight in Olisvine. And today, on his wedding day you don't think it's worth giving some antique gifts? You all know how rich Daniela is. She's got just one sister-Joyce. You honestly think she'd hold back from her? Daniela cares about Joyce so much, she gave her shares in her robotics company as a wedding gift. If she didn't care, would she do that?"


Katrina shifted her focus to the man leading the group, narrowing her eyes. "Daniela gave those shares because she was concerned Joyce might struggle down the road. My husband and I told her it wasn't needed, but she insisted on doing it anyway.That's how much she cares. But of course, you people have no clue. Fine, if you want your gifts back, come to me. Write down your name and your company's name. Just know this-once you take your gifts, don't ever expect another invite or any chance to work with the Harper family. We won't be dealing with you again."



Katrina's voice was unshakeable, and no one dared to make a move.



The leader of the group stepped forward, a hesitant smile stuck to his face. "No, no, we didn't mean it like that. We came here today to meet Daniela. It's all just a misunderstanding. Nobody actually wants to take anything back. Please, calm down-there's no need to get upset."


Katrina let out a cold snort, but she wasn't about to let it go that easily.


Her intense gaze fixed on the man, and she leaned in just enough to intimidate. "Weren't you the one making the most noise earlier? What's your name,and which company do you represent?"


The man lowered his head and offered an apologetic smile.



Just as the group was about to retreat back to their seats, every phone in the room vibrated with a notification.
###Chapter 226 The Woman You Chose To Marry
As the guests bowed their heads to glance at their smartphones, an ominous chill swept through Caiden, sinking deep into his bones.


An intense sense of foreboding engulfed him,his heartbeat escalating into a wild thump. His hand,previously relaxed at his side, now quivered subtly.


He resisted the urge to look at the notification that had captured everyone's attention. Instead, he remained motionless, anchored to the spot as if fearing the earth might crumble beneath him.


Time seemed to stretch into eternity.


The guests, who had just been maintaining courteous facades, suddenly became statuesque.Their expressions morphed-from stiff cordiality to puzzled concern, then to a piercing realization.  Gradually, they lifted their gazes to meet Caiden and Katrina, their eyes now gleaming with icy contempt.


The warmth of their previous looks had evaporated,replaced by a cocktail of derision, disdain, and a sprinkle of indignation.


Meanwhile, Katrina, blissfully unaware of the unfolding drama, stood poised, ready to wield Daniela's name as a weapon to assert her dominance.


"With all due respect, if your intentions aren't genuine, we see no reason to accept your offerings.Should you choose not to align with the Harper family or Daniela, feel free to retract your gifts and depart."



Her declaration had just echoed in the air when the group's leader smashed his wine glass onto the table. The glass hit with such force that wine cascaded over its edges, the red splashes marring the once immaculate white tablecloth.



Katrina,previously exuding a false sense of bravado  that had now vanished, stood paralyzed. Confronted with genuine opposition, she was utterly bewildered.


"Give them back! Why the hell would anyone want anything to do with the Harper family? They're a goddamn disgrace!"


"Nothing but shameless deceivers!"


"This is beyond appalling! What kind of bad luck drags the Bennett family into dealing with deceitful pieces of shit like this?"


Someone beckoned to Alexander, questioning, "Were you aware of this whole gift scheme?


Alexander, always a figure of dignity and respect,now found himself drowning in disgrace. As he stood there, encircled by the business elite, he felt like the butt of some cruel joke.



Once the golden boy, revered and admired in every circle, Alexander's world had turned upside down.


He had seen the statement from Elite Lux and was overwhelmed with humiliation. Red-faced and visibly  flustered, he bent forward in a deep bow and announced, "I deeply regret any inconvenience caused today. Daniela will not be able to join us.Please feel free to reclaim any ggifts you've brought."He lowered himself into a second bow.


Katrina's face twisted with annoyance. "Alexander,what the hell are you apologizing for? Isn't Daniela still a Harper? Just because she's absent today doesn't mean she has severed ties with us. There's no need for you to apologize."



The instant Katrina finished, the guests erupted in a cacophony of laughter.


At that exact moment, Joyce made her entrance,decked out in her wedding dress, radiating an unmistakable arrogance.



Now flush with cash, she regarded everyone around her with thinly veiled contempt.


Alexander sent her a desperate look, silently begging her to defuse the escalating tension. However, Joyce ignored his imploring gaze. With deliberate strides,she approached the table, seized a glass of wine and flung its contents into the face of the man leading the rival faction.


A suffocating silence descended upon the gathering.Every guest at the wedding banquet froze, utterly shocked by the audacity of her actions.


A tremor ran through Richard's hands as his fury boiled over.



A storm of thoughts surged through his head, all landing on the same brutal question: what kind of shitty luck led Alexander to marry this absolute moron?



The man at the receiving end of Joyce's wrath was no ordinary guest; he was a longstanding client and ally of the Bennett family. He had come earlier that day in a spirit of goodwill, hoping to help mediate the brewing conflict.


Joyce didn't even bother to think. She marched over and dumped the wine on him without a second thought, her fury dripping alongside the red liquid. The wine wasn't the only thing she threw-it was the trust and unity built over ten years between their families.


"What the hell, Joyce? Have you lost your mind?"Alexander's voice trembled with shock, his hands clenched at his sides. It took him a moment to recover before he snatched a handful of napkins and hurried over to the man drenched in wine, offering profuse apologies.


Meanwhile, Joyce remained poised, her arms crossed defiantly, radiating an air of indomitable pride.


Supported by the formidable alliance of Elite Lux and Daniela, along with the vast empire of robotics, her confidence soared.



With Harper Group's endorsement and her marriage to Alexander, she felt an unprecedented surge of empowerment.


To her, what was a mere glass of wine in the grand scheme of her backing?  Who would dare challenge her or cross paths with Daniela?


The shares Daniela had entrusted her with weren't just investments; they symbolized Daniela's lingering commitment to the Harper family. This connection was Joyce's leverage-she knew as long as it existed, Daniela could not sever ties without consequence.



Joyce was convinced she could exploit this to the fullest, for obsessions often revealed vulnerabilities.


Her blatant arrogance incited a wave of disgust among the onlookers.


"Alexander, this is the woman you've chosen as your wife?" the drenched man retorted sharply, his voice laced with disbelief and disdain. He scrubbed his face and shirt vigorously with a napkin, but the deep red wine had already permeated the fabric of his pristine white shirt, staining it irreversibly and leaving it wrinkled and spoiled.


In a fit of irritation, he flung the napkin to the ground  and fixed a harsh glare on Alexander. "I've always held the Bennett family in high regard for their honor,which is the sole reason I've kept you as my business partners all these years. But today, I see my trust was misplaced. If you can welcome someone like her into your family, then clearly, I've misjudged you all. We are done with our partnership, effective immediately!"



With that declaration, he stormed away, his anger palpable in every step.



Richard and Alexander remained motionless,stunned by the turn of events.


Around them, the other guests shuffled toward the reception desk, intent on retrieving their gifts.


Katrina, who earlier had strutted around with a veneer of bravado, stood slack-jawed. The sight of the guests reclaiming their gifts had blindsided her.


A wave of panic washed over her. She had been desperate to escape the clutches of poverty and had pinned all her hopes on profiting from this wedding. She abandoned all sense of decorum and dashed toward the gift table like someone possessed,frantically seizing the most lavish gifts.


Her once immaculately styled hair cascaded into chaos as she struggled to grip the wrapped treasures. Her cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson from panic and frustration. "Are you actually reclaiming your gifts? Have you all forgotten about Daniela?"



"What the fuck does Daniela have to do with this?She's already put everything out there for the world to see. Stop being a dumbass and check it for yourself!"



Before Katrina could muster a reply, a hand snatched a gift box right from hergrasp.


The other guests followed suit, reclaiming their offerings. With each gift retrieved, another guest departed.



Within moments, the once-bustling wedding banquet hall was deserted, leaving behind nothing but a chilling silence.
###Chapter 227 The Weight Of Her Words
The waiter stood frozen, the tray of wine still in his hands. It took him a moment to process what was happening, but when he did, he wasted no time in snapping a photo of the stunned Harper and Bennett families before uploading it online.


Katrina's flawless hairstyle had completely unraveled, with strands of hair falling messily around her face. She stared, wide-eyed, at the disaster unfolding before her, before turning to Caiden.


A chill ran down Caiden's spine as he pulled his phone from his pocket, his fingers shaking uncontrollaboly.


Joyce stood there with her arms crossed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Huh! Who cares if they leave?Let them go! Do we really need their money? Right,darling?" She copied Katrina's flirtatious tone, raising her voice on purpose and leaning against Alexander's arm.


Richard, witnessing the absurdity of it all, nearly choked on his anger.


Was this woman out of her mind? Flirting with her husband in the middle of all this chaos-and in front of everyone?



His stomach dropped with the ominous feeling that this woman would bring about the downfall of the entire Bennett family.



Katrina was devastated over the expensive gifts they had lost, not taking any responsibility for her own actions, but instead grumbling, "These people are so ungrateful. They can't even recognize a golden opportunity when they see it.They'll regret this!"


Caiden was about to say something, but before he could get a word out, Alexander lost his patience."Enough!" he shouted.


A tense silence filled the hall. Joyce blinked in confusion. "What's with all the yelling? Why are you so angry?"


"Why am I angry?" Alexander's gaze blazed with fury as he fixed her with a heated stare. On their very first day of marriage, regret had already begun to settle in. "I'm angry because your family lied to me!"



Joyce stiffened.


Katrina's face drained of color, as if something suddenly clicked in her mind.


Alexander gave a cold, humorless laugh, his piercing gaze shifting from Caiden to Katrina before locking onto Joyce. "You told me you had fixed things with Daniela. You said she'd always be part of the Harper family. You promised that after this marriage, Daniela would back Bennett Group without hesitation. Those were your exact words, right? And today, you used her name at this wedding, parading her reputation to trick people into coming and giving away their expensive gifts."


Katrina opened her mouth, desperate to find an excuse, but no words escaped her lips.


Alexander wasn't done. "Just a few days ago, you told me that Daniela felt guilty for neglecting Joyce and willingly transferred company shares to her as some kind of compensation. Isn't that what you said?"



Katrina recoiled, stammering, "But Daniela really did transfer the shares to us..."



"Really?" Alexander's eyes burned with fury. He grabbed his phone and hurled it at Joyce's face."Daniela just made a statement online. She said she has no connection to the Harper family. She never promised to come to this wedding, and in her eyes,Caiden isn't her father, and Joyce isn't her sister. She even said she'd take legal action against anyone spreading lies about her."



Katrina froze, completely taken aback. Her hands shook as she bent down to pick up the phone,her eyes quickly scanning the statement.


Alexander was seething. The shame of being so thoroughly deceived gnawed at him, threatening to consume him. He felt humiliated, his pride crushed by the lies that had been fed to him.


Joyce, still utterly unaware of what was unfolding,furrowed her brow in confusion. "But Daniela really did transfer the shares to me."


Hearing the mention of the shares only intensified Alexander's contempt. "Oh, she gave you the shares,but why? Why would Daniela hand over something as valuable as that? Tell me, Joyce, what do you think her real reason is?"



Caiden stood there in complete silence, his hands balling into fists at his sides.


Joyce, clearly confused, shook her head. "What are you even talking about, Alexander? We just got married today, and you're talking to my dad like this?The shares are in my hands now, so how we got them doesn't really matter, right?"


"Oh, it doesn't matter, huh?" Alexander's voice grew louder, his frustration boiling over. He let out a harsh, mocking laugh. "Take a good look, Joyce! Do you even have the slightest clue how those shares ended up in your hands? Caiden actually kneeled to Daniela just to get them. Do you have any idea how humiliating that is? Caiden begging his daughter for money? That's a new level of disgrace!"


Caiden remained frozen, his body stiff with embarrassment. Alexander's words shattered whatever dignity he had left, laying his shame bare for everyone to witness.


Throughout his life, he had depended on others, bout nothing had ever felt as humiliating as this.


He couldn't even lift his head, too ashamed to face anyone.


His thoughts raced back to the cruel comments he'd read online just moments before-each one digging into him deeper.


"Caiden has earned the title of Olisvine's number one shameless freeloader. This man would kneel and let people trample over him just for cash." "A father kneeling before his daughter? That's disgusting. If I had a dad like this, I'd rather not live.Poor Daniela!"



"Brylee and Daniela really got the worst of it, getting stuck with someone as shameless as Caiden. What a tragedy."


"How is someone like Caiden still walking around?People like him shouldn't even be a thing."


"Caiden's lack of shame is honestly unbelievable.And I heard Joyce's wedding today was just a scheme to take advantage of others using Daniela's name.What a revolting family."


The words replayed in his mind like an unrelenting echo.



Standing there, Caiden felt as though an invisible crowd surrounded him. He could almost feel their fingers poking at his forehead, pointing, and mocking him with laughter.


His fists tightened so hard that his nails dug into his  palms.


He wasn't wrong! He couldn't be wrong!


People would do anything for money. That was the reality of the world.


These people were just envious that he had Daniela as his daughter.


But was she even still his daughter?


Caiden recalled the official statement Daniela had posted earlier on the Elite Lux website.


"I hereby sever all ties with Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce. As Caiden desired, I have given him 5% of the shares in my robotics company. I hope they will stop exploiting my name. As for Joyce's wedding, I never promised to attend. If they continues to claim I'm still part of them, I will take legal action to protect myself."


Below that, an additional note read, "One more thing.I'd like to ask Caiden a question. You knelt in my office, yet now you act as if that never happened? Have some dignity, will you? Also, I've attached a video for everyone to enjoy. Consider it my wedding gift to the Bennett family."


Everything was laid bare for the world to witness.


Daniela's words-"Don't mess with me"-burned in his mind. At that time, he had dismissed them,thinking they were just an empty threat. But now,he fully grasped the depth of her warning and the power behind it.
###Chapter 228 I'm Married Now





The atmosphere thickened with tension, becoming almost suffocating.


The wedding host peered around the sparsely populated hall, paused uncertainly, and then whispered tentatively, "Should we go on with the ceremony?"



Richard reached his limit. Rising abruptly, he snatched his coat and bolted out, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.



Alexander surveyed the few stricken faces of the Harper family with a cold, dismissive stare. With a scornful chuckle, he declared, "Well, if it comes to it,we'll just sign the divorce papers right after the ceremony."



He didn't wait for their response before turning on his heel and walking away. Joyce felt a pang of despair as she watched Alexander's back receding. Overcome with urgency,she dashed after him.


In the echoing expanse of the banquet hall, only Caiden and Katrina were left standing.


Shortly after, the hotel manager approached them with a courteous smile, presenting a bill."Would you like to settle this with cash or a card? Also,please note the wine spill earlier has ruined a carpet valued at ten-thousand dollars, which we've added to your total bill. The charge for today's event amounts to four million dollars. Thank you."



The amount struck Caiden like a punch he never saw coming.


He was left with no option but to cobble together the last of the wedding gifts' money. Pleading for any reduction, he barely managed to clear the exorbitant fee.



Clutching at nothing, Caiden stumbled from the hotel,emerging into the clamor of the city street. He stood,momentarily adrift in the ceaseless tide of passersby, his thoughts a chaotic whirl. How had his life unraveled to this point?



Daniela had always been a beacon of kindness-the most compassionate person he knew, always protective and quick to forgive.


Why had it come to this?


Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux, was his own flesh and blood. If he had shown her the slightest kindness,she would never have cast him aside.


After all, he was her only remaining family.


That fact alone should have guaranteed him a life filled with comfort and luxury during his twilight years.


So,what had driven them apart?


What had caused the deep rift between him and Daniela,as well as Brylee?


Why had he let everything fall apart so disastrously? Lost in his regrets, Caiden wandered down the street,oblivious to the chaos around him until the screech of brakes shattered his reverie.


His body was hurled through the air, tumbling, before it slammed down onto the hard asphalt.


Lying there, his vision dimming and pain coursing through his body, a quiet thought fluttered across his mind.



Had he really messed up this badly?


Daniela received a call from the hospital, pressing her to settle some medical expenses.


Upon asking for the patient's name, the person on the other end hesitated, their words faltering without a clear answer.


Realization dawned on Daniela. Without a word, she ended the call and chose not to visit.


At the hospital, Joyce stormed into the room, her expression clouded with anger. "Dad, what's the matter with you? You're not a child anymore! Can't you watch where you're walking? I've just started a new Chapter in my life with my marriage, and here l am, rushing to the hospital because of your carelessness. Are you trying to sabotage my happiness?"


Caiden, upon hearing Joyce's sharp rebuke, felt her words sting more painfully than his physical injuries."Joyce, I kneeled and begged Daniela on your behalf.I pushed myself to the edge for you. I was worn out,and that's why I didn't see the car. And now you dare say that to me?"


Joyce's voice cut through the air, sharp and chilling."So you kneeled before Daniela? Look, you've secured the shares, right? If a single act of submission can bring us that much gain, I'd kneel every single day. Really, you're okay now, so what's the urgency in dragging me here? Dad, I'm a married woman now. You shouldn't keep burdening me with these issues. It's wearing me down. If you can't manage your own medical bills and expect me to pay for them, have you considered how much strain that puts on my relationship with my husband and father- in-law?"


Caiden's gaze locked on her, his expression one of utter shock. "What did you just say?" His voice was feeble,trembling with disbelief.


"Isn't it clear enough? Do you think it's right to keep leaning on your married daughter like this? And don't forget-I'm not even your flesh and blood. If you're in need, you should reach out to Daniela. She's your real daughter. Consider my predicament for once. My husband and father-in-law are already displeased with me, and your demands are only making my life more difficult."



With a few quick taps, Joyce transferred just enough money into his account to settle the hospital bills.She offered no comforting words, no inquiries about his well-being. Without another word, she turned and left the room,leaving Caiden to sink back against his pillow, his figure deflated, motionless as a statue.
###Chapter 229 Lunatic





Katrina saw Caiden's expression clearly, yet she felt no urge to comfort him.


With Joyce now married to Alexander and a substantial fortune in her grasp, Katrina saw no reason for fear.


As she aged, Joyce would care for her.


While Joyce wasn't Caiden's biological daughter,she was undeniably Katrina's daughter.



Katrina knew that Caiden, having cut ties with Daniela, would have to depend on her. She had spent most of her life serving him. Now it was finally her time to enjoy a bit.


"I'll be heading home," Katrina told him, her gaze indifferent. "A caregiver will look after you1. Once you've recovered, you can head home as well." Caiden's eyes widened, filled with disbelief."You're leaving me here by myself?"


Although his condition was manageable, Katrina had never left his side before, even for minor concerns like a blood pressure check.


At that moment, she was walking away, leaving him behind in the hospital.


How could she remain so unaffected by it all?


As Katrina adjusted her hair, a slight smile playing on her lips, she seemed to read his thoughts effortlessly.


"It's no big deal. The doctor expects your recovery in a few days. Why the fuss?"


She turned to leave but paused just as she reached the door.


For a brief moment, Caiden wondered if she had changed her mind.


But Katrina added coldly, "Since you're fine, don't bother Joyce about this. She's lost face before the Bennett family because of you. You have your own daughter. Leave Joyce out of it. And by the way,my mother will take care of Jack since you're unwell."


Caiden froze, his eyes wide in disbelief. "What? But you said your mother was dead!" He grasped his head,his heart racing with the surreal turn of events.


"Did l?" Katrina responded, her voice devoid of emotion. "Well, perhaps she's come back to life."


With those words, she walked out of the room, her steps echoing a carefree rhythm.


Caiden sat motionless in the hospital bed, unable to move or respond for what felt like an eternity.


Was this really the wife he had loved for so many years? The daughter he had pampered for decades?


By the time Katrina got home, Daniela was already there.



She sat relaxed in the living room, eating a plate of fruit that Cedric had prepared for her. She was watching TV with Ryan and Lillian, enjoying a variety show as bursts of laughter rang out occasionally.


"Did you know your father's in the hospital?" Katrina called to Daniela, shutting the door behind her.


Unfazed, Daniela kept her focus on the TV, eating her fruit. Then, she turned to Katrina with a small smile.


"Why are you smiling?" Katrina asked, her voice shaking. She couldn't hide it, she was becoming more and more afraid of Daniela. When Daniela chose to be cruel, it was terrifying.


"Don't bother with your schemes, Katrina," Daniela replied coldly, maintaining her composure. "You know I can ruin Joyce's life quite easily. You wouldn't want that, would you?"


Katrina felt her smile stiffen. "What are you implying?"


"Let me be clear. Joyce's comfort depends on my happiness. She might have the shares in the robotics company, but remember, I have endless means to bankrupt you both. Would you dare challenge me?"


The smile on Daniela's face never faded.



It was a serene smile, but the words she spoke sent a chill through Katrina, freezing her to the core.


"Save your hypocritical talk," Daniela warned. "Try me again, and I'll have you thrown out of this house."


Flushed with a mix of rage and embarrassment,Katrina felt her cheeks burn.



A maid moved to intervene, but Cedric's stern look halted her immediately, and she stepped back,choosing not to provoke him.



"I refuse to engage on your disgraceful level!"Katrina said, storming up the stairs.


Once in her room, she pressed a hand to her chest,her heartbeat racing wildly.


Though she.was reluctant to acknowledge it,Daniela's cold stare earlier had planted a deep,unnerving fear in her. "Daniela, that lunatic! As if I would waste my time talking to her!"
###Chapter 230 He Can Sleep In His Study Forever
When Joyce came to visit her mother the following morning, her posture radiated arrogance.


Alexander, on the other hand, walked in with a grim expression.


The farce at their wedding had thoroughly embarrassed the Bennett family.


Initially, Alexander hadn't intended to accompany Joyce. However, her dramatic outburst, complete with tears, screams, and threats of suicide, had pushed Richard to his limits, prompting him to insist Alexander escort her. Reluctantly, Alexander had complied.


Before their departure, Joyce had raided several valuables from the Bennett family's storeroom.


Richard's expression was a show of displeasure as  he bid them farewell.


Joyce's union with the Bennett family had been anything but beneficial; it had been a catastrophe.Richard's restraint was fueled solely by the hope that future profits from the robotics company might salvage the struggling Bennett Group.


Alexander's mind was far from such financial considerations. He was thoroughly disillusioned with Joyce.


The sweet,compliant woman he had known had become a domineering spouse, embodying every negative trait imaginable.


She scrutinized his every action, demanded access to his personal phone, meddled in his secretary's duties, and dictated his social life.



Merely one day into their marriage, Alexander was filled with regret.


As he reflected on his previous marriage to Daniela,the differences were unbearable. Daniela had respected his independence, loving him quietly for a decade without ever attempting to curb his freedoms.



During the drive, Joyce seemed to pick up on his distant mood. With a taunting smile, she said, "I monitor you because I love you. Alexander, you're lucky to have such a devoted wife. Appreciate what you have."



Alexander's mood remained dark throughout the journey.



Joyce gripped his phone tightly, making the cramped space of the car feel even more oppressive.


He found himself thinking about what life might have been like if he had never divorced Daniela.



Bennett Group wouldn't be in this mess. And if trouble had arisen, Daniela would have handled it,just like she always had in the past. She wouldn't try to use it as a way to gain control over him.



With each passing moment, Alexander's regret  deepened. By the time they reached the Harper family's residences, the pressure seemed unbearable.



Unconsciously, his steps led him towards Daniela.


Joyce's reaction was immediate; her hand gripped Alexander's arm with cold precision. She stared into his eyes, her voice sharp. "Where are you going?"


Alexander's gaze drifted to Daniela, and Joyce's eyes followed.



Daniela, seemingly unaware of their presence, was absorbed in the TV. Beside her, Cedric offered her a slice of orange, which she accepted and ate from his fingers.


"Alexander, let's be clear," Joyce said, her voice slicing through the tension. "Daniela has moved on.You're lucky I'mn still here. You'll have to make do with me."



Her words pierced Alexander, leaving a stinging sensation. Joyce turned away, dismissing him. Cedric stood by Daniela, the contrast between him and Alexander stark and evident. Daniela's choice,should she ever have to make one, seemed clear.


Katrina pulled Joyce aside into her room. "So,how was the first day as a married woman?"


With a flick of her dress, Joyce replied indifferently,"It was disappointing."



Katrina paused, her voice filled with worry. "What do you mean? What went wrong? Was it the bedroom?"Her expression was one of utter disbelief.


Joyce let out a sharp, mocking laugh. "He didn't even touch me."



Katrina's eyes opened wide in surprise. "What?" She hadn't anticipated such a response. "Alexander dislikes you?"


"He never verbalized it, yet the signs were clear,"Joyce said with a chill in her voice. "As soon as we went home, his family avoided me completely.They  accused me of causing a debacle at the wedding,claiming | drove away significant, long-standing clients. Alexander showered and left for the office. It was nearly morning when he returned." As Joyce spoke, her irritation intensified. "All night, I waited.Yet, the moment he arrived, he went straight into the study. In a rage, I shattered everything there.Without my outburst this morning, he wouldn't have bothered returning with me."


Katrina looked at Joyce in utter disbelief. "Your outbursts are excessive, Joyce. Our indulgence has clearly gone too far. You must understand, you're married now. Such behavior is unacceptable!"


Joyce's anger peaked. "Do you believe Ienjoy this?Did you notice Alexander's expression when he glanced at DDaniela? It was filled with regret and longing. He clearly regrets marrying me. He never intended to marry me so soon. Alexander was taking a risk, hoping that Daniela would intervene and put an end to the wedding."


Yet, the pace of events outstripped his expectations. The wedding concluded before Alexander could grasp the situation fully.


Just now, his gaze was fixed on Daniela, unwavering and intent. He seemed to have forgotten he was a married man.



Anger brewed in Joyce, and Katrina's expression was one of deep concern. The gravity of the situation had caught her off guard.


"However, this changes nothing," Joyce said,her voice brimming with assurance. "The Bennett family wouldn't dare cross me. With my control over the robotics shares, they're forced to appease me. And Alexander? He might as well make the study his permanent bedroom."


Descending the stairs, Joyce unexpectedly greeted Daniela before leaving.


Pausing at the doorway, she turned sharply and called out to Alexander, "Come on! Why are you still staring? No matter how much you look, she will never return to you."  Her words sliced through the air, a testament to Joyce's cruel precision in delivering verbal blows.


From the top of the staircase, Katina observed the scene, her brow furrowed. Her eyes caught Daniela's fleeting,mysterious smile.


For reasons she couldn't quite understand, Katrina's heart skipped a beat.


A chilling thought suddenly crossed her mind, one she hadn't considered before, but now couldn't push aside.
###Chapter 231 Daniela's Plan





Katrina wondered if Daniela gave the shares to Joyce because Caiden knelt before her.


Was Daniela really be this soft-hearted?


Katrina knew she would never get the truth from Daniela.



Later that evening, Cedric asked Daniela the same thing.


Once Katrina and the maids had gone to bed, it was just Cedric and Daniela left in the living room.


It was then that he asked, "You had this all planned out, didn't you?"


It wasn't a question, but more of a statement.


Daniela was going over financial reports from one of the branch offices. She shot Cedric a brief look before offering a small smile. "Yes," she confirmed. "You knew Joyce would lose it and reveal her true colors?" Cedric pressed.


Without looking up from the reports, Daniela replied,"Yes. Joyce has always been stubborn and arrogant -she just knew how to mask it. Back when she was chasing after Alexander, she played the part. But now that she has what she wants, along with the shares l gave her, her true nature was bound to surface."


Cedric gave a slight nod. He had already figured that much out. "But that can't be all ofit,right?" he pressed, sensing there was more to the story.


Daniela and Joyce were worlds apart now. There was no reason for Daniela to get involved with Joyce, let alone go through the trouble of scheming. But somehow,she had done exactly that.


"Why, though?" Cedric asked again.


Daniela placed the tablet down carefully, letting out a soft sigh before meeting Cedric's gaze. "Cedric, has anyone ever told you that being too clever can make you less charming?" Normally, Cedric would have laughed at such a remark. But this time, something felt different. He stared into her eyes, repeating his question with unyielding resolve. "Why?" This was the second time he had asked her.


Daniela pursed her lips, pausing for a beat before speaking. "One day, you'll understand, but not right now. I don't want to deceive you, so I'm asking for your trust. Please let me keep this to myself for now.Can you do that?"


Cedric wasn't ready to back down just yet.


He still couldn't grasp the full extent of her reasoning, but he knew it wasn't as simple as it seemed.Whatever had pushed Daniela to come back to this villa and relinquish shares worth a fortune was something significant.


There was no way it had anything to do with Alexander.


Cedric had the distinct feeling he was on the verge of discovering the truth, yet the truth slipped through his fingers, hidden behind a wall he couldn't break through.


His anxiety grew, but he knew better than to interfere with Daniela's carefully laid plans.


"Promise me-no matter what your plan is, no matter what you're trying to achieve, you will never put yourself in danger. Not now, not ever."


Daniela looked him in the eye and nodded."promise."


Afterward, she lowered her gaze, and pretended to focus on her tablet. As soon as Cedric turned away,she absentmindedly touched her nose.


Ryan and Lillian walked in from outside and caught Daniela's subtle gesture. Ryan leaned in towards Lillian and whispered, "Did Daniela lie again?"


Those close to Daniela knew well-whenever she lied,her hand would instinctively reach for her nose.


This habit had been with her since childhood.When she was young, her mother had once jokingly told her that lying would make her nose grow longer.That innocent joke had stuck with her ever since.


Daniela's eyes stayed glued to her tablet, yet her thoughts were miles away from the screen. She didn't take in a single word of the report she was supposedly reviewing.


Joyce believed her priceless shares granted her an untouchable power. As time went on, her arrogance would only grow, testing the patience of the Bennett family and pushing them to their breaking point.


Then, Katrina would step in, attempting to calm the situation with money.


And there would be the inevitable clash between Katrina and Caiden over financial matters.


That would be Daniela's cue to act. She would take Joyce's shares from her. Once that was done, chaos would flood the Harper family.


All Daniela had to do was be patient.


She had to wait for the right time. When the truth was revealed-when the one responsible for her mother's death was finally exposed-Daniela would tear them apart.


This was the strategy she had set in motion, and Cedric didn't need to be part of it.


Under the gentle glow of the living room lights, her eyes drifted to Cedric's handsome face.


Her thoughts inevitably turned to their childhood.It was Cedric who had lifted her from the shadows, and guided her carefully through the murky depths of her depression, step by step. Now, she couldn't bring herself to involve him.


He deserved a life of peace, free from the turmoil she was facing.
###Chapter 232 I'm Not Obligated





Harper Group had been hanging by a thread, flirtíng with ruin for what seemed like forever.


Joyce, having severed all financial aid to Caiden, left him without a cent to his name. Overwhelmed by desperation, he finally let go of his ego and reached out to Cedric for support.


Caiden's initial plan was to reach out to Alexander for assistance. Yet, Katrina shattered this notion with a scathing comment. "Seriously? You can't even take care of your own mess, and now you want to screw up your son-in-law's life too? Are you trying to make Joyce the laughingstock of the Bennett family?"


Feeling crushed and shamed, Caiden reluctantly discarded the idea.


That bitter moment unveiled Katrina's true intentions.Her prior endearments and praises were nothing more than a charade, cleverly orchestrated to  manipulate him and exploit the Harper family's wealth to land Joyce a prosperous match.


Now that she had secured her daughter's future,Katrina's facade of concern dissolved. The once docile and accommodating woman had vanished.


Brewing with resentment yet trapoped by his financial destitution, Caiden realized his dire situation. Devoid of funds and influence, and dependent on Katrina even for daily essentials, he was forced to navigate his days with utmost caution around her dominating presence.



Whenever Katrina's temper flared, she would not tolerate Caiden's presence at the dinner table.


Time and again, Caiden was left to sit at the bottom of the staircase, his meals accompanied only by the weight of his solitude. These moments inevitably led his thoughts to wander to Daniela's early years.



Had she experienced this same feeling of exclusion and isolation within her own family home? She was merely a child of five back then. The idea sent a cold shudder rippling through Caiden.



Drowning in a deep pool of embarrassment and helplessness, Caiden was too dauunted to seek Daniela's assistance. The onlookers, it seemed,thrived on his predicament, eagerly watching for him to falter.



Finding himself cornered by circumstance, Caiden approached Cedric, his demeanor meek, his eyes cast downward in a gesture of deference. "I'm at a loss here. Daniela now controls Harper Group, yet she's letting it flounder. The company continues to bleed funds, its worth diminishing by the day. Even though she isn't exactly strapped for cash, watching such wastage is baffling. Real money is just being squandered away."


Cedric's eyes held a frosty detachment, radiating an imposing sense of authority. "She has her reasons."


"But what am.I supposed to do?" Caiden asked, his voice faltering as he nervously chewed his lip.I can't even afford a damn cabbage at my age. Fifty years of living for this? Every day feels like hitting rock bottom again. What's left for me?"


Lowering his gaze, Cedric's face remained an impassive mask. "Oh, really? Then perhaps it's time you confronted the person who dragged you into this mess. Don't ask me or her for answers."


A chill seemed to pass through Caiden, freezing him in place. "I know. I'm painfully aware of my shortcomings as a father."



A crack appeared in Cedric's composed exterior as he let out a derisive snort. "If you were truly aware,you'd spare us the charade of calling yourself her father. Stop dressing up your guilt in fancy excuses.You're not fooling anyone, and honestly, you're just making us both sick."


Caiden finally realized Cedric wasn't just annoyed-he was absolutely done putting up with his useless crap.


He bowed his head, shrouded in a heavy silence. As Cedric began to turn away, Caiden finally asked, "If| apologize sincerely, do you think Daniela will forgive me?"



Cedric's gaze was as sharp as steel, chilling him to the core. "You tell me. Isn't self-awareness the bare minimum for a man? You got what you were after,and now you're trying to take it all back? Pathetic.Have you no dignity left?"


Before Caiden could muster a response, Cedric continued, "Even if you've thrown away whatever shred of dignity you had left, you should be sensible,don't you think?"


With that, he turned sharply and departed.


Caiden remained, rooted in the stinging breeze, his face tight with frustration. His nose blushed crimson from the biting cold, and his heart sank into an abyss, dark and seemingly bottomless.


As weeks turned into a bleak month, the burden grew heavier.


Katrina's frequent outings to dine meant that the kitchen at home lay dormant.


On such evenings, the task of cooking fell on Caiden's reluctant shoulders. While savory scents floated tantalizingly from Daniela's dining room,he could only gulp down his bitterness and silently grieve over his dreary circumstances.


One day, the wind howled outside, relentless and unyielding.


It had been a full week since Katrina had retreated to her mother's place.


Caiden, having devoured the last of his noodles,faced the barren shelvesof his kitchen.


Driven by hunger, he abandoned his pride and, plate in hand, made his way to Daniela's dining room. He settled himself at the table, disregarding the piercing stares from everyone seated there.


Cedric, Lillian, and the others shot wary looks at one another before all eyes turned to Daniela.


Daniela held her fork midair for a brief second, her face a mask of indifference, before she continued eating as though nothing unusual had occurred.



Once the meal concluded, Caiden gathered his courage. His voice barely above a whisper, he addressed her. "Thank you."


Daniela turned her gaze towards Caiden. "There's no need for thanks. How did you find the meal?"



Caiden offered a sincere reply. "It was really delicious."



A subtle nod came from Daniela. "I'm pleased to hear that. Although we aren't close personally, you're always welcome to dine here. Just so you're aware,the meal here is $1,000 per person. How would you like to handle the payment? Cash, card, or would you prefer to settle up at month's end?"


Caiden was rooted to the spot, his voice lost to surprise.


With a sly smile, Daniela went on, "Whichever method you choose, payment is due. If paying per meal suits you, Josie will take care of it. Please understand, I don't offer credit here. After all,supporting someone else's father isn't my responsibility,is it?"


With those words, she turned on her heel and departed, leaving Caiden to grapple with a mix of embarrassment and frustration.


Once Daniela had taken a shower, she headed down the stairs, only to be greeted by Josie, who was grumbling over Caiden's failure to pay and his bold excuse of being broke.


From across the room, Daniela's eyes flicked towards Caiden before she pulled out her phone and sent a quick message to Katrina.
###Chapter 233 Rely On Herself





Thirty minutes later, Katrina came back. She stormed through the door, fixing Caiden with a withering look before scolding him.


"Uninvited, you impose yourself at Daniela's dinner table. Humiliated for a mere meal, how do you justify that? Serves you right! Caiden,you're not a young man anymore. How could you let her humiliate you just for the sake of a meal? If she were willing to give you her attention, that would be one thing. But she doesn't care about you, yet you still think there's some lingering father-daughter connection between you? It's absurd! Can't you see the truth, Caiden?She no longer sees you as her father. She texted me in the middle of the night to settle your bill,threatening to cut Joyce's shares in the robotics company if I don't. If you're so troubled that you're dragging your daughter into your mess, why not take the same path as Brylee? Spare others the pain!" Having vented her frustration, Katrina angrily sent a thousand to Josie, grabbed her suitcase, and ascended the stairs, leaving Caiden standing there,nothing more than a cold, unfeeling silhouette.


From the living room, Daniela turned to Caiden with a smirk. "Do you remember how my mother died?"


Caiden's face turned pale at her question. He ran upstairs, his footsteps erratic, almost tripping over as he ascended.



Life for Caiden grew more suffocating from that day forward.



With Katrina's return, their relationship deteriorated further; she found him increasingly unbearable, and her verbal assaults intensified.



In desperation, Caiden reached out to Alexander,using his influence to secure a few minor deals for Harper Group. He then begged Daniela to transfer the profits from these deals to his account.


Subsequently, Caiden ventured into business independently.


After several initial setbacks, he finally secured some contracts through Cedric.



Having never encountered significant professional obstacles in his earlier years, Caiden now faced them head-on. Often returning home intoxicated from networking events, he found the bedroom locked by Katrina and resigned himself to sleeping on the sofa.


Daniela was busy scrutinizing a business proposal.


By the time Caiden stirred from his uncomfortable sleep, dawn was breaking.



Daniela remained focused on her work at the dining table while Caiden lingered in the living room, his gaze fixed on her. For a fleeting moment, he imagined he saw Brylee.



He tried to speak, but his words caught in his throat.


Realization hit him; he didn't know how to face Brylee. She had entrusted Daniela to him, expecting him to cherish and protect her. Yet, he had let her down,failing both as a spouse and a father.


Under his watch, Brylee's once prosperous company had declined.



The shame was too much for him to bear.



Caiden stood motionless for a while, gradually sobering. He then moved to the kitchen, warmed some milk, and set it next to Daniela.


"I heard from Cedric you've been having trouble sleeping. This milk's from your fridge, but it's on me.Have some; it might help you rest," Caiden said,placing a hundred-dollar bill next to the mug.


Daniela didn't look up from her work. "No need."


"Why turn down a simple act of kindness? It's just milk."


Daniela had been reading all night, her eyes showing signs of strain. She blinked and then resumed wearing her anti-fatigue glasses. "Can we drop the act?"



Caiden felt a sting from her cold tone. "I'm not acting. I saw you were tired and thought the milk might help. Why would you think I have ulterior motives?"



Daniela offered a faint smile, her attention returning to the documents, though she seemed less interested.



She had long understood that she must rely on herself in this world.



Without looking up from her reading, Daniela spoke."I'm beyond the point where small gestures affect me. I wear a coat if it's cold, and turn on the air if it's hot. I'm fully capable of looking after myself. I don't need you, got it? To me, anything unnecessary is just an act. Keep your money and give me space, or l might have to ask you to leave to spare us both any unease. Perhaps then, you'll grasp the true cost of losing what little dignity you have left."



Caiden's face was etched with sadness as he looked at Daniela.


In his eyes, she remained the joyful little girl who once hugged his leg, but she had grown so distant and cold.


"Regardless of what you believe, I truly wish to do right by you," he said.


Daniela remained expressionless, offering no reply to his heartfelt plea.
###Chapter 234 What Do You Want





Daniela expected Caiden to leave, but instead,he remained in place. Without saying a word, he pulled out a chair and took a seat.


"| did love your mother. To say I wasn't drawn to her wealth would be a lie. But I needed my pride, too.Your mother's success intimidated me, and honestly,there were moments I felt uneasy. When I married Katrina, I focused only on myself. That's because I'd been holding back my feelings for too long. I just wanted some breathing space after being suffocated."



At his words, Daniela's gaze faltered for a moment.She let out a soft, sarcastic laugh. "Didn't anyone ever tell you that you can't have it all? You want an easy life without lifting a finger, but you can't hate my mother for being successful. You chose Joyce, so don't expect anything from me. It's best not to be too greedy." Caiden opened his mouth to speak, but Daniela cut him off. "Back when I was a kid, other children were picked up by their parents on rainy school days,butl was alone. I'd sit on a tiny bench, wondering why other dads loved their kids, while mine seemed to care more about someone else."


Caiden's face stiffened, discomfort washing over him.





Daniela smiled faintly, a smile that carried a sense of release. "I was stubborn back then. I wrestled with this question for almost ten years before finally letting it go. I just wanted to escape a place that never felt like home. Part of why I treated Alexander well was because I thought he was that boy from my childhnood. But mostly, I wanted to leave, to find a place where | could finally feel like I belonged."


Caiden's voice turned bitter as he spoke. "You never said any of this to me."


"There was nothing to say," Daniela replied,meeting Caiden's eyes. "I told you long ago that I've outgrown looking up to my father and seeking comfort from him whenever | feel hurt. Don't expect anything more from me now. I've already given all I can. Honestly,I don't owe you anything else. And if you have any decency left, don't bring up my mother again. You have no right to."


After that, Daniela returned to her documents without another glance. Caiden's fists tightened as the realization hit him-no amount of words could undo the damage he'd done.



He couldn't help but admit Cedric was right; there was no hope left for mending his relationship with Daniela.



In the end,he left without a word.


The living room fell back into its calm silence until a second glass of milk was placed beside Daniela.


Before she could glance up, someone took the chair Caiden had just left, resting his head on folded arms on the table.


Daniela looked at Cedric, surprised to see he was still awake. "Did I wake you?" she asked.


"No," Cedric replied, his voice rough, carrying a weight that felt heavy in the silence of the room."Daniela."



"Yes?"



"You once told me I did a great job on the North District project. You made a promise back then. Do you remember?"


Daniela nodded, her expression softening. "Yes, 1remember."



Cedric had poured countless hours into that project,crafting a landmark building that exceeded every expectation. Daniela had been grateful for his dedication and had promised that if he ever needed anything, he could ask, and she would do everything in her power to make it happen.



"You told me that you'd always keep your promise.Does that still stand?" Cedric looked at Daniela.


Daniela tilted her head slightly, her eyes meeting his as she asked, "What is it you want, Cedric?"


Earlier, Cedric had lingered at the staircase, the weight in his chest almost too much to bear.


In his mind, he saw an image of a stormy night-Daniela sitting all alone in a desolate corridor,waiting for the rain to end.



The image gripped his heart like an unseen hand squeezing it tight.


He had been plagued by doubts before, questioning if he had acted too rashly, if his choices had been too extreme, or if things were slipping beyond his control.


But now, all those fears melted away. In this moment,nothing else mattered. All he wanted was to pull her into his arms, give her the protection she deserved,and stand as her unwavering shield against the chaos surrounding her.
###Chapter 235| Want To Marry You





"I want you," Cedric said without a moment's hesitation. His voice was resolute. Observing Daniela's confusion, he added, "Yes, you understood correctly. I wish to leverage that promise you made as a means to start a relationship with you."



Daniela was stunned. The pen she held trembled lightly. Speechless, she realized her pulse was now surging. "A relationship? What sort of relationship do you mean?"



"Marriage," Cedric answered bluntly.


At his declaration, Daniela felt a knot form in her chest. "You must have heard my conversation with Caiden just now. There's no need for your sympathy."


Cedric, foreseeing her potential refusal, retorted,"It's not sympathy I feel for you, Daniela, but genuine affection. I want to marry you. I want to offer you the love, attention, and protection you were deprived of in your youth. In the future, on any rainy day, no matter the distance, I'll be there to cover you. You won't have to face anything alone again."


The proposal came so suddenly that Daniela struggled to gather her thoughts.


Cedric pressed on, knowing well that given time to think, Daniela might decline due to her practical nature.


"You might think this low of me, but I'm laying all my cards on the table. Hearing your words to Caiden hurt me deeply. I'm invoking the promise you made to propose marriage. I've said my piece; now I need your decision. Does your promise still stand?"


"Cedric, you're not being rational right now."Daniela's vision blurred as she set aside the paperwork.


"On the contrary, I've been too rational until now!"Cedric exclaimed, straightening his posture. "I've always been overly cautious, ensuring | assessed every situation before acting, and I've let you face challenges on your own. But no more. I don't just want to maintain a distance; I need to be your husband,Daniela."



Cedric's demeanor was commanding. His resolve mirrored the tenacity he applied in his business endeavors. He fixed his gaze on Daniela,determination clear in his eyes. "I can't continue as merely an admirer. This distance is intolerable. Today,I must secure my place by your side."


Daniela slowly withdrew her hand from the table. She was overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment.She had indeed made a promise, and she felt compelled to provide Cedric with a clear explanation,despite her reluctance.


Daniela took a moment to collect her thoughts,ensuring clarity in her response. "Cedric, over the years, I've changed significantly," she began. The overhead light cast a shadow, cloaking her in a mysterious, almost spectral glow. Her words were measured and thoughtful. "I'm not the child you once knew. Even my teachers have remarked on my extensive changes."


"And you've only grown more remarkable." Cedric purposely twisted her words to mean something else.


Daniela pressed her lips for a while before adding,"My personality has changed as well."


Cedric replied with a simple, "It doesn't matter to me."



Daniela continued, "I've been married once, briefly. It taught me that I struggle with commitments deeper than friendship. I'm not particularly vibrant or engaging. In fact, I tend to be quite introverted."


Cedric said, "When we first met, you were struggling with your health."


Daniela raised her eyes to meet his.


"You once said I was your cure for depression. So,would you trust me once more?" Cedric asked, his voice filled with tenderness. "Do you believe I can be there for you through the years?" His statement seemed to carry the weight of a vow.


Life had a way of taking from Daniela what she cherished most.


Such a compassionate soul stood before her, yet she harbored a deep-seated anxiety as if he were merely an illusion that might vanish.


Her life, though successful, felt isolating at its heights.


The circle of people she trusted was small, and her fear of losing someone if she allowed them closer weighed heavily on her.


"You've never met my mother," Daniela continued,biting her lip lightly. "Many remark that I resemble her closely. You're familiar with Caiden; deep down,he's intimidated by her. He views her tactics as too forceful, her influence too expansive, and her wealth overwhelming,factors that diminish his self-worth."


Daniela found herself at the peak of global wealth.


Indeed, she occupied the top tier of the world's financial hierarchy.


Should she amalgamate her holdings, she might well claim the title of the world's wealthiest person indefinitely.


"Do you worry I might end up like Caiden, intimidated by your success?" There was a brief silence as Cedric studied Daniela's face, seeking to reassure her. "Do you fear I might distance myself, feel overshadowed by your wealth, or be daunted by your business insight?"


Cedric's gaze softened, full of compassion, as he continued, "What other reservations might you have about me as your husband? Share them with me; I'm here to listen and to address any issue you might raise."
###Chapter 236 Fell Into A Trap





Cedric exhibited patience and tenderness.


Daniela shook her head gently. "That's all."


With a warm smile, Cedric reached for Daniela's hand.



He sensed her initial hesitation and did not grasp it immediately. Instead, he waited until she loosened her fingers slightly before taking her hand once more.



"Daniela," Cedric called out as the morning light illuminated his face, making his eyes sparkle with the reflection of her. "I'm not Caiden; I'm Cedric. You are not your mother; you are Daniela, a remarkable woman in your own right. Your strength doesn't intimidate me; it makes me want to ensure your happiness even more. Your power doesn't scare me;it fills me with pride. I'm not without ambitions; I have my pride and my own capabilities. So, Daniela, is it me you doubt, or yourself?"


Cedric was not one to speak often, but his words always carried weight and assurance.


Now, as he spoke, Daniela found herself unable to dispute his points. She clenched her hand, yet she hesitated to agree outright.


Cedric asked, "You're thinking it's all happening too quickly, aren't you? Change is always a bit daunting,but don't let the unfamiliarity deter you from moving forward,right?"



Daniela found no words to counter him.



"Feeling sleepy?" Cedric kept his gaze steady, his smile convincing. "If you're tired, why not rest here in the living room? If not, perhaps we could go register our marriage."


Daniela blinked in surprise. "Are you in such a rush?"


Her mind was indeed cluttered at the moment.



She had been buried in paperwork, had a draining discussion with Caiden, and now was navigating this moment with Cedric.



Her thoughts were tangled.



She felt a thorough discussion was necessary to clarify their relationship.


Cedric was naturally aware of Daniela's reservations.


He understood her concerns perfectly.


Determined, he admitted he would use any means necessary to secure Daniela's commitment today.


If he waited until tomorrow, once Daniela had time to think it over, he feared he might lose his chance.


Though anxious, Cedric hid his feelings well, asking smoothly, "Any more doubts? Let's discuss them."


He maintained a calm demeanor while subtly pressing forward.


Daniela responded with a simple, "No."


"Is it the pace that bothers you? Do you think we're moving too quickly?" Cedric asked further.



Daniela confirmed with a nod.



"Too quickly, you say?" Cedric asked. "I've made my choice, and you've given your promise. It's inevitable,whether it happens today or tomorrow. Does the timing truly make a difference?"



Daniela found her thoughts increasingly scrambled by Cedric's arguments.


Cedric continued, "If we are destined together, why not fully embrace our future now? You'll need to come to terms with this eventually, and I'm here to support you as you adjust."


Daniela bit her lip thoughtfully. "How much time will you give me to adapt?"


"That's for you to decide. Whenever you're ready,we'll share the same bed."



Daniela blushed deeply. "That's not what | was referring to." Cedric laughed. "Of course, not that. Let's secure our marriage certificate today. As for the rest, you set the pace. It's only fair. You once promised me a favor,and this is all l ask."


Daniela felt cornered.


It seemed Cedric had laid out a strategic plan,and she was inadvertently playing into his hands at every turn.
###Chapter 237 Husband





As the official was poised to stamp the marriage certificate, Daniela turned to Cedric. "We need to keep this under our hats for the time being."


Cedric gave a subtle nod, his eyes tracking the official's movements, and gestured.


The seal pressed down.



Daniela stared at him, dazed. "You once mentioned sharing a bed someday. But I get to set the pace-you promised."


Cedric's demeanor was easygoing.


Grasping the marriage certificate firmly, he tucked it securely into his suit pocket.


Only then did he take Daniela's hand in his,telling her, "Alright, I'll dance to your tune, honey."


That day, the sun blazed down with unusual fervor. As Cedric led Daniela out, her mind was a whirlwind.


Married,just like that?


The expression on her face was indescribable.


The last time she was married, she had chased Alexander for a decade, only to see the marriage dissolve after just one day.


Now, she hadn't even dated Cedric properly, yet here they were, hitched in the blink of an eye.



As Daniela turned to look at Cedric and saw his smile, a flicker of pity crossed her gaze. Did he truly grasp what he had signed up for?


"I want our marriage to be a secret," Daniela reminded him, clutching at the remnants of her rationality. She needed it secret until she could avenge her mother's death. She wouldn't let her guard down, nor put Cedric at risk.


Daniela thought she must be losing her mind.


When had her life turned into such a whirlwind? Love had never been in the blueprint.


Chaos reigned.


Cedric's smile was bright, almost boyish, as if he had conquered the globe. "In private, may I call you honey?"


Daniela had been down the aisle twice already. Yet,the term still felt alien on her tongue.


But Cedric seemed comfortable with "honey," as if it had always been part of his vocabulary.


"Is that alright,honey?"


Daniela sighed. "Fine, do as you wish!"


Cedric's eyes sparkled. "Then let's toast to this. How about a lavish meal to celebrate?"



Daniela nodded, and Cedric whisked her away to the Night Lounge.


The going rate at the Night Lounge was fifty thousand per head. Calling a waiter over, Cedric said,"My wife isn't keen on spicy food or ginger. Any suggestions?"



Daniela's lips pursed in slight embarrassment.There was no need to hammer it home.



The waiter, caught off guard and almost giddy with the news of his boss's impromptu wedding,seemed ready to burst.



Cedric gave the waiter a stern look, adding in a grave tone, "We're keeping this low-key for now, so hold the fanfare."



Daniela wondered if silence was possible when Cedric kept broadcasting it like that.


The waiter, nearly keeling over from the revelation,saw the restaurant manager approach, all smiles.


"Absolutely, Mr. Philips. As your manager, it's my honor to serve you and your wife personally. Why not try the steak today? It's particularly good."



Daniela opened her mouth to speak, but Cedric interjected, "My wife isn't a fan of steak." "Understood," the manager replied with a polite nod."How about our seafood casserole then? The ingredients are top-notch today."


"She's not into shellfish either."



The manager nodded again. "Noted. We can customize it."



Cedric scrutinized the menu closely. "It includes bacon, right? She's not fond of that either."


The manager's smile didn't waver. "No problem,we'll leave it out."



Cedric continued to peruse the menu with an eagle eye, while the manager kept up a facade of calm but was internally baffled.


Hadn't Cedric been married before?


Why all this fuss over a meal?


He had designed the menu himself, hadn't he? So why this meticulous inspection?


To an outside, it could appear as though this wasn't even Cedric's own restaurant.


Daniela also felt Cedric was being overly meticulous.


She was on the verge of speaking up when he suddenly stood, smoothly took off his suit jacket,shook it out, and hung it neatly on the back of his chair. HHe turned to her and said warmly, "Just wait here for me. I'll cook for you on our first day as husband and wife."



Daniela was momentarily speechless.


Cedric was already on his way to the kitchen.


The manager tucked the menu away and leaned in."Madam, would you care for a drink? Our boss has a few rare bottles stashed away, each a small fortune now. Shall we open one to celebrate?"


Daniela was about to decline, but Cedric reappeared,donning an apron. "Open the most expensive one.lt has a fruity undertone you'll appreciate, Daniela.I bought it thinking of you. Go ahead, try it!"


Cedric's culinary skills were exceptional. He rested his chin in his hand, watching her reaction closely."So,how is it?"


Since they had registered their marriage, Cedric's smile hadn't faded. Seeing his unabated cheer,Daniela found herself smiling back.


"It's delicious," she admitted.


"Then I'll make it for you every day/," Cedric declared,his tone affectionate as if rehearsed many times over.


Daniela didn't protest. She didn't believe Cedric would hold to his word.



She had long cultivated a practice of not relying on others' promises. That way, disappointment was less likely to sting.
###Chapter 238 Also Excellent In Other Aspects
Cedric could tell right away that Daniela didn't believe him, but it didn't bother him. After all, she was right there with him, and the marriage certificate was safely tucked in his pocket. He was now her legal husband, and he felt no worry in the slightest.


After dinner, Cedric suggested they go out for a movie.


Daniela watched the screen with keen interest.


Out of the blue, she felt a touch from the side, which jolted her.


She was about to pull away reflexively when the familiar voice whispered, "Honey, it's me."


That moment clarified everything for Daniela.


She remembered she was married now, and the man  beside her was her husband.


Cedric, with a gentle smile, took Daniela's hand in his, rested it on his knee, and murmured, "Honey,your hands feel cold. Allow me to warm them."


Daniela bit her lip slightly. Hearing that made her heart flutter unexpectedly. She wondered why this particular nickname made her feel so different when it came from Cedric. It seemed like a tender caress to her heart.


This was a new sensation for her, one she had not felt with Alexander or during their marriage.


The feeling was strange. Yet, she found herself not minding it one bit.


Daniela found herself gazing at Cedric's profile.Feeling her stare, he turned and met her eyes with a warm smile.



In a soft tone, he teased, "People often compliment my looks. What's your verdict?"


Daniela, ever the serious one, took a moment to examine him more closely upon hearing his question.


Under the cinema's flickering lights, Cedric's features were sharply cast. His face showed a harrowing handsomeness, the kind that sharpened when he pursed his lips but softened into reliability and warmth when he relaxed.



His skin was smooth, his nose distinguished, and his lips appeared soft.


Daniela pressed her lips together as Cedric turned his head to smile at her.



His smile was tender, his eyes glinting with a bright spark that reflected Daniela's image back to her.



"You are indeed quite handsome," she responded.



Cedric's charm was distinct from Alexander's polished grace or the gentle charm often attributed to more delicate features.



He was strong and composed, yet gentle, and his smile had an irresistible charm. Cedric then slightly opened his lips, a deliberate move, as he leaned closer to whisper into her ear,now flushed with warmth. "Remember, I am yours now."


Daniela's heart skipped a beat. At that moment,her eyes caught the small beauty mark near Cedric's eye, prompting her to whisper, "Cedric,thank you."


"For what do you thank me?" Cedric asked.


"You dashed into a burning building for me, and you were there when I collapsed in the hospital, carrying me to safety," Daniela said. "Thank you for always being my protector."①


Cedric stroked Daniela's hair, responding,	11|t1S nothing; you are my wife, after all."


"Yes, I am now your wife," Daniela whispered back.


As the movie played on, the lead character's dialogue was engaging, yet Daniela found herself more captivated by Cedric.


Minutes later, Cedric squeezed her hand a bit tighter,  leaned back, and murmured, "Honey, aside from my looks, I excel in many other areas to00."


Daniela, puzzled by his implication, asked, "In what ways?"
###Chapter 239 Almost Out Of Control





A subtle smile played on Cedric's lips, but he remained silent. In the cinema's darkness, his gaze met Daniela's intensely.


As the credits rolled, Daniela was still captivated by Cedric's deep, meaningful look, which seemed to convey words he hadn't spoken.


Daniela heart thudded wildly in her chest.


Throughout the ride home, Daniela remained silent until they arrived.


Cedric then turned to her with a grin. "Your heart's pounding, honey. We might let our little secret slip if it continues like this."


Daniela cast a helpless glance at Cedric.


Cedric chuckled, bending slightly to meet Daniela's wide-eyed stare. Moments later, their heartbeats resounded together,filling the quiet night like distant drums.


"Now, my heart matches yours," Cedric joked. "No one will suspect a thing."


It seemed both had momentarily lost their composure.


Upon reaching the house, Daniela chose not to enter immediately with Cedric. She walked around outside to calm herself before she opened the door.


Lillian looked up as she entered. "Hey, Daniela, why are you alone? Cedric just headed to his room. Didn't you both return together?"


"No, we came back separately," Daniela replied as she closed the door.


Lillian leaned in and whispered to Daniela, "Cedric seemed different today."


Daniela looked away. "Huh?"


Lillian leaned closer, lowering her voice so Katrina, who might be eavesdropping, couldn't hear. "Cedric was in an unusually good mood today. He walked to his room with something in his arms, trying to keep it hidden. When I asked him about it..."


Daniela fixed her gaze on Lillian.


Lillian imitated Cedric's cheerful demeanor."He just grinned and told me it wasn't my business.Something special must've happened today; l've never seen him so joyful."


Before Daniela could respond, Cedric's door swung open.


"Lillian, don't disturb Daniela. She didn't sleep well last night and is quite exhausted. Let her rest." He then turned his attention to Daniela, his tone softening. "I need to discuss a project with you later."


Daniela acknowledged with a nod.


As Cedric retreated and closed his door, Lillian stared at his door in disbelief. "Did you catch that? His smile wasn't just happy; his eyes sparkled with excitement too."


Just as Daniela was about to respond, Lillian, still puzzled, spoke up. "And what exactly does Cedric mean? I spoke to you, and he claimed | was disturbing your rest, but wasn't he bothering you as well by wanting to discuss a project? What is he trying to say?"


Daniela was taken aback by Lillian's sharp observation. She smiled and ascended the staircase.


Following Daniela's departure, Lillian leaned towards Ryan and whispered, "Doesn't Daniela seem off today?"


Ryan, absorbed in his computer, casually dismissed her concern. "She's as calm and collected as she's always been."


Lillian glanced skeptically between Cedric's door and the staircase.



Really?


In the dining room, Katrina had been observing theexchange.


When Daniela saw Lillian frown, a mischievous thought crossed her mind.②


She quickly set her food aside and walked over,leaning in to whisper to Lillian, "Did Daniela and Cedric have a fight?"


Lillian gave her a sharp, cold glance. "They're perfectly fine."



"Are you sure?" Katrina smirked. "They usually return together, yet Cedric arrived earlier today alone. Also,he didn't inquire about Daniela immediately, which is unusual for him. He just headed straight to his room,seemingly indifferent about whether Daniela was here."



Katrina settled beside Lillian. "So, they must have argued, right? I've always thought Daniela too distant for Cedric."



Lillian quickly said, irritated, "And why isn't Daniela right for him? Do you think someone else would be better?"


Katrina's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Absolutely!My niece, Shirley Randall, is gorgeous, tall, leggy and buxom, which certainly appeals to men. Cedric and Daniela are both too reserved. Honestly, I think bringing Shirley here could spark something with Cedric."



She felt a thrill at the thought of conflict between Cedric and Daniela.



Before Lillian could reply, Katrina strode out to the yard to make a phone call.


Her voice was a bit too loud, reaching Daniela's ears.


After her shower, Daniela preferred not to blow-dry her hair. With a towel in hand, she stood on the balcony, and by chance, overheard Katrina making a phone call below.
###Chapter 240 Something Wrong With Cedric's Eyes
"I know a man of substance, Cedric Phillips, whom I've mentioned before. He's often spotlighted in the financial press as a standout figure of our era. If Shirley pairs with him, she'd be striking gold."


"True, he's somewhat reserved, doesn't waste words, and can be quite austere. But that's hardly an issue. Isn't a touch of severity common among men,especially the accomplished ones like him? He possesses a razor-sharp intellect, and his reserved nature is hardly a drawback. If he's sparing with words, Shirley can simply fill the air with hers. I've heard he hasn't been in a serious relationship before."



"No! Rest assured, he definitely has an interest in women! Cedric only has his grandmother, so the family fortune is bound to fall into his lap. If he and  Shirley tie the knot, all that wealth will be hers as well. Isn't that a thrilling prospect? Send Shirley here.She's met Alexander, right? Believe me, Cedric outshines Alexander in looks!"


Katrina was busy orchestrating Cedric's introduction in the yard.


Meanwhile, Cedric, the very man Katrina depicted as having a frosty demeanor, had just emerged from a shower and was confidently striding into Daniela's room, a project contract in hand.


"What's going on?" Cedric set down the contract and approached Daniela. He casually took the towel from Daniela's hands.



Overhearing Katrina's matchmaking efforts in the yard,Daniela chuckled. "Katrina's turned into quite the cupid. We didn't come home together this evening, and she's already plotting your romantic engagements."


Cedric seemed unfazed by Katrina's matchmaking antics.  He was more captivated by the challenge of taming Daniela's silky strands.


He picked up a bottle of essential oil, unopened and waiting on Daniela's desk, warmed a dollop in his hands, and delicately worked it through her hair.


Her hair slid through his broad palms like threads of fine silk.


A shadow crossed Cedric's eyes as his thoughts drifted. He chuckled to himself, realizing how marriage had softened his usual resolve.


Looking up, he caught Daniela observing him with intense focus.



"This isn't necessary, it's such a chore," she said.


"Lillian gifted you these over six months ago, and you haven't so much as cracked a seal. It's no wonder she marvels at your effortless grace."


Despite her aversion to late nights, Daniela shunned elaborate grooming routines, yet her skin was smooth as porcelain, prompting envious praises from  Lillian.



"It's all too cumbersome, and using all these just once seems wasteful. It's not worth the fuss."Daniela was never one for an extensive beauty regimen. In the harsh winter, she was content with just a dab of baby cream.


"I don't mind the hassle, though. From now on, I'l manage all your pampering needs." His words tinged with a hint of double entendre.



Daniela's cheeks warmed with a blush.


Cedric whispered in her ear, "I could even assist with the body lotion." With that, he turned to search for it.


Alas! Lillian had supplied everything but body lotion!


Cedric surveyed the array of cosmetics on the table and resolved to secure a bottle of body lotion himself the next day.

 
Feeling slightly regretful, Cedric drew Daniela into his embrace.  Daniela's face radiated heat. "What's the matter?"she inquired.


Cedric, trying to steady his fluttering heart,inhaled deeply and said with measured calm, "You'll need to grow accustomed to my touch. We're married now,and I am, after all, a normal man."


After he spoke, images flashed through his mind.


Overwhelmed, he pressed a kiss to Daniela's forehead and descended the stairs.



Once downstairs, he took a cold shower to regain some semblance of composure.


Then, a knock at the door.


Cedric, still reeling from the heat of the moment he'd left upstairs, wondered if Daniela had noticed.


Was she approaching to offer consolation?


With a hopeful smile, Cedric strode to the door and flung it open.


"Who are you?" His handsome features darkened upon seeing the visitor. The smile vanished.


The visitor, taken aback, bit her lower lip and lifted a basket of fruit. "I'm Shirley Randall. My aunt sent me with some fruit for you."


Under the soft glow of the indoor lighting, Shirley timidly raised her eyes to meet his.


With just one glance, her heart skipped a beat, and her cheeks tinged pink.


She breathed in his crisp fir scent, finding herself enchanted.



With that one look, she knew she had fallen for him at first sight.


Shirley, bashful yet bold, extended her hand. "I washed the fruit myself. It's really sweet."


As she spoke, she subtly drew attention to her form.


Shirley knew her strengths well.


With flushed cheeks, she looked up at him once more.  This time, she was even more convinced that he was her ideal match.



Shirley's voice softened. "Won't you have a bite?"


Cedric frowned, his response chilly and concise."No!" He shut the door briskly.


From a distance, Katrina witnessed the scene unfold.The sound of the door slamming made her jump too.


Cedric lacked any semblance of chivalry.


Could it be he had no interest in women?



Shirley had chosen her outfit with care.


Her attire, a light blue skirt with a wide neckline, was short and cinched at the waist, accentuating her figure perfectly.


Could Cedric be blind not to spare even a glance?
###Chapter 241 They Will Be Together Soon


It was obvious Cedric had no interest in Shirley.

Katrina's enthusiasm quickly faded, while Shirley stared at the closed door, her eyes reflecting deep thoughts.

"Aunt, let me try again," said Shirley.

Upon hearing this, Katrina looked up at Shirley with surprise.

Shirley's eyes shone with a sparkle, and a shy expression settled on her face, making her look just like a young girl experiencing the sweetness of first love.

Katrina gave a firm nod. "Alright, stay at home. Let me tell you, a woman can easily capture a man's heart if she makes thefirst move. You must be proactive, understand?"

Shirley responded with a nod. "I understand. Don't worry, I feel confident."

Katrina's face lit up with joy.

Caiden observed silently, his patience tested once more.

Was she really teaching her niece how to seduce a man?

Katrina would stop at nothing for money.

Katrina caught the sneer in Caiden's gaze and scoffed, "When Brylee was alive, didn't you flirt with me as well? Men often let their desires make their decisions and none are any good!"

Even with his knowledge of Katrina's character, Caiden was shocked by her blunt words.

"You used to praise me, calling me elegant and composed, a true gentleman. How can you speak like this now? You told me your ex-husband abused you when he was drunk, and I felt sympathy for you. After Brylee's funeral, I married you, promising never to let you suffer. And now, you're telling me that I'm just like those awful men?"

Caiden felt a deep pain in his heart.

Unmoved, Katrina looked at Caiden with hatred and exclaimed, "Caiden, why pretend to be so affectionate?If you were truly devoted, you wouldn't have cheated with me. By that sense, you're worse than those other men."

The illusion was completely destroyed.

Caiden's face turned pale with rage, his body trembling. What he had believed to be love was nothing but a lie.

His fsts clenched tightly, he gave a bitter, trembling laugh.

"Fine! You really are something," Caiden said, his expression filled with anger. "Katrina, l've finally seen your true colors."@

Katrina appeared unaffected.

Nobody enjoyed serving others, especially not fora lifetime.

She understood that Caiden's declared love for her was merely a search for the dominance he could not find with Brylee.

If she pleased him, he was more than happy.

If she displeased him, he would not hesitate to show his dissatisfaction through anger.

Was that what they called love?

If that was supposed to be love, she wanted no part of it.

Now that Joyce was married, what was there to be afraid of?

Katrina let out an insulting laugh, not bothering to glance at Caiden again.

Caiden lowered his head, elbows resting on his knees, and ran his hand through his hair, overwhelmed by frustration.

How had he been so blind to see Katrina for the heartless woman she truly was?

He had even cut ties with Daniela because of her.

Alone in the quiet, empty living room, Caiden cried with regret in his heart.

While Caiden was absorbed by his regrets, Daniela's robotics company had made another remarkable breakthrough in the industry, achieving a worth of over a hundred billion dollars.

The company threw a grand celebration banquet.

As Joyce entered the venue, she saw Daniela on stage, gracefully holding her dress while delivering a speech. Cedric was by her side, holding a glass of water, his eyes sparkling with pride as he watched her.

Joyce's eyes stayed on Cedric for an extended moment before she turned her gaze to Alexander.

Alexander's expression was calm, yet Joyce sensed he must be feeling regret deep inside.

Daniela looked radiant and extremely competent, her successes now out of Alexander's league.

Daniela had lost all interest in Alexander.

Reflecting on this, Joyce let out a soft laugh. She had once felt superior to Daniela because she stole Alexander from Daniela.

Yet Daniela had moved on to Cedric, who clearly surpassed Alexander in every way.

It appeared she was the one whó had truly lost.

With a calm expression, Joyce brought her glass to her lips.

Following Daniela's speech, the crowd burst into applause. Joyce's eyes returned to Cedric, his face bright with happiness and pride.

It might have been her imagination, but Joyce felt that tonight, Daniela seemed closer to Cedric than ever.

As Daniela stepped down from the stage, she even extended her hand to Cedric. This was different from her usual self. Daniela had always been as independent as a lone wolf, always detached and unapproachable.

Joyce glanced at the person next to her, a smile tinged with sarcasm on her face. "Don't bother watching. I bet they'll end up together soon, if they aren't already."

Alexander remained silent, finishing his wine in a single, heavy swallow.
###Chapter 242 Hold On To That Slim Chance


Joyce observed Alexander's aloof behavior, her expression growing darker by the moment.

She was puzzled by the facade he presented, acting superior and detached.

Previously, when he was with Daniela, he had been nice to her.

Yet now, despite their marriage, he had remained distant, never once showing affection.

It seemed the household staff had been whispering, for the entire circle of socialites was abuzz with talk that Alexander's marriage to her was devoid of love.

They cruelly suggested he scorned her for her past.

Such vicious comments circulated, yet not a single member of the Bennett family rose to her defense.

Determined, Joyce resolved to sleep with Alexander that evening.

After all, initiating contact had simplified matters for Katrina in her relationship with Caiden.

Alexander wasoff to the side, silently nursing his drink.

Keith approached, smirking, and taunted, "Having regrets now?"

Alexander responded only with silence, continuing to sip his drink.

Keith continued, "I told you Joyce is no match for Daniela. You didn't believe me. Now, Daniela seems to have moved on with Cedric, leaving you in the dust."

Upon hearing this, Alexander raised his head, his gaze sharp and cold. "Has Daniela herself confirmed she's with Cedric?"

Keith answered confidently,′′|sit even necessary to ask? I may not know business, but I understand people.Daniela has always been cautious with herfeelings. She might have pursued you, yet she kept her distance emotionally. Was she ever truly intimate with you? Did she express any real desire? Have you ever actually been together physically? It's simple, Alexander. When a woman is truly interested in a man, she shows it,naturally wanting closeness."

Alexander's expression darkened further. "What's your point?"

Keith concluded, "My point is, whatever Daniela felt for you before was superficial. Now with Cedric, it's different. They share a chemistry that's palpable, and even if they haven't openly admitted it, it's obvious they share a connection."

At these words, Alexander's grip on his glass intensified.

Keith, sensing the tension, patted Alexander's shoulder regretfully. "Forget it, you're not destined for Daniela. Just make it work with Joyce."

The firmness in Alexander's grip on his glass intensified. He then turned his gaze to Joyce.

At that moment, Joyce, with a glass in hand, was laughing loudly with her friends, displaying none of the poise expected of a refined lady.

Meanwhile, Daniela stood elegantly under the soft lighting in a light blue gown, engaging confidently with executives.Her lively demeanor drew the attention of every man present.

In contrast, Daniela, born into wealth, seemed worlds apart from the less polished Joyce.

Alexander's face grew even more somber at the thought.

As the evening progressed to the opening dance, led by Daniela, the moment to select a dance partner arrived. Alexander, hands now free from his pockets, fixed his eyes hopelessly on Daniela, wishing to be the chosen one.

"Don't even think about it," Joyce said, catching the longing look in Alexander's eyes. "Daniela could pick anyone here, but she won't pick you. Not just because you're my husband, but because she doesn't revisit past romances."

Alexander was painfully aware of this reality. Yet, a faint hope flickered in his heart, filled with nervous anticipation. He clung to this unlikely possibility. However, his faint hope was dashed when Daniela, microphone in hand, announced Cedric's name,drawing the crowd's focus.

Disappointment engulfed Alexander, momentarily stopping his heart.

Watching Daniela dance, he admired her grace and agility, her skirt twirling with the rhythm, captivating the onlookers.

His hand tensed by his side, reflecting the turmoil within.

Even after the dance concluded, his emotions remained in disarray.

Watching Daniela beam with joy on the dance floor, he was reminded painfully of their past together, and deep regret welled up inside him.

Compelled by a mix of frustration and yearning, he brushed past Joyce, who blocked his path, and approached Daniela with determination.

"May I have this dance?" he asked, his tone commanding.

At that, Cedric intervened, positioning himself protectively before Daniela, his expression darkening with hostility.
###Chapter 243 He Was Drunk


Alexander's head spun with a reckless abandon, oblivious to the curious stares piercing through the crowded room. He extended his hand towards Daniela, his voice laced with a hopeful desperation."Would you grant me the pleasure? It's merely a dance."

Cedric's complexion turned ghostly. "Alexander, don't provoke me into violence right here! You're Joyce's husband.Do you realize the whirlwind of rumors and trouble your invitation could spawn for Daniela?"

Alexander was fully aware. Yet, at that moment, he couldn't care less. He yearned to dance with Daniela,a desire so fervent he felt he'd pay any price for just one dance.

"Sorry, I'm not looking for another dance partner tonight," Daniela responded, her voice steady and unwavering. She offered an apologetic nod, but her expression remained resolute, devoid of genuine regret.

"Why?" Alexander pushed, unwilling to let the matter drop.

Daniela didn't bother with another reply; instead, she tugged on Cedric's sleeve and said, "Let's go."

Alexander caught the subtle interaction, his heart splintering in silent agony. "When you chased after me before, you weren't this attached. Daniela, are you with Cedric now?"

Daniela remained silent, her grip on Cedric's hand firm as they turned to leave.

Alexander stood abandoned in the center of the dance floor, his heart turning to ice.

Daniela had chosen Cedric. He wanted desperately to tell her,"1fyou still harbor any old feelings,I would divorce Joyce for you."
0
But the opportunity slipped through his fingers.

Or perhaps, Daniela no longer held any space for him in her heart.①

Alexander felt the weight of the surrounding gazes, and a profound sadness enveloped him. Had Daniela truly written him off? Off to the side, Joyce took a bitter sip from her drink, her lips curling into a grim smile. Alexander was indeed regretting it.

Alexander exited the celebration from the dance floor and headed straight to a bar.

Joyce's car lurked at the bar's entrance.

She waited like a predator in the shadows until she saw Alexander being propped up by his secretary, drunk and unsteady. Only then did she emerge from her car.

The secretary was taken aback. "Mrs. Bennett, what brings you here?"

As Joyce maneuvered Alexander towards her car, the secretary intervened hastily. "Mr. Bennett asked to be taken back to the company."

Joyce shot the secretary a frosty glare. "What company? Alexander is married to me. It's my call where he spends the night."

The secretary's anxiety peaked. "This isn't right. Mr. Bennett explicitly said to take him to the company's lounge. Please don't complicate this. If he wakes and realizes I didn't follow his directions, I'll be in a tight spot."

Joyce was unmoved by the plea. She forcefully pushed Alexander into her car, climbed in, and without a moment's hesitation, sped off into the night.

The secretary gasped, "This is not good!"

It was well-known that since his marriage, Alexander hadn't shared a bed with Joyce. Now, in his inebriated state, he wouldn't even recognize if the person beside him was Joyce or someone else.

The secretary wasted no time and rang up Richard.

Richard blurted out, "This is bad!" He then called Joyce.

But Joyce was unreachable.

She had not only powered down her own phone but also Alexander's. She whisked Alexander away to a friend's secluded villa and ushered him into the bathroom.

In his muddled state, Alexander thought he saw Daniela.

His voice cracked as he called out, "Daniela?"

Joyce lifted her gaze, a sly chuckle escaping her lips, and murmured,"γes."
###Chapter 244 Was It Daniela


Richard was pushed to his limit.

He fuly grasped why Alexander hádn't shared a room with Joyce yet.

The reason was his unresolved feelings for Daniela.

He clung to the hope of reuniting with her.

Sleeping with Joyce would solidify their status as a married couple. If Daniela ever changed her mínd, how could he explain his actions?

Regret consumed Richard.

He would have never consented to Alexander's marriage to Joyce if he had a choice.

Joyce's presence was far.more dominant than Daniela's, and she couldn't handle any criticism.

Initially, she pretended to be nice, but as the robotics company flourished, her arrogance became unbearable. She even insulted Richard, calling him an oldman.

His heart was overwhelmed with regret.

What kind of person had he introduced to the family?

Joyce's audacity had grown to the point where she even dared to kidnap Alexander.

Desperate, Richard turned to Daniela for help, knowing the hackers she commanded were unrivaled.Finding Joyce's location should be easy with Daniela's assistance.

Richard tensed as he dialed Daniela's number.

After one ring, a deep, cold voice answered, "Hello?"

Stunned, Richard saw Daniela's number on the display. How could Cedric be on the other end? It was nearly midnight.

"Is Daniela there?" he whispered, hesítating.

Cedric immedlatety recognized his voice and responded, "Mr. Bennett."

"Well. 1 need to speak with Daniela. Can she come to the phone?" Richard Inqurred.

Cedric Jooked over at Daniela, who was engrossed in assembling à Lego model, and replied emotionlessly,°She's busy.You can talk to me about it."

Richard knew he couldn't discuss his concerns with Cedric. That would be akin to exposing his strategy to a rival.

He whispered, "Never mind," and quickly disconnected the call.

Cedric held the phone, hesitated briefly, and then headed to the corridor to find Ryan.

"Ryan, see what Alexander and Richard are doing tonight."

A few minutes later, Ryan indicated the surveillance footage displayed on the computer screen from outside a 'bar, "There's not much to see, but the video shows that Alexander never made contact with Joyce. His secretary stepped in."

Ryan adjusted the computer, and the camera view shifted to follow Joyce to a villa.

At the villa's entrance, Joyce was already pecking Alexander on the cheek.

Alexander seemed confused, his movements as erratic as his thoughts.

They both entered the home.

Before the massive window bathed in warm yellow light, they stripped each other and staggered upstairs.

At this point, everything was obvious.

Ryan chuckled. "Interesting. Alexander was being forced."

Cedric,with a knowing smirk, realized the purpose of Richard's earlier call. Joyce was intent on binding Alexander to herself, and Cedric decided to assist her.

He turned to Ryan and instructed, "Release this surveillance footage."

That evening, Olisvine was abuzz with rumors.

"Who would have guessed Joyce was so unrestrained? She couldn't even wait to get inside."

"Take a closer look, that's neither the Harper's nor the Bennett's doorstep. The couple found another spot for their escapades."

The following morning, Alexander awoke with an intense headache.

As he reflexively reached for his phone, he felt an arm over his chest.

Could it be Daniela?

The events of the previous night came flooding back.

Initially stern, Alexander's face slowly relaxed.

He turned and saw the woman turned away from him.

Her hair cascaded down her back, and in a raspy voice, Alexander called out, "Daniela."
###Chapter 245 Everyone Watched Coldly


Joyce spun around.

In that moment, Alexander's mind was in turmoil.

Suddenly, he lost control.

That day, he nearly ended Joyce's life.

"Why are you here?" Alexander demanded, his words forced through clenched teeth.

"It's me," Joyce replied, pale and gasping for air. "It's always been me, Alexander! Release me!"

"You've set me up!" His hold tightened, his gaze icy.

Joyce was lying in the bed, her complexion turning from pale to a blue tint due to lack of oxygen.

At that instant, she felt her life hanging by a thread.

The dread of suffocating made her eyes bulge.

As Joyce's grip weakened, there was a knock at the door.

Alexander's fractured sanity began to mend.

He realized he had nearly strangled Joyce.

As oxygen returned to her lungs, Joyce understood how close she had come to dying.

She dropped to the floor, shaking and curling into a fetal position.

She was overwhelmed with fear.

The terror was real.

If she hadn't cleverly arranged for a reporter to catch her and Alexander together, she might have died. The door swung open.

The camera snapped photos, capturing everything. In response, Alexander angrily destroyed the camera held by the reporter.

He spoke in a monotone. "If this leaks to anyone else, I'll end you all."

At his words, Joyce's voice trembled like a leaf.

She believed Alexander might actually take her life if she spread the news.

Alexander seized his coat and stormed out.

Joyce curled up in the corner, sobbing quietly.

She reached out to Katrina.

Desperate, she cried into the phone. "Mom, I'm terrified. I need a divorce!"

Katrina came to take her daughter home.

Throughout the journey, Joyce shivered and remained silent, ignoring Katrina's questions.

All she could say was, "I need a divorce, Mom. I can't stay with Alexander any longer."

Katrina was confused. "Why? Is Alexander mistreating you? Or are you stirring up trouble again? Listen,Joyce, the shares Daniela gave you serve as leverage, but Alexander is still your husband. You can't manipulate him forever or he'll reach his limit."

Holding onto Katrina's hand tightly, Joyce pleaded, "Mom, I desperately need a divorce!"

Katrina frowned and said, "Joyce, stop being so willful. You and Alexander just got married. How can you think of getting a divorce now? Wouldn't that be absurd?"

Joyce stamped her feet, shouting, "I just want a divorce!"

Katrina became quiet. She decided she couldn't allow Joyce to remain so defiant, so she reached for her phone to call Alexander. "Mom!" Joyce suddenly screamed.

Katrina was startled into stllness.

Joyce unwrapped the scarf fromn around her neck.

Beneath the harsh white light, a deep bruise ringed her neck. The bruise was pronounced and severe.

Immediately, silence enveloped the entire living room.

Joyce was the first to shatter the quiet.

"Mom! Alexander is a monster! A monster! Ah! I want a divorce! Do you see this? He abused me, he tried to kill me!" Joyce's agitation was palpable. Her body trembled violently as she spoke. Her fear was evident to all.

Katrina began to cry, afraid to even touch Joyce at that moment. "How could tis have happened?"

"Mom! You chose this son-in-law for me! You pushed me into this marriage! He's a lunatic. Do you understand?" Every word Joyce uttered was a desperate shout. Her voice was raspy as she accused Alexander.

As she began to faint, Joyce's final plea was, "I can't be married to Alexander anymore. I was wrong to be so stubborn."

Joyce then fell to the floor.

Katrina, crying out in distress, tried to lift Joyce but couldn't manage. She looked desperately at Caiden."Caiden, come and see how injured Joyce is!"

Caiden said nothing and just walked over. He assisted Katrina in carrying Joyce into the room. He then returned downstairs.

When Katrina came down, her voice quivered with rage. "I am so furious I could scream! I'm going to kill Alexander!" She stormed into the kitchen, seized a knife, and prepared to confront him.

The living room was full of people, Caiden, Daniela, Cedric, Ryan, Lillian, Shirley. They were all watching,yet no one intervened.

Slowly, the maid Daniela had brought in opened the door.
###Chapter 246 She Was Scolded Harshly


Katrina was determined to defend Joyce, but she knew better than to confront Alexander on her own.Venturing into the Bennett family's territory uninvited was a recipe for disaster.

"Will you accompany me to the Bennett family's, Caiden?" Katrina asked.

Caiden's attention remained glued to the television in the living room, his response laced with derision."Me? Why on earth would I? Who am I to you?"

Katrina's eyes widened, her voice tinged with incredulity. "How can you even ask that? You're Joyce's father."

"Am I, though?" Caiden retorted. "When you need me, I'm Joyce's father, but when everything's fine,I'm nobody. No, I can't play this part-time father role any longer!"

Katrina,her frustration mounting, stepped closer. "What are you saying, Caiden? How can you call yourself nobody?"

Nearby, Cedric, sensing the tension rising, instinctively drew Daniela closer to protect her.

Daniela, previously absorbed in the unfolding scene, felt Cedric's pull and complied without question.

Ryan munched on popcorn, seemingly uninterested in Katrina's drama yet intrigued by the interaction between Cedric and Daniela.

Katrina continued to plead her case, but Caiden's patience had frayed to its end."Oh, really? Have you forgotten your own words? You were the one who told me to turn to Daniela in times of crisis, that she was my true daughter, and not to drag Joyce into anything. Remember how Joyce didñ't even visit me in the hospital? Does that seem like a daughter's duty? Ha! I'm not blessed with such a daughter!"

"You..." Katrina stuttered, lost for words, overwhelmed by the ghosts of past arguments. She had thought that once Joyce was married, she could sever her reliance on Caiden, never anticipating a day like this. If only she had known, she would have fostered a stronger bond with him. "Joyce is just a child. Why hold a  grudge against her?"

"Really? Is Joyce a child? How old is she now, still playing the child? She's a married woman with a child of her own, yet still immature? Perhaps what she really needs is a lesson in maturity. And weren't you being so arrogant a few days ago? If I hadn't kept my cool, I'd have died of rage by now!"

Tears began to stream down Katrina's cheeks. "What are you implying? Are you leaving us now? I'm still your wife!"

Caiden rose from his seat, his face a mask of indifference. "Whatever the case, I refuse to wade into Joyce's quagmire. She's not my biological daughter. If you wish to remain here, she may too. But if you're considering divorce, take Joyce with you. There's no room for either of you here."

Katrina's face crumpled with despair at his words.

Perhaps she hadn't expected Caiden to say such things, or she hadn't expected to be at a disadvantage.

Cedric leaned over and whispered to Daniela, "When did Caiden get so clear-headed?"

Daniela shook her head. "I don't know, but it's really none of my concern."

As soon as Daniela spoke, Katrina approached, her lips quivering, tears streaking her face. Cedric stood,blocking her path. "These people have nothing to do with you. Move along."

Always intimidated by Cedric, Katrina bit her lip, realizing she held no sway over anyone in the room except possibly Caiden.

Defeated,she collapsed onto the sofa, wallowing in her misfortune.

When her plight continued to be ignored, she ascended the stairs sulkily, presumably to seek an audience with Caiden.

In family disputes like these, Caiden's support was crucial; otherwise, Alexander could believe he could trample over Joyce.

What fate would befall Joyce?     Wíth a heavy heart, Katrina once again tried to softeri Caiden's stance.

One afternoon, while Cedric was occupied with a phone call outside, Katrina attempted to engage Daniela once more.

Daniela found it mildly amusing. "Whatever befalls Joyce doesn't concern me in the slightest."

"But Joyce ís still your stepsister and a stakeholder in your robotics venture. If the news breaks that she's been beaten by her husband, it could reflect poorly on you."

Daniela interrupted her smoothly, "Rest assured, it won't affect me in the slightest."

Just as Katrina opened her mouth to respond, Cedric reappeared, prompting her hasty retreat.

With dwindling options, Katrina resorted to spending a significant sum to secure a dinner with the Bennett family.

Richard already harbored disdain for Joyce, and Alexander remained a silent observer.

Cornered, Joyce shrank into herself, wvhile Caiden ate his food, leaving Katrina to confront Richard and Alexander alone.

Later, Alexander's aunt arrived and began chastising Joyce. "You've married into the Bennett family; you're one of us now. Running back to your parents over a trifling dispute? Childish, completely.childish! MMen need to let off steam after all the work; a little scuffle is nothing to fuss over. You've riled up your husband, and that's on you. If you can bear it, stay. Otherwise, the Bennett famnily does not need your presence!"

Katrina, dumbstruck, hadn't uttered a single word before being fiercely reprimanded.
###Chapter 247 You Have To Know How To Catch A Man's Eye


Alexander's aunt spat, "Either live together peacefully or consider an early divorce."

Katrina was stunned. Divorce? Joyce and Alexander had only just wedded, and already the possibility of divorce loomed.

Rumors circulated among their friends that Alexander felt no attraction towards Joyce. He found her undesirable and had never been intimate with her.

Divorcing now would only validate the rumors that Joyce was difficult.

Looking ahead, if Joyce wished to remarry or find a compatible partner, the prospects would be significantly tougher.

Additionally, the Harper family's financial situation had deteriorated.

It seemed unlikely that Caiden would offer further support. Without financial means, a divorce would leave Joyce with nothing, potentially leading her to a mismatched marriage with a divorced man.O

Katrina considered her options carefully.

As she looked at Joyce, a brief moment of uncertainty passed between them.

At that moment, Joyce offered a small smile. She recognized the necessity of enduring the day's indignities.

Katrina then addressed the room. "We are all family, and we should forgive and forget, but that does not excuse violence. Alexander, your actions were unacceptable, and I must express that."

She glanced at Alexander with a meaningful look. She meant to demand an apology from him to Joyce, but the words faltered.

Instead,she hesitated. "Well, shall we leave it there for now? Joyce, take care of yourself."

No sooner had she finished speaking than Richard and Alexander rose, disregarding Katrina entirely. As they headed out, Richard said to Joyce sharply, "Aren't you coming?"

Joyce trembled, then turned her gaze to Katrina. Her eyes conveyed deep sadness and a silent plea for understanding.

A sharp pain gripped Katrina's heart. She moved her lips as if to speak but instead turned away, resigning herself to silence.

As Joyce prepared to leave, she spoke icily. "Mom, this is all on you! Everything bad happening is because of you! If you hadn't pushed me to sabotage Daniela's wedding, they wouldn't have split, and I wouldn't be trapped in this violent marriage. This is all because of your schemes!"

With those words, Joyce exited.

Katrina's head drooped, tears streaming down her face before she was overcome by sobbing.

She had spent years manipulating events, never foreseeing such a tragic outcome for her daughter.②

Katrina went back to home, appearing visibly drained.

She spent several days confined to her bed, leaving Caiden to speculate about her demise.

Caiden, however, was indifferent. He was quite content. He filled his days with securing sponsorships and deals for Harper Group, making a modest income and enjoying social outings. His life continued pleasantly.

Since neither Katrina nor Joyce viewed him as family, his efforts seemed pointless.

Nonetheless, he had the villa, and Daniela, showing compassion, had not evicted him. He believed she would arrange a proper funeral for him if he died.

Caiden never talked to Daniela about this, but he was very confident.

Eventually, Caiden concluded that their familial connection was the reason Daniela would never abandon him.

With this thought, he felt at ease.

At times, glimpsing at Daniela reminded him of Brylee. Initially, Brylee had intimidated him, but now he was thankful to her.

He was thankful for the capable daughter she had brought into his life.

After resting for three days, Katrina's resolve hardened.

Caiden continued to ignore her. She purchased many gifts and went to see Joyce.

Upon returning, her eyes swollen and red, Katrina retreated to her room for another day of rest.

Daniela spent her days casually watching television, with Cedric keeping her company.

Observing them whispering together, Katrina turned to Shirley and advised, "You can't just sit there idly. You need to learn how to attract a man's interest."
###Chapter 248 Shirley


Shirley tilted her head to look at Katrina.

Katrina began to share her strategies for captivating Caiden.

"You need to use strengths, Shirley. You're attractive and beautiful, but you have one flaw: you're too proud.You may attract those less fortunate men, but high-ranking men don't appreciate women like that. They prefer women who are simple."

Shirley was doubtful upon hearing this. "Really? I think Cedric actually prefers proud women. Look at how reserved Daniela is; he always makes the first move with her."

"What do you know?" Katrina scoffed. "Are you Daniela? Do you have the brains to be a CEO like her at Elite Lux? Or are you as beautiful as Daniela? You have nothing to boast about, yet you refuse to be humble.What advantage do you have?"

Shirley pressed her lips together. She knew how to attract men, but she was unsure how to approach someone as brilliant as Cedric.

Cedric's position was too high, unlike the men she could easily enchant with a simple smile. Except for Daniela,nothing seemed to catch his interest.

That day, during Caiden and Katrina's argument, the living room was buzzing with whispers.

Cedric was an exception. He didn't spare a glance for Caiden and Katrina; his eyes were fixed on Daniela,showing such deep admiration that Shirley felt a chill of hopelessness.

She thought she stood no chance.	0

Yet Cedric seemed too ideal, his status high, like the moon unreachable in the sky.

His gentle attention towards Daniela sparked envy in her; she longed for such devotion for herself.

Gritting her teeth, Shirley said to Katrina, "I'll try once more, but I may need your assistance." As she finished speaking, the door swung open.

Joyce walked in with a look of displeasure, and Katrina could see she had faced mistreatment by the Bennett family once again.

Initially, Katrina's attempt to pair Shirley with Cedric had been merely an experiment.

But now, if Joyce was indeed unsuccessful with the Bennett family, Katrina realized she would depend entirely on Shirley.

Katrina quickly devised a strategy and assured Shirley. "Alright, I'Il work with you on this."

Shirley nodded, her smile returning, and then she headed to the courtyard to call her family.

Her grandmother possessed an aphrodisiac that, once consumed, induced a strong physical urge, relieved only by having sex.

The aphrodisiac was powerful, needing just a small amount to be effective, and it was harmless, even beneficial to one's health.

Katrina was aware that Shirley planned to request this special aphrodisiac from her family. Joyce sat on the living room couch, sneering with disdain in her eyes.

Katrina, visibly irritated, asked, "What's the matter with you today?"

"What do you think? Alexander hasn't come home again. He was seen flirting with a celebrity on camera yesterday. Just look at the man you chose for me! I could have picked anyone in Olisvine and been better off.Do you know what people are saying about me? Even the servants of the Bennett family think I'm like a forgotten wife!"

Joyce's eyes drifted to Shirley in the courtyard, her emotions in turmoil, and she vented her frustration on Katrina. "Are you even my mother?"

Katrina sighed and asked, "Why the sarcasm? What are you trying to say?"

Joyce gestured towards Shirley outside. "Why do you let Shirley try to win over Cedric, but you forced me to marry Alexander? Why?" Everyone knew that Cedric was far superior to Alexander.

"If I had married Cedric, I'm sure he would have treated me well and never hurt me. Mom, I'm your daugter.Why would you offer such a good man to someone else?"

Katrina retorted, "Joyce, do you have any conscience? Didn't I encourage you to go after Cedric? You failed on your own, and now you blame me?"

Katrina was visibly exhausted. "You never reflect on yourself. Why do you always hold me responsible for everything? I think I've spoiled you far too much!"

Joyce had endured enough disrespectful stares from others recently. The last thing she expected was harsh criticism from Katrina at home.

She lost control, hurling objects around the house in her fury.

As she stormed out, she cast a heartbroken look at Katrina. "People say that once a daughter is married,she's no longer part of her original family. I never grasped that until now. It seems I'm not as dear to you as your niece!"

With those words, Joyce left, left a trail of mess behind her.

Caiden came downstairs, saw the chaos, and remained silent, as if unconcerned. He stepped around,avoiding the debris, turned on the television, and settled down to watch.

When Shirley returned indoors, she exchanged a glance with Katrina and gave a subtle nod. She whispered to Katrina, "My mom said she'll send it."

Katrina gazed at Shirley and felt that her future hopes now rested upon her.
###Chapter 249 Look Like A Couple


While Shirley bided her time, she was far from inactive.

In the game of seducing men, Katrina believed Shirley played a smarter hand than Joyce.

As Shirley circled Cedric like a hawk, Caiden warned, "Take this seriously, Katrina. Don't stir the pot with Cedric."

Katrina paused, turning to give him a curious look. "Well, well, I thought you had taken a vow of silence.Seems you can still speak after all!"

Her eyes danced with mockery as she probed, "What's the matter now? Think Daniela's your new champion, and you're ready to curry favor? You certainly know how to sail with the wind, Caiden."

"I'd love to curry favor with her, but that would require Daniela giving me the time of day," Caiden retorted with frankness. "I'm not here to chat with you. I'm warning you-don't poke the bear with Daniela. Shemay not sweat the small stuff, but cross her lines, and she can make your life a living hell."

Caiden eyed Katrina's scornful smirk and added, "Don't underestimate her. I'm concerned you might just get us thrown out of this villa. It's always the still waters that run deep."

Katrina smirked, unimpressed. "Oh really? And just how terrifying might that be?"

"A woman like her didn't climb to her current heights by playing the damsel. Get the picture?" Caiden replied,his tone matter-of-fact.

Without a knack for cutthroat tactics in the business realm, one would quickly be swallowed whole, leaving not a trace behind.

Katrina, cloistered from the corporate battlefield, wouldn't grasp such complexities. Before her marriage to Caiden, she was but a housemaid.

What could she truly comprehend? Her expertise lay solely in the arts of coquettlsh manipulation.

Her counsel to Joyce and Shirley on handling men was invariably woven from the same thread.

Realizing further conversation was futile,Caiden awaited Daniela at the door as she finished her day's work.

"What's up?" Daniela inquired, not lifting her gaze from her phone. "I'm swamped right now. If it's trivial,please step aside."

Caiden asked, "Is Cedric trivial enough for your time?"

That caught her attention. Her eyes flicked up fromn her phone to his face.

Caiden stole a glance at her phone, noting a screen filled with figures.

Daniela pocketed her device."Speak!"

Caiden divulged, "Shirley is attempting to charm Cedric."

Daniela's initial reaction was dismissive, but her hand paused midway to her pocket as Caiden continued,"They're going to make Cedric take an aphrodisiac."

Daniela's fingers slowly uncurled. Her face clouded over for a brief moment before she regained her usual poise."Understood," she acknowledged, then entered the house.

Watching Daniela's composed figure, Caiden couldn't help but contrast her with Joyce and Shirley.

The difference was night and day.

He suddenly questioned what he ever found appealing in Katrina.

What was she, after all?

Daniela returned home.

Josie mentioned that Cedric had just returned from his business trip.

As she spoke, the door to Cedric's room swung open. "You're back." Daniela nodded. "I thought you were on a business trip! Why are you back so soon?"

Cedric approached, taking her bag as they ascended the stairs together. His voice, low and husky, carried a hint of warmth. "I wanted to be back early. And I missed you."

A small smile played on Daniela's lips.

Shirley observed their ascent to the room. The apple she had peeled, originally intended for Cedric, seemed redundant now; she ended up eating it herself. Suddenly, a thought struck her.

Turning to the servant, she remarked, "Don't you think Daniela and Cedric seem almost too comfortable with each other? So relaxed..."

"They look like a couple!" Josie chimed in cheerfully.

Shirley nodded in agreement. "Exactly! Like a couple!"

###Chapter 250 | Love Daniela


Shirley's face blanched upon hearing the news.

She had always sensed something unusual about Daniela and Cedric's interaction, and now it seemed there was a deep bond between them.

Eager for answers, Shirley quickly sought out Katrina to discuss her concerns.

"You're reading too much into it" Katrina remarked assuredly while tending to her flowers. "Their relationship is purely platonic. Consider how Daniela treats Ryan. She's kind to him as well. They couldn't be married. If there were, Daniela wouldn't keep it hidden. Why should she hide Cedric?"

Shirley wasn't entirely convinced by Katrina's reassurances.

"Listen," Katrina added, "Daniela is much like her mother-hard to understand, but deeply loyal once you get to know her. I was merely a servant, yet Brylee treated me like family. Some people genuinely go out of their way for those they value."

This trust had enabled Katrina to marry Caiden.

"If there was anything official between them, given their prominence, it wouldn't remain a secret. They just share a close bond."

Shirley nodded, though her gaze drifted back upstairs, wondering about the allure of Daniela's room that kept Cedric returning so often.

Lillian shared her confusion. "Something's really off," she commented to Ryan, who was seated on the floor,immersed in his coding.

"What's up?" Ryan asked distractedly.

"Daniela and Cedric have been acting oddly lately."

"Really?" Liflian explained, "They're distant in public but seem close at home, watching TV together. I initially thought they might have quarreled, but Cedric spends hours In Daniela's room."

Ryan, having stayed up all night working on a complex programming task, multitasked between coding and responding to Lifian without breaking his focus.

Lillian nudged Ryan, asking, "What's going on with them? Are they fighting or getting closer?"

Ryan dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. "No way, those two can't really fight."

"Are they together then?" Lilian speculated.

Again, Ryan shook his head. "Daniela's not easy to win over. Cedric would need a decade at least to make any headway."

At that moment, Cedric descended the stairs, overhearing the tail end of Ryan's remarks.

He cleared his throat, feigning irritation. "What's this now? I'm just trying to get some work done.Why bring me down? Do you really think I'm that hopeless? Ten more years? How old do you think I'll be?"

Lillian caught sight of Cedric and felt a familiar twinge. She whispered to Ryan,"Did you see how Cedric just smiled? It's rare to see him smile that broadly."

Ryan,preoccupied with a remote meeting, didn't notice. He responded nonchalantly, "Yeah, he's been smiling more often lately. It's not that unusual."

Lillian sensed something amiss.

After taking a shower, Cedric was about to head upstairs to see Daniela.

As he opened the door, Lillian's gaze followed every move. "Heading upstairs again?" she called out.

Cedric halted, then turned back, walking towards the living room instead. He casually picked up the remote."No, just planning to watch some TV."

Lillian squinted, skeptical. "Really? You seemed pretty set on going upstairs."

Cedric, who had initially wanted to go up but knew Daniela preferred to keep things discreet, turned to the television and responded cryptically, "You must be imagining things."

Lillian frowned. "I'm not the one with illusions, Cedric. Just be careful with Daniela."

Cedric smiled to himself, reflecting inwardly. He wasn't there to cause trouble. He was utterly enchanted by her.
###Chapter 251 He Didn't Bother To Be Polite


Lilian was a bundle of nerves as she went to Daniela's room. "Daniela, Cedric has been behaving rather oddly lately."

Daniela was engrossed in her puzzle, hardly looking up as she mirrored Ryan's earlier dismissive tone."Oh,really?"

Liflian grasped Daniela's hand. "Seriously, don't brush this off. Men either simmer in silence or erupt without warning. I think he's teetering on the edge, about to lose it!"

It was the first time Daniela had encountered such a colorful portrayal. She burst into laughter, unable to contain herself.

Lillian squinted with a hint of mischief. "Daniela, I suspect his eccentricity stems from his long, unsuccessful campaign to win your heart."

Meanwhile, downstairs, Cedric was channel surfing, unimpressed by the offerings. His gaze drifted upstairs,restless. No television drama could hold a candle to the intrigue of observing Daniela.

Shirley approached with a bottle of juice, leaning in to subtly showcase her figure. "It's sweltering today.Have some juice."

Cedric barely acknowledged her, nudging her aside with the remote. "You're blocking the view!"

Shirley's grip on the bottle tightened.

Was Cedric even interested in women?

He just passed up a golden opportunity.

Or perhaps his interests lay elsewhere?

Shirley studied Cedric's chiseled features. A sudden realization dawned on her, widening her eyes in shock.

She turned incredulously to glance at Ryan sitting nearby.

Could it be that Cedric preferred Ryan?

Shirley's voice wavered. "What do you think of Ryan?"

Cedric glanced at her, reading her like an open book. After a brief pause,he nodded."He's great," he affirmed, giving Ryan's leg a casual pat. Ryan remained oblivious, but Shirley's world seemed to crumble.

"Do you like men?" Shirley lowered her voice.

"That's right," Cedric responded without missing a beat. But in truth, his heart yearned for women, Daniela in particular.

Shirley's face turned pale and she forced a smile. "Alright then. I'll keep your secret."

"Good. I hold a high position, and discretion is paramount. It could impact my business."

Shirley nodded. "Okay, thank you for trusting me! I promise I won't tell a soul!"

Cedric nodded internally, adding silently,"Thanks."

Shirley's mind was abuzz.

It took her a moment to find her footing, moving with awkward haste.

Soon after, she hastily gathered her belongings and departed, leaving Katrina confused and perplexed.

What was going on?

Why the sudden exit?

Katrina attempted to intercept her, but Shirley didn't even glance back, rebuking, "Before matchmaking, you should at least get your facts straight. You've wasted so much of my time."

Katrina, puzzled, responded, "What do you mean?" "What do I mean? I mean exactly what I said! I promised not to tell anyone, but now I see why Cedric frequents Daniela's room as if it were his own, and why she trusts him impticitly. Now it all makes sense!"

With that, Shirley stormed off, teaving Katrina standing there, utterly thrown off.

What did she mean?

What was really happening?

What on earth had gone down?

By the time Katrina tried to follow her, Shirley was already out of sight.

Back in the living room, Ryan was doubled over with laughter. "Does Shirley has a brain? What was she even thinking? How could she possibly believe you like me?"

Cedric dealt with the situation silently.

When Katrina reentered the room, her expression stormy, she demanded, "Cedric, what did you say to Shirley? Why did she leave in tears? Did you mistreat her?"

Cedric didn't bother to be polite, turning with a sharp, cold stare. "Do you really think I'm someone to be trampled upon?"

Cedric's gaze was piercing, sending a chill down Katrina's spine.

###Chapter 252 Cedric Likes Men


Katrina couldn't get an answer from Cedric, so she turned to Shirley for it.

At first, Shirley seemed determined to keep her lips sealed.

But under Katrina's relentless questioning, she finally relented. "Cedric likes men."

The confession landed like a thunderbolt, leaving Katrina utterly stunned and scrambling to process it."Excuse me,what?"

Shirley, sensing there was no point in sugarcoating, laid it out plainly. "He told me himself. And I even had someone look into it-Cedric has never dated a woman."

Katrina's nerves frayed as she pressed, "Has he dated men?"

"No,but..."

Katrina felt a flicker of relief, but Shirley continued, "His secretary? They've been together for over ten years. Before that, they were classmates. And yes, he's a man."

Katrina quickly dismissed it. "That hardly proves anything."

"His driver, too," Shirley added. "Another man who's been by his side for just as long."

Katrina bit her lip, stubbornly insisting, "That still doesn't mean anything significant."

"And what about Ryan?" Shirley pressed. "Cedric gets along with him too. Think about it-Cedric may seem distant, but he has close ties with many men. Women approach him all the time, given his status, but he's never chosen one. Why do you think that is?".

Katrina struggled to come up with a reply.

"Aunt Katrina, if you were a man with a good job, plenty of money, and lots of influence-everything looking perfect-but you never got married or even had a long-term girlfriend, what do you think that would mean?" That doesn't prove he's into men," Katrina said, refusing to back down.

"Maybe, but doesn't it at least suggest he has little interest in women? I even hired a private investigator.Did you know all his secretaries are men? For a company of that size, it's practically unheard of! Not a single woman. In a country this big, where else would you find something like that? Doesn't that raise a flag?"

Her rapid-fire explanation left Katrina in a daze. She faltered for a moment, barely managing to murmur, "But Daniela is a woman, isn't she?"

"Daniela's the exception, the only one," Shirley replied firmly. "Even with Lillian, Cedric is distant. Maybe he doesn't see Daniela as a typical woman. To him, she's more like a man, someone strong enough to manage an empire that massive. She's anything but ordinary."

Katrina sat in silence for a moment, only to realize Shirley had already hung up.

With that conversation still lingering in her mind, Katrina went back to observing Cedric.

He seemed unbothered by her watchful gaze, as long as she didn't interfere with Daniela.

A few days passed, and Joyce stormed into the house with tears streaming down her face as she vented her frustrations.

When no one downstairs gave her the attention she craved, she marched upstairs to find Katrina.

"Mom, I've had enough! I want a divorce!" Joyce burst out the moment she stepped into the room.

Katrina sighed, already weary, as Joyce launched into a tirade. "Alexander doesn't love me at all! All he ever thinks about is work. He just got back from a trip two weeks ago, and now he's saying he has to leave again.I even checked-he barely traveled for business before. It's so obvious he's just avoiding me."

Katrina let out another sigh. "Didn't I tell you to adjust your attitude last time? Did you do that?"

"Of course I did!" Joyce shot back indignantly. "I followed your advice-l even offered him a massage after work. And you know what he said? He didn't even look at me and just muttered something about not being into massages!"

Katrina sighed yet again. "And what happened next?" "Of course, I got mad! Mom, Alexander has completely changed. He's not the same person anymore. If I'd known he'd turn out like this, I would've never married him. I'm still young, and I didn't sign up for a marriage where I'd feel so ignored. I'm serious, Mom. I want a divorce. If this continues, don't be surprised if I have an affair.

Katrina's eyes widened in shock as she slapped Joyce's hand. "Are you out of your mind? You can't just say things like that! If word gets out, your reputation will be ruined."

Joyce pouted, her defiance apparent. "Then you figure it out. I've got my own money now. The first dividend from the robotics company just came in-over three million! I don't need the Bennett family anymore, so why should I be scared of Alexander?"

Joyce's sudden confidence was fueled by the unexpected windfall.

While the robotics company's dividends weren't regular, the payouts were undeniably substantial.

With three million already in her account, just a few more payouts would ensure she was well off.

She wasn't about to live like a widow while still so young.

If Alexander insisted on ignoring her, she'd make her own fun elsewhere.

After all,Alexander would be the one losing face.

While talking, Joyce transferred five hundred thousand to Katrina before asking, "Where's Shirley?"

Katrina nodded as she noticed the transfer. "She's gone."

Joyce's head snapped up at the response. "She's gone? Wait, don't tell me she's done with Cedric," she asked, her eyes glinting with curiosity.

"She thinks Cedric might be into men," Katrina said, feeling like her luck couldn't get any worse.

Joyce's eyes lit up with a mischievous glint."Oh,really?"

Then without another word, she headed downstairs.

Downstairs, the living room was alive with the hum of the TV. Cedric sat off to one side, his long fingers idly stroking the fluffy head of a little dog resting by his side.
###Chapter 253 Doubt


Joyce had never confessed it to anyone, but she had a peculiar fascination with hands.

The very frst time she laid eyes on Cedric, her attention was immediately drawn to his hands/

They were striking, long, and impeccably clean, with neatly trimmed nails that gleamed faintly under the light.

His hands were a perfect blend of strength and elegance, exuding an effortless grace in every movement,no matter how mundane.

Now,as she watched him gently stroke the head of a fluffy little puppy, a strange flutter stirred within her.

Shirley had dared to approach him, so why shouldn't she?

With Daniela momentarily out of the room to take a phone call, Joyce made her way downstairs and took a seat beside Cedric.

Mindful of his reputation for valuing personal space, she maintained a polite distance-close enough to speak, yet far enough to avoid making him uneasy.

"Cedric, do you like Daniela?"

It was a question that didn't really require a response. Cedric's feelings for Daniela were practically common knowledge. But Joyce had her reasons for asking.

Predictably, Cedric stayed silent.

"Shirley filled me in about you," Joyce pressed on. "Cedric, let's make a deal."

Cedric kept his eyes glued to the television, showing no interest in her words.

Joyce, certain that Cedric was listening despite his indifference, carried on. "I'll leave Alexander and marry you.Someone of your status will need to settle down eventually and have a family. I'll give you complete freedom, and all I ask is ten million a month. What do you think?"

Cedric finally turned his head, giving Joyce a cool glance before chuckling. "Not much to look at, but your ambitions sure are bold."

Convinced she had an edge, Joyce pushed further. "No matter how close Daniela is to you, she's only interested in men. She's no help to you. You'd be better off choosng me."

Daniela walked back into the room, catching the tail end of Joyce's statement.

Narrowing her eyes, she asked, "Choose who?"

Joyce was fully aware of how crucial it was to stay on Daniela's good side, especially now that Daniela was running the robotics company. "Oh, it's nothing. We were just chatting about a TV show."

Joyce rose to leave but leaned close to whisper to Cedric, "Think it over," before making her way upstairs.

Daniela took her seat, but before she could say a word, Cedric gently tapped her fingers.

Their fingers were just about to intertwine when Lillian unexpectedly turned around.

Cedric reflexively straightened up as Lillian squinted at him and asked,"Cedric, what were you doing just now?"

Cedric couldn't help but think that crowded places were definitely not for him. He couldn't even hold his wife's hand.

With a quiet sigh, he shrugged it off and said casually, "Just watching TV."

From that point on, Lillian kept turning around, even going out of her way to physically separate them.

Cedric clenched his jaw, narrowed his eyes, and glanced over at Ryan, who was engrossed in typing. "Would you mind taking her out of here? I'd really appreciate it."

Ryan let out a brief chuckle. "Sorry, but I don't make the rules."

Cedric clicked his tongue in frustration. "How can you be so spineless?" Ryan looked up with a grin, his eyes clearly saying, "Same goes for you."

That night, Cedric remained in the living room, stretching his stay until midnight.

He assumed Daniela had already turned in, yet Lillian was still wide awake.

"Liflian, why are you staring at me like that?" he asked.

"You're acting oddly. Cedric, let me make something clear: loving someone doesn't mean you have to be with them. Do you understand what I mean?"

Cedric muttered,"Yes."

Despite his exhaustion, he couldn't suppress a feeling of smugness.

Loving someone didn't equate to being with them

Yet,he already had her.

Daniela was his wife, after all.

It had been a whole month now.

Lillian fixed him with a steady stare, and Cedric, feeling cornered, quickly sent a message to Ryan, who was still in the room.

Ryan set aside his laptop, stood, and suggested, "Lillian, come join me for a late-night snack."

Lillian declined with a curt,"NO."

Ryan nodded nonchalantly."Oh, well, I'll go alone then. That place had great food last time."

He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

Cedric leaned back in his chair with a faint smile playing on his lips. "The restaurant owner is quite friendly,too. She's made a few hints about wanting to have a fling with Ryan."

Lillian sprang to her feet and dashed after Ryan. Cedric chuckled to himself, turned off the TV, and headed upstairs.

Daniela, though exhausted, hadn't quite drifted off. She could tell the instant Cedric entered the room.

Cedric gently lifted the blanket, taking care not to disturb her at first.

When the warmth of the room seeped in, he reached out and pulled Daniela into his embrace.
###Chapter 254 Can't It Be Made Public


Daniela, feeling sleepy, couldn't suppress a smile. "Did Ryan take Lillian out?"

Cedric sighed, pulling her closer. "Yeah, she was being stubborn. I almost didn't think I'd make it here tonight."

Daniela closed her eyes, a smile curling on her lips.

Cedric suggested, "Can't we just make it public? Not even to Ryan or Lillian?"

Daniela nestled deeper into Cedric's arms, seeking warmth. She feared the cold, and his embrace brought comfort.

She was used to sleep in his arms now.

"Ryan can know, but if Lillian hears about-it with her big mouth, the entire world will know. I still have things to sort out."

More than the rumors about their relationship, she feared people uncovering her weaknesses.

"Don't come upstairs tomorrow. I can handle sleeping by myself," she added.

"But when I'm not here, you never sleep soundly."

Daniela often struggled with sleep, finding it hard to rest deeply. In the past, she would turn to Cedric's puzzles, working on them until she was tired enough to fall asleep.

Eventually, she realized that with Cedric beside her, she could finally sleep soundly.

She had stopped doing puzzles altogether, and the ones scattered on the floor hadn't been touched in over two weeks.

Just now, she felt a little tired, but still, sleep wouldn't come easily. Daniela sighed to herself, marveling at how quickly habits could shift. In just half a month, her insomnia, which had lasted for years, seemed to have improved.

"I'd eventually fall asleep," Daniela murmured, her voice drowsy, as her breathing evened out.

Joyce,on the other hand, was still waiting for Cedric's answer.

In the meantime, she had gone back home once.

"Going back to your parents' place again?" Richard asked, his tone indifferent as he looked at her.

Joyce didn't entertain him and replied curtly with a simple "Yes."

"I heard Daniela's robotics company paid out dividends?"

Joyce let out a scornful snort. "Yes, they did."

Richard looked down on Joyce's arrogance. His friends were curious about the amount of the first dividend from the robotics company. Since Joyce held a small stake, Richard didn't pay much attention when he asked about it.

Joyce curled her lips into a smirk. "Three million last time, and another three million this morning."

"What?" Richard felt a surge of unease. "Is that the total amount distributed, or what you actually received?"

Joyce gave Richard a look of pure disdain. "Are you serious? A company as large as a robotics firm-how could three million be enough for everyone? I'm just a minor shareholder with no say in the company. How would I know the total distributed? That's the actual amount I received."

As soon as she said this, Richard's eyes brightened.

Joyce hadn't done a thing, yet just because Caiden had knelt to Daniela that time, she somehow struck it rich--six million just like that?

If he had the chance, Richard wouldn't hesitate to kneel as well.

Sadly,he wasn't fortunate enough to have a daughter like Daniela.

His lips tightened in frustration. If Alexander hadn't chosen to divorce Daniela because of Joyce, Richard would be the one on top in Olisvine today.

The more he thought about it, the more he loathed Joyce.

His anger deepened as he remembered how she had manipulated things to turn against Alexander.

Joyce then headed upstairs, slipped into an outfit that screamed confidence, and left the house.

As she passed, she didn't even spare him a glance, her arrogance unmistakable.

Richard,irritated,wasted no time complaining as soon as Alexander walked in.

"What kind of woman did you marry? She's acting like I'm not even her father-in-law. Don't you see that,Alexander? Daniela's robotics company is raking in the cash, and Joyce is acting so smug about it. She even told the servants she won't be back for dinner. I'm telling you, Joyce has some dangerously ambitious plans.You'd better keep an eye on her, or she'll end up causing a scandal."

Alexander set his briefcase down, his attention elsewhere. "The company is brand new. How much could they possibly distribute? A few hundred thousand, at most. Joyce might splurge on a couple of inexpensive bags, but that's all."

Hearing this, Richard dramatically raised his fingers."Joyce claimed they distributed this amount. They did it last week and again this morning. Looks like Daniela's business is quite successful!"

Alexander glanced at his fingers and fell silent, contemplating for a long moment.

"That's not possible," Alexander muttered as he hung his coat. "Her company hasn't been around long enough to distribute that much. Everyone knows tech startups need heavy investment, and it takes years before they even break even. There's no way they could give out so much so soon."。

Richard remarked, "Joyce let it slip this morning. She can't keep anything under wraps."

Alexander retorted, "She has to be lying."

Richard didn't respond further. The atmosphere became heavy with silence.

"I'll give Raul a call. He made a small investment," Richard said as he dialed the number.

The call was answered promptly, and Richard went straight to the point.

Raul clicked his tongue twice. "You're well-informed, Richard. The funds just came in this morning, and you're already in the loop. Daniela certainly knows how to run a business. Have you heard the gossip?
###Chapter 255 Joyce And Alexander Had A Fight


Richard had a sinking feeling that this wouldn't be good news. Without thinking, he asked, "What is it?"

Raul replied, "Everyone's on the same page that the Bennettfamily made a huge mistake. How could they let go of such a talented daughter-in-law and bring back someone like Joyce instead? The word around town is to stop worrying about other investments and just follow Daniela's example. Whatever she puts money in, we should too. Just a little bit of her success would be enough to keep us comnfortable."

Richard's feelings became more tangled.

"Richard, we have a network that focuses on the elites at Elite Lux, collecting insider information. We often send gifts to find out what Daniela's involved with. Would you like to be a part of it?" Raul asked.

Richard was tempted, yet a sense of shame held him back. "There's no need for that. This might just be a lucky break. Don't get ahead of yourself; be careful not to overstep."

Raul laughed lightly. "You sound so cynical, Richard. Fine, if you're not interested, it's your call. We don't have many spots left, anyway. The fee's now two million, and we're full.Bye."

The calI ended, and Richard felt even more downhearted.

He had heard of that association before, but he had no idea just how exclusive it was.

With over two thousand members, all scrambling to win Daniela's favor.

What shocked him, though, was the price of entry-two million!

It was downright ridiculous!

The room fell into a heavy silence.

Finally, Richard turned to Alexander with a sudden thought and asked,"Do you think we should join this association? Is there still a chance we could get involved with that robotics company? Could Joyce assist us?" Alexander's expression remained icy. "You're better off relying on yourself than depending on others. Don't join that association; it's beneath you."

Without another word, he headed upstairs.

Richard let out a heavy sigh. It was, indeed, humiliating.

The gossip going around was that Alexander had traded a priceless gem for something completely worthless.

Richard had pushed away a perfectly good daughter-in-law, and now, joining her association would make him the laughingstock.

But what choice did he have? There was too much money on the line.

Reluctantly,Richard decided to keep pushing forward and went to seek out Joyce for help.

"So, you're saying you want to invest in the robotics company?" she asked.

Richard nodded, offering a charming smile. "Exactly. After all, Daniela is your sister, and your influence counts for a lot."

Joyce sneered in response. "So now you recognize my worth? Now you're flattering me? Who was it that called me useless? And now you want my help? Forget it!"

Joyce never missed an opportunity to speak her mind.

She took pleasure in putting people down with her sharp words.

Though seething with anger, Richard swallowed his pride. "We don't need much,just 5% shares."

Joyce was even more satisfied, looking down at Richard with contempt. "Who do you think you are? Do you really believe you're worthy of this? When Alexander married me, you barely cared. When he hit me,you didn't defend me. Have you ever treated me like family? People say Alexander can't stand me. Did you ever stand up for me? And now, just because there's a benefit, you want to use me? You've got some nerve."

Richard's eyes went wide in shock. This wasn't the response he had hoped for. No one had ever spoken to him in such a way before.

However, Joyce kept her cold smile in place and continued, "You don't see me as a person, and frankly, I don't care about you either. Now that I have money, you think you can use me to get close to Daniela?Dream on!"

Richard was practically shaking with fury.

Joyce relished the moment more and more. "I love watching you squirrn. Aren't you all so proud? And now you have to lower yourselves to me? How pathetic!"

Richard's fingers quivered as he pointed at Joyce's arrogant face. "Who are you calling pathetic?"

"You!"

Suddenly, a sharp slap echoed through the room.

Joyce stood still for a moment, stunned, before wiping her mouth and noticing the blood.

Narrowing her eyes, she stood tall and coldly stared up at Alexander, who was a head taller than her.

"You actually hit me? I'll make you pay for that!"

With that, she charged at Alexander, but he responded by slapping her hard again.

Enraged, Joyce lost all control, her fury erupting as she began smashing everything she could get her hands on in the house.

Alexander stood off to the side, watching with a calm expression. His indifference only fueled Joyce's anger.In a fit of rage, she stormed into the kitchen and returned with a knife in hand.

The two clashed fiercely, the tension escalating with every passing second.

During the fight, Alexander was slashed.

Richard's anger. boiled over, his body trembling with rage as he dialed the police.

When Katrina received the call, she was stunned. Alexander was planning to charge Joyce with attempted murder?

It seemed utterly ridiculous to her.

Panic surged through Katrina as her eyes met Caiden's icy stare.

After a brief pause, Caiden turned his gaze elsewhere.

Katrina clenched her teeth as the door to the villa creaked open.
###Chapter 256 Happiness Comes Suddenly


Daniela entered the house.

Katrina's eyes lit up when she saw Daniela, almost as if she were looking at someone who could save her.

However, she knew that asking help for Daniela would be futile. Daniela would never agree to go with her to the hospital.

Hurriedly, she approached Daniela and said with urgency, "Daniela, Cedric's in the hospital! He called and said you need to come right away."

Without giving her a chance to protest, she pushed Daniela out the door.

As the driver sped through the streets, Daniela narrowed her eyes at Katrina, her gaze so cold it felt like it could freeze the very air between them. "Say that again," she demanded.

Katrina could sense Daniela's presence growing more formidable, and she began to feel a twinge of fear.

Nervously laughing, Katrina added, "Well, Joyce got into trouble, and there's no one else who can deal with it. Please, I'm begging you; come with me to the hospital."

Daniela's face hardened.

At this moment, the car pulled up at the hospital entrance.

Katrina practically dragged Daniela towards the hospital, her urgency clear.

But Daniela pulled her hand away sharply, walking inside on her own without a second glance.
 
Katrina hurried after her. "I knew you still think of us as family."

Daniela's lips curled into a smirk, but her tone quickly turned serious. "If this happens again, the consequences will affect Joyce's financial interests."

Katrina's face drained of color at her words. She understood that Daniela was talking about the five percent stake in the robotics company.

"It won't happen again. Thanks for coming."

"There's no need to thank me. I just want to see how the things you fought so hard to steal are now leading to your downfal," Danlela replied, her tone biting.

Katrina was left speechless.

They both then made their way into the hospital.

From down the corridor, Joyce's angry voice echoed.

Alexander stood quietly to one side, his hand wrapped in a bandage from a recent injury.

The police were trying to mediate, and as they drew closer, the first thing they heard was an officer's defeated remark. "If this doesn't resolve, file a lawsuit."

Katrina hurried forward with a nervous grin."It's just a family dispute, nothing serious," she said, trying to defuse the tension.

Daniela showed no interest in sticking around. Her attention was focused on responding to Cedric's messages.

As she sent the message, Joyce's sharp voice cut through, coldly demanding of Alexander,"Where are you looking with those eyes?"

In that moment, Alexander truly grasped the vast differences between people.

His first marriage had been with Daniela, who had divorced him with courage and clarity, walking away with nothing but offering them both a dignified exit.

This had led him to believe that divorce could be a dignified solution when a marriage fell apart.

But with Joyce,.everything was different. He found himself struggling to adjust to her domineering nature.

So why hadn't he divorced Joyce yet? Because he knew that, this time, there would be no dignity in it.

Joyce was not a woman of grace-she wielded her crude power to crush everything around her,leaving no room for honor or respect.

In Joyce's world, the idea of losing simply didn't exist.

in the hospital corridor, heavy with the smell of disinfectant, Alexander gazed at Daniela's luminous profile from a distance, regretting his rash decision to divorce her for the thousandth time.

Joyce was escorted away,being led to a quieter space to calm down.

Feeling the situation was boring, Daniela was about to leave when Alexander approached her. "I'm sorry you had to be part of this awkward situation."

His demeanor had changed dramatically, but Daniela didn't care to explore it and had no interest in engaging. She gave a slight nod before turning to walk away.

Alexander stood still with a conflicted expression.

Richard, eager to smooth things over, quickly caught up with her, a chuckle slipping from his lips. "Daniela,let me walk you out. I apologize for you having to witness all this mess today."

Daniela said nothing in response.

In the elevator, Richard flashed a smile and leaned in."We've known each other a long time, Daniela, so I'll get straight to the point. I was wondering if your robotics company is still accepting investments.I have some funds and was thinking of contributing."

Daniela made her way to the hospital entrance.

Cedric's car was parked and waiting outside.

She remained silent, yet Richard persisted in following her.

Just as Daniela was about to get into the car, Richard, unwilling to let go, called out to her. "Daniela, we wronged you in the past, but that's all behind us now. Marrying someone like Joyce, well, that's Alexander's karma. Please don't hold that against us. I don't have grand ambitions; I just want to dip my toes into a small investment. A million would barely make a dent for me. Can you allow me to be involved?"

Daniela turned her gaze toward Richard. After a brief pause, she finally responded, "Alright."

She understood that sometimes, to earn, you had to invest.

"I'll have someone reach out to you soon. Make sure you're ready with the funds," she added.

Richard was over the moon at her response.

He never saw this stroke of fortune coming.

He was so thrilled, his excitement almost spilling over.

At the same time, a part of him regretted not asking for more earlier.

A million? That was small change.

Richard, practically bubbling with excitement, could hardly contain himself as he rushed upstairs to tell Alexander the good news. "Daniela agreed. She's letting me invest!"

Alexander, taken aback by the unexpected turn of events, was even more surprised than Richard had been.
###Chapter 257 Aren't You Angry


Richard couldn't hide his satisfaction. "It's not a huge amount, but we can build on it over time. Alexander,Daniela's really a kind soul. I made a sincere apology earlier, and at first, she didn't respond, but when l mentioned it was my life savings, she started to soften. Daniela is nothing like that cold-hearted Joyce.Despite how you neglected her before, she never held a grudge against you. I must say, she's a gem. You're truly missing out."

Alexander was overwhelmed with a mix of emotions.

Standing silently in the cold corridor, he whispered to himself, "If I truly apologize, will she forgive me?"

As he reflected on this, he felt a subtle warmth begin to thaw the coldness that had taken root in his heart.

Maybe it wasn't the right time yet. Perhaps he should wait just a little longer.

He would wait until Bennett Group was running smoothly again and securing a significant project. Then,he could approach Daniela and ask for another chance, a fresh start.

Only then would he feel like he could truly stand on equal ground with Cedric.

He knew he hadn't been the best husband in the past, but if he could have another opportunity, he was determined to build a better future with Daniela.

To truly cherish her this time, never again exploiting her loneliness or allowing himself to take her for granted.

With those thoughts,Alexander felt a surge of purpose, a renewed determination to make things right.

Meanwhile, Joyce returned to Caiden's villa again.

She waited for.a quiet moment when no one was around and trapped Cedric in the garden.

"Have you thought more about my proposal?" Joyce asked with a sly smile, her eyes locked onto Cedric. His physique was exactly her type-thin in clothes, yet toned and muscular underneath.

His eyes, always indifferent, fascinated her. She was eager to see just how wild and uncontrollable someone fike him could be in bed.

"Don't worry. As long as the money is right, I won't spill your secret." She edged closer, her voice low and tempting.

Cedric's lips curled into a sneer as he smoothly sidestepped her approach, causing Joyce to stumble and crash to the ground.

"What's that supposed to mean?" she snapped, glaring up at him.

Cedric's expression remained icy. "You're giving yourself too much credit. Do you honestly think you're in any position to be connected with someone like me?"

Without a second glance, he turned and walked away, leaving her seething with anger.

Joyce slammed her fist into the ground, frustration boiling over.

Cedric had no idea what was good for him.

If that was how he wanted to play it, she'd make sure to use her own methods.

It wasn't long before rumors started circulating throughout Olisvine that Cedric had a preference for men.

The rumors escalated, growing wilder and more exaggerated with each passing day.

Daniela, attending a banquet without much concern, overheard people gossiping about it.

Their faces were filled with sincere regret.

"How could Cedric... What a shame!"

"My dad even told me to try harder to win his heart. After hearing that, he couldn't eat for three days."

"Who wouldn't be disappointed? I always said I'd compete with you fairly, but now, what's the point?"

"There are so few decent men left in the world, and now the good ones are being snatched away from us! Is there no justice?°

"I once saw Dániela as a rival, but now I see I completely misjudged her."

Danlela held her glass of wine, listening to every word of the conversation.

Now it made sense why the other women at the banquet had been so friendly towards her.

But she couldn't wrap her head around how these rumors had even begun.

She glanced at Cedric, who stood not far off, mningling with a drink in hand.

He looked composed and dignified, not at all like someone who'd be linked to such rumors.

"Daniela, are you shocked too?" someone murmured, leaning in to share a secret. "My friend says Cedric is gay."

Daniela turned to the speaker, her eyes wide with shock. "Who told you that?"

The person shrugged nonchalantly. "It's comnmon knowledge now. And word on the street is that Cedric has some pretty unusual preferences-the stranger, the better."

Watching the man who had been wrongly accused, Daniela couldn't help but feel a deep sense of pity.

She asked, "I see. And what else have they been saying?"

Daniela didn't usually get caught up in gossip, but seeing her curiosity, everyone eagerly spilled the latest rumors.

"I heard Cedric goes to gay bars all the time and is pretty popular there."

"And apparently, he likes them rough and strong. The image is just too much to handle."

Daniela tried to picture it, but the thought felt too taboo for her to fully entertain.

After finishing his rounds of socializing, Cedric planned to seek out Daniela.

But when he looked, there she was, surrounded by a group of women, all chatting excitedly. Cedric found it oddly interesting.

Daniela rarely showed interest in anything this much.

It was rare to see so many people gathered around her for a conversation.

But he enjoyed seeing her so lively and at ease.

Cedric turned to Lilian, asking, "What are they talking about?

Lillian chuckled lightly. "They're talking about your juicy gossip."

"My gossip?" Cedric raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Lillian nodded, passing on the explosive rumors she'd just caught wind of.

She didn't buy into the idea that Cedric had any interest in men, so the gossip didn't really grabher attention.

Instead, her focus remained on watching how Cedric and Daniela interacted with each other.

As she spoke, she observed Cedric's expression carefully.

Even though he was the target of the rumors, Cedric didn't show a hint of anger.

Holding his wine glass, he chuckled quietly, his gaze fixed on Daniela. "Does she actually enjoy hearing these outrageous stories?"

Once more, a strange thought began to creep into Lillian's mind.′′Aren't you angry?"

Cedric smiled. "Why would I be angry about it?"
###Chapter 258 She Is My Ex-wife


Lillian narrowed her eyes.

As someone in a powerful position, being the subject of rumors was a matter Cedric would have to take seriously, even if he was broad-minded and not easily angered.

While business success depends on capability, the image of those in power plays a crucial role.

After all, why do so many CEOs go to great lengths to project an image of a perfect family life?

A stable public image is key to gaining investors' trust.

Cedric understood this basic truth better than anyone. Yet, he let the gossip about him spread without doing anything to stop it.

Either Cedric was exactly what the rumors suggested, or...

Lillian's gaze fell on Daniela, who was smiling. "Cedric, do you not care, or is it because you value Daniela's happiness over your own image and choose not to intervene?"

As soon as she finished speaking, Lillian noticed Daniela's and Cedric's eyes meet from across the crowd,followed by a shared smile.

Something wasn't right!

There had to be more to it!

Unless they were very close, there couldn't be such a lingering, meaningful exchange of glances.
 
Lillian's curiosity was piqued.

She grabbed Daniela and pulled her into the courtyard. "Daniela, what's really going on between you and Cedric?"

Daniela had been enjoying the conversation inside, where they were discussing Cedric being caught in a compromising situation, when Lilian abruptly dragged her out.

Daniela felt a twinge of regret.

"You've heard it all-Cedric likes men."

°Stop with the nonsénse. I don't believe it. Cedric is so traditional; he's only ever had eyes for you!"

"Then what do you want to ask me?"

"What's your relationship? Are you and Cedric together? Is there something between you two...

Just as Lillian was about to get to the heart of it, the driver called to inform her there was an issue with the car.

Lillian urged, "Don't think you can run off, Daniela. Stay here. I'll be back. Don't try to deceive me." With that,she stormed out.

Daniela let out a soft chuckle and settled onto a nearby bench to wait for Lillian.

What no one noticed was that someone had been observing from the balcony upstairs the entire time.

It was Alexander, silent and unmoving.

Keith approached Alexander and peered down.

He saw Daniela sitting gracefully on the bench, her long dress flowing elegantly around her.

"You have to admit, even just sitting there, Daniela radiates the elegance of an aristocratic lady. She might lack theharshness of someone ín charge, but her charm is undeniable."

The moment he spoke, Keith felt a sharp, icy gaze cutting through him from beside him.

"I didn't mean it like that. I was just admiring her. What's that supposed to mean, Alexandér? You're married.
What does Daniela have to do with you? Even if I do like her, what's the harm in that?"

Alexander's cold gaze swept over him. "How dare you!"

Keith laughed. "What? Do you still have feelings for her?" "Isn't it normal for me to have feelings?" Alexander replied, taking a sip of his drink, his eyes fixed on Daniela, "She's my ex-wife."

Keith let out a short chuckle. "The way you're talking, it's like she's still your wife, not your ex. But then again, who wouldn't be drawn to someone like Daniela? If you're serious about it, you'd better make a move before someone else does."

Alexander raised an eyebrow, his curiosity gettíng the better of him. "What exactly are you getting at?"

"Everyone used to believe Daniela and Cedric were a couple. So even if they had feelings for her, they didn't dare approach Daniela. But now that it's clear Cedric prefers men, the chance is wide open. Now everyone's itching to make their move. Even if they're not genuinely interested in her, chasing after Daniela's fortune is hardly a poor choice."

At those words, Alexander's fingers tightened around his glass.

Just as he was about to reply, he noticed two men with drinks heading in Daniela's direction.

His expression hardened, and without another thought, he made his way downstairs.

Joyce made her entrance, fashionably late, just in time to witness the whole scene unfold.

Katrina leaned in and whispered to her, "After all this time, you still haven't won over Alexander?"

Joyce clenched her teeth in frustration. "He doesn't have feelings for me. He doesn't like me. What am I supposed to do?"

Katrina hesitated, then spoke. "If you really can't keep a man's heart, you'll have to learn how to make the best of your circumstances."

Joyce turned her head sharply, her eyes cold and calculating."You mean...?"
###Chapter 259 Go Home


Katrina urged, "Seize half of Bennett Group's assets, Divorce Alexander."

Momentarily, Joyce's expression tightened as she hesitated.

"Being tough is sometimes necessary for a woman to get what she deserves. If you hesitate now, Alexander might start hiding his assets. You could end up with nothing. Imagine him using what should have been yours to charm Daniela. Could you live with that?"

Joyce's hands balled into fists. She could not. Her discontent, however, was more profound.

Alexander had once been fond of her, so what had caused him to stop noticing her all of a sudden?

He had run into the fire to rescue her instead of Daniela.

These actions had convinced her of Alexander's genuine affection.

But when had his attentiveness weakened?

When had Alexander started to disregard her?

Was it her assertiveness that repelled him?

No man appreciated being forced.

With fists still clenched, Joyce inhaled deeply and looked towards where Alexander had gone. "Mom, I want to try again."

Katrina opened her mouth to respond, but Joyce cut her off. "I've decided. Don't try to change my mind."

Katrina sighed, resigned. "Very well, but one day you'll see. When a man really cares, he'll go to any length for you, even risking his life. That's true love. But when he doesn't like you, he won't even spare you a single glance."

Joyce understood this. Yet, the dissatisfaction within her lingered. In the courtyard, Daniela noticed two figures drawing near. She thought it was Lillian and Ryan. A bright smile spread across her face. Her smile momentarily overwhelmed the approaching men.

Daniela's beauty was renowned, yet her smile was rarely witnessed.

But as soon as she realized who they were, her smile disappeared, replaced by a polite expression.

Daniela rose, nodded at the two, and began to walk away.

"Ms.Harper," one of them called out.

Turning with a puzzled look, Daniela responded,"Yes?"

"We don't know each other, but we're familiar with your reputation. Rumors say you're unapproachable, but seeing how you've socialized today, you seem quite friendly. We were hoping we might become friends."

Daniela acknowledged with a subtle smile. "The rumors hold some truth."

Both men appeared puzzled. "What?"

"I do tend to keep my distance," Daniela explained. "While friendship might be too much, perhaps we could consider a business partnership. Please excuse me; I must attend to other matters."

With these words, Daniela left.

The men exhaled deeply in disappointment.

Even without Cedric, approaching Daniela seemed an impossible task.

Alexander arrived in the courtyard to find it empty.

Daniela was nowhere to be seen.

His dreams of helping her didn't happen.

Amidst the silence, his quickened pulse now seemed out of place.

Inside, Cedric was at the piano, his fingers dancing across the keys, while Daniela stood by, her smile subtle yet captivating. Entering the hall, Lillian caught Daniela's attentive gaze and followed it to Cedric. "Daniela, hasn't Cedric been a bit too showy lately?" Lillian asked.

Feigning confusion,Daniela responded,"Has he?"

Noticing Daniela's amused expression, Lillian asked further, "You know he has. The last time Cedric played the piano was when you came back from abroad. At a function after his big deal, he declined to play.Yet today, here he is, performing with such flair. Doesn't that strike you as strange?"

Trying to discern Lillian's point, Daniela sighed. "What are you suggesting?"

Narrowing her eyes, Liflian said, "It's obvious you're together. That's why Cedric's been so joyful. Despite the rumors about his preferences, he looks content. He must have got what he wanted."

Daniela chuckled."Really now?"

"Yes," Lillian said, her tone serious. "And you've been unusually cheerful yourself. Don't hide it from me,Daniela. I promise I'll keep it to myself this time."

Daniela paused to take a drink.

Lillian's eyes pleaded for the truth.

Just then, Cedric stepped down from the stage, approaching Daniela.

Under the ambient lighting, they appeared as the perfect duo.

Turning to Ryan, Daniela suggested with a smile,"Why don't you explain to her?" Then she turned to Cedric."Shall we go home?"

Lillian stood there, completely stunned. She turned to Ryan, bewildered. "Did Daniela just suggest they go home together? What does that mean about their relationship?"

 
Daniela and Cedric stepped outside together.

After taking a few more steps, they suddenly heard Lillian's shout, loud and uncontrollable.
###Chapter 260 Divorce Her Now


Lithan's shout echoed through the space, drawing Alexander's attention as he stepped in from the courtyard.

His eyes scanned the roomn, realizing that Daniela was no longer present.

A wave of disappointment washed over him, and he briefly thought about leaving.

Yet before he could make his exit, he walked over to Lillian and asked, "What's wrong?"

His motive was simple: to gain Lillian's favor, knowing she was connected to Daniela.

To his surprise, as soon as he spoke, Lillian turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him standing there,feeling awkward.

Katrina and Joyce stood off to the side, observing the entire exchange.

Joyce's fist tightened in frustration.

Katrina spoke with a knowing tone."Alexander's pride knows no bounds. If it weren't for Daniela, he wouldn't even spare Lillian a glance. Joyce, take my advice-secure half of the Bennett family's assets first."

Joyce didn't respond; instead, she walked straight towards Alexander.

"Alexander, who are you looking for?" she asked, observing how he'd been searching for someone ever since he stepped in from the courtyard.

"No one," he replied, his voice losing its edge as he saw Joyce, his disinterest clear. "I'm leaving now," he added before turning away.

Joyce was left standing there, now the subject of whispered mockery.

In the idle circles of the elite, gossip flourished, and that night, Joyce was the main topic.

"I used to think Alexander was really into Joyce. He still married her after she gave birth to another man's child. Turns out, there was more to it."

"Exactly. It seoms Alexander's heart is sti with Daniela. He likely used his connection to Joyce as a way to get closer to her."

"Makes sense. After áll, Joyce just can't measure up to Daniela."

"No wonder Alexander never comes home to sleep. The only time they had sex was because Joyce set him up."

"Joyce's methods are truly underhanded."

"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

Suddenly, fury contorted Joyce's face as she knocked all the drinks off the table.

With anger boiling over, she stormed towards the gossips and slapped one of them three times.

Stil not satisfied, she grabbed the girl by the hair and slammed her head hard against the wall.

The room fell silent in shock as thecrowd stared, unable to comprehend what was happening.

Only when blood began pouring from the victim's forehead did the security rush in to hold Joyce back.

Even with her hands held tight, Joyce erupted in a frenzy of harsh words, her fury spilling over as though she had completely lost control.

The victim lay motionless on the floor, unconscious and drenched in blood.

The entire room watched in stunned silence.

They stared at Joyce, as if she were insane.

Richard stood on the sidelines, taking in the entire spectacle.

He couldn't help but gasp in shock, desperately wishing he could slip away unnoticed from the unfolding chaos.

It was beyond humiliating. Just as he was about to step away, Kátrína's voice cut through the air. "Richard,you can't leave."

A cold shiver ran down hls spine as he realized everyone's gaze had shifted to him.

He longed to leáve, but with Joyce being his daughter-in-law, he couldn't simply walk away from the mess.

Sighing deeply, Richard stepped forward to manage the situation, cursing his bad luck for being caught up with such a crazy and vicious woman.

The injured girl was rushed to the hospital, and Richard quickly paid a hefty sum of five hundred thousand as an advance for the medical bills.

Afterward, he accompanied Joyce and Katrina to the police station.

By the following morning, the entire elite social scene was abuzz with the scandal: Alexander had married someone so unrefined, a simple country girl.

Richard, seething with anger, yelled into the phone at Alexander, who was on his way to the police station."You need to divorce her now! This is the last straw!"
###Chapter 261 Let's Get A Divorce


Joyce was now Alexander's wife, and her every action now reflected on the reputation of the Bennett family.

The unexpected violent episode had cost Alexander several important business deals as he made his way to the police station.

His hands clenched the steering wheel with increasing force, his frustration mounting.

He had once believed that once things calmed down, he could finally find the right moment to express his feelings to Daniela.

But Joyce had destroyed any chance of that now.

A surge of anger bubbled within him.

Still, the situation demanded his attention:

Joyce remained his wife, and her actions meant the Bennett family was left to shoulder the fallout of her scandal.

Alexander headed to the police station and arranged for her bail.

Richard, clutching his chest, turned to Alexander and said, "Take Joyce to her parents'. I don't want to see her around for a while!"

Without giving him a chance to reply, Richard headed straight for the driver's car.

Just before the door closed, he cast one last glance at his son, his voice firm and unyielding. "Divorce Joyce! She's nothing but trouble, and the longer she stays, the worse it gets for the Bennett family!"

Left with no choice, Alexander took it upon himself to drive Joyce and Katrina back.

Throughout the ride, Joyce wailed and voiced her grievances nonstop. "What's wrong with Richard? It's the middle of the night, and he's kicking me out, sending me back to my parents'. I'm the victim here.Instead of blaming those people, he's blaming me. Alexander, say something! Your wife was wronged, and you just sit there siently. You're such a coward!°

From the back seat, Katrina noticed how tightly Alexander's lips were pressed together.

Her chest tightened as a flicker of worry passed through her.

She knew that sllence like his only came from deep disappointment, the kind that left no room for words.

In a gentle tone, Katrina sald to Joyce, "Enough now. You're at fault too. Alexander came to pick you up; isn't that enough? And hitting someone-what were you thinking? That's more than anyone would expect, and it's definitely not okay."

Katrina glanced at Alexander, offering a placating smile. "Alexander, I'm sorry. Joyce has been spoiled by me, and it's made her temper worse."

Joyce shot back instantly, "Mom, what are you even saying? Those people were spouting nonsense! They're insane! That banquet was awful anyway, as if I cared to be there. I'm a shareholder in a prestigious robotics company now. Even if it's just a small share, my monthly earnings are enough to make them jealous.Why would I bother with them? And if they talk trash again, I'll put them in their place!"

Katrina sighed internally as a dull headache began to form.

Once again, she couldn't help but think that Daniela gifting Joyce shares in the robotics company had been a mistake.

It had only inflated Joyce's already overbearing ego.

Now, with some financial backing, Joyce seemed to dismiss everyone around her.

Alexander stayed quiet, his expression unreadable.

When they arrived, Joyce told Alexander, "It's late, so why don't you just stay here tonight?"

Ignoring Joyce's remark, Alexander looked at Katrina with calm politeness. "Katrina, I need to have a private word with Joyce." Katrina immediately grasped what he intended to discuss, and the reafization made Joyce's heart skip a beat.

Katrina let out a weary sigh and sald, "Alright, you two have your conversation. I'll head to the kitchen and whip something up. It's been a long day, and you must be starving."

With that, she turned and left, leaving them to sort things out on their own.

Joyce lingered, pressing her lips into a sly smile as she raised a brow, mimicking how Katrina always seduced Caiden.

Leaning toward Alexander,she murmured,"Alex-

But before she could finish, he pulled her away forcefully.

"Joyce." Alexander's voice pierced through the stillness of the night, cold and sharp like a blade."|t′Stime we end this. Let's get a divorce."

Even though she had braced herself for this moment, hearing the words out loud sent a jolt of panic racing through her. "What are you saying?"

"I mean exactly what I said. Let's end this. There's no point in dragging it on."

Fury bubbled inside Joyce. She was ready to snap but held herself back, her voice barely a whisper. "Why?"

"Why? It's clear as day. You've been part of the Bennett family for months, yet not a single one likes you.The house staff doesn't respect you, and the employees think you're useless. Joyce, can't you see?Everyone looks down on you."

Joyce balled her fists, scrambling for a reason. "It's because you're indifferent to me! The way you treat me sets the tone for everyone else. If you showed me some real affection, they'd follow suit. They're all just a bunch of yes-men, only reacting to what you do!"

Alexander could feel a headache brewing, his frustration growing by the second.′′|sthat your view of them?Let me remind you, on our wedding day, when you were drunk, it was the staff who took care of you.My father made you soup in the morning, and my uncles gave you gifts. Have you ever stopped to wonder why they don't like you now? It's because you think you're better than everyone now that you've got some cash."

Joyce sulked. "If they had the skills, they'd make as much as I do."

Alexander felt like he was speaking to a brick wall."I've said all I need to say. We can part ways peacefully,or we'll go to the court. It's up to you."

Without another word, Alexander turned and walked away, not willing to stay in the same room a second longer.

A few moments later, Katrina appeared and saw Joyce standing alone, her face a mess of tears and snot.
###Chapter 262 Displays Of Affection


Daniela and Cedric had already made their way home.

As the door creaked open, Daniela peeled away from Cedric's warm embrace, her attention riveted to the TV screen.

Cedric exhaled deeply, and Daniela glanced at him with a smile.

Katrina and Joyce walked in mid-conversation. "You really need to rein in that temper of yours, Joyce.You've gone from bride to nearly divorced. What does that tell the world about you?"

Joyce dismissed the mention of divorce with a casual shrug, as if it were mere pillow talk. Divorce was often a card played but seldom dealt. She figured a bit of sweet-talking could smooth things over later. Even as a twice-married woman, she knew Alexander's track record was no trophy either.

With a dismissive wave, Joyce ascended the stairs to retire for the night, while Katrina took the food to the kitchen.

A sudden thought struck her, and she turned, casting her gaze from Daniela and Cedric to Lillian."Why aren't you sitting between Daniela and Cedricanymore? Weren't you keeping an eye on them?"

Lillian, her mouth busy with chips, responded with indifference, "The word on the street is that Cedric prefers men. So, to me, he and Daniela might as well be besties! No need for concern."

Katrina pondered this and made her way upstairs.

As the sound of a closing door echoed, Lillian stole a glance at the couple.

Daniela was sprawled across Cedric's lap, engrossed in her phone game.

"Hey, shouldn't you two keep your relationship under wraps? What's all this about?" Lillian chided.

Daniela chuckled. "Aren't we practically besties now? So, a little closeness shouldn't matter." Cedric tenderly brushed a stray hair from Daniela's face. "Exactly, no harm in it."

"You're just indulging her," Liflian muttered, half amused, half exasperated. "Despite the rumors swirling around,you two seem to relish the drama."

That night, Cedric, usually so guarded, strutted upstairs overtly.

Lillian sighed, pondering how the girls would react once they realized they'd been duped.

Katrina felt a nagging suspicion. While dabbing on her night cream, she asked Caiden, "You've been around quite a bit lately. Noticed anything untoward between Cedric and Daniela?"

Caiden rolled over, his back to Katrina, signaling his disinterest.

Katrina squinted through her hand cream application. "Something just doesn't sit right."

In the dimly lit room, Cedric drew Daniela close.

Looking down at her, her eyes twinkling, he asked,′′|sit that amusing?"

Daniela nodded. "I've just realized the potency of rumors. Did you hear? They said you were gay. It's just ludicrous."

As Daniela's laughter filled the room, Cedric's expression darkened subtly.

Daniela's laughter tapered off. She scooted away, wrapping herself in a blanket, inching towards the edge of the bed.

Cedric's lips pursed. "I'm off to shower."

Daniela peeked from the blanket. "Another one? Wasn't one enough?"

Cedric took a deep breath, his jaw set. "Should I not?"

Daniela giggled. "Go ahead."

He bent down, kissing her and saying, "I'll deal with you later."

Ten minutes later, Cedric stood up, glanced at Daniela's slightly parted lips, closed his eyes for a brief moment, and headed to the bathroom.

Daniela,her smnile Hngering, drifted off to sleep enveloped in the scent of Cedric lingering in the air.

The next morning, the housekeeper told Joyce, "There's a package for you on the table."

Puzzled,Joyce approached and, upon opening the envelope, was taken aback by its contents.

As Katrina descended the stairs, the look on Joyce's face gave away the nature of the documents she held.

"Mom," Joyce cried out, tears streaming down her face. "Alexander wants to divorce me! He's serious this time!"

Her wails echoed throughout the house, reaching every ear.

Inconsolable, she sobbed, "Mom, what do l do?"

Katrina's eyes flicked to Caiden descending the stairs, then quickly away.

Even if Caiden wanted to intervene, the precarious state of Harper Group meant that Alexander wouldn't take him seriously.

Only Daniela could sway him now.

As Daniela appeared, Katrina, bypassing Joyce, pleaded, "Daniela, could you talk to Alexander? Couples have their disagreements, but if it drags on, it'll lead to divorce. You have a lot of sway now; could you say good words for us?"

"Are you out of your mind?" Cedric cut in sharply before Daniela could utter a word, his expression chilling.

Lillian, poised to interject, withdrew silently, her heart sinking slightly. It was clear that Daniela no longer required her guardianship.

Katrina was caught off guard by Cedric's bluntness."What?"

"Your family's drama shouldn't tangle Daniela's feet. Have you even considered the weight of what you're asking her to shoulder?" Frustration knotted Katrina's brow, and she yearned to retaliate but held back, knowing Cedric was not one to challenge lightly.

Masking her agitation with a strained smile, she ventured, "But what if Daniela herself is open to stepping in?

Her eyes then sought Daniela, who remained head bowed and declared, "I listen to Cedric."

Katrina's face feI, words failing her as the retort died on her lips.

Lillian, rising, felt a sharp pang of discontent.

She had no appetite for the saccharine display that was about to unfold.
###Chapter 263 | Find It Disgusting


Katrine's gaze remalned fixed on Daniela. "Daniela,I know we've had so many misunderstandings in the past. That's on me, and I'l take full responsibility. You can blame me all you want, but please, don't take it out on Joyce. She's still young. Can you help her? Please?" Hope flickered in her eyes as she looked at Daniela.

But before Daniela could réspond, Cedric's voice sliced through the air. "Still young? Joyce is an adult, isn't she? Do you think you can push Daniela around just because you assume she has no one to defend her? Let me make one thing clear-Daniela has people protecting her. Don't drag your family's mess into herlife."

Katrina opened her mouth to argue, but Cedric didn't give her the chance. "Josie!" he barked.

Josie emerged from the kitchen, carrying a knife and pointing it to Katrina's face. "Yes, Mr. Phillips."

The blood drained from Katrina's cheeks, leaving her pale and trembling.

In his eyes, they'd lost their minds. All of them!②

Joyce, seeing no other way, tried to stall for time.

Maybe the top lawyer from Elite Lux could help craft a strategy. But Cedric wasn't about to give her that opportunity.

His patience snapped. "Don't come any closer. My tolerance for this nonsense is wearing thin. If you dare to take advantage of Daniela again, I'll buy out Harper Group tomorrow, and you'll find yourself thrown out of this house."③

His words hit like a sledgehammer, and Katrina, consumed by fear,grabbed Joyce's arm and dragged her away.

Several days passed.

Alexander's secretary stepped into the house. "Mr. Bennett's message is clear-draggingthis out is Katrina stared at the divorce agreement and was about to say something when Joyce burst out of the room.

Refusing to accept the harsh reality, she ran straight to Alexander's car and knocked on the tinted window.

"I'm not the type to cling shamelessly. Get out here and let's talk. If you stil want the divorce after that, fine -we'll get divorced."

The car door opened, and Alexander stepped out.

But the moment he stood in front of her, it became clear-Joyce had no intention of letting him go.

She kept talking about her hardships and how hard it was to be in a marriage without love.

"Alexander, l've already been judged for having a child out of wedlock. If you divorce me now, how am l supposed to face anyone? How will I ever marry again? I know you're still upset about what happened last time, but it was only because I love you. You married me but never touched me. Do you know what people say? They call me tainted, damaged. Have you ever thought about how that makes me feel? This marriage can't work if I'm the only one trying."

Joyce's tears fell freely now. She recited lines she had carefully rehearsed over the past few days,clinging to the hope that they might soften his heart.

"Let's not divorce. Let's go back home and make this work. Please." For the first time since their marriage,Joyce adopted a posture of complete humility.

She thought that as long as she admitted her mistakes, Alexander would reconsider. But she was wrong.

In the dim light of the evening, Alexander stood before her like an immovable mountain. His presence was cold, his expression distant. "I don't like you. We're not suited for each other, and forcing this will only lead to misery for both of us. I can't do this anymore. This marriage has to end."

Joyce hadn't imagined that even after lowering herself so much, Alexander would remain utterly unyielding.A flicker of anger crossed her face, but she forced it down, masking her frustration.

"Alexander, I know you're still furious about what happened before, but I swear it won't happen again. I'll apologize to the one I hurt. I'll even make up for the Bennett family's losses."

Before he could cut her off, she rushed to speak again, her voice trembling. "That's enough. Don't say anything. I'm going back inside now."

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and hurried away, her steps uneven and rushed.

Alexander remained rooted in place, exhaling a long, weary sigh. As he moved to return to his car,faint footsteps caught his attention.

Turning to the sound, he saw Daniela walking a small dog. The bell on its collar jingled, its gentle chime breaking the stillness of the dusky evening.

The weight pressing on Alexander's chest seemed to lift, his earlier frustration dissolving.

His eyes lingered on Daniela as she crouched down to scoop up the lively dog. She smiled as it wriggled in her arms, its fur brushing against her cheek as if it were sharing a secret.

Her laugh, light and melodic, carried through the air as she murmured, "Why are you being such a little troublemaker today?"

Alexander knew he shouldn't approach her. He'd told himself that before-the last time he'd seen her at the dinner party. But just like then, restraint slipped through his fingers. "Daniela."

The smile on Daniela's lips gradually faded. She gently placed thedog on the ground, her grip on the leash steady, her face unreadable. "Mr. Bennett." Her tone was formal, distant-like a stranger addressing someone they barely knew.

Alexander's chest tightened with a sharp ache. "Do you really need to be so cold? You used to call me Alexander."

But Daniela's eyes drifted to the dog instead, her attention shifting away as if his words hadn't even reached her.

"You must have heard by now," he continued, his voice softer, almost pleading. "I'm divorcing Joyce. The details are already being sorted out." Daniela didn't flinch; her expression remained like stone, distant and detached. She kept her hold on the leash and took a step forward, her intention to leave clear.

Alexander panicked and followed, his steps quick to match hers.

She stopped suddenly, her sharp gaze locking onto himn like ice. "Alexander, do you hold some kind of grudge against me?"

His breath hitched at her unexpected question. "L..."

"Your divorce from Joyce has nothing to do with me. Stop trying to involve me in this mess. I want no part in your drama or your love life."

Alexander opened his mouth to respond, but she interrupted him again, her tone dripping with disdain."Frankly, I find it revolting."
###Chapter 264 The Wrong Person


Alexander felt his entire body tense as Daniela's icy words-"l find it revolting"-pierced him like shards of glass.

The ache in his chest spread like a wildfire, bitter and unrelenting.

For a moment, he just stood there, frozen in place.

Daniela, watching him, assumed he would leave. She knew the kind of man Alexander was; his pride wouldn't allow him to endure such humiliation.

But to her surprise, he stayed.

Her brows furrowed slightly, If he wasn't going to leave, she would. She had no intention of prolonging the encounter. After all, if Joyce caught wind of this, she would twist the narrative to make it seem as though Alexander's divorce was her fault. Joyce was the kind of person who always needed a scapegoat, someone to bear the weight of her insecurities.

She wasn't afraid of Joyce. She simply found it a waste of time to get tangled in someone else's drama.

Without hesitation, she turned on her heel and began walking away.

Alexander's voice broke the silence. "Are you still blaming me?"

She didn't even glance back, refusing to dignify the question with an answer. Her pace remained steady,her back straight.

But Alexander wasn't ready to let it go. He followed her, his tone pressing, desperate?

"Daniela, is this still about the fire? Are you angry because I saved Joyce instead of you?"

The question struck a nerve, but not in the way he might have expected.

Once,it had felt like the ultimate betrayal-a moment she could never forgive. Now, as he mentloned it, thé memory seemed distaht, faded. It was like a photograph left too long in the sum, its colors dim and muted.

Time had dufled the sharp edges of her pain.

She could still recall the bitter disappointment she had felt that day, the way her heart had twisted with dlsbelief.

But that version of her was long gone. Her heart had learned to let go, to move forward without carrying the weight of the past.

"I can explain," Alexander said, stepping in front of her to block her path. "Daniela, please, lef me explain.Back then, in the fire, the smoke was so thick I couldn't see anything clearly. All I could remember was that you were wearing red that day-red, like a winter rose. When I rushed inside, the first thing I saw was a flash of red. I thought it was you. I swear, I didn't know it was Joyce. I was trying to save you."

Daniela stood silently, her gaze steady asshe watched him struggle to explain himself.

The memory, once searing and unbearable, no longer held power over her.

She nodded faintly, her voice flat as she replied, "Noted."

Alexander's anxiety spiked at her indifference. His hands clenched at his sides as he pressed on. "I know you misunderstood me back then. But | didn't explain myself because I thought it wouldn't change anything.What happened had already happened."

Daniela tilted her head slightly, her eyes narrowing as she glanced at him. "Then why are you bringing it up now?"

"Because I think you misunderstood me,"Alexander blurted out, his words spilling over each other. "And misunderstandings should be cleared up, don't you think? Daniela, you'll forgive me, won't you?"

His voice was laced with desperation, his eyes searching hers for any sign of forgiveness. "It wasn't supposed to be like this. We were supposed to get married and live a good life together. You were supposed to be my wife. Andd we were already married. Everything was perfect, but because of that one mistake,everything went off course. Now, I just want to fix it. I want everything to go back to the way it should have Alexander's gaze burned into Daniela, his words tumbling out in a rapíd, almost breathless cadence, as if he feared she would walk away before he finished.

He believed that if he could just explain himself, if he could just clear up the misunderstanding,everything could be salvaged. There was still hope. There had to be.

"I'm divorcing Joyce. We weren't right for each other. Daniela, you're the one who's truly right for me.Daniela, please, give me another chance."

By this point, Alexander's tone was almost pleading.

Daniela looked at him-the man she had loved for so many years.

The sight should have stirred something within her. Once upon a time, she might have dreamed of this moment, of Alexander lowering his proud head to speak such words.

But now, there was no joy, no sense of triumph in her heart.

Was it pity?

Not in the slightest.

She had something better now, something far greater than the fleeting emotions she had once felt for him.She was not someone who dwelled on the past.

Every step she took was deliberate, every choice well-considered. Regret was a luxury she had never allowed herself to entertain.

Meanwhile, Joyce had finished knitting a scarf for Alexander. It was a gift she had worked on tirelessly,picturing the moment she would hand it to him.

She stepped outside, the scarf clutched tightly in her hands, her heart light with anticipation. But she heard Alexander's words.

She stood there, unmoving, as the truth hit her like a gust of cold wind. She even wanted to laugh.

So this was it. This was the truth.

No matter what challenges they faced, she had always kept a place for Alexander in her heart.

Back then, when the flames raged around her, Alexander had burst into the building and pulled her to safety.He had risked his life for her, not Daniela.

That memory had been her anchor, the reason she had convinced herself to hold onto him.

And now, she realized the favor she had cherished for so long was nothing more than an illusion.

Joyce recalled the moment Alexander had told her he couldn't take it anymore, his voice cold and distant as he declared he wanted a divorce.

She had lashed out, her words sharp and cutting, but deep inside, she had already started to let go.

She had always known herself too well.

She wasn't the kind of woman who could suppress her temper or swallow her pride for the sake of appearances.

She lacked the poise and grace expected of a CEO's wife. The endless rules, the polite facades, the intricate games of high society-it had never been her world.

Their marriage had been short, but it felt longer, weighted down by all the ways she didn't belong. More than once, she had thought about letting go.

In fact, she had already told herself that if Alexander ever insisted on a divorce, she would agree.

She had resolved to set him free, and in doing so, she would free herself as well.

But now, he was saying that he had saved the wrong person.
###Chapter 265 Her Economic Dependence


Joyce discovered that the favoritism she once believed in was merely an illusion.

Thls epiphany rendered her previous decision to walk away almost comical.

She laughed so intensely that tears cascaded down her cheeks.

As she laughed, Daniela and Alexander turned around, drawn by the sound.

Tightening her grip on her scarf, Joyce inhaled deeply and straightened up.

She then draped the scarf around her neck.

She affirmed to herself that a man incapable of loving her was unworthy of her heart.

With the scarf securely in place, Joyce approached Daniela and Alexander.

Alexander, looking bewildered, watched as Joyce confidently linked her arm through his. With a superficial smile, she asked, "Why haven't you left yet? What were you discussing with my sister?"

Her smile, though faint and unconvincing, did not reach her eyes, hinting at the coldness behind it.

Alexander frowned deeply.

Turning to Daniela, Joyce said, "I need a moment more with Alexander."

Daniela gave a brief nod and walked away.

Alexander made to follow Daniela, yearning for a response to his earlier confessions, but Joyce obstructed his path. "Don't waste youur time."

Alexander faced her, irritation sharp in his voice. "What do you mean by that?"

Joyce offered a wry smile, the warmth of the scarf around her neck contrasting with the coolness of her demeanor. She adjusted the scart casuafly and warned, "Alezander, no matter your bellets or whether Daniela ends her relatlonship with Calden, she remains my sister. Our marriage is still legafly valid, and should you pursue anything with her, just a few tears from me in public could wreak havoc on Bennett Group."

She chuckled dryly, her laugh piercing the tense alr. "After all, is there anything more scandalous than you having an affair with your sister-in-law, wouldn't you agree?"

Alexander's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing. "You wouldn't dare."

"Why wouldn't I?" Joyce retorted, her voice calm yet detached. "What do I have to lose? I don't rely on you,Alexander. But do you dare to take that risk?"

She stepped closer, her tone quietly menacing."Are you willing to risk Bennett Group's future against me?Perhaps you should proceed. Maybe Daniela will be touched by your persistence and forgive you eventually."

She crossed her arms and flashed him a cold, mocking smile.′′SO,what's your decision? Your business empire or the beauty? Choose."

Joyce didn't wait for his response.

Before walking away, she turned sharply, her voice firm and decisive. "I don't consent to a divorce. You're welcome to file if you wish, but be ready to lose everything. I've realized I quite enjoy being your wife."

Then, she let out a wild, almost unhinged laugh before turning and walking back to the villa. Her eyes were cold,her expression resolute.

If she couldn't have a happy life, they might as well be miserable together.

Alexander stood frozen, Joyce'sultimatum-"yoour business empire or the beauty"-resonating in his mind like a deafening roar.

He hadn't anticipated Joyce would take such drastic steps, placing herself yet again as an obstacle between him and Daniela.

His gaze lingered on Daniela as she walked away, and his hand slowly clenched into a tight fist. That same day, Joyce packed her belongings and left. When Katrina inquired about her actions, Joyce declared she wasn't seeking a divorce. She intended to endure this marriage for the rest of their lives.

As she spoke, Daniela was in the living room. Joyce's gaze fixed on her throughout the conversation.

Daniela,however,showed no reaction, making it unclear whether she had heard it or not.

Joyce grabbed her suitcase, ready to depart, yet paused, reflecting briefly before setting it back down. She approached Daniela and stood next to her.

"Daniela, I've decided not to divorce Alexander. What do you think about that?" Joyce felt a twinge of fear towards Daniela.

Daniela,invaluable for her connections, was like a treasure trove of opportunities. Joyce was aware of Daniela's influence,having witnessed powerful men submit to her at Elite Lux with utter obedience.

If she angered Daniela, and Daniela chose to reclaim the roboticscompany shares, Caiden wouldn't be able to retrieve them a second time.

Without Daniela's financial support, Joyce questioned how she could possibly challenge the Bennett family.

Daniela, engrossed in a report, seemed not to hear Joyce initially.

Daniela glanced at Joyce, prompting her to repeat her statement.

Daniela's reply came flatly. "It's up to you. Why are you telling me? I'm not your mother."

Nearby, Joyce's mother, observing the exchange, narrowed her eyes at Daniela, suspecting an ulterior motive.

Unlike her mother, who possessed keen instincts, Joyce simply offered a tentative smile to Daniela. "I felt l should consult you. Without the support from the robotics firm, what else can I count on?"

Realizing the futility of any deception in front of Daniela, Joyce let go of any facade.

As she concluded, her phone chimed with a notification. She made no move to check her phone.

Daniela raised her chin slightly and asked, "Aren't you going to check that?"
###Chapter 266 Blood Feud


Joyce was initially baffled by Daniela's words. She hesitated, her head bowed as she fished out her phone from her pocket.

Upon viewing the text, Joyce became statue-still. Then, looking at Daniela, she uttered, "What are you getting at here?"

"You were seeking some leverage, weren't you?"

Tears welled up in Joyce's eyes as she leaned in, trying to hug Daniela.

But Daniela blocked her advance, keeping her at arm's length.

"Thank you, Daniela!"

Daniela cracked a small smile and shifted her focus to her phone. "You're a shareholder of the robotics company.Should you need support, the company will stand behind you. You'll see dividends in due course;financial worries won't trouble you."

Joyce's excitement was unmistakable, radiating from her expression.

However,Katrina's expression darkened.

This windfall only fueled Joyce's combative spirit. The more Daniela contributed, the bigger the storm Joyce would brew for the Bennett family.

Joyce had just learned that Alexander had been intended to save Daniela from the fire, and now she seethed with anger.

With fresh resources and Daniela's pledged support, Joyce was primed to return and wreak havoc on the Bennett family.

Katrina saw Joyce as a pawn in Daniela's game. As Joyce stood abruptly, pride lifting her stature, Katrina reached out and held her arm. "Joyce, listen to me.Daniela has an agenda. You're too upset now. Maybe hold off on going back just yet."

Joyce shook off Katrina's grasp, her face etched with frustration. "Mom, I don't understand you anymore.Can't you see Alexander has driven me to the edge? Instead of backing me, you're preaching calm? You never held back when you went after Daniela. You always taught me that victory was all that counts.If I back down now, I'Il be forever marginalized in the Bennett family. You've always lived by your own rules, and now you expect me to just fold? That's hardly fair! You've grown old and lost your zest, and frankly, Daniela shows me more kindness than you do. People are inherently selfish; that much is clear. You just want a comfortable life, just like when Alexander hurt me and you turned a blind eye."

Tears streamed down Katrina's cheeks. "Darling, how can you accuse me like that?"

"Mom, stop worrying about me. I know what I'mn doing. You go ahead and cozy up to Daniela. She's a good person." With those words, Joyce departed without a backward glance.

Katrina watched her daughter disappear, a pang of dread rising in her heart.

She felt on the brink of losing Joyce; perhaps she already had.

Fright gnawing at her, Katrina approached Daniela hastily. "What are you plotting? What are your intentions with Joyce?"

Daniela paused, then locked eyes with Katrina.

Under the harsh overhead lighting, Daniela's eyes shone with a sharp gleam, her lips curving into a subtle,icy smile. "Why don't you tell me?"

Katrina was momentarily taken aback. Under Daniela's penetrating stare, her heart pounded wildly. She had an uneasy suspicion that Daniela knew more than she was letting on. But she wasn't sure.

"What do you mean? Are you trying to hurt Joyce? Daniela, we've never been adversaries. Why manipulate her like this?"

Daniela brushed off the allegation, nonchalantly turning off her phone's screen. She then rose gracefully to her full height, looming over Katrina who clenched her fists. Daniela leaned in, her voice a whisper near Katrina's ear. "Are you certain we've never been adversaries? Or perhaps..."

She trailed off, leaving the thought hanging.

Katrina watched as Daniela straightened, her demeanor echoing that of Brylee's.

A chill snaked through Katrina.

She shivered slightly as Daniela finished her thought.

"Or perhaps this is a blood feud!"
###Chapter 267 She Was Only Five


Every strand of hair on Katrina's body prickled as she absorbed Daniela's words.

Her eyes widened in shock, meeting Daniela's gaze. Unintentionally, she exclaimed,"What do you know?"

When Daniela heard this, her smile grew even wider.

It wasn't a reassuring smile; instead, it was the kind that sent a shiver through Katrina's heart.

Daniela advanced slowly, her steps deliberate.

Instinctively, Katrina moved back.

She never imagined that the little girl she had once bullied, the one who would sit at the stairs with a bowl,eating quietly, had now turned into someone who could make her shrink back with just a glance.

A pang of regret hit Katrina. She regretted not dealing with Daniela permanently, much like she had with Brylee.

"What do you think I know?" Daniela asked, her voice calm yet filled with cold.

Katrina stood there, frozen, for what felt like an eternity. She couldn't find the words to respond to that question.

As the true meaning of Daniela's words slowly sank in, a cold shiver ran down her spine, freezing her blood in its tracks.

Se trembled, the coldness seeming to penetrate her bones.

When she regained her composure, she found herself alone in the living room, engulfed by fear.

Turning to her husband, Katrina said, "Caiden, Daniela is targeting Joyce!"

Caiden had just come home,slightly buzzed from an evening out. He laughed it off with a dismissive wave. Katrina raised her voice, desperate. "I'm serious! Daniela's distributed dividends of the robotics firm frequently, and her glare just now... it was as if she wanted me dead. You've seen Joyce grow.We can't let Daniela harm her."

Again,Caiden brushed her concerns aside. "Daniela's got too much on her plate for such pettiness.She wouldn't target Joyce over something trivial like Alexander. If she wanted to hurt Joyce, why would she have given her shares in the first place?"

Katrina faltered, at a loss for words.

Caiden shrugged, relaxed. "She would only be really angry when Brylee was involved."

Without bothering to freshen up, Caiden covered himself with a blanket, lay down, and soon began snoring.

Katrina, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with anxiety.

She reached for her phone and dialed. "Mom, I think Daniela remembers what happened to Brylee."

"What? That happened so long ago. Don't work yourself up. Even if Daniela suspects something, does she have any proof? She was only five when Brylee died. Can you remember anything from when you were five?By now, she's probably forgotten it all."

Katrina's expression darkened, and her voice dropped to a murmur. "Five years old... Surely she remembers more than that."

Briefly hesitating, Katrina then instructed, "Mom, we need a hypnotist, but not the old one. Find someone young and attractive. I intend for Daniela to meet her mother's fate!"

As she hung up, Katrina glanced nervously towards the bedroom.

Caught up in thoughts of Brylee, she realized she had neglected her usual cautions. She picked up a fruit knife and paused by the bedside.

Her hand clenched tightly around the knife, her determination firm.

Meanwhile,Caiden continued to snore, unaware of the tension. Katrina exhaled slowly, her nerves easing slightly. She scolded herself internally to remain vigilant.

She couldn't let Daniela turn the tables on her after all these years.

Katrina headed to the bathroom to freshen herself up.

Unbeknownst to her, Caiden's eyes fluttered open in the bedroom. His hand was damp, his grip uneasy.

The sharp edge of the fruit knife glinted menacingly on the nightstand. A bead of cold sweat trickled down Caiden's forehead.

He wiped his brow roughly, his hand shaking, then closed his eyes once more.

Silence surrounded the room again, as though the night had swallowed the ealier disturbance.
###Chapter 268 Hypnotist


The next morning, Cedric stepped out of Daniela's room.

It was still early, five o'clock in the mnorning.

The house was eerily quiet.

As Cedric made his way downstairs, he found Caiden lingering near the door to his own room.

Cedric hesitated, caught off guard by the unexpected sight.

He stood still for a moment, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation, but before he could speak,Caiden broke the silence. "Hey, Cedric. Got any work trips coming up? Maybe something you could send me on?"

Cedric gave him a confused look. "What do you mean by that?"

Caiden's unease was evident, and he seemed desperate. "I just need to escape for a while. Katrina's making me lose my mind, and a business trip is the perfect excuse. No matter what happens between you and Daniela, I'm still her father, right? While you're trying to win her over, you can't forget about me."

Cedric's face hardened as he heard those words. His contempt for Caiden deepened.

Just moments before, he had come downstairs fromn Daniela's room, yet Caiden didn't ask a single question,showing no concern as a father.

Instead,Caiden seemed focused on exploiting the situation for his own benefit.

How could someone like him ever be fit to be a father?

Cedric's expression remained frosty as he washed up and replied flatly, "There is a trip, but it's quite far."

Caiden's face immediately brightened. "Really? Perfect! Just send me then!"

Cedric answered in a detached tone, " I'll have my secretary check if it can be arranged." Caiden seemed thrilled. "You're the boss, after all. If you tell your secretary to book me a flight, she'll get it done, won't she? Perfect! I'll go pack right now."

Without waiting for a response, he hurried off to prepare for the trip.

Cedric went for his usual morning run and then made breakfast. By eight o'clock, he made his way upstairs and knocked softly on Daniela's door.

As he entered, he found Daniela still deep in sleep.

The cold edge in Cedric's gaze softened instantly.

He knelt beside the bed and lightly tapped Daniela's nose. "It's eight. Time to wake up?"

Still half-asleep, Daniela grabbed his hand, pulling it under the covers with hers. She drifted for a moment longer before finally blinking her eyes open.

Once she had dressed and freshened up, Cedric spoke up. "Caiden asked me to set up a trip for him. I told him it'd be quite far, and he seemed pretty excited about it."

Daniela gave a small nod, unfazed. "Sure. Let him go then."

She thought that adding another person to the war between her and Katrina would only make her plans more complicated.

The questions from the previous night had unsettled Katrina just enough for Caiden to pick up on it. Now, he was eager to make his escape.

That confirmed everything Daniéla had suspected from the start.

Cedric glanced at Daniela. "Aren't you going to tell me what you're planning?"

Daniela smiled faintly. "Haven't you already figured it out?"

Cedric wasn't as oblivious as Joyce. He likely had his own suspicions and was just waiting for Daniela to confirm them.

"I take care of my own vengeance," Daniela said with conviction. Cedric nodded. "As long as you stay out of real danger, do what you need to do. I've got your back. But if you push it too far and risk your safety,I'll step in."

For him, that was the one line he wouldn't cross. His priority was making sure Daniela remained safe.

That day,Caiden boarded a private jet owned by Cedric's company, his excitement barely contained as he imagined the "work trip" ahead. Just before the plane took off, Cedric asked, "Anything else?"

Caiden waved a hand nonchalantly. "Just make sure the local branch handles my meals. I'm a bit particular about what l eat."

With that, Cedric gave him a nod, turned on his heel, and walked away.

When he returned home later, Lillian, who had been waiting for him, gave him a curious glance. "So, where exactly did you send him off to?"

Cedric's expression darkened. "It was the City of Romance."

Lillian's grin widened. "And now?"

"A desert," Cedric replied.

On the plane, the moment Caiden realized his actual destination, his face turned pale. He erupted in disbelief, "A desert? Are you kidding me? I came here to enjoy life, not to mess around with sand."

The plane had already crossed into another country.

Up in the sky, no matter how much he shouted, the plane's course couldn't be altered.

Katrina believed Caiden was away on a business trip. She thought he had buried himself in work due to financial struggles, so she had no reason to suspect anything.

Early that morning, she returned home with a young man in tow.

He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with a bright smile and dimples that added to his charm, making the whole room light up.
###Chapter 269 Katrina's Nephew


It was the weekend.

Daniela made her way downstairs and saw the young man, who introduced himself as Johan Randall.

"Good morning," Johan said, his eyes lifting to meet hers with an air of polite familiarity.

Daniela offered Johan only a fleeting glance, her silence speaking volumes.

Katrina hurried over, stepping in to explain, "This is Johan, my nephew. He'll be staying with us for a few days."

As she took a sip from the glass of juice Cedric had handed her, Daniela allowed a faint smile to play on her lips. "You seem to have quite the extended family. First, your niece; now, your nephew. Who's next on the guest list?"

Katrina's smile stiffened, and her jaw tightened. "Well, family visits are just a part of life, aren't they?"

"Of course," Daniela replied with an easy shrug. "Actually, Peyton was talking about visiting soon. Maybe we should invite her too."

At the mention of Peyton, Katrina's face immediately paled.

She knew all too well that Peyton's hostility towards her would make any visit a recipe for disaster.

With Joyce and Caiden in the midst of a heated fallout, Peyton was undoubtedly relishing every moment,spreading the gossip about Joyce's personal matters wherever she went.

Katrina couldn't stand it, but there was little she could do to silence Peyton's chatter.

Suppressing her frustration, Katrina took a steadying breath. "Daniela, she's getting older. Let's not trouble her.I know you prefer fewer people around, so I'll be more considerate next time."

Daniela stayed silent, not responding to Katrina. She let out a quiet scoff and returned to her breakfast, ignoring the tension in the air.

Nearby,Johan lingered, watching Daniela's profile with a gentle smile. "You're really something, Daniela. I like that about you."

Cedric approached,holding a plate of food, and shot Johan a disapproving look.

With a faint smile, Daniela responded, "I'm glad you do. Hope it sticks."

Johan quickly showed just how persistent he could be.

Whenever Daniela wasn't in her room, he'd hover around her, constantly talking about his campus life with an eager grin plastered on his face.

He played the part of the innocent, carefree young man effortlessly.

Without a word, Daniela let him carry on, sinking deeper into the couch as she typed away on her phone.

Curious, Johan leaned in to take a look, but Daniela quickly handed the phone to Cedric instead.

Cedric took a quick look at the screen.

The file labeled "Johan Randall" showed one simple message: "No record found."

A playful smile tugged at Daniela's lips. Johan, completely unaware, grinned back at her. "What's got you smiling so much?"

Remaining composed, Daniela answered smoothly, "Just stumbled upon a little trickster. It's kind of amusing."

The air around Johan grew tense at her words.

He began to wonder if Daniela was hinting at something more.

For a brief moment, it seemed like Daniela could see right through him.

"You're quite the jokester," he remarked, his eyes fixed on her phone. Reaching out to grab it, he was met with a quick tap that locked the screen with a sharp click.  Without another word, Daniela stood up and began heading upstairs. Johan followed closely behind.

When Daniela entered her bedroom, he moved to follow her in.

But the door slammed shut in his face with a loud thud, leaving him with a stinging nose.

Moments later, Cedric appeared with a plate of fruit, and Johan pointed at the electronic lock. "She locked it."

With a calm, practiced motion, Cedric placed his finger on the panel, and the door clicked open.

As Cedric stepped inside, Johan attempted to follow, but Cedric shot him a cold, unwavering look. "Try one more step, and you're done."

Johan's smile faltered, freezing in place.

His eyes locked with Cedric's, and though his youthful appearance remained unchanged, the intensity in his gaze hinted at something far darker.

Johan carefully placed his foot back down. "What's the deal? Why are you both targeting me?"

Cedric flashed a mocking grin, his eyes glinting. "Maybe you should ask yourself why you came knocking on our door,practically asking for trouble."

The forced smile on Johan's face quickly disappeared.

Once again, he was struck with the realization that his cover had been blown.
###Chapter 270 Suspend The Dividend Paymnents


Cedric walked into the roomn and saw Daniela seated at her computer, diving into research about Johan.

As the phrase "world-class professional hypnotist" popped up on the screen, Cedric's eyes narrowed with suspicion.

Daniela's lips curled into a smirk when she came across the line, "acommission fee starting at eight million dollars."

It became clear that Katrina had likely borrowed money from Joyce.

Daniela had anticipated this moment for a long time.

Picking up her phone, she stepped out onto the balcony and dialed the finance department at the robotics company.

"Suspend all dividend payments," she ordered.

Meanwhile, Katrina was sprawled on the living room couch downstairs, leisurely watching TV.

Joyce texted her, "Mom, you said you'd figure out a way to pay me back soon. Don't forget your promise."

Reclining comfortably, Katrina typed back with a serene smile. "Don't you trust me? Once Daniela's gone,everything she owns will go to Caiden. You'll get far more than eight million. In fact, Elite Lux will be yours entirely."

Joyce's eyes widened in surprise."Really?"

Katrina responded confidently,"Of course."

As Katrina hit the send button, Johan appeared, descending the staircase.

Narrowing his eyes, he remarked, "Daniela has formidable psychological defenses. She's not easy to hypnotize." Katrina leapt up in frustration. "Are you joking? I thought hypnotists could hypnotize anyone with ease!"

Johan squinted, responding calmly, "Not at all. Hypnosis comes with specific requirements-a quiet,enclosed space. I can't even get near Daniela's room. And as for Cedric, he might seem insignificant,but he shows up the second I try to approach her. Are you certain he doesn't have feelings for her?"

If Katrina hadn't repeatedly insisted they shared no romantic relationship, Johan would have sworn that Daniela and Cedric were married.

The unspoken bond between the two was like an invisible fortress-impenetrable to outsiders.

"Impossible," Katrina declared with unwavering certainty."Cedric likes men."

Johan's brow furrowed in disbelief. "Are you serious?"

The intensity in Cedric's gaze whenever he looked at Daniela painted a very different picture. Whether they were married or not, there was no denying they were a couple. How could he possibly like men?

"He admitted it himself," Katrina replied, her voice steady. "He likes Ryan."

For a moment, Johan was caught off guard. It was rare for him to misread people, yet Cedric had managed to throw him off entirely.

"Whatever the case, make sure Daniela is dealt with quickly." Katrina hadn't forgotten her promise to hand Elite Lux over to Joyce.

With a company as powerful as Elite Lux in Joyce's hands, the Bennett family would have no choice but to acknowledge her.

Meanwhile, Cedric was battling his own frustrations.

Johan's constant appearance around Daniela left him with no opportunity to sneak upstairs at night

Daniela asked him to sleep in his own bedroom.

Cedric had a sleepless night, yearning for her presence.

With dark circles under his eyes and a growing irritation, he decided it was time to confront Johan. But Daniela had other plans. She dragged Cedric out for a movie, hoping to lighten his mood. By the time they reached the concession stand, Cedric, with a tub of freshly bought popcorn in his hands, noticed Daniela grinning mischievously.

"What's with that look?" Cedric asked, tilting his head as he followed her gaze.

In the corner of the theater, a woman wearing a mask was giggling flirtatiously with a man.

Cedric's brows lifted as he recognized the woman. "Joyce?"

Daniela smirked, her tone carrying a hint of amusement. "Well, I knew Joyce would cheat on Alexander, but this is faster than I expected."

As the lights dimmed and the movie began, Cedric followed Daniela into the same screening room as Joyce.

Joyce and the man slipped into the most secluded seats in the theater, making it clear that the movie wasn't their main focus.

Daniela,with mischief in her eyes, chose a seat behind them.

Before long, they heard Joyce's voice.

"Ah, be gentle. Milo, that hurts. More, I need more."

Cedric's expression grew as dark as the pitch-black cinema screen.

The mortifying whispers persisted throughout the film, testing Cedric's patience to its very limit.

Daniela, unfazed, lounged in her seat with her multidimensional glasses on, munching popcorn. It was hard to tell if her attention was on the big screen ahead or the awkward live drama unfolding.

After what felt like an eternity, the credits rolled, signaling the end of the movie.

Cedric had come with the simple plan of holding Daniela's hand and stealing a kiss in the dimly lit cinema,but the evening had derailed far from his intentions.

Exiting the theater, Daniela glanced at Cedric, and his sour expression was impossible to miss. "Aren't you going to keep tailing them?" Cedric asked, his voice tinged with irritation.

"There's no need. Their little affair is practically an open secret. Let's just wait until Alexander catches wind of it," Daniela replied nonchalantly.

Just then, her eyes landed on Alexander, walking down the opposite corridor. Dressed sharply in a tailored suit, he was surrounded by a group of polished executives, clearly fresh from sealing an important deal.

Completely unaware of her surroundings, Joyce was engrossed in playfully sharing candy mouth-to-mouth with her companion.

Alexander,fresh from sealing an important deal, was strolling through the corridor on his way to grab a bite.

As he headed to the restaurant, something-or rather someone-caught his eye. HHis stride faltered slightly,and he turned his head for a clearer look.

"Daniela? What brings you here?"
###Chapter 271 He Brings Me Happiness


Alexander was quite taken aback to see Daniela at the mall. She never liked shopping and even when chasing after him, she seldom wished to spend time with him.

For Daniela, shopping was a complete waste of time.

With a chuckle and clear amusement, she remarked, "Mr. Bennett, you're concentrating on the wrong aspects."

Alexander hadn't expected Daniela to reply, yet there she stood, ready to engage.

Previously, Alexander was indifferent to her comments, but today, something changed.

Daniela's readiness to converse delighted him.

He even smiled, his voice growing gentle. "What do you mean? Where should my attention be?"

Daniela smiled faintly. She observed Joyce reaching up to kiss the man next to her and coyly snuggling into his arms.

"What's the matter?" Alexander inquired, noticing Daniela's silence. "Why did you stop talking?"

Daniela redirected her gaze back to him.

Alexander continued, "Where should my attention be, Daniela? I believe my focus is correct." His voice was soft and playful, touched with flirtation.

Cedric could no longer bear it and stepped in, pulling Daniela away. He sneered, "What nonsense is this?Alexander, you're a married man. Shouldn't your focus be elsewhere? Do you need Daniela to teach you that?"

Alexander stood tall, meeting Cedric's glare. "I am merely speaking with Daniela. It's well known that Joyce and I are incompatible. I'm in the midst of divorcing her. Daniela is an extraordinary woman, and she's free to be pursued by anyone. What authority do you have to interfere?" If Alexander had not spoken those words, Cedric might have remained calm. However, the mention of "authority" made Cedric smirk with evident satisfaction. "What authority do I have? You're not worthy of an answer."

Alexander scoffed, "To an outsider, it might seem like Daniela is already your wife. You should think before you boast,especially in her presence."

Cedric's smirk was one of utter self-satisfaction. "Her marrying me is just a matter of time. I'm completely in control here."

Alexander frowned at his words.

Daniela, noticing Joyce descending the stairs, quickly lost interest in her discussion with Alexander. She pulled on Cedric's sleeve. "Let's go. It's time to head home."

With that, Daniela and Cedric left without a backward glance.

Earlier that day, after signing a contract, Alexander felt a surge of happiness, feeling a newfound closeness to Daniela.

Yet,he was restless throughout their dinner.

The memory of Daniela tugging on Cedric's sleeve haunted him.

Daniela,a woman who treasured her personal space more than most, usually didn't let just anyone close.

Alexander had always viewed her need for space as an intense obsession.

But moments ago, Daniela had easily invaded that spacewith Cedric, so naturally that she might not have even realized it.

Alexander's gaze grew darker, his heart sinking deeper.

He believed he had to work harder and elevate his financial status to match Daniela's before he could declare his love for her once more.

Joyce had not yet left the mall when she bumped into Katrina. "Oh my gosh!" Katrina gasped and hurriedly pulled Joyce into the women's restroom.

Joyce called out to the man waiting outside, "Milo, wait for me.I'll be out soon."

Katrina was visibly upset. "Joyce, have you lost your senses? Are you cheating on Alexander?"

Joyce looked back calmly. "Why not? If Alexander won't sleep with me, someone else will."

Taking a moment, Katrina inhaled deeply before probing further. "How much are you paying this man each month?"

Joyce raised three fingers.

Katrina's expression turned to shock. "You're out of your mind! I've seen this man at a party before. He was with a woman who ended up losing everything because of him! Everyone knows about it. Weren't you aware?"

Joyce responded confidently, "That won't happen to me. I'm not like the rest. Besides, Milo isn't with me for my money."

Katrina scoffed at her reply. "If not for money, then what? Why would you give him three million a month?"

"It's my decision," Joyce retorted. "We are a couple. I get dividends each month. What's wrong with sharing a bit with him? I just want him to be comfortable. Is there anything wrong with that?"

Now,Katrina regretted her earlier decision deeply.

Had she foreseen this outcome, she would not have persuaded Daniela to give Joyce those shares.

Wealth could change people, and it was clear Joyce wasn't adept at handling it.

She had never imagined Joyce would betray her husband like this.

"Why are you so astonished, Mom? When you were seeing Caiden, wasn't he still married? Brylee was alive then. How is what I'm doing any different from what you did?"

Katrina paused,taking a deep breath. "It's different. Caiden was wealthy, and I benefited from him. What do you get from this relationship?" Katrina paused, taking a deep breath."It's different. Caiden was wealthy, and I benefited from him. What do you get from this relationship?"

"Joy, happiness. What Alexander can't provide, he can," Joyce answered.
###Chapter 272 Katrina Took The Blame


Katrina narrowed her eyes. "You two are out shopping in such a public place. Aren't you concerned about running into Alexander?"

"No," Joyce responded with confidence. "Alexander is on a business trip."

Katrina was startled by this. "Joyce! How could you be so careless? I just saw Alexander. He mentioned he's heading upstairs for dinner. How do you not know whether your husband is on a business trip or not? If you cheat on him, he's sure to divorce you!"

Joyce gave a nonchalant shrug. "If he wants a divorce, that's fine by me. I'mn financially stable and there are plenty of other options out there. I don't need to cling to Alexander. He doesn't love me, anyway. Don't worry, Mom. I know what I'm doing. Milo is waiting for me outside. I have to go." With that, she fixed her hair in the mirror and departed.

Katrina's expression turned to one of disapproval. Losing interest in shopping, she headed straight home to wait for Daniela.

Meanwhile, Cedric, feeling the movie outing was lackluster, decided to return home and watch a film in Daniela's room instead.

But as he opened the villa door, he was surprised to see Katrina there without Johan.

With a grave look, she addressed Daniela. "Daniela, I need a moment with you."

Cedric's expression soured immediately. Why was it so difficult to have a private moment with his wife?

Daniela gave Cedric a reassuring smile, then told Katrina, "Wait a moment." She then guided Cedric upstairs.

Cedric was still bewildered when Katrina stood and addressed Daniela sharply. "How long must I wait? I have something important to say." "You'll need to wait until I'm done here before we can talk," Daniela responded without turning,her tone dismissive.

Cedric was then escorted back to Daniela's room. He lingered there, gazing at her.

Despite being taller, he felt overwhelmed in her presence, as though she could easily swayhim.

Daniela motioned Cedric into the room and met his gaze silently, saying nothing.

Under her intense stare, Cedric's earlier irritation melted away. He asked softly, "What's troubling you?"

"Why do you seem upset?" Daniela inquired.

Cedric averted his eyes, replying, "I'm not upset."

"Really?"

Affirming, Cedric said, "Yes."

Daniela then rose slightly on her toes and kissed him gently.

It was a brief kiss, but it sent a shiver down Cedric's spine.

As he looked at her, Daniela questioned him again, "Why are you upset?" Her expression was cool and detached.

Cedric, gathering his resolve, countered, "You're my wife. Is it wrong to show my feelings?"

Daniela simply looked at him. She then tiptoed again and delivered a longer, more meaningful kiss. "Still upset?" she asked.

Cedric nodded. "Yes."

Daniela continued to kiss him, soothing his feigned distress.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Katrina's patience was wearing thin. She quietly asked the maid, "What are they possibly discussing upstairs for so long?"

The maid, not bothered by the inquiry, answered, "They're always like this. They get along well. I noticed Cedric making frequent early morning visits upstairs, saying he was bringing Daniela water."

Hearing the maid's explanation, Katrina was incredulous. Ddn't Daniela have water in her room? Was it something special about the water provided by Cedric?

As she pondered this, Daniela descended the stairs.

Katrina quickly asked, "Where's Cedric? Still in your room?"

Daniela's face remained impassive, though her lips were slightly reddened.

"He's organizing some company data," she responded nonchalantly as she walked towards the sofa and turned on the TV. "What did you want to discuss with me?"

While Daniela focused on the TV, Katrina, feeling a bit dissatisfied, decided not to press further. Instead, she ventured, "Could you do me a favor?"

Daniela, picking up an apple, responded flatly,"No."

"I haven't even told you what it is yet."

Daniela stayedsilent, her attention fixed on the TV, her demeanor detached.

When Cedric descended the stairs and saw Daniela's aloof expression, the peace he had just reclaimed was unsettled again.

"I's nothing serious," Katrina mentioned, trying to remain nonchalant despite her internal turmoil over Joyce's recent actions. "Could you transfer Joyce's dividends to me?"

Daniela turned and asked,"Why?"

Unable to reveal her true motives, Katrina said, "I'm a bit strapped for cash lately."

Daniela responded, "Ask Joyce to transfer them to you. I don't handle those details."

Katrina clenched her teeth in frustration. "Fine. I'll tell you the truth-Joyce and Alexander are divorcing.I don't want the Bennett family to get any dividends from the robotics company. I'd appreciate if you could halt the dividend distribution until I get things sorted." Unbeknownst to Katrina, Daniela had already ordered the halt on dividends.

Seeing Katrina willing to take the blame, Daniela was content to let her do so. "What should I say if Joyce asks?" she asked.
###Chapter 273 All Her Efforts Were In Vain


Katrina asserted with conviction, "Blame it on me. After áll, I'm Joyce's mother,"

Daniela stayed quiet, her attention turning back to the television as she nibbled or her apple.

Katrina pleaded for a long time, even writing a guarantee letter, before Daniela finally relented.

Grateful, Katrina showered her with thanks. "We're family, after all. I always knew you had a soft heart,Daniela, far mnore understanding than Joyce." She then headed upstairs.

She was certain that without financial support, Milo would leave Joyce.

Everything would then revert to normal.

When Joyce stormed in, Johan was attempting to hypnotize Daniela.

The sudden intrusion caused Johan to jump, disrupting the hypnosis-it was ineffective.

Though Johan harbored resentment, Joyce's overbearing nature overshadowed his feelings.

With determined strides, she closed the distance to Daniela, her tone laced with frustration. "Why haven't |received the dividends yet?"

Daniela propped her chin on her hand and glanced at Katrina, who recoiled slightly. "We're facing some operational challenges, so the dividends are on hold for now. Is there an issue with that?"

Caught off guard, Joyce faltered, her haughty demeanor softening slightly. "But the payments were made every five days before!"

"Perhaps they were, but that's not the case now."

"Why not?"

"I see no point in repeating myself. Were you not able to grasp what | said?" Joyce's arrogance crumbled even more, her voice faltering. "But..."

"No buts, Joyce. Have you forgotten that you're merely a minor shareholder? Or has the company's support made you lose sight of your place here?"

At that moment, any trace of arrogance left i Joyce evaporated.

Johan watched,utterly fascinated.

Daniela had the uncanny ability to sway emotions effortlessly. With just a handful of words, she had left Joyce deflated and defeated.

Joyce, clearly upset, protested, "But you can't completely halt the distributions. We all have emergencies to deal with."

Katrina, who had been a silent observer, was surprised by Daniela's tactfulness in not outing her involvement.

Watching Joyce lose her edge, Katrina got up with a steady gaze. "Joyce, enough of this nonsense. The company must make its own decisions. How dare you challenge Daniela's management? You should be more mindful of expenses. The company's growth is paramount. Besides, owning such a minor share,why the fuss?"

This statement made Joyce frown deeply. She bit back her rage, knowing better than to lose it in front of Daniela now.

Quietly, she pulled Katrina aside to the doorway and then burst out. "Mom, what was that about? Were you really taking Daniela's side just now? What the hell is wrong with you? Remember, I loaned you that eight million. Well, since you believe it's all for the company, you might as well give it back. I need it back now."

The heat of Katrina's rage burned through her piercing stare. "Have you lost your mind, squandering money on a gigolo? Didn't I make it clear what that money was for? And now you have the nerve to ask for more?Do you still covet what Daniela has?"

With a sharp glare, Joyce fired back, "I've given up on that. I just want Milo. It's been days since he last took my calls. Just give me the money!"Katrina's hands trembled with fury. The thought that her daughter was being manipulated by a man fifled her with disgust.

"There's nothing left! Joyce, I'm warning you! Dump that worthless Milo, or don't bother calling mé your mother ever again!"

With those Tinal words, Katrina whirled around and stormed back into the villa, slamming the door with such force that it made Johan startle in the background.

Meanwhile, Daniela remained engrossed in the television,utterly indifferent.

Standing by the door, Katrina gazed at Daniela's composed figure and felt a surge of frustration. Why couldn't she have a daughter as remarkable as Daniela?

Why was her own daughter ensnared in foolishness?

All the dreams she had harbored for Joyce crumbled to dust, all her efforts rendered futile.
###Chapter 274 He's Quite A Sight


Katrina stepped into the room and murmured a sincere "Thank you" to Daniela.

Daniela offered Katrina a fleeting glance but chose to remain silent.

She kept to herself the fact that Katrina had implored her to withhold the dividends, understanding well that anger, when allowed to fester and boil over time, could erupt with devastating effect. This was when the results were most profound.

Daniela maintained her composure, serene and unruffled, while nearby, Johan queried, "When are we going to share a meal together?"

Leaning her chin on her hand with a soft smile, Daniela replied, "There will be an opportunity soon."

That evening, as Daniela graced the banquet, she couldn't help but notice Joyce had brought Milo along.

With a sharp click of her tongue, Lillian shook her head. "Milo really has a way with Joyce, charming her into bringing him here."

Ryan chimed in, "I heard Milo gave Joyce the cold shoulder, pushing her to borrow money at steep rates just to appease him. He insisted on coming here, and Joyce, fearful of upsetting him, complied."

Daniela chuckled. "It seems Joyce's affair is the talk of our circle now, isn't it?"

"Absolutely. Milo's playing Joyce like a fiddle, using her to pave his path to more affluent connections. Hle's quite proud of his manipulations and doesn't shy from flaunting them. Tragically, Joyce is blinding herself to the reality, trapping herself with no way out."

With a spark of curiosity, Lillian leaned in and questioned, "What's so special about Milo that Joyce is this crazy about him?"

Ryan cast a glance towards Lillian, remarking with a hint of intrigue,"To thrive in this business, one must possess a certain charm. I've heard he's damn good when it comes to the bedroom." Overhearing the conversation, Cedric turned his gaze sharply towards Daniela.

Lifllian grasped Daniela's arm. "Come, let's see for ourselves what kind of man Joyce has managed to snag."

With little resistance, Daniela found herself swept along by Lillian's enthusiasm.

They approached cautiously, halting a few paces away to observe.

Milo Brewer, the man linked with Joyce, had an androgynous appeal that blurred the lines of gender.His demeanor shifted intriguingly with his gaze-pitiful when cast downward, yet mysteriously captivating when he looked up.

His eyes, when he fixed them on someone, shimmered with a profound affection that was hard to ignore.

Standing tall at six feet three inches, Milo's heritage was a tapestry of diverse ancestries, highlighted by his striking blue eyes that seemed to capture and reflect every flicker of light.

After a thorough appraisal, Lillian affirmed with a nod,"It's no mystery why Joyce is so enchanted; he's truly a remarkable sight."

Daniela, after a brief glance, averted her eyes and turned her attention to the fruit beside her.

Despite his looks, she remained unimpressed. Her own allure and the charm of her handsome husband were more than enough for her.

"Daniela, he's watching you," Lillian whispered, nudging her slightly.

Daniela didn't react at first, her gaze lowered. However, when she finally lifted her eyes, they collided with a pair of deep blue ones, reminiscent of an endless ocean-mysteriously deep and strikingly beautiful.

Men often shied away from the term"beautiful," aware it was a standard not easily met. Over her years,Daniela had encountered few who could bear the weight of such a description; Cedric had been one of those rarities.

Now, Milo stood before her as the second. Yet, despite his beauty, he lacked Cedric's breathtaking allure.He was simply, undeniably beautiful-nothing more. As their eyes locked, Milo approached her with a smooth stride. "Ms. Harper, I've heard so much about you."

Daniela offered him a courteous smile."Likewise."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving a lingering curiosity in her wake.

From the sidelines, Milo watched her departure, swirling the wine in his glass. A smirk played on his lips,piqued by the enigma of Daniela.

Beside her, Lillian inquired, "Daniela, what do you think?"

Daniela scrunched her nose slightly. "His cologne is overpowering. It's almost suffocating me."

With a slight tilt of her head, Lillian mused, "Is that so? I personally find it rather charming."

Ryan,wearing a scowl, abruptly pulled Lillian away, cutting their conversation short.

As the evening wound down and the banquet drew to a close, Cedric slipped out to fetch the car. Daniela lingered by the entrance when Milo suddenly emerged beside her. Startled, she instinctively stepped back.

The brisk wind funneling through the entryway buffeted Milo, who stood in its gusts. Daniela adjusted her scarf upwards, partly to shield herself from the chill and partly to block the waft of his cologne.

"Ms. Harper, you're tearing my heart to pieces."

Daniela offered him a faint smile. "Would you mind keeping a distance of five steps,please?"

Obligingly, Milo raised his hands in a gesture of compliance and retreated five steps. "Tell me, what's your favorite fragrance? Next time, I'll wear it just for you."

His every phrase seemed to waltz on the edge of flirtation, yet remained tastefully non-intrusive.

"Ms. Harper, may I be so bold as to ask for your contact information? I have long admired you from afar, and to meet you today has been nothing short of captivating."

Milo exuded confidence, clearly at ease in the interaction.

His history told him that strong, successful women like Daniela appreciated acknowledgment and flattery. He leveraged his extensive experience to make his approach, confident of his eventual success.

"Oh, really? Well, paying for men isn't my style. I've heard your smile could launch a thousand ships, and frankly, I can't afford that kind of expense."

"You're far too modest. As the CEO of Elite Lux, is there really anything out of your reach? I suppose I just haven't captured your attention yet. No matter, I relish a good challenge, and time is on my side." With a graceful bow, Milo tipped an imaginary hat to her.

Before he turned to leave, he flashed Daniela a conspiratorial wink and a grin.′′Asmile that could launch a thousand ships, for sure. But yours? It's in a league of its own, worth a million times more. If you'd agree to spend some time with me,I'll gladly serve you in any way. What do you say?"
###Chapter 275 You're Not My Mother


Milo wrapped up the conversation and strolled off, exuding confidence with a self-assured smile.

Turning her head, Daniela noticed Cedric's car already waiting at the side, and slid into the passenger seat.

Cedric, his voice low, remarked, "That guy was flirting with you."

It was a statement, not a question.

Daniela shot Cedric a glance and smiled. He had a habit of getting jealous, and she secretly found it endearing.

From the back seat, Lillian jumped in, her voice brimming with curiosity. "Daniela, I heard Milo charges fifty grand a night for his company. If he's willing to waive that for you, isn't that a pretty swreet deal?"

Daniela let out a quiet chuckle, her eyes flicking to Cedric's visibly sour expression. "That's true. But I prefer things that retain their value."

Pulling out her phone, she transferred ten million to Cedric. "I'd rather invest in a truly expensive man,like one worth ten million a night."

Cedric's phone vibrated, and when he checked it, he saw a notification confirming a ten-million-dollar deposit into his account.

Lillian leaned forward to peek at Cedric's screen, then groaned dramatically."Ugh, you two lovebirds are unbearable! Let me out of the car-I can't handle all this PDA!"

Cedric turned the wheel with a grin that stretched from ear to ear, unable to hide his slelight.

In that moment, Daniela realized she had discovered a fresh reason to work hard and earn more money.

She found that teasing Cedric was a surprisingly enjoyable hobby.

While she didn't care much for indulging herself, she genuinely enjoyed spoiling Cedric. Standing at a distance, Joyce saw Milo deep in conversation with Danlela. But he wouldn't let her approach,so she could only watch with longing.

After losing Alexander to Dániela, Joyce couldn't shake the fear that Milo might also slip through her fingers.

Unsure of how to keep his attention, she resorted to showering Milo with money.

However, the borrowed cash soon dried up. By the time Joyce maxed out over a dozen credit cards, MAilo had disappeared from her life yet again.

The situation left her in a state of extreme anxiety.

To her dismay, she saw Milo standing beside her rival, Liza Alvarado.

Her anger boiled over, and she went to find Daniela.

Bursting into the room, she yelled, "Daniela, I don't care what it takes-you have to give me money right now!"

Daniela,sitting in the living room with the TV on, didn't flinch. Her face remained calm and unreadable.

"Or better yet, how much for those stocks?" Joyce pressed. "Just tell me how much, and I'll sell them to you."

Katrina sprang to her feet, her face flushed with anger, and slapped Joyce hard. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Yes, I'm crazy!" Joyce shouted back. "I need Milo in my life-he makes me feel aliv/e,like a real woman! I'll do whatever it takes to keep him! So, either you give me the money, or I'm selling the shares. The choice is yours!"

After her outburst, Joyce turned her attention to Daniela, waiting for a response.
0
Daniela realized this was the moment she had been anticipating. Smiling faintly, she asked, "Joyce, have you forgotten? Those shares were a gift from mne."

Joyce frowned,.confused."What do you mean? A gift can't be sold?"

Johan,seated quietly nearby, watched as Daniela deftly worked towards her desired outcome. "The shares I gave you can't be sold," Daniela declared matter-of-factly.

Panic flashed across Joyce's face. "Why not?" she demanded.

Daniela explained, "Because they came with conditions. Imagine if you sold them to someone who could use them against me. I can't afford to leave myself vulnerable."

Joyce stood frozen, unable to process what she had just heard.

Daniela added, "And about the dividends...

Katrina's face went pale. She feared what Daniela would say next.

Daniela went on, "Your mother told me not to distribute dividends to you. Since money shouldn't just sit idle,I reinvested it into the company's next research project. There won't be dividends for the next ten years."

Katrina's jaw dropped in disbelief at Daniela's revelation. Snapping back to reality, she exclaimed, "I only told you to withhold dividends temporarily, not to sink them into investments!"

"You can't be serious. This is company money. The funds have to be utilized, so as the majority shareholder,I reinvested them into research. It's a logical decision based on what you told me. Are you now trying to backtrack?"

Her words hit Katrina like a dagger.

Johan watched in amazement from the sidelines.

Was Daniela truly unaware of psychology?

How could someone so seemingly unaware be so skillful at psychological manipulation?

Joyce, upon hearing everything, was on the verge of breaking down. She confronted Katrina, crying out,"Mom! Why would you do that? Ten years with no dividends! You did it deliberately, didn't you? If I don't do what you want, you make my life a nightmare!"

Joyce beat her chest with a loud thud. "I'm your daughter! Why are you doing this to me? Why?"

Her voice cracked as she screamed,"Why?" Katrina moved to explain, but Joyce shoved her away violently, "You've never treated me like your daughter.You've only seen me as your puppet. You want to control me, to manipulate me for your entire life. If I don't follow your orders, you punish me without mercy. You're not my mother, not really. I can't stand it anymore. I never want to be under your control again!"

Katrina shook her head in desperation.

But Joyce, in a fit of rage, shoved her once again.

The force sent Katrina tumbling to the floor, her head hitting the steps, causing a painful crack and blood to start trickling down her temple.

Joyce, however, showed no concern. She glared at Katrina with a look of pure hatred, as though the woman on the floor wasn't her mother but a bitter enemy she could no longer tolerate.
###Chapter 276 Your Family Has Put Us In A Tough Spot


Katrina watched, stunned, as Joyce knelt before Daniela. Her eyes widened with shock. Struggling to her feet, she cried out, "Joyce! Have you lost your senses? How can you kneel before Daniela?"

Joyce, her own daughter, was kneeling to Daniela, Brylee's daughter.

To Katrina, having battled to surpass Brylee, this was tantamount to a crushing defeat.

It felt like a silent confession of her defeat.

No! She wouldn't lose! How could she lose to Brylee's daughter? Never!

"Joyce, stand up!" Katrina yelled, her face contorted with anger.

Clutching her throbbing head, she tried to pull Joyce away.

However, Joyce held firmly to Daniela's pants, unmoving.

Watching Daniela sit upright with a chilly look, Katrina's stance faltered.

When Daniela looked up and their eyes met, Katrina felt as if she saw Brylee's reflection in her. Guilt washed over her, and she quickly looked away.

Meanwhile, Joyce, unaware of the emnotional turmoil, continued to thud her head against the floor.In desperation, she blurted out to Daniela, "These shares are worth a lot! I'll sell them to you for just twenty million. Hand me the money, and they're yours."

Daniela rose slowly, gazing down at Joyce with clear disdain.
0
Her look was as dismissive as one might glance at an unworthy pet.

In a calm, measured voice, Daniela responded, "I'm sorry, but you can't alter the past. The profits have already been allocated to a new venture, so withdrawing them isn't possible."

Daniela skillfully shifted the blame onto Katrina. For the first time, Katrina witnessed a profound hatred in Joyce's eyes.

Her heart quivered as she murmured, "Joyce, I did everything for your benefit."

"For my benefit? That's laughable. Where were you when the Bennett family shunned me? Why did you arrange my marriage to Alexander, only to leave me feeling deserted? And now, you alone decide on my shares! Ten years without dividends-what good are these shares to me?"

Joyce was desperate.

She had less than ten days.

If she didn't send money to Milo within ten days, he'd leave her.

This thought triggered a surge of panic in Joyce.

She feared losing Milo and couldn't accept that possibility.

In a rush,Joyce ran off,Katrina's voice echoing after her into the void.

Meanwhile, everyone in Olisvine was reeling from the robot company's announcement of a ten-year halt on dividends.

"Why? Weren't they making regular payouts before?"

"Indeed, I've just invested in a villa, relying on those returns. What about my mortgage now?"

"I've purchased a luxury vehicle. Without those dividends, I can't even cover the fuel costs!"

"My entire retirement hinges on these dividends. What's happening?"

Richard, who had recently funneled his retirement funds into the company, was awaiting another significant return when the payments abruptly stopped.	0

Pale and unsteady, he contacted the company's operations manager.

The manager courteously explained that the dividend suspension was due to internal business decisions.

Richard felt something was amiss with Daniela's management style. As he prepared to confront her, the association that had dealings with Daniela's company came to a decisive conclusion.

"Richard, your family has really put us in a difficult position!"
###Chapter 277 I'm Not Daniela


Richard was completely taken aback. "Enough with the underhanded comments. I've put in money too, just as much as you! How is this debacle my fault?

"Richard, are you really in the dark?" The mocking tone from the other end of the phone stung. "Haven't you heard? It's your daughter-in-law, Joyce, who stirred up this hornet's nest. I've done some digging. Joyce was desperate for cash to prop up her beau. Worried Joyce would squander it, Katrina had Daniela put a freeze on the dividends. Daniela felt the funds could serve a better purpose, so she channeled them into a new venture. Now, all that cash is tied up in research and development, which means dividends are off the table for now."

Richard absorbed every word. He understood them all individually, but pieced together, they were gibberish to him.

His mind whirled, torn between asking,′′Which man is Joyce supporting?" and′′|sit certain there will be no dividends?"

The voice continued, "Richard, it's the talk of Olisvine. Because of Joyce, there are no dividends. Joyce and Katrina are now public enemies. Tell your daughter-in-law to watch her back outside, or she might find herself in hot water!"

The speaker was Richard's old friend. Despite his attempt to moderate his tone, the words came out biting.

To mess with someone's financial lifeline was to court disaster.

This grudge was monumental.	0

Richard's first move was to call the robotics company, which confirmed the invested funds were locked in.

He hung up and sat stunned.

His retirement savings, accumulated from years of toil, were meant to secure a stress-free twilight.And now,because of Joyce,they were up in smoke.

A fierce rage burned within Richard.

Just as he was about to call Alexander, the door clicked open and Joyce entered.

"How dare you show your face here?" Richard leaped to his feet. "Joyce, do you comprehend the chaos you've caused? Because of you, the Bennett family is dragged through the mud. How can you just waltz in here? Are you tangled up with another man?"

He couldn't bring himself to say "having an affair." He trusted Joyce hadn't strayed that far.

Before marrying Alexander, Joyce had been as headstrong about it as Daniela. Having achieved her goal,why would she stray?

Daniela was decent. Joyce, raised in the same home, should know better.

But Joyce, disheveled, declared, "Everything they say is true. I want a divorce from Alexander, and half of the Bennett family's assets."

Richard froze. A chill crawled up his spine. He stared at Joyce, his eyes wide with shock and dismay."What did you just say?"

"I'm perfectly calm, and I mean every word," Joyce asserted, her lips pressed tight. Before arriving, she'd talked to Milo. He wasn't after her money, but he was strapped for cash. If she couldn't help him, he'd have to look elsewhere.

How could she let the man she loved slip through her fingers? Milo was too precious; he was hers alone.Since she couldn't liquidate her shares in the robotics company, she'd cash in her now meaningless marriage instead.

She settled herself on the sofa, channeling Daniela's usual composure, trying to think what her sister would do in such a scenario. Somehow, this brought her peace.

She told Richard, "The Bennett name carries weight, and Alexander cares about his image. I'm still his wife.If I'm shamed, it reflects poorly on him too, right?" Richard trembled with anger at that. He realized he had overestimated Joyce's sense of propriety. He scoffed, "So what?"

"I don't want to have a falling-out with you. I've given my all to this marriage, but Alexander has never truly accepted me. He's hinted at divorce before. I know he still pines for Daniela. I'm ready to step aside. After the divorce, blame it all on me, and I'Il bear it silently."

Richard was taken aback. He saw that when people lost all shame, they gained a cunning edge.

Joyce was so clear-headed,calculated and determined.

She eyed Richard and said, "But this divorce won't come cheap."

Richard braced himself, knowing Joyce was about to lay down her terms.

"I want half of the Bennett family's assets, not a penny less."

Securing half of the fortune would more than suffice to tide Milo over through his financial storm. Then,they could weave their future together.

Richard, trembling with fury, pointed a finger at Joyce, his tone icy and measured. "You've only been part of the Bennett family for a mere half a year. Aside from a trail of scandals, what value have you added? On what grounds do you stake a claim to our wealth? Joyce, if you have any conscience, you'd initiate the divorce yourself, respecting the years you and Alexander have shared."

Joyce responded with a cold, humorless smile. "I don't have any conscience. There's no thread binding Alexander and me. I am not as forgiving as Daniela. I lay claim to what's mine, and I will seize it."
###Chapter 278 A Gift For Her Daughter


Richard's eyes widened in disbelief. "Joyce, how dare you claim the Bennett family's wealth yours? it has nothing to do with you. Moreover, you're the one having an affair. You deserve nothing."

Joyce looked at Richard with a chilly gaze. "What? Do all women who marry into your family have to leave empty-handed? I am not Daniela. If you care about your family's reputation, you should giveme half of the assets. Otherwise, don't blame me for making things awkward!"

Joyce ascended the stairs. "I'll give you one night to think it over. If you don't transfer the funds by tomorrow, I'll release the scandalous photos of me and the man. Then, Bennett Group's stocks will take another hit."

Richard remained below, watching Joyce disappear into her room.

His anger was so intense he thought he might have a heart attack.

Joyce was nothing but a bitch!

She was ready to tarnish her own reputation for a man!

Now, she was threatening to expose her infidelity.

How could the Harper family have raised such disparate daughters?

Back then, Daniela had departed quietly without any drama.

In contrast, Joyce seemed like a person possessed by a demon, hell-bent on destroying the Bennett family.

What a malevolent woman!

Richard tried to reach Alexander, but all attempts to contact him failed.

Left with no other options, he decided to call Katrina.

Daniela, reclining on the sofa, could hear Richard's voice on the other end, lashing out at Joyce. Nearby, Johan observed Daniela's stoic expression as she continued to watch TV.

However, he suspected that Daniela was somehow linked to this entire debacle.

She had masterminded the ruin of these people silently.

As he was lost in his thoughts, Daniela slowly raised her eyes to meet his in a silent, icy stare that lasted a few seconds.

Johan felt a tight grip of anxiety as he clenched his hands on his knees.

Daniela turned her attention back to the TV, her expression unchanged.

Richard's voice filled the living room. "Joyce has really outdone herself! Do you know what she told me?I can hardly say it! She wants half of the Bennett family's assets now. I won't go into details, but Katrina, is my family's wealth what you're really after?"

Before Katrina could reply, Richard continued, "If that's what's happening, then fine, let's throw caution to the wind!"

Quickly, Katrina apologized. "Joyce has lost her mind. That's why she's behaving like this. Please, don't be angry. I'll speak to my daughter. Let's not mention divorce. She's still young, and everyone makes mistakes at times. Let's just say Joyce is indebted to Alexander for this. We'll compensate him later, so please, calm down."

After Katrina offered a barrage of soothing words, Richard hung up the phone.

Katrina then reached out to Joyce.

Joyce respondedcurtly, "Either you get me the money, or I will divorce Alexander. The choice is yours!"

Just as Katrina was about to reply, the call abruptly ended.

Katrina remained in the living room for a long while, visibly frustrated and tugging at her hair.

When she finally looked up, her eyes met Daniela's.

At that moment, Johan saw Cedric narrowing his eyes."Daniela," Katrina said boldly, "you heard everything, didn't you? We're all family. You need to help me."

Daniele changed the channel on the TV with the remote.

"It's not much, just lend me ten million, okay?" Katrina added.

Daniela chuckled briefly. "So now you need money/to support Joyce's man? That's quite unexpected!"

Katrina pursed her lips, tightened her grip, and seemed to come to a firm decision. "Daniela, I won't just borrow your money. At an auction once, I won something quite valuable. Let me know how much you'd want for it, alright? Consider it a purchase from you."

Daniela remained silent.

After a moment, Katrina returned from her room holding a brocade box.

Daniela casually glanced up, but her expression froze in shock upon seeing Katrina's item.

Cedric immediately perceived a shift in Daniela's emotions.

Approaching Daniela, Katrina opened the box to reveal a radiant, luminous pearl."Could this be worth ten million?"

The blankness in Daniela's eyes slowly gave way to a profound, icy intensity. Her gaze shifted from the pearl to Katrina's face, and she scoffed derisively.

Katrina felt her heart miss a beat.

"Is this yours?" Daniela inquired,her tone icy.

Katrina inhaled deeply.

When Brylee jumped off the building, she had this pearl in her hand.	0

Originally intended as part of a crown for her daughter's wedding, Brylee had the pearl with her that day.

After Brylee's leap, Katrina found the invaluable pearl and took it for herself.

Initially, she intended to give it to Joyce as a wedding gift. However, as Daniela's influence expanded, Katrina reconsidered.

Now,facing desperate circumstances, she felt compelled to take a risk.

She wagered that Daniela was too young at the time to recognize the pearl's worth.

She speculated that Brylee had never shown the pearl to Daniela and that Daniela was too young to recall any of it.
###Chapter 279 Did You Offend Cedric


Katrina hesitated as she held out the pearl.

Daniela gave no visible sign of surprise, which allowed Katrina to release a quiet breath of relief.

"Take a look at this pearl. Caiden presented it to me on our wedding day. I never thought I'd let it go,but I'm in dire need of cash at the moment. What do you think it's worth? Just throw out a number; I promise I won't haggle."

Daniela's gaze remained fixed on the television, seemingly uninterested.

As the echo of Katrina's plea died away, the dialogue from the television filled the expansive living room, the characters' voices a stark contrast to the tense silence between the two women.

Seeing Daniela's continued indifference, Katrina's heart sank, her hopes of a simple transaction fading.

She pressed her lips together, contemplating her next move-to take the pearl to an auction house, though she dreaded the hefty fees that would diminish its yield.

Just as Katrina was about to reach out to the auction house, Daniela's voice cut through the quiet.

"Ten million." Her tone was nonchalant, her eyes still on the screen.

Elation surged through Katrina. She glanced at the pearl cradled in her palm, feeling a twinge of greed."Daniela, we're family. Don't you think that's a bit on the low side? Perhaps consider a higher offer? This piece is truly magnificent."

Daniela responded with only a slight,enigmatic smile.

Across her, Johan reclined in his chair.

"Well, aren't you starting to push your luck?" Unruffled as ever, Daniela maintained her usual stoic demeanor,seemingly indifferent even at home. The air tensed around Katrina; a surge of anxiety struck her.

"Don't get upset. We're family, after all. A little more or less shouldn't matter, right?" Despite her efforts to appear calm, Katrina harbored a growing fear of Daniela. "How about twelve million?"

"Eight million," Daniela countered without missing a beat.

Katrina's heart skipped. "Why drop the price? Daniela?" She clutched the pearl more tightly. "Twelve million is already under the market rate."

"Six million."

A knot formed in Katrina's stomach. "This isn't fair..."

"Five million."

Katrina's eyes widened in dismay.

Daniela flashed her a chilling, dismissive smile, shattering Katrina's hopes in an instant.

Daniela's voice was icy, her composure unshaken. "Katrina, you're hardly in a position to negotiate. Frankly,I'm not interested in that pearl. But what about Joyce's predicament? Didn't she set your deadline for tonight to come up with the funds? Imagine what will happen if you don't deliver by tomorrow. Soon enough,the whole town will buzz with tales of your daughter and her never-ending scandals."

Katrina was well aware that presenting the item at an auction would entail a longwait in line, hoping against hope for the right purchaser to come along.

Such a process could span several agonizing weeks. Yet Joyce couldn't afford todelay.

Both Daniela and Katrina recognized the urgency.

As Josie handed Daniela a plate brimming with fresh fruit, Daniela accepted it, then declared with a cold firmness, "Four million. Say another word, and I won't give ita second thought."

Without waiting for a response, Daniela rose and made her way upstairs.

Watching Daniela's retreating back, Katrina's frustration bubbled over, and she bit her lip hard, her gaze burning with indignation. Comered and out of optlons, she conceded, her voice strained. "Fine! Four million!

At Katrina's capitulation, Daniela halted her ascent, pausing on the stairs above to cast a sweeping glance downward.

For a flicker of a moment, Katrina suspected Daniela remembered the pearl. It seemed Daniela always knew At was meant to be the gift from her mother.

Before Katrina could fully grasp the moment, Cedric took the pearl from her."I've transferred the four million to you."

Katrina's eyes darted to her phone, confirming the transaction was complete.

"Wasn't Daniela supposed to handle the payment?" she asked Cedric.

"She doesn't need to concern herself with paying for something so minor. I've taken care of it." With that,Cedric turned and ascended the stairs, pearl in hand.

Left alone, Katrina clutched her phone, her fingers white from the grip.

A surge of humiliation washed throuugh her-she had sacrificed her pride for the sake of money, only to be played by Daniela's manipulative games.

Cedric, seemingly oblivious to the weight of his gesture, nonchalantly paid as though the amount was a mere four dollars.

Katrina was seething with resentment.

She couldn't help but wonder why her own daughter hadn't married someone as influential as Cedric.

What qualities did Daniela possess that Joyce seemed to lack?

Unbeknownst to Cedric, the pearl held a tumultuous history.

Daniela's revelation of its story left him profoundly shaken.

Earlier, when they were downstairs, he had only noticed her distress; he hadn't grasped the depth of her turmoil until now.

His heart heavy with empathy, Cedric enveloped her in a comforting embrace and murmured, "It seems that fate has returned the pearl to you. I've taken care of the payment, Daniela. Consider it a blessing from your mother, delivered through my hands. Please, let go of your sorrow. Remember, I'm here for you, and in spirit,so is she."

That night, Daniela retreated to her room, her spirit damnpened by the day's emotions.

Cedric joined her, synchronizing his nightly routine with hers in a tender gesture of solidarity.

It was only after Daniela drifted into sleep that he opened his eyes in the quiet darkness.

A fierce resolve ignited within him, casting a stark contrast to the gentleness he had just displayed.

Alexander had spent more than a month working on a major business deal.

Just as he was poised to finalize the agreement, Phillips Group unexpectedly swooped in and clinched a five-year deal with his prospective partner.

Stunned by this sudden turn of events, Alexander discretely passed some money to a contact at the other company,seeking clarity.

"Did you offend Cedric? We're far from a big player; it's unusual Cedric would notice us..There's no way it's solely because of our work. So, what's the real reason behind his sudden interest? Could it be an act of retribution against you?"
###Chapter 280 Divorce


Alexander was at his wits' end.

For ages, Cedric had never once made a move against him.

Such behavior seemed beneath Cedric, as though he considered it beneath him to sully his hands.

Thus,Alexander had been living in a bubble of security. Why then was Cedric now showing his displeasure?

As Alexander grappled with his confusion, a distressing call from the company broke through. It seemed Phillips Group had poached several of their long-standing clients overnight.

Those who resisted signing with Phillips Group found themselves swallowed up through hostile takeovers.

The remaining clients of Bennett Group were now quaking in their boots.

Over the phone, Alexander's secretary asked, "What's our plan?"

Alexander was at a loss for words. Later, a tip from an ally revealed they had paid a handsome sum to bribe a manager at Phillips Group for insights. The aggressive strategy, it turned out, was all because Joyce had crossed Cedric. The manager also sneered that Alexander was cursed by bad luck to have married such a disaster like Joyce.

Fury blazed within Alexander.

Realizing that staying abroad would do no good, he booked the next flight home.

Upon arriving, he tore off his tie in frustration and flung his briefcase onto the sofa.
 
Just as he was about to summon Joyce, Richard burst in, seething. "Joyce's kept a boy toý!"

Alexander's world stopped. He stared icily at Richard, disbelief etching his features. He squeezed his eyes shut, struggling to cage his wrath. "How long has this been going on?"

Richard's face was a picture of fury. "It's been whispered about for some time, but she's only recently started flaunting him in public. Now the whole town's abuzz. It's utterly shameful."

Richard shook lis head in revulsion. "That's the last straw. You need to divorce her. There's no telling what other stunts she'll pufl. She's thrown decency to the winds. Just last week, she conned four million dollars from Dániela and squandered it with that man in mere days. Now, she's roped Katrína into her schemes to drum up more cash. Joyce has completely lost her senses."

He massaged his temples wearily. "We need to discuss this divorce tonight. I refuse to live under this cloud of disgrace any longer."

With that, Richard retreated to his room, clearly drained and disgusted.

Katrina,equally shamed, agreed to meet with Richard and Alexander.

When Alexander arrived, Katrina greeted him with a smile.

Alexander's face was set in stone as he walked through the living room, his eyes briefly meeting Daniela's.

She sat on the sofa, legs crossed, engrossed in her phone.

Alexander knew Cedric was absent, tied up at an internationalconference as its keynote speaker.

Ryan and Lillian were absent.

Pausing in the living area, Alexander addressed Daniela, who seemed lost in her own world, "It's been a while,Daniela."

Her lack of response was as if she deemed the conversation beneath her interest.

"I need to talk to Joyce shortly. Care to join?" Wary of a rejection, Alexander added, "Could be interesting gossip for you."

Daniela responded flatly, "Not interested."

Alexander pressed his lips together, holding back further comment, and moved towards the dining room where Katrina and Joyce were already seated.

Joyce's laughter was scornful. "Really, Alexander? Inviting Daniela to join us? What are you playing at? Looking for your next trophy wife? Think dumping me wil impress her? Has anyone ever told you you're acting like a complete ass lately?"

Alexander took a seat, his demeanor cool. In his eyes, Joyce was already nothing more than a stranger. Her affair was a thorn in the side of his business, but beyond that, he felt nothing.

The loss of a major business deal because of her was the last straw.

He was resolute about the dlvorce.

His invitation to Daniela was indeed a signal that he was back on the market.

Katrina clung to a sliver of hope for reconciliation. She smiled weakly."Joyce, stop talking nonsense. You two are the married couple here. He invited Daniela simply because she's alone and he thought she might be bored."

Joyce sneered. "The whole world knows what's really going on. Spare us the facade."

Just then, the door swung open, and the servant announced Richard's arrival.

Richard paused in the living room, addressing Daniela warmly. "Hello, Daniela. It's chilly today, isn't it? Make sure you keep warm."

Joyce overheard Richard's cordial words. She curled her lips into a scornful smile.

Once upon a time, Richard had scorned Daniela, but now here he was, pretending to be considerate. How utterly laughable!

As soon as Richard caught sight of Joyce's mocking smirk, his previously good spirits vanished.

He sat down, his face a mask of granite, clearly in no mood for niceties.
 
Joyce felt a familiar fire of anger flare up within her.
###Chapter 281 Determined To Get A Divorce
Joyce was on the brink of speaking when Richard stood and talkéd to Daniela. "Daniela, care to join?Could be interesting gossip for you."



Joyce's face soured further at his words. "Your son already invited her. Have you all become Daniela's loyal hounds now?"



Richard, unbothered by Joyce's barb, beamed at Daniela. "Daniela? Why not sit next to me? You're family,after all."


Joyce erupted into scornful laughter. "Family? What sort of family do you think you are to her? How pretentious! Daniela's the richest soul under the sun,and here you are, offering nothing but a face of desperation. Maybe take a long look in the mirror first!" Alexander's face darkened at the exchange.


Seeing Daniela putting on her headphones, Richard had no choice but to return to his seat.



The only reason he had shown up was the lure of the chance to speak with Daniela.



He needed to recover some of his past investments,and Daniela was his only hope.



With his patience for Joyce's antics drained, Richard cut straight to the chase. "Let's skip dinner. I've lost my appetite. We might as well settle this now. As far as I'm concerned, Joyce and Alexander are on a fast track to divorce."



Joyce was perched across from them. She locked eyes with Alexander. "What's your take?"


Alexander's reply was crisp and clear. "We're getting a divorce."



A shadow of bitterness flitted across Joyce's face."Fine. I want half of your fortune. If that's agreeable,we can divorce tomorrow." Alexander's expression turned steely. "Do you even grasp what you're demanding?"


Joyce's gaze didn't waver. "If you deny me what l want, I won't grant youa divorce. I'll make sure you regret it."


Richard couldn't contain his fury any longer. "You're the one at fault here! How dare you have the audacity to make demands from us?"



"I have my faults, but what about Alexander? He entered this marriage while his heart belonged to another. He's well aware of it."


Richard clenched his jaw. "You've kept a boy toy, and it's the talk of the town! How can you stand there and say that?"


"Why shouldn't I? If my husband fails to meet my needs, I'll find someone who does." Joyce's voice was icy, her face unflinching.


Richard's anger was palpable, but Alexander intervened. "This marriage is over, regardless. I can't split the assets in half, but to part amicably, I'll offer you six million for the six months we've endured together. Take it or leave it. If you refuse, I'm filing for divorce."



Joyce sneered. "Six million? Are you trying to discard me like I'm worthless?"


Alexander retorted, "As far as I can tell, you're in dire need of cash. Milo isn't a reliable fallback. Without that six million, he'll leave you. I can afford to draw this out in court. Can you?"


Alexander had done his homework on Joyce's affair with Milo.



Joyce loathed those who exploited vulnerabilities for personal gain.


Alexander was employing the same tactic Daniela had once used to manipulate Katrina.



Katrina's voice was harsh. "Fifty million. NNot a penny less! Otherwise, Joyce will remain Alexander's wife indefinitely. And don't bother threatening us with court. Sure, Joyce is at fault, but Alexander's absence hasn't exactly been conducive to a healthy marriage."


Richard's hand trembled on the table. "Joyce! Just by having you as my daughter-in-law, our family has lost millions in deals. How dare you demand fifty million!Would it kill you to let go?"


At this, all pretenses fell away.


Joyce laughed mockingly. "Why should I care about dignity now? I need the money to support Milo! I've come too far to turn back now. Give me what I want,and what happens next is none of your concern. But if you refuse, Alexander, you'll live with the shame of my indiscretions. Up till now, I've kept silent. If talks break down, who knows what I'll say?"


Richard slammed his fist on the table. "What are you implying?"



"What do you think? Alexander has neglected me for so long. If I claim he's impotent, who would doubt it?Coupled with my affair, it would all add up." Joyce was ready to sacrifice her pride for financial gain.


Richard was seething, barely able to contain his rage.


Katrina turned to interject, but Joyce cut her off coldly. "Mom, if you can't support me, at least dlon't hinder me!"



Alexander faced Joyce, his gaze acknowledging her resolve. "Alright, you're determined. I must admit,that's commendable.
###Chapter 282 Let The Bennetts Regret Their Choices
Alexander slid the divorce agreement across the table. "Sign it."


Fifty million in hand, Joyce signed the agreement,officially ending her marriage.


As she stood to leave, Alexander didn't even glance back. His only sign of hesitation was a brief moment of stillness in the living room.


Joyce lingered in her seat, a sudden emptiness settling over her. With a forced smile, she turned to Katrina. "Mom, I'm finally free! The divorce is done,and now I can go after the love I've always wanted!"


Katrina let out a heavy sigh. In her eyes, Joyce's history-having a child, ending a marriage, and keeping a boy toy- meant she'd never find anyone better than Alexander. She shook her head. "You'll regret this, Joyce. You'll see."



Joyce let out a laugh, her disbelief evident. "No, I won't. Mom, I'm texting Milo. He's coming over for dinner tomorrow. I'm going to marry him!"


Katrina felt as though the weight of the world was crashing down on her, utterly drained by Joyce's choices.



Meanwhile, Daniela ignored the conversation entirely,her patience with the family drama completely spent.



Johan leaned towards Daniela, his voice a low murmur."Did you catch that? Joyce just finalized her divorce."



Tonight, Johan saw an opportunity.


With Cedric and Daniela's friends absent, it was the perfect moment for him.


Johan exchanged a knowing glance with Katrina, who understood his unspoken intention. As she began to share her plan to hypnotize Daniela with Joyce, the latter marched out the door.



The silence in the living room was immediate and thick.



Katrina, visibly tense, sat in the dining room,watching the fondue pot bubble without taking notice.



A few moments later, Johan's voice came from the living room, quiet but final. "It's done."


Shocked into motion, Katrina sprang from her seat,her chair teetering dangerously behind her.


Johan, startled by her sudden movement, rushed to her side. "Quiet down," he hissed, his voice urgent.


Katrina gave a quick nod, her breath still shaky.


Together, they crept towards Daniela.


Sitting motionless on the couch, Daniela seemed lost, her eyes distant and unfocused, as if she were in another world.



Johan shot a questioning glance at Katrina. "What  should I do now?"



Katrina's gaze turned cold, locking onto Daniela with an almost venomous intensity. Her voice was laced with frost as she spoke to Johan. "Take her to the rooftop."


Understanding Katrina intent, Johan gave a subtle nod.



He acted quickly, guiding Daniela with steady hands.


The wind howled fiercely across the balcony, its strength tugging at Daniela's long dress as she stood there, almost motionless.



The fabric fluttered upward, caught by the fierce gusts.



Her hair was tossed around wildly, adding an extra layer of fragility to her already delicate appearance.



Katrina asked, "She won't just wake up on her own,will she?"


Johan chuckled, sucking on a lollipop. "Not unless


someone says her name. Relax, you've done this before-fifteen years ago,remember? You're a pro."


Pulling out his phone, Johan continued, "Okay, just a few more steps, and we're done. I'll head downstairs to cover my tracks. Transfer the money now. I'm out after this."



Katrina's eyes flicked to Daniela.


The scene mirrored what had happened with Brylee all those years ago.


A sense of relief washed over Katrina as she transferred the funds to Johan.



Once the transaction was complete, Johan checked the confirmation and leaned in close to Daniela,whispering the final command in her ear.


"In an hour, you'll be jumping from this building."


With those words, Johan pulled his cap lower over his eyes and turned to leave the rooftop.



Just before exiting, Johan paused and cast one last  glance at Daniela.


For a fleeting moment, unease washed over him, as if Daniela could see through every layer of his plan.


Despite the nagging feeling, everything had gone according to plan that day.


Pushing the unease aside, Johan shook off the nagging feeling.


He adjusted his cap one final time before slipping away from the house.


Alone on the rooftop, Katrina remained,perfectly at ease.She had done this before.


An entire hour stretched ahead, plenty of time for everything to unfold.


Ryan and Lillian had gone out for dinner, and it would be at least three hours before they returned.


Cedric was stuck at an international conference,followed by a banquet, and wouldn't return until late that night.  In one hour, Daniela would vanish from existence,just like her mother.


Everything Daniela had worked for would fall into her hands.



A triumphant smile tugged at Katrina's lips.


Gazing at Daniela's face, so eerily reminiscent of Brylee's, Katrina's sense of victory swelled. "Talent doesn't save you, does it? You and your mother are still nothing more than pawns in my hands.If you two hadn't been so skilled at making money, I wouldn't have ever bothered with you. But don't worry,Daniela. I'll take over Elite Lux foryou. All of it will be Joyce's. You and your mother were both so short-sighted,paving the way for my comfort all along."


Caught up in her glee, Katrina almost forgot the frustration she felt over Joyce's divorce.


Money was all Joyce needed to have any man she desired.


In contrast, Alexander was a mere shadow of the  wealth Joyce truly deserved.


The Bennett family would soon regret their decisions.
###Chapter 283 Alexander Discovered Something Unusual
The scandal involving Joyce caused Alexander to lose several keý business deals.


His divorce also drained a significant portion of his company's funds.


Overwhelmed by these setbacks, he walked around his house in a silence filled with frustration.


Initially, his plan was to secure some major contracts,then confess his feelings to Daniela.


However, with his finances depleting, he felt he could no longer delay.


Alexander remembered Daniela's distant manner in the living room, which sparked an unexplainable anxiety within him.


He worried she might not wait for him or possibly fall  for someone else.



He longed to ask her, "Can you wait for me? I'll treat you well. I'll give you everything."


Alexander paced nervously in the living room.



Just as Richard was about to speak, Alexander abruptly took the keys from the table and left without saying anything.



Richard was aware that Alexander was on his way to see Daniela.



He actually hoped that Alexander and Daniela would come back together.


If not, the investment he made in the robotics company would be locked up for a decade, a period during which he might not even be alive to reap the benefits.



Richard remained in the living room, his resolve unwavering, waiting for Alexander to come back with positive news.  Alexander was driving fast.


Daniela was on the balcony, her dress and hair fluttering wildly in the wind.


Katrina sat in a nearby chair, observing Daniela with an icy stare.


"Daniela, you previously assisted by holding back Joyce's dividends, so perhaps I owe you thanks. Yet,you are too adept, reminiscent of Brylee-calm,skilled in finance, just like your mother. Your mother and I were once close. I suggested subtly that she should leave Caiden, but her pride made her cling to him,leaving me no choice but to eliminate her. It was not my intention to end her life. She sealed her fate by choosing the wrong man. Now, here you are,repeating her errors. Why did you choose to divorce Alexander? Would it not have been simpler to remain with him? If you hadn't divorced him, he wouldn't have pursued Joyce, making her a citywide joke. But fret not, you will depart first, and soon after, I will deal with Alexander."



Glancing at the clock, Katrina noted there was still  half an hour before Daniela would need to obey Johan's directive to jump.


She needed to depart to establish an alibi. Offering Daniela a faint smile, she murmured, "Goodbye,Daniela."


Tonight, everything owned by Daniela would be hers.


And it wouldn't stop with Daniela. Alexander and eventually Caiden would also meet their ends at her hands.



Katrina chuckled softly as she prepared to leave.


"Daniela!" Just then, a voice called out from below,startling her. "Daniela!"


Startled, Katrina hurried back to the edge of the balcony and looked down.


It was Alexander.


Using a hypnotized person's name is a potent method to disrupt their trance.O


Concerned, Katrina glanced back at Daniela,who  appeared still dazed.


Katrina attempted to descend, but as she opened the rooftop door, Alexander was already ascending.


Upon seeing Katrina as well, Alexander bit back the words he was about to say to Daniela.


"Katrina, what are you doing on the rooftop?"


He then looked towards Daniela, who had her back turned to him.



"Daniela?" Alexander called again.


At the sound of his voice, Daniela seemed to ease slightly.


Alexander quickly moved to stand in front of her.He noticed clarity in her eyes momentarily, as if she were snapping out of a trance.


Frowning, he grabbed her arm and turned towards Katrina. "What happened to Daniela?" His voice carried a tone of suspicion, almost as if he were interrogating Katrina.  For a brief moment, Katrina's mind went blank. She worried she had accidentally revealed too much. She nervously clasped her hands together, her eyes darting around in panic.


Alexander's scrutiny intensified, observing how Katrina avoided his gaze, her face reddening with apparent guilt. "What were you doing just now?" he demanded, his voice hardening.


Just as Katrina felt overwhelmed, Alexander noticed Daniela's hand slip from his. He turned to Daniela."Were you feeling unwell just now?"


Daniela shook her head. "No, it's just the wind on the balcony is too strong. I'm heading downstairs." With that, she left for the lower floor.


Alexander stayed on the balcony, his gaze intense and focused as he confronted Katrina. "What were you really doing out here? Or more precisely, what were you doing to Daniela?"


Katrina attempted a nervous laugh, her nose crinkling. "What could I do? We were merely  chatting. Why won't you believe me? It's absurd to think I could harm Daniela."


With those words, Katrina turned and departed, her silhouette echoing despair.


Alexander remained silent for a while, then moved closer to the balcony's edge amidst the gusting wind.



The cold wind swirled about him, nearly causing him to stagger.


He steadied himself and peered down.


The villa was five stories high, but the high ceilings made the drop seem closer to eight stories.


From this perspective, all he could see was an abyss.


His thoughts drifted back to the vacant, distant look in Daniela's eyes, sending a shiver of dread through him.
###Chapter 284 Being Caught





Alexander made his way down the staircase, only to discover Katrina feigning nonchalance as she watched the television.


Outside, in the courtyard, Daniela was deep in conversation on the phone.


Bits and pieces of her chat floated in through the open window. It sounded as though Lillian was inquiring if Daniela fancied a midnight meal.


Alexander's eyes lingered on Katrina once more.



Katrina was preoccupied with an apple, devouring it with increasing fervor.


"Katrina." Alexander broke the silence abruptly.



Startled, Katrina nearly leaped out of her skin."Huh?"


 
"You're practically down to the apple's skeleton." Katrina glanced at the apple, paused, then let out a forced chuckle. "I wasn't paying attention. Did you come to see Daniela?"


Alexander didn't reply immediately. His intense stare continued to bore into Katrina, as if he was about to strip away her veneer at any moment.


"I need to leave now. If you need to speak with Daniela,go ahead. I'll leave you two to it."


Katrina rose hurriedly without waiting for his response, scrambled into a pair of heels at random,and scurried out the door.



Since her marriage to Caiden, Katrina had always been a stickler for sartorial precision.


Her ensembles were meticulously planned, with not a color out of place.



But just now, Alexander noticed Katrina was wearing a long black dress paired with garish yellow high heels.



It was the exact ensemble Joyce once attempted to wear,which Katrina had adamantly criticized.


Now here was Katrina, adorned in just that.


Alexander's suspicions about Katrina's erratic behavior deepened.


He opted to remain in the living room, awaiting Daniela's conclusion to her phone call.


Outside, Daniela wrapped up her dialogue with Lillian.



Cedric dialed Daniela. "Katrina's just left."



Peeking inside, Daniela noted the now-vacant couch.


"Did you capture anything worthwhile?"


"Yes, she spilled the beans. But then Alexander appeared out of the blue, and threw a wrench in the works."



Daniela had orchestrated this scenario meticulously,only for Alexander to unwittingly throw it off course.


This did little to improve Daniela's disposition. Cedric tried to soothe her over the phone. "Let it go.We'll hatch another plan later."


Daniela sighed. "Okay. It's getting cold out here.Why don't you come inside?"


After ending the call, she lingered in the courtyard to compose herself before entering.


Alexander rose from the sofa. "Daniela, we need to talk."



Daniela was visibly fatigued. "Let's talk another day.I'm rather worn out."



"But it's important."


At this moment, Cedric barged through the door.


Alexander hesitated, locking eyes with Daniela, and fell silent for a long stretch.


"Aren't you going to say something?" Daniela prodded,looking at Alexander.


Alexander pressed his lips tightly together, hesitant to disclose his discovery in Cedric's presence. He believed it was a secret between Daniela and him.It needed no other ears.



While Alexander wrestled with his thoughts, Cedric made his way into the living room.


Daniela kept her gaze fixed on Alexander.


Alexander finally spoke. "It's nothing. I heard you've been battling sleepless nights, so I got my hands on some supplements."


Daniela nodded. "Thank you. That's very thoughtful.Fortunately, I don't suffer from insomnia anymore, so I won't be needing them." With that, she ascended the stairs.



Cedric, who had spent a good part of the night by the door, hoping to record Katrina trying to kill Daniela, was thwarted by Alexander's untimely arrival.


He decided to shower. Emerging from the bathroom,he found Alexander had left. He proceeded upstairs.


He found Daniela lying in her bed, engulfed in gloom Kneeling beside her, he whispered, "It's okay. We'll get another shot at this."


Daniela remained mute.



Cedric persisted, "Do you reckon Alexander picked up on something today?"


"Likely. When he walked in, Katrina's voice quivered so much, it would've been difficult not to notice something was amiss."


"I wonder why he showed up out of the blue in the first place."



Daniela stared at the ceiling. "Who knows? Maybe he genuinely came to deliver supplements."


Cedric tilted his head to regard Daniela. "Want to try them? He left them on the table."


Daniela rested her head against Cedric's abdomen and murmured, "No need. I have you now, and sleepless nights are a thing of the past for me."
###Chapter 285 Why Did Cedric Get Out Of Daniela's Room
Once Daniela finished speaking, exhaustion overcame her, ánd she drifted into a deep slumber.


A subtle smile played on Cedric's lips.


Katrina had been feeling uneasy since leaving home.


She was certain that Alexander's sharp instincts must have caught on to something.


Regret gnawed at her. Her exit had given Alexander the opening to speak with Daniela.


Anxious, she turned around and rushed back to the villa.



But by the time she returned, the living room was eerily quiet.


Katrina swallowed her unease, the thought of the  night ahead keeping her awake.



Morning came too soon, and Katrina rose before the sun, fatigue heavy in her eyes.



As she quietly slipped from her room, Daniela's door creaked open just ahead.


Katrina froze, her heart racing, and quickly withdrew.


She stayed hidden, waiting for the sound of footsteps descending the stairs.



When she finally stepped out again, she saw Cedric instead of Daniela.



Katrina's eyes darted to the clock. It was five in the morning. At this hour, even the maids were still in bed.



What could have brought Cedric out of Daniela's room so early?


Had he been there all night?


Or had he just arrived with the first light? A surge of unease washed over Katrina, and she made her way downstairs, halting just outside Cedric's room.



The door creaked open just then.



Before she could avert her gaze, their eyes locked.


"Up this early,Cedric?"


Cedric, dressed in his workout clothes, simply nodded. His expression gave nothing away.


Without a word, he continued his path towards the door. Katrina's eyes lingered on his retreating figure.


Shaking off the moment, Katrina went outside to grab a glass of water, her mind still focused on Daniela's bedroom window above.



That room, once Joyce's, boasted large floor-to-ceiling windows and a stunning view, perfectly centered within the villa. It was nearly a hundred square meters of space.



Katrina noticed the curtains were tightly drawn.  Daniela was clearly still resting.


Katrina's eyes fell to the floor, but then a wild thought darted through her mind.


Did Cedric really like men? Or he only loved Daniela?Perhaps he simply wasn't interested in any woman other than Daniela.


For a brief moment, Katrina's imagination ran wild,but she quickly shut down the thought.


After all, she held the belief that every man eventually strayed, so the idea of Cedric staying loyal to just one woman felt far-fetched.



Even someone as spineless as Caiden had betrayed Brylee for her back then.



She felt confident that Cedric's eyes would eventually wander towards her niece.


Katrina was certain of it and decided to set the thought aside.


Still holding her phone, Katrina considered reaching out to Alexander for a meal, hoping to learn if he had uncovered anything the day before and told Daniela.


However, she feared that seeming too eager might reveal some of her own hidden truths.


So she turned to Joyce, who was still asleep well into the afternoon.



Joyce's reaction to Katrina's suggestion was immediate-her face twisted with frustration.



"Mom, can't you stop being so self-centered? I just divorced Alexander, and now you want me to go back to him? What kind of excuse would I even give? What would people think of me? Have you even thought about that? Milo would get upset."



Joyce stood up, snatched her purse off the cabinet,and added, "And don't act like you forgot-you still owe me eight million. You can't just pretend that never happened."


Katrina stared at Joyce in disbelief. "Didn't Alexander just hand you fifty million? Are you seriously claiming  you're still broke?"


"I've been putting money into a business with Milo."


The mention of business made Katrina uneasy."Joyce, you're no business expert. What do you even know about running a company? How could you invest in that? Don't let yourself be duped!"


"Stop doubting me, Mom. You always think I'm incapable, but Milo says I'm actually clever. I've just been waiting for the right moment. Now that it's here, I'm not going to let it pass me by."


Katrina's expression hardened. "And just how much did you put in?"


She had assumed a small investment, maybe one or two million at most. However, Joyce raised her fingers in front of her.


Katrina's chest tightened. "Four million?"


Joyce burst into laughter. "Mom, are you serious?What's four million going to do for me? I put in forty-five million. Milo promised a huge return. I know you  never believed in me, always thinking I'm foolish, but just wait. I'll bring in a fortune before long."


With that, Joyce turned and made her way towards the door. As she passed, she shot a final reminder at her collapsing mother. "And don't forget-eight million is still on you."


She walked out with a confident stride, leaving Katrina's mind spinning.


In a panic, Katrina dialed the number of a private investigator she knew, requesting him to dig into the company Joyce had mentioned.


Surveying the empty space around her, Katrina realized how isolated she truly was.


Her grip on the phone tightened as her anxiety intensified.


She couldn't settle, her nerves frayed, until finally,Daniela emerged from upstairs. Trembling, Katrina rushed towards her, pleading, "Daniela, please. You haveto help me this time."
###Chapter 286 Use His Cousin To Lure Joyce
The disappointment from yesterday's failed plans had soured Daniela's mood, leaving her little patience for niceties.


In a voice devoid of warmth, Daniela questioned,"What is it now?"



"It seems Joyce might have been caught up in a scam. I've already reached out for some help,but they're not as efficient as your contacts at Elite Lux.Could you possibly get someone on it?" Katrina asked, her voice laced with urgency.



Daniela proceeded downstairs to have her breakfast,with Katrina trailing right on her heels.


Once Daniela had finished her meal, Katrina, unable to contain her desperation any longer, pleaded,"Please, Daniela, can you help me? I'm truly
 desperate here. Joyce has poured all her savings into this venture!"



Daniela was already aware of the situation. With a nonchalant air, she picked up her phone, tapped a few keys, and declared, "The company is a sham.They're planning to vanish abroad with the investments in a matter of days."



Katrina felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck her. Her complexion drained of color, and suddenly, she found herself collapsing to her knees. "What can we do?Help us, please! That money is all Joyce has!"


Daniela observed Katrina, now crumpled on the floor and weeping bitterly. A frosty gleam flickered in her eyes as she recalled Katrina's harsh words yesterday -that Brylee deserved to die.



Katrina was oblivious to Daniela's thoughts. She was consumed by panic. If Joyce lost the money, she'd never recover financially. Her future would be bleak and filled with hardship. What could possibly be done now? "Please," Katrina implored, her voice quivering with desperation. "I'm begging you, Daniela."


Daniela offered a slight, indifferent smile. "I can't assist with this matter. You might want to speak with Alexander. Milo has ties to the Bennett family."


She left her statement deliberately vague, shrouded in ambiguity.


Her cryptic words caused Katrina's mind to race toward a darker interpretation. She deduced that the Bennett family had never truly welcomed Joyce,cunningly using Milo as a pawn in a sinister plot.They resented the hefty fifty-million-dollar divorce settlement they were compelled to pay, devising a scheme to reclaim it.



In the wake of Daniela's veiled insinuations, Katrina stood frozen momentarily, her thoughts frantically assembling the pieces. A sudden epiphany struck her,propelling her to her feet.


"What did you just say? Milo and Alexander know each other?" The more Katrina considered it, the clearer it became. She had always felt that Milo and Alexander looked somewhat alike.



Fueled by fury, Katrina murmured a terse thanks to Daniela, grabbed a knife from the table, and stormed out, her emotions in turmoil.



Upon entering, Cedric noticed the fierce anger etched across Katrina's face.



"What happened to her?" he inquired, turning to Daniela.



With a shrug, Daniela narrated the events, to which Cedric responded with an approving thumbs up.



This tactic of deflecting the blame had taken Alexander by surprise.


Confronting Alexander, Katrina demanded, "Do you know Milo Brewer?"



Without room for denial, Alexander admitted, "He's my cousin." Those words incensed Katrina further.


Seething, she withdrew the knife from her bag.


The incident erupted into headlines, igniting a whirlwind of media attention. Speculation soared wildly.


"The crap these rich folks pull gets nastier every day!"


"Wait, Alexander actually paid some guy to seduce his wife?"



"Honestly, I didn't think it was possible for a man to stoop so low and embarrass himself this badly."


"Rumor has it, he's still yearning for his ex-wife.Could this be the reason for his desperate actions?"


"Pathetic Joyce, always the idiot falling for his manipulative schemes."



As the scandal intensified, the Bennett family's reputation suffered a devastating blow.


Their stock prices plummeted to unprecedented lows, leaving Alexander in a frantic search for solutions. His only feasible strategy was to convince Joyce to publicly clarify the situation.


When Joyce answered his call, her response was a chilly laugh. "You must be dreaming! When we were married and you disregarded me, I didn't see you debasing yourself like this. Don't think for a moment that I'm unaware of your motives. Your recent scramble to forge new partnerships is nothing more than a ploy to reclaim Daniela's affection. Well,here's a newsflash-I won't let you manipulate me!"


With a sharp click, Joyce ended the call.


From that moment, the Bennett family's chance to rectify their tarnished image was irretrievably lost.



Katrina faced legal consequences for her previous actions. By the time she was released, darkness had enveloped the city.



She attempted to reach Joyce, but her calls went unanswered. Weighed down by defeat, she trudged back to her home, where she took a long shower and finally collapsed into bed, utterly exhausted.


As she lay in the dim quietude, her mind wandered through a lifetime of calculated maneuvers that had led her to this dismal point.



Drained to her core, Katrina found no solace in rest.



The following morning, at the brisk hour of five, she jerked awake, stirred by an unyielding instinct.


This time, instead of venturing out, she paused by her bedroom door.



Minutes ticked by until the soft creak of a door pierced the silence.


Her eyes narrowed, suspicion igniting like a flint spark.


Quietly, Katrina twisted the doorknob and peered through the sliver of an opening. From this covert viewpoint, she spied Cedric. A crease formed between Katrina's eyebrows as pieces of a disturbing puzzle began to fit together.


Over the ensuing days, she monitored Cedric's comings and goings with a hawk's vigilance, her suspicions growing as she uncovered his secret late-night visits to Daniela's room.


On one such occasion, as she strained to see through the thin crack of her door, a slight noise escaped her.


Cedric halted on the staircase, his head snapping in her direction.



Their eyes locked through the narrow gap-his gaze icy and commanding, exuding a dominance that sent an involuntary shiver cascading down Katrina's spine, even as he was the one cloaked in secrecy.
###Chapter 287 It's Too Late





The door slammed shut with a resounding crash.



Katrina's heart raced furiously.


Compared to Cedric's placid demeanor, she felt exposed, like a guilty child caught in the act of sneaking a cookie.


It wasn't until the familiar hour of her usual breakfast that Katrina gathered enough courage to venture downstairs.



Cedric had returned from his morning jog, his demeanor as serene as a still pond. With her heart in her throat, Katrina approached him. "Cedric..."


Cedric paused and turned to face her.


"Why were you coming out of Daniela's room this morning?" Her voice trembled slightly, stark against Cedric's tranquility. "Did l?" Cedric's reply was laced with feigned ignorance.



"Yes, I've seen you do it several times."


Cedric's eyes narrowed, his gaze cutting through the air like a knife. "Is there a problem with that?"



Katrina bit her lip, struggling to find her words."It's just... Daniela is a woman. It doesn't seem proper for you to stay in her room overnight, does it?"


Cedric gave a nod, his face an unreadable mask."Indeed."



Katrina stared, confused.



Just that? Then what? Wasn't he going to elaborate?No flurry of excuses? No desperate bribes to keep her silent about his secret? Nothing. Cedric displayed none of those.



Instead, his response was chillingly detached. "From now on, if you notice anything like this, you know what to do, don't you?" Katrina stood dumbfounded.



Cedric's voice was icy, a stark contrast to the warmth he showed Daniela. "If this matter gets out, I will deal with you."



Katrina recoiled.



"Or Joyce." Cedric dabbed his forehead with a towel,his expression one of utter indifference. "I don't easily lose my temper, but I've had my limits tested before. Those people have disappeared."


His words were delivered calmly, yet each one bore a threat. "Feel free to challenge me, but be warned-1don't negotiate, and I certainly don't take kindly to threats."



With that, Cedric turned and retreated to his room.


Katrina remained frozen in place.


She couldn't react for a long time.



Had she just been threatened?



It was Cedric whose secret was uncovered. Yet, he had turned the tables, making her the target of his intimidation.



Seething,Katrina dialed the media tip-off hotline.


But when someone answered, her voice caught in her throat.


She couldn't deny it; Cedric's intimidation had struck a nerve.



From that day forward, Cedric became brazen.Previously, he would sneak to Daniela's room when the house was quiet.


Now,he ascended the stairs without hesitation, and Katrina even caught him showering in Daniela's bathroom once.



Katrina seethed with anger. Yet, she felt powerless to intervene. Eventually, she resigned herself to the situation.



It was okay. She had sought Alexander's help before,who had done nothing. Now, with Cedric and Daniela openly together, Katrina found twisted satisfacton in watching Alexander trying to win Daniela back but to no avail.


But her amusement was short-lived.



Joyce returned home after vanishing for several days, her demeanor crushed. "Mom, can you just give me back the eight million?"



Katrina thought Joyce had finally come to her senses, but her next words nearly made Katrina faint.


"The company I invested in is in a bit of a bind. It needs eight million to weather the storm. Mom,please give me the money."



Katrina was feeling as though she'd raised a complete fool. "Eight million? You gave me eight million, and now, by sheer coincidence, your company is short exactly that amount? Joyce, think it through! Does that not strike you as suspicious?"



Joyce shook her head. "It's exactly that-a coincidence. Milo says the company is thriving! It's just a temporary cash flow hiccup. Once we plug that gap, we'll be rolling in profits. Mom, please, I need that money."


Katrina scoffed bitterly. "I don't have that kind of money. What do you want me to do, sell myself?"


At this, Joyce's expression hardened, and her eyes grew icy. "Mom, must you stand in the way of my success? What's happened to you? You've changed,and it breaks my heart."


Katrina was so enraged that she was speechless.


Joyce stared defiantly at her mother, her voice cold and detached. "Fine. Don't come to regret this."


With those words, Joyce stormed out.


Later that day, Joyce became the subject of viral videos across all platforms. Her appearance was disheveled, her expression haggard, and her confessions shocking. She openly admitted to infidelity and blamed herself for the dissolution of her marriage.



She even branded herself a whore in front of the cameras.


Katrina, watching the videos, felt her heart splinter into fragments.


This was the daughter she had adored for over two decades. She was doing this to quell the Bennett family's scandal and get money from them.


For Milo, Joyce had sacrificed her dignity and trashed her own reputation.


The ache in Katrina's chest was agonizing.


Only then did she grasp the true weight of Joyce's parting words: "Don't regret it."


But it was already too late.


Joyce again squandered the eight million dollars she had taken from the Bennett family.


That night, Katrina sat in the living room, the internet aflame with scorn and ridicule, while calls from dismayed relatives flooded in.


Caiden, who seldom reached out, finally called."I can't believe I ever married you. You and Joyce have brought disgrace upon me. I'm severing all ties with her."



With that, Caiden hung up, his decision as final as when he had disowned Daniela.



Katrina collapsed onto the couch, unable to utter a word for three long days and nights.


The once poised woman, always impeccably dressed, now seemed drained of life, her face etched with premature lines, gray hairs emerging one by one.



One morning, as Cedric descended the stairs,Katrina's weary eyes lifted to meet his. She pleaded,"Please, Cedric, save Joyce. If no one helps her, her life will be ruined forever!"
###Chapter 288 Allergy





Cedric paused on the staircase, his gaze icy and distant.



"When Daniela was left to fend for herself, did any of you consider stepping in to save her? Joyce still has your support, but back then, Daniela had nobody.Her family showed less compassion than mere strangers. Daniela was once vibrant and spirited. Do you realize what crushed her spirit, leaving her so numbed by pain she can no longer even weep? It was you.Every single one of you. And now, you've earned every bit of this miserable downfall."



Katrina had always perceived Cedric as devoid of emotion, a fixture of stoic detachment.


Yet, in that fleeting moment, she glimpsed a fierce hatred blazing in his eyes.



A chill ran down her spine. Without another word, Cedric's stoic mask returned as he turned and disappeared into his room.


After Alexander gave Joyce eight million dollars,Bennett Group's accounts dwindled to a mere few hundred dollars, driving Richard to such a peak of fury that it landed him in the hospital.


Alexander left the hospital and headed straight for Elite Lux.



His concern for Daniela weighed heavily on his mnind,compelling him to remind her of what happened on the rooftop that day, though weeks had passed since the incident.



Upon his arrival at Elite Lux, Alexander found Daniela absorbed in a meeting.


As her secretary guided him to Daniela's office, they passed the glass-walled conference room and Alexander saw Daniela.



She commanded the room from the center, her figure accentuated by the sleek lines of her tailored suit, the epitome of elegance and professionalism.


As she projected data onto the screen, her voice resonated with a confidence that captured the undivided attention of the senior executives encircling her. They scribbled notes fervently,hanging on her every word.


At that moment, the secretary interjected,obstructing Alexander's view as she addressed him."Mr.Bennett, this way,please."


Alexander trailed behind her into a well-appointed office and took a seat as instructed. "Ms. Harper is tied up in a meeting. She'll be another hour. Please,make yourself comfortable," she informed him before leaving the room.


Alexander responded with a silent nod, his thoughts drifting back to a time when the roles were reversed,and it was Daniela who had waited for him in his office at Bennett Group.



The office at Elite Lux was an expansive space,marrying functionality with aesthetic appeal through its minimalist design. A gentle floral scent hung in the air, soothing and subtle.


Alexander, aware that Daniela never wore perfume,noticed a flowering gardenia plant perched on a nearby desk.


The secretary, returning briefly, stated, "That was a gift from Mr. Phillips. He tends to it personally,and as you can see, it's thriving. It seems the environment here nurtures both plants and people alike."


She smiled, excused herself, and promised to return shortly with a cup of coffee for him.


Time passed slowly, and over an hour later, Daniela emerged from her meeting.


The secretary had already informed her that Alexander was waiting in the office.


"What's up?" Daniela asked, wasting no time on pleasantries.


"There's something important I need to tell you,"Alexander replied. The secretary closed the door behind her, leaving them to their private conversation.



Daniela nodded, methodically signing documents as she conversed. "Go on."



"Katrina is scheming behind your back."



"Is that so?" Daniela responded in a tone that bordered on disinterest.



Alexander's anxiety was palpable. "Absolutely.Remember the incident on the rooftop? Katrina led you there. The winds were fierce that day-it's evident she had ill intentions."


Briefly lifting her eyes to meet his, Daniela asked,"Are you suggesting she intended for me to fall off the roof?"



"Exactly," Alexander affirmed with a nod.


Returning her gaze to the documents, Daniela asked,"And your basis for this claim?"


Alexander's expression turned to one of confusion, revealing his inner turmoil.


"Since I cut my ties with Caiden, my assets are no longer intertwined with his. What reason could Katrina possibly have to target me? Merely out of spite? Alexander, do you honestly believe that spite is enough to justify attempted murder?"


Caught off guard, Alexander struggled to find his voice.



Each time Daniela countered with her poised, logical arguments, he felt increasingly out of his element.


The undeniable authority she wielded as a leader rendered him nearly powerless, dwarfed by her formidable presence.



Time and again, Alexander found himself deferring to Daniela, uncertain how to steer their conversations.


"Stop dragging me into your nonsense-l've got better things to do," Daniela said, her eyes meeting his as she clutched her pen.



Alexander managed a terse, "Just be careful." Daniela offered no reply.


A heavy silence settled over the spacious office.


Alexander knew he should make his exit, yet something made him linger.


Daniela, however, seemed utterly disinterested in continuing their interaction.


"I guess I'll be on my way then," he remarked, locking eyes with Daniela. "I couldn't help but notice your office only has one plant-kind of drab, don't you think? I've ordered some sweet osmanthus flowers to brighten it up. They'll be here soon."


Daniela didn't get a chance to object as Alexander hurried out, perhaps fearful of a rejection.


The moment the flowers arrived, the secretary let out a soft gasp, unable to hide her surprise.


"Where do you want me to put these?" she inquired.



"Keep them downstairs," Daniela responded with a hint of annoyance. "I'm allergic to them." The secretary wasted no time and had the flowers sent straight to the first-floor restroom, where Daniela would never see them.



The sheer weight of the massive flower pot had the employees gasping for breath by the time they got it downstairs.



"Is Alexander out of his mind? If he was going to send flowers, shouldn't he have checked her preferences first? Daniela is allergic, and he is clueless?"



"Why didn't Daniela just turn him down?"


The gathered employees turned to the secretary,their curiosity unanimous. "Does she still have feelings for him?"
###Chapter 289 Are You Really This Happy

The secretary let out a frustrated sigh. "Are you all out of your minds? Daniela has someone. as remarkable as Cedric pursuing her. Why on earth would she waste a second on Alexander?"



The team exchanged puzzled glances. "Then why did she keep the flowers Alexander sent?"



Reflecting on Daniela's response, the secretary speculated, "She probably just couldn't be bothered.Refusing would have meant explaining herself, and we all know she doesn't like revealing her weaknesses to outsiders."



At the mention of outsiders, the group nodded in agreement.


It was clear: someone like Alexander could never hold the same appeal for Daniela as Cedric did. Alexander was under the illusion that his flowers had earned him the same privileges Cedric had-privileges like regular visits to Daniela's office.


The next day, he took the opportunity to go up to her office,claiming it was to tend to the flowers.


The secretary, aware of Daniela's allergy to those flowers, simply told him they had been moved to the first floor.



Confused, Alexander made his way downstairs, only to find the flowers placed near the restroom.


His excitement fizzled out in an instant, leaving him deflated.



While walking around, he overheard the employees discussing Daniela's allergy to the flowers he had sent.



A wave of frustration quickly shifted to guilt as he absorbed the information.



Determined to make it right, Alexander rushed out and bought an even larger pot of gardenias-bigger  than the one Cedric had given her.


However, this time, he didn't encounter Daniela.Instead, he crossed paths with Cedric, who had just finished tending to the flowers.


"Mr. Bennett? This isn't your company. Don't you think it's a bit inappropriate for you to be planting flowers here?"



A smug smile tugged at Cedric's lips.


Once, he had always felt overshadowed by Alexander, never quite able to stand up to him.


But now, he was Daniela's husband.



That little fact gave him the confidence to speak his mind, as he now had every right to do so.


Even though their marriage was still a secret, Cedric still ordered the staff to dispose of Alexander's flowers without a second thought.


"That's not something you can just do!" Alexander snapped. "Oh, I can and I will. You don't belong here,Alexander. Don't think you can crawl back to Daniela just because things fell apart with Joyce."


A flush of anger spread through Alexander as he gritted his teeth. "I didn't mean it that way. It was just a simple gift, trying to be friendly."


"We don't need your gift. We already have flowers and someone to care for them. You're not needed."



Rage burned inside Alexander, but he knew better than to challenge Cedric face-to-face.



A sense of inferiority gnawed at him. In business,Cedric had the upper hand, and deep down,he knew he couldn't measure up to Cedric.



In this world, power and wealth were the keys to everything.



Alexander's fists tightened in silent resolve. He vowed to himself that one day he'd stand toe-to-toe with Cedric. He would reclaim his place at Elite Lux,win Daniela back on his terms, and show her he  This Happy could provide all she deserved.


As Alexander stormed off, Cedric allowed himself a quiet chuckle.



Alexander's intentions were apparent and Cedric understood them perfectly.


Alexander wouldn't be granted the opportunity to redeem himself, nor would he ever stand before Daniela again.



There were certain losses that couldn't be undone.



Upon Daniela's return, the secretary filled her in on the events of the day.


"Did he get upset?" Daniela asked, her voice calm.


The secretary, assuming Daniela referred to Alexander, nodded. "Yes, he was absolutely furious when he left."



Daniela shifted her gaze towards the secretary."I was asking about Cedric."



The secretary's response was immediate. "No. He was in a great mood. After Alexander left, he was tending to the flowers and humming a tune."


A faint smile tugged at Daniela's lips.


Curiously, the secretary watched her and then asked,"Should I handle these situations differently next time?"



In business, it was often more advantageous to have allies than adversaries.



"No need to worry," Daniela replied with composure."When I'm not here, trust Cedric to handle matters."


With that, Daniela walked back to her office.


The secretary stood frozen, glancing at Lillian in disbelief. "Lillian, what did Daniela mean by that?"


Lillian's smile widened. "It meant exactly what you think it did."



"Are Cedric and Daniela an item?"



Lillian gave a sly nod, accompanied by a quiet gesture to keep it hush-hush. "Best to keep it between us."



The secretary nodded enthusiastically.


The next day, as Daniela stepped out for a meeting,Cedric arrived once more. He immediately noticed the warmer reception awaiting him in the secretary department.


"Mr. Phillips, we've prepared your favorite coffee.Would you like me to make you a fresh cup?"


"Mr. Phillips, this one's brand new and seems to suit you perfectly. Please, have a seat and let us know if it feels right."


"Mr. Phillips, here's the watering can. It's already filled for you."


Cedric asked in confusion, "What's with all the sudden enthusiasm?"



A chuckle escaped the secretary's lips. "Daniela mentioned that when she's away, you're the one in charge. We just want to make sure everything's perfect for you." Cedric's face lit up with a smile of satisfaction.


As Daniela entered, the door swung open, and she was instantly embraced by Cedric.


The secretary slipped out with a knowing smile.


Looking up, Daniela found herself met with a tender kiss,warm and lingering.


After a while, Daniela let out a breathless lagh."Are you really this happy?"
###Chapter 290 Dividing The Fortune





"I am really happy," Cedric admitted.


Daniela chuckled. "Once everything is settled,promise you a grand wedding. How does that sound?"



Cedric held Daniela in a warm embrace. Knowing her distaste for unnecessary complications, he leaned close, his voice a whisper meant only for her. "More than a wedding,I'd rather..."


His voice tapered into a whisper.


Daniela's cheeks flushed as she glanced up at Cedric. "Is that all you daydream about?"


Cedric nodded, unabashed. "Let's wait until we're back home."



"What?"



"Not at the Harper family residence-too many prying eyes there! We'll head to our own home."


The opulent villa he had acquired for a staggering five billion dollars had become the talk of the town.



Everyone whispered that it was the love nest for him and his future wife.



Indeed, it was intended for Daniela. Hearing her suggest it, Cedric's heart swelled with joy.


He tightened his embrace, as if fearing she could vanish into thin air.


After a pause, Cedric sighed deeply. "Let's wrap up our affairs swiftly, shall we?"


Daniela nodded and reciprocated his embrace.


Once they cleared their current hurdles, she hoped to give Cedric two children, adding branches to his family tree.


Their intimate moment was shattered by a knock at the office door.


Daniela and Cedric reluctantly parted. Cedric stole a quick kiss and gently squeezed her waist before stepping back.


"Come in," Daniela called.


Katrina burst into the room, her entrance so frantic she nearly tripped over her own feet. "Daniela,you must rescue Joyce this time!"


Katrina collapsed to her knees, clutching desperately at Daniela's skirt. "Joyce has thrown herself into that venture, and now, with Milo vanished with all the money, she's the one in the crosshairs. The company owes a hundred million, and they're threatening her life if she can't settle the debts. Daniela, I implore you. She's your stepsister. You can't just stand by and watch her perish!"



Daniela looked down at Katrina, who was groveling on the floor. She recalled the opportunity Alexander had unwittingly disrupted, now seemingly returned to her. A sly smirk crossed her face. "I can't help her."



Katrina's voice quivered as she remained kneeling. "I know l've wronged you in the past. I was harsh, acting out of fear of being not accepted by you after marrying your father. Daniela, it was never my intention. I'm truly sorry."


Katrina bowed her head repeatedly, each nod echoing in the tense silence of the room.


Daniela observed her with a frosty detachment.


"| acknowledge my mistakes, Daniela. Just give me a chance to make things right. Please, save Joyce.She's still so young. If you turn your back now, she might not survive this."


Katrina's plea rasped with desperation, but Daniela remained stoic in her chair.



After what seemed like an eternity, Katrina realized her pleas were in vain. She wiped away her tears,standing defiantly. "Daniela, you won't lift a finger for Joyce,will you?"


Daniela remained silent, her expression chillingly indifferent.


"Very well! If that's how it is, don't blame me for what happens next!" Katrina pulled out her phone and called Caiden. "You wanted to sever ties with Joyce,right? Well, come home immediately, Caiden. I want a divorce!"


With that, Katrina ended the call abruptly.


She turned back to Daniela, her voice steel-clad."I'm divorcing Caiden, and I'm claiming half of the Harper family's fortune!"


Daniela let out a light laugh, spreading her hands."Sure, if you think you can actually lay claim to it, by all means,try!"
###Chapter 291 You've Crossed Me




On that day, Caiden returned from abroad.



After eating at Daniela's kitchen, he finally settled onto the living room couch. "If you want a divorce,fine. But splitting the family fortune? Not on my watch," he declared flatly.



Katrina hadn't genuinely intended to pursue a divorce. At her age, starting anew was not on the cards.



The threat of divorce was merely a gambit to coerce Daniela into rescuing Joyce.



What Katrina hadn't anticipated was Daniela pulling Caiden into the fray to confront the issue head-on.


In a panic, Katrina fell to Caiden's feet. "Honey, I know this mess is Joyce's doing, but can't you find it in your heart to save her? Please?" Caiden flicked her hand off his knee with disdain."Save her? How about you save me for a change?Look at the havoc you've wreaked on this family!can't step outside without whispers that I fathered a disgraceful daughter!"


Katrina dissolved into tears. "I know. It's all Joyce's fault. But you've doted on her for so many years.Please, she's still your daughter!"


A shadow of regret crossed Caiden's face. "Had I known Joyce would turn out like this, I would never have welcomed her into our family! I pushed away my own daughter for her, and now I'm filled with remorse. I'll make it clear to the public that I have only one daughter-Daniela!"


With those words, Caiden shoved Katrina aside and stormed out into the yard, where he promptly called his lawyer.


That same day, Caiden issued a public statement severing all ties with Joyce.


The statement also declared his intention to divorce Katrina, consolidating the Harper family's control under him and Daniela.



This announcement was not merely a step to distance the Harpers from the scandal wrought by Katrina and Joyce, but also a strategic move to ingratiate himself with Daniela.


When the topic of mending his relationship with Daniela arose, Cedric was quick to interject."There's no fixing what's irreparably broken. Daniela has all the care she needs."



Hearing this, Daniela glanced up at Cedric.


He stood before her, much like a guard dog protecting its territory.


Caiden was taken aback by the scene.


In the past, Cedric had always shielded Daniela, yet he'd maintained a respectful distance, never overstepping his boundaries or speaking out of turn.


But now? Cedric appeared empowered, advocating for Daniela without a second thought. What was the nature of their relationship now?



Were they an item?



If so, their united front would be a formidable force in the nation.



It was a level of influence that could intimidate the most stoic observer.


Caiden's demeanor softened as he turned his gaze to Daniela, his voice almost pleading. "Daniela, my dear, our blood ties are undeniable. Regardless of past events, think of the money I took as merely a father's due support from his daughter. Can we agree on that?"


Daniela had long become immune to Caiden's audacity.However, Cedric was seething.


His fury was almost tangible as he stepped closer,his presence imposing. "Taking what's not yours and labeling it a freebie? The world doesn't operate on your whims, Caiden. Let's be clear-you've burned this bridge." Cedric had once given Caiden a chance to prove himself.



When Caiden last departed, he must have sensed Katrina's brewing schemes. A single word of caution to protect Daniela would have sufficed, yet Caiden remained silent. Instead, he chose flight over fight,preoccupied with his own safety.


Such a man was unfit to be called a father.



Cedric didn't wait for a response. He took Daniela by the hand and led her to her room.


Daniela sighed, and as Cedric held her, she patted his back. "Why waste anger on someone like him?"


Cedric, still fuming, replied, "Daniela, I don't understand why you're still smiling. My heart breaks for you!"
###Chapter 292 She Won't Show Any More Mercy
Daniela didn't care in the slightest.


Caiden had always been the epitome of selfishness,driven solely by his own interests. If he weren't, how else could he have remarried with such haste after Brylee's death?



The very idea of seeing him as a father had faded into irrelevance for her years ago.


But Cedric couldn't understand Daniela's apathy.Though he only had one family member, his grandmother, she had loved him dearly.


Whenever he interacted with Caiden, he couldn't help but cling to a faint hope that Caiden might show a bit more kindness towards Daniela.



It was a glimpse of Cedric's own humanity-a part of him that remained tender and idealistic despite his  hardd-earned success.



Watching Cedric's frustration with Caiden often made Daniela think about how, despite being a billionaire CEO, he still carried a soft, vulnerable heart. It touched her in a way she hadn't expected.


Maybe it was because someone else still held on to what she had long since given up on.


When Daniela came down the stairs, she was greeted by the sight of Caiden pacing angrily, his face flushed with frustration.



"Daniela! Do you even know what Cedric has done to me?" he complained.



Daniela's face remained unreadable. Of course, she knew.



Caiden had been leveraging her and Cedric's names to secure business opportunities.


After the funds landed in Harper Group's accounts,he conveniently labeled them as profits and distributed them as dividends. The sums weren't significant-just tens of thousands a month at most.



Yet,Caiden basked in the illusion of success. At first,he knew full well that his so-called achievements stemmed from Daniela's and Cedric's reputations.But as time passed, he began to convince himself he was a brilliant businessman.



Cedric, however, had reached his limit. With one decisive move, he severed every business tie Caiden had built.



"Cedric told everyone in the industry that if they even think about working with me, he'll blacklist them. Is this how he plans to go against me?" Caiden asked.


Daniela took a slow sip of her water, her gaze unwavering. "Isn't it clear?"



Caiden almost sputtered in fury. "Daniela! I brought you into this world. How can you just stand there and let this happen to me?"



A faint smile tugged at Daniela's lips. "My mother  brought me into this world, not you."



"You..."



Daniela kept her composure, never once feeling responsible for how Caiden felt.


With that, she turned and walked away to sit down in front of the TV.



Caiden shot her a furious glare. "If you're not going to let me run my business, then you better start giving me money. Daniela, supporting your parents is a legal duty. Don't try to back out of it by saying we're estranged. I've already spoken to a lawyer.You'll be required to pay me an allowance every month."



That much was true.


Daniela was well aware of that fact.


Without taking her eyes off the TV, she responded "Don't worry. If you need the money, I'll give it to you." Caiden's eyes instantly sparkled with excitement at her words. "Are you serious?"



Daniela gave a quick nod. "Of course, I don't break the law."



Caiden's face broke into a wide grin.


Given Daniela's wealth, the financial support wouldn't be a small amount.


Had he known it would be this easy, he never would have bothered with business in the first place.



He could have simply asked Daniela for money straight away.



Caiden left happily, as he was excited to get his monthly allowance from Daniela.



On the other hand, after Caiden made his public declaration severing ties with Joyce, Katrina's anxiety intensified.


If Joyce no longer had ties to the Harper family, how could those who owed money possibly let her off the hook?


Katrina spent her days in helpless tears, consumed by worry.


Caiden, however, remained utterly indifferent. His cold demeanor gave no hint of the affection he had once shown her.


Katrina couldn't help but regret her past choices.


She bitterly recalled the wealthy man her mother had once tried to set her up with. How different things might have been if she hadn't turned him down.


Just as this thought crossed her mind, her phone buzzed with an incoming call.


"Has Joyce made it back home yet?" her mother asked from the other end. The faint clink of poker chips and the shuffle of cards were barely audible in the background.


"No," Katrina whispered, her voice trembling as tears she could no longer hold back began to fall. "Mom,what am I supposed to do? I've begged Daniela, I've  even pleaded with Caiden, but neither of them will spend a penny to help Joyce."


There was a brief pause on the other end, followed by the sound of cards being shuffled and the low murmur of people placing bets.


A few minutes later, the sound of a chair scraping against the floor broke through the quiet, and the background noise began to fade.


Her mother's voice returned, this time with less noise in the background. "When you reach a dead end, it's time to walk away. Remember that wealthy man I told you about? He's still an option. Just recently,he asked about you, wondering if you'd reconsidered."



Katrina was quiet for a moment.


"He's a great match. His wife passed away, and despite being introduced to other women, he showed no interest in any of them. But the moment he saw your picture on my phone, he was immediately interested. He told me money's no concern for him.I did some digging. He's in the oil industry, and he  spends like money's nothing."


Katrina bit her lip, weighing her options.


"I understand what you're holding on to, but Daniela is beyond Caiden's reach now. You're only fooling yourself if you think you can outsmart her, especially with Cedric backing her. You're out of your league here."



Her mother paused,giving her words time to sink in.


"From everything you've said, it sounds like Daniela might already know the truth about her mother's death. If that's the case, you need to leave while you still can. If you don't, it won't be just you-it'll be Joyce too. You saw how cruel Brylee was. Her daughter is more ruthless than her."
###Chapter 293 Pathetic




Katrina knew how ruthless Brylee was.


At an elaborate dinner, a group of men had compelled Brylee to consume an excessive amount of alcohol. She had drunk each glass, not once faltering in her demeanor. However, when their tactics had taken a deceptive turn, Brylee had shattered a bottle over one man's head.



The violence had escalated when a knife had plunged cleanly through the man's palm, filling the room with his pained screams.


Amid the chaos, someone had thought to film Brylee,intending to depict her as a violent instigator. Yet,Brylee had been unfazed.



That night's events had made Brylee a well-known figure.


Afterward, no one had dared to challenge her again. Even years later, Katrina could still recall the image of Brylee's blood-streaked face on the video.


Daniela, in many ways, was both similar to and distinct from Brylee.



She shared Brylee indomitable strength and authoritative air. Yet, she possessed a serenity that Brylee never had, her emotions masked behind a veneer of perfect calm.



This aspect of Daniela was indeed intimidating to Katrina.



"Katrina, you are my daughter. I would never hurt you. Opportunities like this are rare. If you don't grasp it now, it may never come again. I'll leave the choice to you, though. Take your time to think it through."


Katrina responded with a soft, barely audible agreement.


As they were about to end the call, Katrina paused,then spoke up hesitantly. "Mom? I've always tried to support you, but now I'm the one in need. Could you possibly lend me some money?"


Her voice quivered as she went on, "This isn't for me;it's for Joyce. I need to settle her debts to bring her home.I wouldn't be asking if I weren't desperate."


A heavy silence fell on the other end of the line.


After a tense pause, Katrina's mother responded,"Alright. I don't have much to spare either. I'm old,Katrina. I can't risk leaving myself destitute. But I'll send you most of what l've saved, keeping just enough to get by."


Lately,Katrina had faced nothing but rejections.


The unexpected support from her mother brought tears to her eyes instantly. "Mom, I swear I'll repay you," she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.


"Don't say things like that, Katrina. We're family.During tough times, you realize who truly values you.Remember who's there for you now and who just stood by, watching you struggle. Forget about those who didn't care. Think about that wealthy man l mentioned. I'll wire the money later."


With a sudden click, the call was disconnected.


The woman bearing two jagged scars across her face returned to her seat at the poker table.


The clattering of cards and chips resumed.


"Erika, didn't I told you that the rich guy has some weird quirks? Why didn't you pick someone else for this?"



Erika Schmidt, with a wry smirk and a cigarette dangling from her lips, replied evenly, "Why pass up such a chance on outsiders when I can keep it within the family?"


"Fair enough. That guy is loaded, but I've heard his last few wives... Well, let's just say their ends were anything but peaceful. Are you going to warn Katrina about that? It's not something just anyone can handle."



Erika laughed. "Warn her about what? It's tough to earn a buck, and life's no walk in the park. She'll catch on soon enough. Nothing's handed to you on a silver platter. Once she's free of Caiden, she'll adapt just fine.AlII need to do is grab the cash."


Five hours later, Katrina's phone chimed, signaling a wire transfer of five hundred thousand dollars had landed in her account.



It was less than she'd expected, yet it was still a decent sum.



A surge of relief washed over her, and just as she was about to redistribute the funds, her phone buzzed again.



This time, it was a photo.


The man in the photo was unmistakably wealthy but looked entirely ordinary with his stout frame,round face, and shifty, narrow eyes that sparkled with a disconcerting greed.



Seeing him was enough to make Katrina's stomach twist uncomfortably. Without hesitation, she deleted the image, secured her funds, and completed a transfer of three million dollars.



With a quick handoff of two hundred dollars to the intermediary, she sealed an agreement to gradually return a staggering hundred million.



With everything in motion, Katrina was left to anxiously await further developments.


Meanwhile, Caiden was waiting for money as well.His phone never left his hand.



In the meantime, he managed to squeeze in attendance at a social event.


Recently, he felt suffocated, confined by his own circumstances.



The debacle with Joyce had severely dented his image, casting a shadow over his reputation.


With the public declaration to sever all ties with Joyce now circulating, Caiden felt liberated enough to step out into the world again. As he neared the restaurant's entrance and reached for the door handle, a flurry of voices spilled out from within.



"I really have to give Caiden credit. Everyone's buzzing about Joyce being nothing but trouble, yet here he is, not hiding away."


"Unbelievable. I burst out laughing the moment I saw Caiden's post. That guy? He cuts people off if they embarrass him, but grovels back when he needs something from them."



"Absolutely. I caught him the other day, practically on his knees to Daniela, who wouldn't even glance his way."



"Daniela's got such a cool temperament. Were it me,Caiden would've earned a good few slaps by now!"


"Exactly! And here's the kicker-imagine if Daniela hit a rough patch and Joyce ended up with some wealthy guy. Do you seriously believe Caiden would stoop so low as to crawl back to Joyce?" The thought alone is hysterical!" "Caiden is so pathetic!"
###Chapter 294 Caiden's Embarrassing Moment
The mocking laughter from inside the restaurant echoed in Caiden's ears.



His smug grin faded in an instant, replaced by a stormy expression.


For a moment, he considered walking away, but after a few hesitant steps, he spun around and marched back inside.



The door swung open with a loud thud, silencing the chatter as heads turned his way. Caiden scanned the room before confidently claiming a seat.


"Apologies for being late, everyone," he began, his voice dripping with exaggerated politeness.


The people in the restaurant exchanged amused looks. Caiden began, "Daniela insisted on getting me a new outfit. I told her something from Elite Lux would do,but she wouldn't hear of it."


Tugging at his collared shirt, he added, "Just look at this. Pure wool. Set her back fifty grand."


Not a trace of embarrassment crossed his face.



Pausing briefly, he launched into more boasting."She also promised to take me on a trip this holiday.Bought her own private island, you know? You probably saw it in the news. Once it's ready, she'll fly me out personally."


Hearing this, everyone couldn't help but marvel at Caiden's luck in having such an extraordinary daughter.


Even if they felt a hint of envy, there was nothing they could do.



After all, Daniela was undeniably remarkable.


As the world's richest woman, her wealth was beyond comprehension. Even if Caiden lived  recklessly, just a small portion of her fortune was enough to ensure a lifetime of comfort.



While their compliments flowed freely, jealousy simmered beneath the surface.


Caiden soaked up their flattery, reveling in a swell of pride and self-importance.


Rather than holding back, he leaned into his bragging even further.


"I'm not even old enough to retire yet, but Daniela insists on giving me a monthly allowance. I told her it wasn't necessary, but she wouldn't take no for an answer. In fact, this month's payment should come through today."


Taking out his phone, he began recording a brief video for Daniela, ensuring the group was in full view.


"Hey Daniela, I'm out with some friends you've met before," he said, panning the camera to capture the group, who eagerly waved and smiled.


Watching them light up at the opportunity to impress  the world's wealthiest woman, Caiden smirked in satisfaction.



Moving closer to the window, he lowered his voice and spoke with a sly smile. "Send over that allowance now, and while you're at it, cover this dinner for me.Help me make an impression here."


He pressed send and caught a few curious, slightly skeptical glances from the others.


Ignoring them, he grinned and settled back in his seat, placing his phone on the table like a trophy.


He was eagerly waiting for the bank notification,ready to show it off once again.


As he waited, someone chuckled and asked, "So,Caiden, with your daughter being the richest woman alive, how big is that monthly allowance?"


At that, every pair of eyes around the table turned to Caiden.



Caiden soaked in the attention, giving a modest smile before replying, "Well, It's decent." The truth was, he  had no idea how much Daniela would give him, so he couldn't afford to overdo the boasting.


"I'm practically retired now, so I don't really need much. My daughter always says her money is there for me. She takes care of all the bills at home and even reimburses anything I spend elsewhere. She keeps reminding me not to stress about money at my age and just enjoy life."



As he finished speaking, his phone buzzed on the table. Caiden's face brightened instantly as he grabbed his phone and held it uup for all to see.


"Look at this. Another transfer. Daniela's covering today's food and drinks. Thanks for the company,everyone!"



He unlocked his phone and proudly displayed the transaction.



The group leaned in eagerly for a closer look.


A wave of superiority washed over Caiden as he savored the attention. But the moment he saw the glaring figure of two thousand, his smug grin vanished.


The others exchanged quick glances, then leaned back in their seats.



Caiden let out a forced laugh. "Ah, she must've just sent enough to cover our meal."


Just then, Daniela's audio message arrived.


Hoping for a lifeline, Caiden quickly pressed play.


Daniela's voice filled the room, sharp and clear. "I'm sending you four months of your basic allowance,that's five hundred a month. That should keep you quiet for a while. And Caiden, if you're inviting people out, the bill is yours. Have you forgotten your place?"


The message ended abruptly, and a heavy silence followed. Then, suddenly, a burst of laughter erupted.



Some wiped tears from their eyes, others held their sides in laughter, and a few were doubled over,barely holding onto their seats. Caiden's face burned with humiliation.


He shot up from his chair, stiff as a board, and bolted out.



The mockery behind him only intensified.


Even outside, he could still hear their laughter.


"That shirt's ancient. He really thought we'd believe Daniela bought it for him!"



"And when he tried whispering for more money by the window? I nearly died!"


"I know, right? He thought no one heard him,but he was the biggest joke."


"All he did was name-drop Daniela. Bet she doesn't even care about him."



"Seriously? Secondhand embarrassment hit me so hard!"



The jeering voices behind him cut through his pride like daggers. Overcome with shame, Caiden kept his head dlown,unable to meet anyone's gaze.
###Chapter 295 The One Who Caused Unhappiness
Caiden believed it was all Daniela's fault.


Had she just played along, his public humiliation could have been avoided.



Five hundred a month? That sum wouldn't even begin to cover his tips.



Seething, Caiden made his way home.



Upon arriving, he found Daniela deeply engrossed in a video game she'd recently developed, sprawled comfortably on the couch.



He approached her aggressively, questioning,"Daniela, what do you think you're doing?"



At that moment, Cedric appeared, stepping out of a bedroom, a towel draped around him.  Caiden glared at Daniela. "Do you even understand how embarrassing today was for me?"



Unaware of the specifics, Daniela could only assume that Caiden had failed another of his schemes."Maybe you wouldn't feel so embarrassed if you stopped making baseless claims."


Her reply only fueled Caiden's anger.


"Daniela! I am your father! Does my disgrace mean nothing to you? Does it please you to see me degraded?"



"I'm honestly glad for my mom. Being with you had only brought her pain," Daniela responded with a laugh, her voice dripping with sarcasm.


Caiden felt like he was about to burst with anger.


Cedric prepared to step in.



With a piercing stare, Daniela confronted Caiden."If she were still here, Caiden, do you think she would regret her marriage to such a fool?"  In a fit of anger, Caiden raised his hand, ready to strike.



Daniela rose to her feet, her eyes piercing Caiden with cold intensity. "Do you truly believe that my mother took her own life out of mere despair?"


Suddenly, Caiden froze, struck by a grim realization.


As Daniela moved closer, he backed away.


"She's been haunting my dreams, telling me about the pain of her fall. She talks about her bones breaking, her blood spilling, and how peace never came. And yet, you call yourself my father, her husband? Did it ever cross your mind that it might not have been just an accident?"



Overwhelmed, Caiden sank into the couch. His face turned pale. "I don't know anything," he stammered,then raced up the stairs.


His nerves had wiped the initial argument clean from his memory.


Hours later, with a defeated slouch, Caiden stood at  Cedric's door and said, "I'm heading back to Zentara."



Standing by the large window and mid-call, Cedric paused to say, "We'll leave it here for now," to the person on the line before turning to Caiden.


"Whatever happened back then didn't involve me.I'm clueless about it, and I'm intent on returning to Zentara."



In the dim ambiance of the room, only a sliver of light cast shadows.



Cedric's silhouette was just visible to Caiden, who couldn't make out his expression.



"Do you really believe you're innocent? Aren't you the one who claimed Daniela as your daughter and Brylee as your wife? And now you say it's none of your concern?"



Anger flared within Caiden. "Brylee is gone! I've cut ties with Daniela! If they want revenge, that's up to them. There's nothing I can do. I need to leave for Zentara now, Cedric."


Caiden's voice turned cold as he looked up. "They don't care about me anymore, and I'm no use to them.I need to leave. Right now."


Caiden had always detested the tough life in Zentara.He used to constantly dream of returning. Yet now,he was anxious to leave.


Cedric, however, simply said, "No."


Caiden looked up sharply. "Why not?"


"Because you instigated all this chaos. You were unfaithful, giving Katrina the opening she needed to disrupt your marriage, and it was Brylee who suffered. You robbed Daniela of a happy childhood.You failed as a husband and as a father. This blame is on you. There's no escape this time. You can't just run away."


In the hushed room, Cedric's voice cut through the silence, resolute and calm.


Caiden's initial agitation dissolved under the weight  of Cedric's accusations.


Overwhelmed by despair, Caiden collapsed to the floor, clutching his head. His voice broke as he murmured, "It's not my fault. I didn't do this. It's all their doing."
###Chapter 296 The One Who Truly Loved Me Was Killed By You

Caiden seethed with anger after Cedric flatly refused to send him back to Zentara.



With nowhere else to go, he crashed at a friend's house for a few days.


When Daniela came to pick him up, his face was twisted in frustration. "Daniela, you're really heartless. Do you actually expect me to face Katrina?"



Daniela didn't even glance in his direction. While playing on her phone, she replied, "You're a witness to this whole thing. You can't just walk away now."


She had limited Caiden to a mere five hundred dollars per month.


Broke and out of options, Caiden had no place to turn. Desperate, he even toyed with the idea of selling the villa.



However, anyone wealthy enough to consider buying it had already heard Daniela's ominous warning."Anyone who dares to purchase Caiden's villa is declaring war on Elite Lux." Despite the price had been slashed repeatedly, no one dared to finalizethe sale.


Once again, Caiden was reminded of the sheer reach of Daniela's power in Olisvine.



Feeling defeated, he abandoned his schemes altogether.


Late that night, as darkness cloaked the area, a car pulled up to the front gate of the villa.


It paused for just a moment before speeding away.


Curious, the security guard went to check and discovered a burlap sack lying on the ground.


When he opened it, he was horrified to find a woman inside, her hair tangled and a filthy rag gagging her.  He aimed his flashlight at her face and recoiled in shock. He shouted, "Who the hell are you?"


By chance, Daniela was driving past at that exact moment. She recognized the woman as Joyce and called Katrina.


Joyce had passed out, and an overwhelming stench clung to her.


Katrina rushed over but quickly realized she couldn't move Joyce on her own. Reluctantly, she called Caiden for help.


As soon as he approached and caught a whiff of the foul odor, he couldn't hold back and vomited on the spot.



Ultimately, one of the guards stepped in, pinching his nose as he dragged Joyce into the villa, treating her as if she were nothing more than discarded trash.



"Joyce, Joyce?" Katrina's voice quivered as she took in the jagged cuts marring Joyce's once-smooth face. The evidence of Joyce's brutal torment was undeniable. When she finally regained consciousness, her mind seemed shattered.


She grabbed Katrina's arm tightly, her sobs erupting uncontrollably.



"Mom, please save me! Those people are monsters.They said if I don't pay by next week, they'll take me back. I'd rather die than face them again. Please,Mom,help me!"


Overwhelmed by panic, her body gave out, and she fainted once more.



As the harsh overhead lights illuminated Joyce's wounds, Caiden's eyes widened in horror at the word etched into her skin: bitch.



A sickening jolt struck his chest as he turned to Daniela, only to find her face devoid of any reaction.


For the first time, an unsettling fear of his own daughter crept into Caiden's heart.


Clenching his trembling hands into fists, he waited until Katrina escorted Joyce to the bathroom before leaning towards Daniela and whispering, "Did you have someone do this?"



Daniela cast a cold, indifferent glance his way.


Caiden was convinced that Daniela had to be behind this.Lowering his voice, he said, "Even if you have a grudge against Katrina, Joyce had nothing to do with it. Don't you think this is too far?"


Daniela let out a chuckle, her tone laced with mockery."Oh? You really think this is too much?"



Caiden gave a solemn nod. "Of course it's too much!If those scars on her face become permanent, her life will be ruined. How could you do something so heartless?"



Moments earlier, the sight of Joyce's mutilated face had shocked everyone. Yet Daniela's composure remained eerily undisturbed, her gaze chillingly indifferent.



The cold detachment in her eyes was nothing short  of terrifying.


Daniela's cold smile lingered. "Heartless? Me? I wasn't always this way. I used to be hopeful, even innocent. Do you remember that? What Joyce suffered today might have been from a knife, but when I lost my mother, the wounds I endured were invisible yet far deeper. Did you ever stop to consider how broken I was back then? Of course not. I didn't scream or cry, so my pain went unnoticed. I was left to suffer alone, wasn't l? And yet, you seem to have forgotten someone who once loved me more than life itself. That person died because of you."


A fiery glint ignited in Daniela's eyes, her voice steady but charged with fury.


"The question isn't whether I orchestrated what happened to Joyce. What matters is that | could. You better hope you weren't involved in my mom's death,because if you were, I'll make sure your fate is far worse than Joyce's."


With that, she dismissed him entirely, her attention snapping back to the TV without a second glance. Caiden stood frozen, her words sending an icy jolt straight to his core.


His heart raced wildly, and his legs trembled so much he could barely keep himself upright. After a few failed attempts to speak, he finally stammered out a shaky protest. "I had nothing to do with it. I swear."


Daniela didn't even blink in response.


Upstairs, Katrina's muffled sobs echoed through the halls as she carefully bathed Joyce.


A maid descended the stairs, her face pale. She hesitated before telling Caiden, "Sir, the scars are not just on her face. They're everywhere."


Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Even her most private parts have been carved with the word 'bitch.'"
###Chapter 297 He Was There For Daniela
Even with the best reconstructive surgery, restoring Joyce's appearance seemed almost impossible.


Caiden found himself stunned yet again.


Throughout it all, Daniela sat unbothered, her attention locked on the television as if nothing unusual had happened.



A deep, gnawing fear began to settle in Caiden's heart.



This wasn't merely fear of Daniela's influence-it was a bone-deep dread, as if he were staring into the face of a living nightmare.


That night, Katrina stayed upstairs long past midnight,tirelessly caring for a traumatized Joyce.


When she eventually came downstairs, exhaustion consumed her, and she nearly crumpled at Daniela's feet.



"Daniela, I'm begging you, please save Joyce! A hundred million might be a fortune for most, but for you, it's nothing but just a drop in the ocean."


Daniela turned off the television, her eyes finally settling on Katrina. "You're right, a hundred million doesn't mean much to me. But tell me, why should I save Joyce?"



Katrina's voice trembled with desperation. "If you don't help, they'll kill her. They've already beaten her,slashed her-her body is covered in scars. They said they'll sell her if we don't pay!"


Daniela's lips curled into a faint smile. "And what exactly, does any of that have to do with me?"



Katrina froze, biting her lip to keep herself from breaking down. "I understand this isn't your problem,but after all, we're family, aren't we?"

 
Daniela's response was icy. "I do have family, but it's certainly not you. Whether Joyce lives or dies is irrelevant to me." With that, she rose from her seat.


Katrina's fists tightened as she stared at Daniela's icy expression, a chill spreading through her chest.


Caiden instinctively stepped back, determined to avoid being drawn into the confrontation.



"Daniela, you're seriously not going to do anything?"Katrina asked.



Daniela cast a mocking glance at Katrina. "Can't take it anymore?"



Katrina's expression froze, her pride battling with her desperation.


Daniela's voice dripped with disdain. "Begging doesn't suit you, so why bother? Why not drop the act? Your pathetic sob story is sickening."


Katrina's face stiffened again, and her lips pressed into a firm line. Using her hands, she pushed herself to her feet. She cast a sharp glance at Daniela before slowly shifting her gaze to Caiden. Fear flickered in Caiden's eyes. "Why are you looking at me like that?"



Katrina's gaze was earnest as she addressed Caiden."Caiden, I've served you for nearly twenty years.I may not have achieved much, but l've always given my best. Please, talk to Daniela.If she agrees to save Joyce, I promise to serve you for the rest of your life,just like I always have."


Her words carried a heartfelt sincerity as she spoke.



Caiden hesitated, stealing a nervous glance at Daniela.



Daniela's laugh cut through the air just as he was about to say something.



"Caiden, let's skip the fact that you no longer have any influence over me. Even if you did, do you honestly think Katrina's worth a hundred million?How funny!"


The cruel remark drained the color from Katrina's face. Caiden's lips tightened as he stepped back, throwing Katrina an awkward shrug. "This is between you two.Don't drag me into it."



Seeing Katrina frown, Caiden added hastily,"Joyce isn't even related to me anymore. Frankly, I shouldn't have let her in tonight. The fact that she has a room here is me being generous. Don't involve me-Daniela's ruthless, and I want no part of this."



Katrina had long known that Caiden couldn't be trusted.Yet she hadn't anticipated that two decades of shared history could crumble so effortlessly under a few biting words from Daniela.



"Fine." Katrina wiped her tears and took a steadying breath. "Then let's talk divorce."



Caiden's eyes darted nervously to Daniela, who remained silent with an unreadable expression.



Unable to gauge Daniela's thoughts, Caiden dared not say a word. All he wanted was to vanish into thin air. "Regarding the divorce, I'll go along with whatever Daniela decides," Caiden mumbled at last.


Katrina turned to face Daniela. "Here's the deal: this villa, half Harper Group's shares, and Caiden's personal assets converted into cash. Just give me a hundred million in total, and I'll divorce Caiden right away. I know you don't want me here, Daniela. Pay up, and Joyce and I will disappear."


Her tone was unyielding.



Daniela, however, let out a laugh. "Is this how you ask for help? Let's be clear-you're the one in a rush, not me."



Daniela's sharp retort left Katrina momentarily speechless.


At that moment, the door clicked open, and Cedric entered the room.



Caiden had never felt so relieved to see Cedric in his life.



Rushingto Cedric's side, Caiden leaned in and whispered urgently, "You've got to do something about Daniela. She's absolutely out of control tonight!"



Cedric ignored him entirely and strode across the room to take his place behind Daniela.



Not a single word escaped his lips, but his presence spoke volumes. He was there as her steadfast protector.


Katrina's jaw tightened. Dealing with Daniela on her own was already no small feat, but with Cedric standing firmly at her side, it felt like an impossible mountain to climb.



"What's your endgame here?" Katrina demanded,her voice laced with frustration. "Aren't you worried that I won't leave this villa?"



Daniela gave a casual shrug. "Makes no difference to me. My mother bought this villa. Whether or not Caiden claims me as his daughter, I have my place here." From his spot near the door, Caiden gave a small nod. "She's right."


Fury simmered within Katrina. "What exactly do you want?" she asked, her voice rising.


Daniela stood under the glare of the overhead light,her expression calm yet detached.


All eyes in the room were fixed on her.


Daniela approached Katrina and leaned in to whisper something into her ear.
###Chapter 298 Joyce Wants To Commit Suicide
Katrina shook uncontrollably after hearing Daniela's final words. A look of fear flashed across her face,soon replaced by complete confusion.


Daniela had already gone upstairs, and though some time had passed, Katrina's hands remained chilled by the shock.



Suspicions were one thing, but when Katrina confronted the harsh reality, her mind spiraled into chaos.



Daniela was already upstairs, and Cedric had gone up with her.


Caiden approached Katrina with confusion written across his face. "What did she say? Aren't you overreacting?"


Katrina slowly lifted her pale face. She tried to speak, her mouth opening and closing several times, before the words finally tumbled out, choked with tears."She told me she knows what it's like to watch the person you love most walk away and she wants me to feel that same pain."



Her voice trembled as she locked eyes with Caiden."What does Daniela mean by that?"


A wave of unease washed over Caiden. After a long,tense pause, he spoke flatly. "Is there any point in pretending anymore?"


Until now, Daniela hadn't asked a single question about the past. But she was convinced that Katrina had murdered her mother.


Katrina wanted to defend herself. She walked up to Daniela's door, but as she stood there, she found herself at a loss for words.



Just then, Cedric came out to get some milk for Daniela, and saw Katrina standing by the door.



Hoping he would be easier to convince, Katrina said,


"Cedric, I had nothing to do with Brylee's death. The police investigated, and I had a solid alibi. Daniela can't accuse me without any proof."


She held her breath, hoping he'd believe her. But Cedric's response was even colder than Daniela's.


His gaze hardened as memories surfaced-how Daniela had grown up without a mother's love, while Katrina had taken everything that had once belonged to Brylee, and raised her own daughter like royalty.


A surge of rage coursed through Cedric; he wanted to destroy Katrina in that moment.


Panic gripped Katrina as she stumbled backward, her balance slipping before she tumbled down the stairs.


Her scream echoed through the villa, sharp and filled with pain.


Katrina had broken two ribs.


As she was rushed to the hospital, Joyce burst out of her room. She stood there, utterly confused, the weight of the situation crashing down on her.


She had hoped Katrina would save her from the cruel torment. But now that Katrina was injured, what could she do? What was left for her?



Joyce froze at the top of the stairs, her legs trembling as memories of the endless, inhuman torture she had suffered flooded her mind.



Steeling herself, she made her way slowly down the stairs.



Seeing Caiden watching TV, she tried to summon the image of the obedient daughter she once was."Dad."



Caiden didn't even glance at her, his voice cold as he snorted. "I'm not your dad."



Joyce understood the resentment in his voice.Kneeling beside him, she tried to reach him.


Her face remained ghostly pale, still marked by the trauma she had suffered.
With desperation, she grasped Caiden's hand and begged, "Dad, I know l acted horribly before, but l've changed. You're getting older. Please, let me take care of you. I'm still your loyal daughter."


Caiden's gaze shifted to Joyce at her words.


After all, he had once cared deeply for her, and for a moment, compassion stirred in him.


Joyce bowed her head, letting it rest against his knee, her voice soft and vulnerable. "Dad, you know l've always been a bit naive, just a little stubborn.You'll forgive me, won't you?"


Caiden clenched his jaw, his silence speaking volumes.



Seeing the familiar softness in his expression, Joyce pressed further, her eyes shining with determination."I really mean it, Dad. Everything I've gone through has shown me just how much family matters. You're the most important person in my life."


Caiden often melted at sweet words, but Joyce's

next words caught him off guard. "Dad, if you pay off that hundred-million-dollar debt for me, I'll change my last name to Harper."



The mention of a hundred million shattered any lingering fantasy Caiden had of a heartfelt family reconciliation.



"What did you say?" Caiden squinted at Joyce, his confusion quickly turning to disbelief.


She might have once been his daughter, but now she seemed like a parasite, clinging to him with nothing but greed.



Thinking she had finally softened him, Joyce was blindsided by what happened next.


Caiden suddenly sprang to his feet, and Joyce was thrown off balance, stumbling to the floor in shock."Dad..."



"Don't you dare call me Dad. Have you lost all sense of guilt? I fed you, clothed you, and raised you.I even turned my back on my own daughter for you. And now you want to take everything I have?"


Joyce shook her head fervently. "Dad, I have no way out. Please, help me!"


Caiden sneered. "Yes, you have no way out. If you had one, you wouldn't be begging. You ran off with that useless Milo. Now that you've been fooled, deal with it on your own!"


With that, he turned and walked away.


Joyce sat motionless on the floor, her gaze blank as she stared into the vast emptiness of the villa.



She remembered a time when she had been the beloved daughter, adored by Caiden, with her mother holding the highest place of favor in the household.



She had been a prominent socialite in Olisvine,admired and envied by many.


Joyce couldn't comprehend how she had fallen so far,reduced to a figure of disdain and contempt.


Bitterness filled her chest, like a growing storm. Her heart felt cold, as though it had stopped beating.


The endless torment she had endured felt like a slow,unrelenting agony, each day stretching out longer than the last.



She had no one to turn to, no one to lean on.


The thought of being dragged away again,tossed into that dark warehouse to face another round of cruelty, filled her with dread.


With trembling legs, Joyce made her way upstairs,the maid's calls echoing behind her, but she didn't stop or answer.


When she stepped out onto the balcony, the cold wind hit her face sharply, as though it was trying to strip away the last shreds of her humiliation.


Surprisingly, Joyce felt an odd sense of relief, a strange kind of peace settling over her.
###Chapter 299 Protect Him





Just as Joyce leaned forward, someone yanked her back.



Cedric's gaze was icy, filled with a chilling indifference.



Tears streaked down Joyce's face as she looked at him miserably.


Never in her wildest thoughts had she imagined that Cedric, of all people, would be the one to pull her back from the edge.


"Cedric,let me go! I want to die!"


Cedric dragged her inside and dropped her to the floor,treating her like nothing more than a burden.


Despite his harshness, Joyce felt a strange softening in her heart.



Just moments before, she had been lost in a haze,almost ready to end it all.


Now she was terrified just thinking back on it.



Her fear made her vulnerable. She stared up at Cedric.



His eyes were razor-sharp, like an eagle's, radiating the authority of someone in command.



Seeing him like this stirred something in her.



She bit her lip, tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, attempting to mimic how Katrina used to flirt with Caiden.



"Cedric, you saved me."



Had this villa not been the one Brylee left to Daniela,Cedric might have kicked her off the roof.


But Joyce remained completely oblivious to Cedric's true thoughts.



Lowering her voice, she asked, "Cedric, you do care about me, don't you?" He remained silent, offering no response.


Undeterred, Joyce pressed on, "If you didn't care,you wouldn't have followed me up here. You saw l was struggling and came after me. I've noticed you sneak little glances my way. You do like me, don't you? I know I'm not as beautiful or accomplished as Daniela. Cedric, I'm willing to be your mistress if you help me pay off the hundred million I owe. My child and I will belong to you completely."



With newfound resolve, she reached out to hug him.


The feel of his solid form against hers sent a surge of excitement through her.


Joyce opened her eyes, puckered her lips, and leaned in, but before she could make contact, a hand suddenly pressed firmly against her forehead.


"Joyce, what nonsense is running through that head of yours?"


Joyce froze in place, her gaze landing on Daniela.Confusion clouded her mind. "Where's Cedric? He cares about me. Where did he go?"



"Daniela, you can't stop us, no matter how rich or powerful you think you are. You can't stand in the way of two people who truly love each other!"



Daniela scoffed, a scornful laugh escaping her lips."Katrina's still in the hospital, and you're here acting like this is some trashy romance novel? I'm warning you, if you want to die, do it somewhere else. Don't dare to ruin my home. Even if you die, I'll step over your body."


Joyce pressed her lips together, holding back her frustration. "Then give me a hundred million, or I'll pester Cedric. I've got nothing to lose, so why should I care about my reputation?" She had reached the end of her rope.


Daniela sneered. "You're expecting the debt collectors soon, aren't you? Go ahead and waste whatever time you have left chasing Cedric."



Joyce's face drained of color. "Why don't you go visit Katrina in the hospital?Maybe she'll take care of it for you," Daniela suggested.



At the mention of Katrina, Joyce hesitated and glanced at Cedric, who had somehow ended up standing behind Daniela.


She gritted her teeth and walked away.


After she had gone, Cedric let out a sigh of reliefand pulled Daniela close with an arm around her. "Crazy woman. I honestly thought I might end up tainted by her kiss."


Daniela chuckled, patting his hand reassuringly."|t′S fine. As your wife, I'm here to protect you."


Cedric's eyes sparkled with a new light.


It was the firsttime Daniela had referred to herself as his wife.



He pressed his lips to her soft neck, his voice low as he murmured, "As your husband, I intend to exercise my rights." Just as he finished speaking, Lillian, who had just come upstairs, quickly spun around on her heel."Sorry, I didn't hear anything. I just heard the maid mention Joyce might try to jump off the villa, so l rushed up. I didn't hear a word."


Meanwhile, on her way to the hospital, Joyce tried reaching out to several of her old friends.



Most of them hung up before she could even finish a sentence.



Some so-called friends had no qualms in telling her,"Just find a rich guy to look after you. Stop pretending you're above it all. It's a quick way to earn money."


Joyce wasn't even remotely interested in such a suggestion.


Despite everything she'd been through,her heart still longed for love.


Perhaps if she met someone like Cedric-someone accomplished-it could be different. But she found  wealthy benefactors thoroughly unattractive.


Her self-respect meant more to her than any sum of money.



Daniela's words echoed in her mind. Maybe Katrina could help fix everything.


After all, Katrina had always been the one to pick up the pieces when she made a mess of things.


Daniela might have money, but she had her mother,who would go to any lengths for her.


Before she got out of the car, Joyce called Alexander."We were married once. I was tricked, and now you owe me. You should help me out."


Before Alexander had a chance to say anything,Richard snatched the phone out of his hand. "Joyce,you've got some nerve! Do you even realize how much you've dragged our family down? We got delisted because of your scandals. Our business has fallen back fifty years. I can't even go out in public anymore, and you still have the audacity to ask for money? Why didn't those goons just finish you off already?"


The line went dead with a sharp click as the call abruptly ended.


Staring at the blank screen of her phone, Joyce was overwhelmed by a deep sense of dejection. With a heavy heart, she pushed open the door to Katrina's hospital room.



Katrina, looking drained and fragile, caught sight of her and felt a sharp headache building.



"Mom, have you come up with a plan? The debt collectors are going to be here soon."



Katrina sighed deeply. "Why do you always make me worry so much?"


Joyce stuck her tongue out playfully. "If you can't get the full amount, try for half, at least."


Katrina glanced at Joyce's foolish expression,wishing she had known better from the very beginning. "Half is fifty million. Don't you understand 
how tight things are right now?"


Joyce's throat tightened as she swallowed. "So, what do we do?"



Sitting on the bed, Katrina glanced at a text from her mother. "There's a man named Doug Fairburne.I told him you need money, and he said he's willing to help.If you keep him company, he'll transfer the funds right away."

###Chapter 300 Suspicious





Katrina furrowed her brow as she switched off her phone.



The thought of wealthy people dabbling in shady dealings was nothing new to her. Over the years, she had grown accustomed to her comfortable lifestyle and had no desire to face a harsher reality.



Placing her phone aside with a sigh, Katrina glanced at Joyce and said, "I need to use the restroom."


Joyce got up to assist her mother.


Once Katrina was inside, Joyce quickly stepped out,her eyes darting to the phone Katrina had left on the bed.



"Joyce, I need a hand, please," Katrina called from inside.



"I'm on my way," Joyce answered hastily, placing the phone back exactly where it had been and heading to help her mother.


When they came back, Joyce sat down and eagerly began peeling an orange for Katrina.



Katrina observed her daughter with a hint of surprise."You're in an unusually sweet mood today, aren't you?"



Joyce beamed at her. "You're my mom.Why wouldn't I want to take the best care of you?"



Katrina's face softened into a smile.



Joyce continued, "Mom, you've always been there for me, haven't you? I know I can count on you to keep me safe. I'm so thankful you're my mom."


Joyce hardly ever spoke so openly, and it nearly brought Katrina to tears.



That night, Joyce stayed by Katrina's side, looking after her before heading home. For the first time in a while, Katrina felt genuinely comforted.It felt like her child had finally started to mature,making all the sacrifices she had made feel worthwhile.



When Joyce returned home, she found Daniela immersed in reviewing a pile of reports.


A secretary stóod beside Daniela, briskly updating her on various work matters.



Daniela caught sight of Joyce entering and narrowed her eyes slightly but said nothing.


Cedric quickly took a seat beside Daniela.


He wasn't interested in Joyce, but he thoroughly enjoyed being the center of Daniela's attention.


A little pampering now and then didn't bother him at all.


As Cedric moved closer to her, Daniela offered a faint smile before turning her attention back to the documents spread out in front of her.


Joyce felt like she had just been subjected to an overly sugary moment. Mumbling something under her breath, she stomped upstairs.


When Joyce returned downstairs, Daniela's secretary was already gone.


Joyce threw herself onto the living room sofa,exuding a newfound sense of confidence.


Even Caiden couldn't help but notice how much Joyce's mood had improved.


"So, what's the deal? Did someone bail you out of your debt mess?" Caiden asked, raising an eyebrow.


Joyce let out a sarcastic chuckle. "Yeah. Who needs a useless dad when l've got someone who actually steps up?"


Caiden instantly caught the meaning behind her words.



He didn't care much and shrugged it off as something that didn't affect him.



Caiden turned his attention back to the TV, while Daniela cast a calm, measured glance at Joyce. To Daniela, there were people who would never learn restraint, no matter how many times life knocked them down. And Joyce was exactly that type of person.



Settling on the couch, Daniela opened her laptop and started typing with purpose.



She'd already had a nagging feeling that something didn't add up.


Katrina had claimed to be out of options, yet somehow she'd managed to gather millions to secure Joyce's release.



Katrina,who had been Caiden's wife for years, might have stashed away a small fortune. But did she truly have access to a hundred million? That question alone stirred Daniela's suspicions.



With swift precision, she hacked into the banking system and retrieved Katrina's recent transaction records. As expected, a seven-figure transfer had landed in Katrina's account just one day before Joyce's release.



Daniela tapped on the screen, and the sender's name popped up.


Erika Schmidt.



Daniela recognized the name instantly-it was Katrina's mother, a notorious gambler. Katrina had often supported Erika financially in the past, so it wasn't shocking to see some money flowing back her way.


But still, where did Katrina manage to secure a hundred million for Joyce?


Daniela checked every phone number linked to Erika,her fingers dancing over the keyboard.


It didn't take long for her to uncover all of Erika's recent calls and messages.


One message, in particular, grabbed Daniela's attention. 
"There's a man named Doug Fairburne. I told him you need money, and he said he's willing to help. If you keep him company, he'll transfer the funds right away."


Daniela angled her laptop, letting Cedric read the message glowing on the screen.
###Chapter 301 Cornered Enemies Would Fight Back


Cedric's eyes instantly landed on Doug's name.

He lifted a hand and tapped the screen lightly.

Daniela gave.a small nod in response.

Cedric winked at her.

"What are you doing?" Joyce asked, her mood noticeably brighter after reading the message which she believed held the key to solving her problems.

Her dreams of a fresh start rekindled, she looked at Cedric with affection.

But Cedric and Daniela seemed so engrossed in each other that they barely acknowledged her presence.

They looked as if they might lean in and kiss any second.

Daniela tilted her head slightly, catching Joyce's gaze, and offered a faint smnile.

The moment Joyce caught that smile, a sense of unease gripped her.

She knew all too well that whenever Daniela smiled like that, it usually spelled trouble for her.

With a slight tremor in her voice, she asked, "Why are you smiling?"

Daniela leaned back into the sofa with a casual air. "It must've been tough, huh? Not many people in this city can come up with that kind of money."

Caiden glanced up at her words, his curiosity piqued.

Joyce straightened her posture and shot back, "What's the matter? Jealous that l've got someone who's got my back?"

As Joyce spoke, Cedric silently reached for Daniela's hand, ensuring it stayed out of Joyce's line of sight. Daniela's smile grew wider. "Oh, absolutely. I'm a little envious of how resourceful your mom is. She must've put in a lot of effort, don't you think?"

Caiden had been quietly observing Cedric and Daniela's secretive hand-holding, but the moment he heard Daniela speak, he turned away.

Daniela continued, "Even for married couples, it's not easy to come up with that amount of money so quickly, especially to cover an endless debt. Your mom must've gone through a lot."

Her words left both Joyce and Caiden visibly pale.

While Joyce appeared uneasy, Caiden's expression shifted to genuine fear, as if terrified that Katrina had cheated on him.

Daniela watched their reactions with quiet amusement, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.

Without another word, she leaned back casually and continued scrolling through her phone, clearly entertained by the drama she'd just sparked.

Caiden shot up from his seat, his voice thunderous. "Joyce! Tell me exactly how you managed to come up with the money to pay off your debt!"

Joyce's heart raced in panic.

A hundred million was an enormous amount.

She had no clue how to come up with a believable story to explain it.

The weight of the situation hit her, and she couldn't help but regret her earlier arrogance.

She should have kept her head down and stayed out of trouble.

"We're nothing to each other anymore," Caiden snarled. "If I don't want you here, you're gone. And if Katrina has betrayed me, I'll make sure you both pay for it!"

Caiden's obsession with his reputation consumed him.

The mere thought of his wife betraying him was intolerable. He wouldn't stand for it-ever.

The more the idea festered, the hotter his anger burned.

Furious, he stormed upstairs, grabbed Joyce's luggage, hurled it outside the villa, and tossed down a divorce agreement he'd already signed.

"Get Katrina to sign this! She leaves with nothing. This house belonged to my late wife, and it's got nothing to do with her! Both of you, out!"

The thought of Katrina stooping so low for money only fueled Caiden's rage further.

It was well past ten o'clock, and no cabs ran through this villa district.

Joyce stood at the gates of the villa, her tears falling silently down her cheeks.

The night stretched on, growing colder and darker.

Shivering in the cold night air, Joyce heard the sound of the villa door opening.

She turned around to find Daniela standing under the porch light, her expression unreadable.

Daniela offered, "Come inside."

Joyce sniffled, her voice trembling."Are you really that nice?"

Daniela smirked. She wasn't being kind-she simply relished the drama.

Kicking Joyce out would've been too easy,too boring.

With nowhere else to turn, Joyce reluctantly hauled her suitcase back inside the house.

Caiden shot Joyce a furious glare before turning to Daniela."Why are you letting her back in? Haven't we endured enough humiliation?"

Caiden's anger was unmistakable, and Daniela could see it clearly in his expression.

However, she remained unfazed, her voice steady as she replied, "You were right about one thing earlier.This villa belonged to my mother. You have the right to throw people out, and I have the right to let them in. When you brought people in without consulting me, it only seems fair I don't need your permission now."

Caiden's frown deepened.

Daniela flashed a faint smile, gazing down at Caiden. "If I wanted, I could even throw you out."

Joyce's face brightened upon hearing Daniela's audacious words.

Her smug expression returned, her confidence restored.

Some people never seemed to learn their lesson.

Caiden clenched his teeth, his eyes following Joyce as she lugged her suitcase upstairs.

When the room fell silent, Caiden spoke again. "Daniela, what's your game? You clearly can't stand them,yet you won't let them leave. What's your point?"

Daniela's expression remained unchanged, her calm demeanorunwavering.

"Daniela, I know them. When backed into a corner, they'll fight back," he added.

"Really? Let them try. I'm curious to see just how far they'll push it." Daniela chuckled coldly.

She was eager to see what desperate moves Katrina and Joyce would make next.
###Chapter 302 Is This Really The Only Way


Caiden clenched his jaw tightly.

He felt a deep, genuine fear of Daniela now-far more than he'd ever feared angering Brylee.

With Brylee, he could smooth things over and return to his usual carefree self once her temper passed.

But Daniela was entirely different.

She was firm and unrelenting in her stance.

She was immune to both soft and hard tactics.

Caiden now lived with a constant, gnawing fear that Daniela might toss him out of the villa at any moment.

"Whatever Katrina and her daughter do, it has nothing to do with me. I just want to stay out of it. If they stir up any trouble, don't blame me," he said.

Daniela could see the fear in him.

The emptiness of his pockets and the constant uncertainty were indeed a slow, agonizing torment.

She didn't offer a single comforting word. Instead, she let him worry day after day, believing that was the only way he could atone for his sins.

Early that morning, Joyce filled a thermos with breakfast the maid had prepared and set off to visit Katrina at the hospital.

As she was leaving,she noticed Caiden but ignored him.

Caiden's expression darkened as he spat disdainfully at her retreating figure, regretting everything more than ever.

The whispers of rumors people had spread behind his back echoed in his mind. "Caiden must have some nerve. How could he raise someone else's child so willingly?"

"I don't understand. One day, I visited his place when it was freezing, and Daniela was wearing nothing but a thin shirt. I asked the maid why she didn't make her wear something warmer, and she said Daniela was just that stubborn-she didn't feel the cold."

"If the mnaid was bold enough to speak like that, Katrina must have been even tougher on her."

"Caiden's a fool. He should've cherished his own daughter. I witnessed Joyce pour freezing water over Daniela in the middle of wvinter. Caiden saw it too, yet he acted oblivious."

"He'll eventually face the consequences of his actions."

"Damn,Caiden."

There had been countless similar comments, but Caiden had always dismissed them as idle gossip.

Now, however, he felt the weight of every word coming to life. The reality of it all sank in, and he finally understood-he was facing the consequences he had long avoided, the ones he truly deserved.

Meanwhile, Joyce made her way to the hospital with the thermos in hand.

With a wide smile, she sat by Katrina's bedside and peeled an orange for her.

Katrina lay there, feeling comforted, believing that all the love and care she had given her daughter over the years had finally borne fruit.

Now, Joyce was taking care of her.

"Mom,how does it taste?" Joyce brought a piece of orange to Katrina's lips.

Katrina smiled. "It's sweet. And it warms my heart. There's nothing that makes me happier than seeing you so caring."

As shespoke, Katrina's thoughts wandered, weighed down by the crushing burden of Joyce's debt.

"I'll do everything I can to take care of your debt. If things get too complicated, I'll divorce Caiden. Daniela has a tight grip on the finances, but maybe | can squeeze ten million out of him. It won't cover everything, but it should help with part of what you owe. After that, I'll figure out the rest."

Suddenly,Joyce's cheerful demeanor faded. She slowly raised her gaze, her eyes turning cold. "Mom, what did you just say?" she asked.

Katrina kept a faint smile on her face, but it faltered as she noticed Joyce's change in demeanor. "First, I'll divorce Caiden, and then..."

"Divorce?" Joyce sprang from her chair, her voice sharp with agitation. "And ten million? Mom, you know how much I owe. Ten million is barely a fraction ofit. And if you divorce Caiden and cut ties with the Harper family, what happens to-me? How am I supposed to use that status to secure a future, especially when it comes to getting married? And what about my son?"

Katrina's brow furrowed. "I know this is difficult for you, but it's theonly option we have at the moment."

As she spoke, her chest tightened, a sharp pang of pain shooting through her.

She gripped her chest, struggling to catch her breath. The orange she had just eaten turned bitter in her mouth.

"Don't worry. I'll work something out for you. Jack can stay somewhere else for now. We'll rent a place.And..."

Joyce found the entire suggestion laughable. Her gaze turned cold, and she fixed Katrina with a steely stare."Mom, I refuse to return to a poor life. And don't even mention marrying someone else who's easy to control. Men like Caiden, who are that naive, don't come by often. You're getting older. Do you really think you can compete with younger women?"

Katrina bit her lip, feeling the sting of Joyce's words deep within her. She was about to protest, ready to ask,"Why do you think I'm doing all this?"

Joyce cur her off. "And is this really the only way?"

The words lingered, heavy in the air.

Katrina's forehead creased, a look of confusion crossing her face. "What do you mean?"
###Chapter 303 Go Ask Daniela To Pay The Debt


Joyce was ruthless, but she lacked the cunning to play the game behind the scenes. Without hesitation, she admitted, "Mom, I saw the message Grandma sent you."

Katrina was caught off guard. "And what if you did?"

"Isn't that the simplest answer?" Joyce retorted. "Grandma said Doug throws money around like it's nothing. He could give you a fortune. What's stopping you?"

Joyce shot Katrina a quick look and continued, "Doug didn't ask for a divorce. He just wants you to keep him company. Mom, that's one hundred million! And isn't dealing with men something you know all too well?"

Katrina felt completely exhausted.

If she had the energy, she would have slapped Joyce across the face.

This was her precious daughter.

The one she had loved with all her heart.

"How could you say something like that?" Katrina felt her heart crack. She was filled with a deep sense of disappointment.

Lately, she'd been wondering if Daniela killed her, would Joyce step in to avenge her, as Daniela had done for her own mother?。

The thought made her heart ache with sadness.

Joyce was still so young and had to carry such a heavy weight of bitterness.

But now, it turned out she had been fooling herself all along.

Joyce was nothing like Daniela.

Years ago, Brylee had been too busy, hardly ever spending time with the five-year-old Daniela. But that young Daniela clung to her mother's memory with relentless devotion.

Meanwhile, Katrina's own daughter-the one she had raised for over two decades-was now telling her to sleep with a stranger to settle her debt.

It felt as though her whole world was crumbling around her.

"Joyce, you're aware I'm married, right? You've called Caiden 'Dad' for more than twenty years. How could you ask me to go along with this?"

Unfazed by her mother's pain, Joyce responded casually, "But didn't you do the same thing before? You cheated on my real dad with Caiden. I was young, sure, but I wasn't blind. The garden, the bathroom,the rooftop, the kitchen. Didn't you and Caiden sneak around in all those spots? How is this any different?Caiden wasn't even close to being as rich as Doug, was he?"

Katrina felt a painful tightness grip her chest. "Joyce, think about it. I asked you once how you'd feel about Caiden becoming your new father, and you agreed."

Joyce nodded. "And now, I agree with Doug becoming the new father."

Katrina felt completely crushed. She had always seen Doug as a last resort, someone she could turn to only when all other options were exhausted.

Years ago, there had been some love between her and Caiden. But now, she faced the possibility of staying in her marriage while getting involved with another man purely for financial gain.

A decade ago, perhaps she could have. But after so many years of comfort, she wasn't willing to sacrifice her dignity like that anymore.

She had worked so hard to leave her past behind, and now it felt like she was slipping right back into it.

Leaning back against the headboard, Katrina sighed. "Joyce, you just don't get it."

Joyce narrowed her eyes. "So, you're refusing to help me? You were willing to sneak around with Caiden for your own sake, but now you won't make a single sacrifice for me?"

Joyce threw the orange she had been holding onto the floor in frustration. "Katrina, you brought me into this wortd. You're responsible for met You have to figure ouì á way to ciéa my hundred-milion debtr

With that, Joyce stormed out of the hospital room witlrout a second grance.

She was sure Katrina would eventually turn to Doug

So,when the debt oollectors arrived, Joyce feft à mlx of desperation and bolidness. Without hesitation, she knelt before them, pleading for just two more days.

One of them, a man named Flash Dixon, leaned in and grabbed Joyce's chin wlth a sty grin. "You know what' :happen# you don't pay, right? Gotta admit, a young lady raised with money like you is a rare flnd."

Joyce shuddered. "I'm from the Harper family. My dad might not have money, but I have a sister. She's filthy rch!

Flash ralsed an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.aIs that so?"

"Yes, she's the true heir to the family, Brylee's biological daughter. She's stunning and wealthy: Forget about a hundred million.She could easily come up with billions. You should go after her."

Flash listened closely, pressing his tongue to the side of his mouth. "You're not lying, are you?"

Still on her knees, Joyce nodded urgently. "Completely truthful. Look it up now! lf l'm lying, you can kill me right here!"

Flash pulled out his phone. "What's her name?"

"Daniela Harper."
###Chapter 304 Can't Sleep Either


Daniela had found herself caught in a relentless whirlwind of work.

Her commitment to the headquarters left her no time to unwind or take a breath.

By the time she returned home, it was often well past nine at night.

Though Cedric_usually picked her up, the demands of a large project at Phillips Group recently made Daniela insist that he meet her at home instead.

One day, just as Daniela got into the car, the driver glanced back. "There's a car trailing us. I've been noticing it for days. That car has been tailing us ever since we left the office."

Without looking up from her tablet, Daniela replied, "I see."

The driver asked cautiously, "Should I get someone to handle it?"

Still focused on her tablet, Daniela answered, "No need. They haven't made a move, just keeping their distance. If we take action now, we'll only alert them."

The driver nodded firmly. "Understood."

As they pulled up to the Harper family villa, they saw Cedric arriving at the same time.

He made his way over to Daniela, his expression serious. "You're aware a car's been tailing you,right?"

A faint smile tugged at Daniela's lips. "Did you notice it too?"

Seeing her smile, Cedric relaxed slightly, his posture shifting. "Yeah, I was behind you. I saw that car follow you into the neighborhood."

Together,they walked into the house, and Daniela nodded. "It's been going on for a few days now."

Cedric's face tightened with concern. "Should I handle it?" Bending down to swap her shoes, Daniela responded, "There's no need. They're not posing any danger."

Cedric fell quiet. He sensed that Daniela always had a plan. Her composed manner spoke volumes of her confidence.

After a brief pause, Cedric took her hand and said, "I've told you before, there are lines I won't cross. Do you remember?"

A smile played on Daniela's lips. "I remember."

With a curious glance, Cedric asked, "And what exactly are those lines?"

"Not allowing myself to get hurt," Daniela answered simply.

His gaze locked with hers, and he asked again, "You promised, didn't you?"

The worry in Cedric's eyes was undeniable, a concern so palpable that Daniela couldn't dismiss it.

She had always been detached, indifferent to most things around her, keeping a distance from the world.

No matter what happened, it never truly bothered her.

The world kept turning whether she existed or not.

However, when she looked into Cedric's eyes, the anxiety she saw there caused a gentle, unexpected flutter in her chest.

Her expression softened, and with a calm smile, she reassured him, "Yes, I promise."

Cedric knew that when Daniela gave her word, it was unshakable.

Once she made a promise, it was as good as done-there was no turning back.

A slight tension eased in Cedric's shoulders as he heard her words.

In the high society they navigated, being followed was far from unusual, but it still stirred a protective unease in Cedric.

If it had been him being followed, he might not have cared as much. But when it came to Daniela, he wouldn't stand for any threat to her.

She was everything to him, his entire world.

Anyone daring to harm her would have to face the full force of his anger.

They had already eaten at the office, and after a quick shower, they slipped into their familiar routine-relaxing together in front of the TV in the living room.

In the midst of their quiet evening, Joyce quickly passed through the living room, her head lowered, and dashed upstairs.

Cedric's eyes left the TV and followed her for a moment, moving towards the staircase.

After a brief moment, Cedric turned his focus back to the screen.

Joyce didn't return downstairs after that.

Once in her room, she began typing out Daniela's detailed daily routes and schedule, sharing every little detail with Flash.

Her hand trembled as she pressed send.

Fear clung to her, but she couldn't pinpoint which terrified her more.

Flash,or Daniela.

A sense of unease settled deep within her, making it impossible to shake off.

Long after midnight, Joyce decided to head downstairs for a drink. She flicked on the hallway light and made her way down.

As she reached for a bottle in the wine cabinet, a figure on the sofa caught her attention.

Startled, Joyce placed her hand over her chest and moved closer to get a better look. "Cedric?"

There, Cedric sat in simple loungewear, his form illuminated by the moonlight.

The glow softened the usual sharpness of his features, making him appear unexpectedly gentle. With a nervous flutter in her chest, Joyce tightened her grip on the bottle and walked to him.

"Struggling to sleep too?" she asked, her shirt slipping slightly off her shoulder to reveal her smooth skin.

Cedric didn't acknowledge her. He remained still, and just as Joyce was about to step closer, his voice cut through the silence, cold and distant.
###Chapter 305 I'm Okay


A harsh, commanding "Get lost!" echoed through the vast living room.

Joyce froze in her tracks, her cheeks flushing with humiliation.

That familiar sting of not being good enough compared to Daniela crept in once again,filling the quiet night.

Her eyes grew red as she gazed at Cedric's sharp, chiseled features.

She couldn't understand what she was missing.

Why could he show so much kindness to Daniela but not to her?

His eyes held such warmth for Daniela, yet when they turned to her, they were nothing but icy.

What was it about her that fell short next to Daniela?

Why did Cedric, with all his capability, refuse to even look her way?

Overcome with bitterness, Joyce clenched her jaw and tore off the thin robe she had draped around herself.

She had been about to settle into bed, used to sleeping with as little as possible.

On her way to grab a drink, she had casually thrown on a simple robe. Now, she was being naked.
。
The late-night breeze cut through the room, sending a chill across her skin.

Standingtall, Joyce revealed herself completely. She was convinced that Cedric wouldn't miss her presence in the expansive living room.

Back in the bedroom, Daniela instinctively reached out for the person she expected to be beside her,but her hand only met cold, empty sheets.

Frowning,she felt around the mattress, the coolness confirming she was alone. She slowly opened her eyes, letting them adjust to the darkness around her. "Cedric?"

But the silent room offered no reply.

Tossing the covers aside, Daniela figured he must have gone downstairs for water and decided to check for him.

As she reached the staircase, her eyes landed on Joyce, who stood completely naked in the middle of the living room.

Cedric stood not far off, seemingly deep in thought.

A deep frown etched onto Daniela's face as she hurried down the stairs.

Before Joyce could utter a word or make a move, Daniela positioned herself in front of her.

Grabbing the discarded robe from the sofa, Daniela gripped Joyce by the neck and pushed her towards the entryway.

Joyce barely had a moment to process what was happening before the robe hit her face with a jarring smack.

The sharp impact on her skin fanned the flames of her anger.

She yanked the robe away and was ready to declare that she and Cedric were caught up in'a moment of passion. But as soon as her eyes met Daniela's piercing glare, she went rigid.

Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.

She had never seen Daniela in such a state before.

Typically, Daniela was the picture of indifference.

Whether it was handling Caiden's favoritism, going after Alexander, or dealing with the gossip that followed her,she always kept her cool. Her confidence never wavered, and there was never a hint of emotion that could be easily read.

There was a time when Joyce had even convinced herself that Daniela was incapable of feeling anger or contempt.

After all, when Alexander and Daniela's marriage fell apart, she didn't waste time trying to explain herself to the media. Instead, she just showed them the evidence, straightforward and without fuss.

It was moments like that which led Joyce to believe Daniela was far too composed to ever lose control.

Yet now, Daniela's icy, piercing stare bore into her, and the grip around her neck gradually tightened.

The choking terror of having her life in jeopardy was far worse than the time she had been trapped in that bleak warehouse.

"Do you really think I wouldn't hurt you?" Daniela's face was no longer blank; a faint, almost pleasant smile spread across her lps.

"I..." Joyce opened her mouth to defend herself, intending to blame Cedric for seducing her.

But before she could say anything, Daniela's grip on her neck tightened once more, silencing her.

With her other hand, Daniela pressed a finger firmly against Joyce's lips, stopping her words in their tracks."I'm not interested in your excuses. I don't need your denial."

Terror widened Joyce's eyes.

Daniela's gaze sharpened as her fingers pressed harder into Joyce's neck.

Joyce's faceturned ashen, and the blood drained from her features in mere moments.

Joyce's hands slapped desperately at Daniela's arm, but Daniela shoved her forcefully to the floor.

The impact jolted through her, and Joyce's head hit the floor with a sickening thud, the blow nearly knocking her unconscious.

Her vision blurred and faded at the edges, and for a brief, terrifying moment, she felt as though death was right on top of her.

A wave of fear flooded over her, her body trembling as something warm began to trickle down beneath her. "Daniela!" Cedric's voice rang out, sharp and urgent. "Let her go!"

He had never seen Daniela behave this way. She seemed completely deaf to his voice, no matter how much he raised it.

Not wanting to use force, he crouched and encircled Daniela in his arms, whispering,"|′Ss over now. Don't let it upset you. I'm fine, really. There's no need to be angry."
###Chapter 306 Daniela Lost Control


Joyce's mind grappled with a sudden truth just before darkness overtook her senses.

Daniela, too, was only human. She could lose control. She had someone she cared about, and that was Cedric.

With that realization, Joyce slumped to the floor, unconscious.

Lillian and Ryan returned from ther late meal to a surprising scene-Cedric holding Daniela.

"Hey, you two, it's late. Maybe take the romance upstairs?"

Lillian was poised to exit, but Cedric's voice halted her retreat.

"Deal with the mess down here."

At that moment, Caiden, disturbed by the noise, descended in a hastily worn robe.

He entered the living room just as Cedric spoke.

As he noticed Joyce prone in a puddle of something odious, disgust flicked across his face.

Ignoring everything, Cedric guided Daniela upstairs, their hands intertwined as though they were alone.

Catching sight of Daniela, Caiden recoiled instinctively.

"What's wih her? Why the fury?" Caiden murmured. "Was she about to kill Joyce?"

Daniela's intensity shook him, drawing the remark from him without thought.

Upon hearing him, Daniela looked up from the intertwined hands of her and Cedric.

Caiden stood frozen, struggling to find words. Locked under Daniela's daunting gaze, as terrifying as a ghost from tales of old, he opened his mouth. But the malice in her eyes silenced him before he could speak.

She advanced a single, menacing step towards him.

Startled, Caiden hit the floor with a loud thud.

Cedric drew Daniela closer with a gentle tug of her hand. Bending close, he murmured, "Come on, honey.Let's go back to our room."

Daniela blinked, seeing her own reflection in Cedric's eyes.

He then led her into their bedroom.

For a while, Caiden's heart raced until it finally calmed.

He suddenly recalled it wasn't the first time Daniela's eyes held that fierce look.

Back when Brylee passed away, whispers of her hysteria circulated.

These whispers morphed into wild rumors that Brylee had overdosed on aphrodisiacs, which led to her death.

She was labeled a slut by many.

Initially, Daniela didn't grasp the meaning of "slut."

Observing Caiden, she tried to discern if the term was derogatory.

By that time, he had married Katrina and seemed indifferent to the slander about Brylee.

Time moved on.

Daniela matured.

Exceptionally intelligent, she advanced several grades, entering senior high at just ten

Among older peers, she frequently heard the careless slinging of the word "slut."

Her gaze then mirrored the intensity seen moments ago. One classmate's insult resulted in his own sustaining five broken ribs, a disfigured face from candle way,and deep emotional scars.

Caiden was taken aback.

As Caiden fetched Daniela from school, the look in her eyes deterred him from any scolding.

It was fear, not affection, that silenced him.

The ferocity in a ten-year-old's demeanor disturbed him deeply.

Daniela's emotional turmõil eventually leveled out on its own.

Caiden chose not to dwell on the past.

It was only later he understood that Daniela's mood disorder flared due to that singular term.

This only occurred when something deeply affected her core.

Caiden stared with a hardened gaze at the closed door of Daniela's bedroom.

Apart from Brylee, it seemed Cedric had become another crucial person in Daniela's life.

Rising, Caiden expressed his frustration. "Unbelievable. After all these years of my support, you've never defended me as a daughter should. Joyce merely attempted to seduce Cedric, and he was unharmed.Was such a drastic reaction really necessary?"

Descending the stairs, he presumed Joyce had simply passed out.

However, upon noticing the vivid red marks encircling her neck, he stood frozen

The front door swung open.

Ryan lingered by the threshold with a lazy stance.

Outside, Lillian was speaking on the phone. "So, she's still alive, right? Should we take her to the hospital? If she were dead, I'd just bury her here and save the trouble."

The response from the other end caused Lillian to end the call in annoyance. She turned to Ryan. "What if we just end her here? The hospital visit sounds tedious. We'd need to wait for the car.?

Ryan, absorbed in his phone, merely shrugged. "Doesn't bother me."

Caiden was taken aback by their indifference.

Concerned, he declared, "IH make the call. I'll take her myself. You two take a break. This is still about a human life. Let's not treat it so lightly."

After speaking, Caiden caught a glimpse of Lillian's mocking smile.

"Really? Do you actually believe a life is that significant? That we should treat it with more care?"

Pausing, Caiden sensed the implication in her words.

As Lillian moved past, she tapped Ryan on the shoulder. "Let's head back to bed."

The entrance then quieted down abruptly.

Caiden quickly phoned for an ambulance. As they helped Joyce to the ambulance, he realized she was completely exposed beneath her robe.

A sudden gust of wind whipped the fabric away.

Now Joyce was fully exposed to everyone's eyes.

One paramedic commented in dismay, "We're here to save a life, not to be confronted by such a distasteful sight."
###Chapter 307 All I Want Is You


Caiden stood frozen, his eyes narrowing as he shot a frosty glare at Joyce.

Why did she have to push Daniela's buttons? Wasn't she just inviting disaster upon herself?

The hours ticked by as the night grew darker.

Cedric led Daniela back.to their bedroom.

The comforting familiarity of the room eased Daniela's tension little by little.

Cedric settled down across from her, hoIding out a glass of water. Daniela simply shook her head.

With a soft sigh, he set the glass down, his attention returning to her.

"I wasn't really paying attention. My mind was elsewhere, and I didn't notice Joyce's actions. Then you came downstairs. You got upset, right?"

Daniela shook her head again but then gave a small nod.

Cedric smiled slightly. "You're upset with Joyce, not me, aren't you?"

Hearing that name brought a flicker of anger to Daniela's gaze.

Cedric reached for Daniela's hand and cleaned it with a wet wipe.

"I can handle myself. I just wasn't paying attention earlier. Don't let it upset you."

His tone was gentle, almost like calming a child. "But it bothers me too-it hurts right here."

He guided Daniela's hand to rest over his chest.

She observed him in silence.

The moonlight streaming through the tall window softened Cedric's sharp features. Daniela noticedher own reflection mirrored in his steady gaze.

Then Cedric spoke, his voice steady. "Daniela, I love you. I always will. You don't need to worry about anyone else. I'H keep myself safe, and you can have anything pure and real from me."

Daniela's face softened, the anger fading and replaced by a calm, deeper longing.

"Why don't we get some rest now?" Cedric suggested, patting Daniela's hand gently.

He crouched down to grab the glass from the floor, planning to set it on the table. But just as he reached for it, a hand grippedhis wrist.

He glanced over, and before he could fully process what was happening, something soft grazed his lips.

A soft,tender warmth brushed against him, stirring something deep within.

Cedric felt his heart soften, almost,melting at the touch.

At first, he let Daniela's hesitant kiss continue, but her soft, impatient sounds made him chuckle before he leaned in to return the gesture fully.

It wasn't long before his laughter faded, overtaken by a deep, smoldering desire.

Cedric kept the glass in one hand while his other arm wrapped around Daniela's waist.

In the past, she had always held back, and Cedric never pressured her.

He allowed her to set the pace for everything between them.

He would always give in to whatever she desired.

Even when his desire for her burned fiercely, he'd cool off with a cold shower.

He had a feeling she was holding something back, or maybe she was leaving him a way out.

He couldn't understand why she thought he needed that.

He didn't. He never wanted an escape. But because it mattered to her, he went along with it without question.

Now, as Daniela's hands reached for the buttons of Cedric's shirt, his expression turned serious in an instant.

He pulled away slightly, his voice soft yet firm. "Is this just a fleeting moment, or are you sure of what you want?"

Despite his question, she continued to undo his buttons, drawing closer for another kiss.

"Daniela?" Cedric's-voice was gentle, laced with a touch of self-awareness. Though he couldn't deny the excitement building within him, a part of him wrestled with doubt, wondering if he was somehow overstepping.

That small voice of reason urged him to pause, and so he called her name, seeking reassurance before moving any further.

However, Daniela ignored him. She focused on the buttons again but soon grew frustrated and looked up at Cedric with a silent, pleading gaze.

"You do it yourself." Her voice was gentle and enticing. Cedric's hand shook slightly around the glass,droplets of water falling onto his arm like little sparks.

The drops felt strangely hot against his skin. He could no longer control himself.

Cedric's lips curved into a playful smile as he looked at her. "You're quite the demanding one, aren't you?
Too lazy to undress me yourself, so now l've got to handle it all?" 

Daniela's eyes were tinged with faint redness.

Without saying a word, she focused on his buttons again.

Cedric's heart raced, a dizzying feeling washing over him.

Every part of this moment seemed to pull him in, intoxicating and irresistible.

She fumbled with the shirt for what seemed like an eternity, and Cedric couldn't tell whether it was frustrating her or himself.

At last, he placed his hand over hers, meeting her gaze. "If you regret this later, I won't feel bad. But right now,all I want is you."

As soon as he finished speaking, Daniela closed the distance and kissed him once again.

Without missing a beat, Cedric deepened the kiss, matching her intensity.

After they pulled back, breathless and dazed, Daniela whispered, "I like that."

Cedric blinked, completely taken aback, his mind racing to process her boldness.
###Chapter 308 Does Daniela Control Your Finances That Tightly


Daniela lifted her shirt as she spoke.

Deeper grew the night outside.

On the table, a glass perched precariously shook, causing subtle ripples to dance on the water within.

Low whimpers echoed through the room, stretching the night into an endless void.

The following day dawned.

Cedric awoke, his spirit completely rejuvenated.

Snuggling close to Daniela, he admired the gentle curve of her lashes.

A profound sense of relief swelled in his chest.

Echoes of an almost surreal thought lingered in his mind.

Daniela was lost in a deep sleep, dreaming of a comforting warmth pressing against her.

When the warmth turned stifling, she shifted, only to feel it persist.

A hot breath against her skin then dragged her back into a suffocating sleep.

Half-asleep, she caught Cedric's low chuckle as he murmured, "Once I completely owned you, I never want to let go of you."

She slept on, undisturbed.

Cedric went downstairs to cook for Daniela when Caiden returned from the hospital.

"Cedric, you need to pay up. I can't shoulder these hospital bills."

In loose white loungewear, Cedric watched the soupsimmer. Caiden, fraught with anxiety, inquired, "Where's Daniela?"

"In her room," Cedric replied calmly. "But I advise against going up there right now."

Caiden paused on the stairs upon hearing that. "Why don't you pay the bills then? I's only thirty grand, a mere slice of your bank balance."

Content, Cedric responded lightly, "I don't control my finances."

"Then who does?" Caiden blurted out, realizing his question's futility afterward. He groaned in frustration."You're content not controlling your money?"

Cedric's assured demeanor might lead one to think he let Daniela manage his finances.

"You're just dating, yet she already controls your money?" Reconsidering, Caiden chose not to ascend the stairs. Instead, he attempted to reason with Cedric. "Listen, every man should have some accessible cash.You're not even married to Daniela yet. If she wants to control your finances, you can refuse. Besides, with your business, surely you've got some reserves?"

Cedric responded, "No, there's only about ten dollars left in my account."

The previous night, while embracing Daniela, he had transferred all his funds into her account.

He subscribed to the belief that a true man, once married, should relinquish financial control, living modestly under his partner's vigilant supervision.

Caiden was baffled by the joy evident on Cedric's face. "You're a CEO and you're down to ten bucks?"

Cedric gestured towards the phone on the table.

Approaching, Caiden peered at the screen and saw the balance was a mere cent.

"Not even ten dollars!" Caiden gasped in disbelief.

Cedric glanced at the display. "Looks like they charged a fee. I'll need to ask Daniela for lunch money later."

Caiden's astonishment grew. "Billions at your disposal, and you can't even afford lunch? Does Daniela really control your finances that tightly?" Cedric simply smiled. "Yes, she's quite strict."

Caiden,observing Cedric's increasingly satisfied expression, clicked his tongue twice. Despite his concerns for Cedric's well-being, a sense of solidarity emerged.

"Would Daniela cover Joyce's hospital expenses if I asked? She must, right? Saving is tough on my budget."

He then showed Cedric the paltry sum in his account. "This is all that's left."

Cedric, while serving soup, nodded. "Ask her, if you feel bold enough."

Caiden hesitated, wishing Cedric would offer to ask instead. Noting Cedric's passive compliance as he carried soup upstairs, Caiden abandoned the thought.

'"Forget about it."

He realized that Cedric's predicament might be more severe than his own.

Unfortunate man.

Meanwhile, Daniela nestled within Cedric's hold, briefly awoke to sip some soup before drifting back to sleep.

As darkness enveloped the outside, she stirred once more.

Opening her eyes slowly, she noticed Cedric sitting quietly beside her.

His laughter greeted her awakening.

"Welcome back."

Daniela turned away from him, her eyes closing once more. "I'm done with that."

Cedric,sitting on the bed's edge like a devoted dog, panicked slightly."What?Why not?"-

He carefully turned Daniela to face him. "Didn't you like it? Wasn't it enjoyable?"
###Chapter 309 Ramon's Godson


Daniela's cheeks gradually warmed with a blush.

The color deepened, spreading from the tips of her ears down to her neck, conceáled beneath the blanket.

Cedric,seldom seeing Daniela this shy, was visibly pleased.

He leaned forward, cupping her face and locking eyes with her.

In a gentle, teasing voice, he asked, "So, was I that bad?"

Daniela blinked, catching the gleam of desire in Cedric's eyes-almost predatory.

Her eyes widened in alarm. "Cedric, I'm really tired."

He chuckled, touching his nose to hers as he whispered, "Next time, I'll choose something simpler. This was a first for me. Go easy."

Daniela was about to reply when Cedric flung back the blanket.

His hand glided up her smooth abdomen.

Cedric mentally promised it was just a light tease.

Previously, even if Daniela resisted going further, he always had a way of playfully agitating her.

He was confident in his self-control now. Yet, the moment he felt her silky skin and heard her subdued,breathy sounds, all restraint dissolved.

Swept up by the moment, Cedric surrendered to his desires, captivated by the woman in front of him.

Amidst the fervor, a thought sparked within him. Once he'd embraced such unrestrained wildness, it was difficult to retreat.

Past midnight, Cedric enveloped Daniela in a soft blanket and carried her downstairs for a meal. He first reheated some soup for her.

Then, he began preparing additional dishes.

Josie, alerted by the sounds, entered the kitchen, but Cedric assured her he was fine on his own.

At the dining table, Josie complimented Daniela. "Cedríc is quite skilled in the kitchen. He's got everything under control."

Daniela offered a weary smile in agreement.

As she bent to sip her soup, the blanket slid down. Her loosely fitting top exposed a few red marks at her neckline.

Josie noticed, then chuckled before her expression turned slightly serious. "You should warn him to take it easy. Going two days without food is too much for anyone."

Despite her concern, Josie felt content.

"Cedric has always thrived in a lively environment. I've seen his home grow empty and him colder each day.Solitary business endeavors are challenging. He has faced many trials alone. His grandmother and I did our best to support him, but it was hardly enough. He was always disciplined, precisely knowing his, limits.Throughout these years, I've never observed him care for anyone like he does for you. It warms my heart to see him find true love. I'm thankful you've entered his life. Otherwise, I feared he might end up alone. When he asked me to care for you, I didn't hesitate because any woman who could win Cedric's heart must be extraordinary."

Wrapped in a warm blanket and enjoying some hot soup, Daniela looked towards Cedric, who was busy in the kitchen, and a gentle smile crossed her face.

She thought to herself how wonderful Cedric was and dreaded the thought of ever losing him.

Meanwhile, Katrina and Joyce shared a hospital room in silence.

Eventually, Katrina broke the silence. "Joyce, you're young and don't grasp the dangers of high society's games. People can die from them. No matter how upset you are, I won't get involved with Doug." Joyce gazed coldly out the hospital garden window. "I don't expect you to go out of your way for me.fhar my methods, and I'm prepared to risk everything, even If it means sacrificing my life.°

Following this, Joyce requested a nurse to change her room.

A chill gripped Katrina as she remembered Daniela's willingness to risk everything for her mother,contrasting sharply with Joyce's readiness to risk only her mother's well-being.

Katrina sighed deeply, closed her eyes, and tears began to fall.

Despite her injuries, the debt collectors that arrived weren't deterred.

They stormed into the hospital, knives at the ready, pressing against Joyce's already bruised face. "You planned this, didn't you? You told us Daniela was wealthy and then told Cedric to stick by her side,preventing us from kidnapping her."

Joyce shook her head in fright. "I didn't do that. Why not bring more muscle? Can't you handle Cedric?"

Immediately, another wound marked Joyce's face.

"Still brave enough to talk back? Do you realize who Cedric is?"

Confused, Joyce replied, "Cedric is the CEO of Phillips Group. Are you intimidated by a mere businessman?"

If so, Daniela's influence was much larger. Shouldn't they fear her more?

"Cedric is Ramon Dillon's godson, and he's long been connected to the underworld, more than you know.
Are you concealing more? Is Cedric protecting Daniela merely over business interests?"	0

Struck by this, Joyce fell silent.

Ramon Dillon? The man was known for his ruthlessness. Cedric was Ramon's godson?

"Do you have secrets to tell?" The debt collector eyed Joyce coldly.

"No, there's really nothing more. They are merely business partners. Had there been more, it would have been public by.now. Initially, Cedric showed interest in Daniela, but that changed over time." Joyce paused,then added, "Now, he has feelings for me."
###Chapter 310 Get Rid Of Daniela


The moment Joyce finished speaking, the debt collectors erupted in laughter, full of scorn. "What nonsense! Cedric wouldn't even look at you! Tell the truth, or you'll regret it!"

"I'm telling the truth. There was a time when Cedric showed interest in me. That's why he moved into the Harper family's villa. Daniela couldn't handle it and returned there too. If you don't believe me, go see for yourselves-they're both living in there."

With a mixture of truth and fabrications, Joyce added, "If you're still uncertain, jus ask Cedric yourself."

The debt collectors knew that Cedric had taken up residence at the Harper family's villa, but rumors about Cedric's romantic interests were scarce. They had no clue who he was involved with if anyone.

A heavy silence settled over the group.

They knew better than to cross Cedric or Ramon.

"Listen, I know I owe you. But you're better off going after Daniela. Take her down, and you'd be doing Cedric a huge favor. She's a constant headache for him, and trust me, he'd owe you for that. Why wouldn't he? Besides, Daniela is loaded. Forget about the hundred million. If you handle her like you did me, she might cough up a billion just to keep the peace. And you'd have Cedric's gratitude. A win-win, don't you think?"

Joyce's voice was firm, and her eyes shone with a purposeful resolve.

"Cedric and Daniela are still business partners. He can't just ignore her, not completely. I get that this complicates things for you. So, here's my idea. I'll make sure Daniela ends up at the hospital during work hours. On her way there, that's when you can act. What do you think? At that time, Cedric will be caught up in an international deal. He won't be watching her. You should have no trouble making your move then,right?" Joyce finished explaining and locked eyes with the group, her gaze intense, awaiting their response.

If they agreed, she could use them to get rid of Daniela.

In Joyce's eyes, Daniela had always been too proud, too untouchable. Seeing Daniela being kidnapped by these people would be satisfying, perhaps even sweet revenge.

Joyce daydreamed of the chaos that would follow once rumors of Elite Lux's CEO being kidnapped for 48hours surfaced. Daniela would have no choice but to resign to protect the company's reputation.

And in that moment, no one would dare compare Daniela's respectability or talent to hers.

Joyce couldn't shake the thought that everything she'd suffered, Daniela must experience in kind.

Only then would the bitterness consuming her heart begin.to fade.

As the debt collectors finally departed, a cold, malicious smile crept onto Joyce's face.

Reaching for her phone on the bedside table, she dialed Daniela's number without hesitation.

"Get here, now. The doctor says I need another surgery, and you're paying for it. If you refuse, I'll call Cedric.And if neither of you shows up, I'll go to the media and claim you were the one who hurt me."

The line went silent the moment Joyce finished speaking.

Joyce sat in the hospital bed, her mind suddenly clouded with doubt about whether Daniela would really show up.

The uncertainty gnawed at her.

After what felt like an eternity of worry, Joyce decided to send a text instead to Daniela.三saw Cedric at the hospital. If you don't show up now, I'll go find him myself."

Joyce understood that fabricating something too extreme would backfire.

If she pushed her lies too far, Daniela would uncover the truth in an instant.

All she could do now was wait, silently hoping that the debt collectors would take care of Daniela. If they succeeded, Daniela would be out of the picture, and she would no longer feel so overshadowed,sn ordinary, in comparison.
###Chapter 311 This Blindfold Is Too Tight


The debt collectors had waited through the day and night, yet Daniela remained insíde her home

Joyce understood that Daniela would not trust her.

In a desperate move to draw Daniela out, Joyce clenched her teeth and jumped from the second-floor window of the hospital.

The incident prompted an immediate call from the hospital to the Harper family.

The maid; after a pause filled with stunned silence, rushed to alert Daniela.

"Miss Harper, Joyce has jumped from the building! The doctor requires a family member's consent for her surgery."

Daniela replied icily, "How convenient. Isn't her mother already there in the hospital?"

The maid, still agitated, said, "They can't find her mother at the moment. You should go to the hospital."

Daniela, recalling Joyce's earlier words, began to sense a setup.

A smirk crossed her face quietly.

She then went upstairs to change clothes.

Back at the hospital, learning that Daniela had departed the villa brought Joyce a sharp intake of relief

Her risky decision to jump hadn't been futile.

On the road, Daniela's driver noted, "There's a car following us."

Daniela checked a message from Lillian and responded with composed assurance,""UJnderstood."

Initially,the mysterious car maintained its distance. It then suddenly accelerated, cutting off and halting Daniela's car in the street's center, drawing the attention of bystanders as other vehicles quickly dispersed.

One vehicle that had passed returned with a sharpU-turn

Inside, Daniela's frown deepened.

Outside,a man with a scarred face demanded loudly,"Get out!"

Before she could respond, Alexander emerged from his car, impetuous as always."What are you doing?This is a public road!"  

Daniela momentarily shut her eyes, frustrated by Alexander's reckless bravado.

His confrontation diverted the thugs' focus from Daniela to him.

Alexander pointed at the leader. "What's your business here? Don't block the road. Move on immediately."

The leader's biceps bulged with menace as he snarled, "This doesn't concern you. Back off!" His threatening stance made him appear particularly formidable.

Alexander stood firm. "I am not afraid even if there are more of you." He glanced quickly at Daniela and yelled, "Daniela, go! Get out of here!"

The leader's gaze darkened with murderous intent.

"Do you know each other?" he asked Daniela.

While seated in her car, Daniela responded coolly,"I don't know him."

Simultaneously,Alexander exclaimed, "How could I not? She's my ex-wife!"

Daniela shut her eyes.

Spotting the glint of a blade outside, she quickly exited the car.

But Alexander threw himself right into harm's way.

The leader paused, shocked by the blood now on his ownhand. He cursed angrily,′′Areyou out of your mind?"

Alexander, holding his abdomen and kneeling in pain, still tried to sound heroic. "Daniela, run!"

The leader looked at Alexander skeptically. "This isn't a movie."

Unable to tolerate more, he knocked Alexander out with a single punch.

The area finally calmed down.

"Do you want to feel the knife, or will you get in the car yourself?" the scar-faced man asked Daniela.

Daniela offered a slight smile. "I'Il get in, but first | need to speak to my driver."

The scar-faced man eyed Daniela's serene expression suspiciously.

Daniela leaned towards the driver and instructed, "Take the car to a car wash. Don't let the blood stain the seats."

The man sneered, "You might not even return, and you're worried about keeping the car clean?"

Remaining calm, Daniela said, "I'm a bit of a neat freak,so..."

She pushed the cold blade away from her neck. "Keep that away from me."

Her composed demeanor unsettled the scar-faced man.

He suspected she was plotting something.

Observing her frail appearance and doubting her capability to fight, he said, "Stop acting tough and get in."

Daniela got into the car without any protest.

As the vehicle began to move, a bloodstained hand grabbed the door."What are you doing?" Alexander demanded.

The scar-faced man frowned and was about to push him off when Daniela stated calmly,"|′dhurry if I were you. It looks like the traffic police are here."The vehicle had been stationary for too long, drawing attention.

Alexander reached for Daniela, but the scar-faced man took advantage of the moment to pull Alexander into the car.

"Don't worry! I've got this," Alexander said as he entered.

His words made everyone in the car laugh.

In contrast to Alexander, Daniela stayed calm.

They blindfolded her and drove off to an undisclosed location.

Midway through the journey, she spoke up, her voice firm yet polite. "Sorry, but this blindfold is too tight.Could you loosen it a bit?"
###Chapter 312 Someone Backing Daniela


Alexander felt like a coward next to Daniela.

He tried to emulate her calm and fell silent.

The car became quiet.

After another half hour, it stopped.

Alexander and Daniela were forced out. She complied and walked where they led her, while Alexander squirmed and kept asking, "Do you know who I am? Do you know who she is?"

Annoyed, the leader slapped Alexander, knocking him to the ground.

"Why bring both?" someone shouted from above.

An underling replied, "This guy kept talking, so we brought him. Claims he's a CEO, but he's nothing special.We'll dump him later."

"And her?"

"Boss, while you were away, Joyce couldn't clear her debt, so I brought her sister here."

The area fell silent fora long stretch.

Then someone opposite them, sounding shocked, asked, "What did you say? Who did you bring?"

"Joyce's sister, Daniela Harper, head of Elite Lux. She's very wealthy. Joyce said we could get billions if we kidnapped her."

The shock was met with a long silence.

Another added quickly, "Boss, I checked. Daniela is indeed wealthy, not simple at all."

No reply came from the other side. Soon,rapid footsteps approached.

The sound of dress shoes clicked against the floor.

"Boss, why come down here? It's just a woman.We-n

"Boss, what are you doing?"

The scat-faced man was stunned. Their usually stern boss now appeared compliant.

"Boss?"

"You fool! Didn't | tell you Joyce's debt are her own? Why involve innocent people?"

The scar-faced man looked confused. "But Joyce has no money. She helped us trap Daniela. Isn't that beneficial?"

Their boss shouted back, "No, it's not! Not at all! You fools almost caused a disaster. I'll deal with you later!"

After this, he turned to Daniela with a warm smile, bowed slightly, and said, "I'm very sorry."

Daniela kept her composure, her eyes twinkling as she looked at him. "Logan, you've been quite careless lately."

Logan Lee replied, "It wasn't intentional. These fools haven't harmed you, right?"

"NO,"Daniela said calmly.

Relieved, Logan exhaled. "I'm glad. Seeing you from afar, I was so startled I thought | was seeing things."

Daniela smirked slightly. "Oh, really? I half expected you to flee the moment you spotted me."

Logan touched his nose, acknowledging her point with an awkward smile.

After her release, Alexander was still not awake.

The goons loaded him into an ambulance. Daniela checked her phone to find that Logan had transferred a substantial apology fee, which brought a small smile to her face. One of Logan's men grumbled quietly, "Boss, we didn't even lay a hand on her, and we're suddenly dowr two hundred million?"

Logan watched Daniela's car pull away, his expression icy."Idiot. We nearly caused a huge issue. Daniela's supporters are not ones to mess with. We couldn't have disentangled from her without paying a steep price."

The man with the scar on his face tightened his grip in frustration.

# was all due to Joyce.

How else could they have squandered two hundred million?

This mess was Joyce's doing.

When Alexander later awoke in the hospital, he opened his eyes wide at the sight of Daniela sitting by his bed, absorbed in her phone.
###Chapter 313 You Want Me To Hit You


As soon as Alexander noticed Daniela, he sat up quickly. "Are you alright?"

Daniela, realizing he was awake,started to leave.

"Daniela!" Alexander called out. "Are you really going to just walk away?"

Daniela retorted, "What? Haven't you been beaten enough? You want me to stay and hit you?"

Pain flickered in Alexander's eyes. "After everything we've been through, can't you at least speak to me kindly?"

He believed he had intervened to protect her.

He thought she should be thankful, not harsh.

His heart ached, his spirits sank.

He felt his sincere efforts wvere completely ignored.

Daniela dismissed his feelings as ridiculous. "Just keep out of my affairs next time."

Alexander stared at Daniela in shock. "I saved you! Is this your thanks to someone who saved you?"

She continued walking without replying.

Suddenly, Alexander yelled, "Daniela, doesn't my risking my life for you deserve another chance? Am I inferior to Cedric?"

Daniela stopped briefly, then chuckled. "The audacity, comparing yourself to Cedric."

Alexander remained motionless. He was bewildered.

He knew Daniela was fiercely loyal to those she cared about. To others, she was indifferent. Yet, here she was, vehemently defending Cedric. This realization chilled Alexander. "What do you mean by that? What exactly is happening between you and Cedric that makes you defend him so passionately?"

Daniela didn't see the need to elaborate. Her relationship with Cedric was clear and uncomplicated.

However, due to Alexander's close relationship with Katrina, Daniela chose not to disclose details that might reach Katrina. It simply wasn't worth the risk.

"We're just friends," she remarked casually, looking down at her phone.

She was reading Cedric's message when footsteps approached.

Alexander quirked an eyebrow. "Cedric, did you hear that?" he exclaimed with evident glee, his eyebrows raised in amusement.

At that moment, Daniela understood that Alexander had tricked her.

"Really?" Alexander pretended to be disappointed, eyeing Daniela. "Just friends, huh?"

Seeing Cedric disappointed was a rare sight for Alexander, and he was visibly pleased by it.

Alexander's mood remained uplifted even after Daniela had gone.

He clung to hope as long as Daniela was not officially with Cedric.

They had never become a couple, leading him to believe they never would.

Alexander felt confident, considering his recent close encounter with Daniela during the kidnapping.

Reflecting on their shared ordeal, Alexander smiled and started browsing the trending news.

He scrolled but found no reports on their kidnapping.

Alexander's brow furrowed deeply in confusion.

This seemed incorrect.

Why was there no news? Shouldn't the police have caught those criminals by now?

With their level of influence, Alexander expected some media coverage.

He continued to search without success and eventually contacted a few media outlets.

They confirmed having no information on the matter.

Alexander's last memory was being punched by one kidnapper.

If Daniela had not informed the authorities, how had they escaped without issue?

What more did he not understand about her?

Meanwhile, Joyce was taken aback by Daniela's unharmed condition.

Even more troubling, Joyce had just received a menacing message from Flash, her debt collector,threatening to sell her if she failed to pay within five days.

The thought made Joyce shudder.

Katrina was groggy as she answered a call from her mother.

"Katrina, you're aware that Joyce has only five days to clear her debt, right?"

"Yes," Katrina responded, her brow furrowing.

"What are your thoughts? It's quite urgent. We're out of options. Remember that affluent man I told you earlier? What do you think about meeting him?"

Katrina hesitated, biting her lip. "Mom, could you possibly lend me some money instead?"

Silence lingered on the line,

"Mom, over the years, I've contributed a lot to you. Surely you have some savings left. I'm really in a bind and have no other options. Could you lend me a part of it? I promise to repay you once I'mn back on stable ground."

In a detached, terse tone, Erika responded, "I'Il see what's available, though it might not be much. Why must you be so stubborn? You have an opportunity with a good man now, yet you choose to stay with Caiden.
What do you gain from that?"

"I'm okay, Mom. I just need a little support," Katrina replied,maintaining a neutral tone.

The conversation concluded abruptly.

Joyce was nervously awaiting Katrina's decision to assist, only to receive a brief message instead.

"Joyce, your grandmother has agreed to lend you the money."

Infuriated by the disappointing outcome, Joyce threw her phone across the room, watching it smash into pieces.
###Chapter 314 Joyce, Are You Crazy


The argument between Joyce and Katrina had escalated to a level neither of them had ever reached before.

"You're really not going to help me? You're my mother! If I can't pay this debt, I'm finished. I'm your only daughter, and you still won't step in? Grandma doesn't have enough to lend, maybe a million at most. That's barely a drop in the ocean when it comes to the interest!" Joyce yelled.

Katrina's brow furrowed. "I'm doing everything I can to find a solution. But don't expect me to sell myself just to fix this!"

Joyce's temper flared, her words sharp and bitter."Why not? Whether it's Caiden or anyone else, it is the same!"

The slap that followed was sharp and resounding.

For a moment, Joyce stood frozen, stunned by the force of the strike.

Her hand pressed against the stinging skin, and Joyce glared at Katrina with cold fury. "Fine. If you won't help, I'll figure it out on my own."

With that, she stormed out of the room.

Katrina stood in the doorway, her eyes following Joyce as she stormed out. A deep, exhausted sigh escaped her lips.

Later that day,Katrina made the decision to leave the hospital.

Her plan was to approach Daniela once more.

But as Katrina faced Daniela, her words came out stiff.

"Daniela, if I divorce your father, what will you give me?"

Without looking up from her phone, Daniela replied, "Nothing. If you want out, you leave with nothing."The weight of her words sank in, and Katrina knew the conversation had come to a dead end.

With a bitter glance at Daniela, Katrina turned and made her way upstairs.

Days passed, and Joyce vanished without a trace.

In the wake of it all, Daniela's grip on the Harper family's wealth tightened, leaving Caiden with no influence,completely powerless.

Katrina's financial situation had hit rock bottom, her funds barely enough to keep her afloat.

Then, out of nowhere, a million dollars appeared in her bank account.

A sinking feeling twisted in Katrina's stomach as soon as she saw the deposit.

Without hesitation, she checked the details of the transfer.

As expected, Joyce's name was displayed on the screen, confirming her suspicion.

The message accompanying the transfer sent a clear message. "Repayment, with interest."

Katrina got it right away.

Joyce was severing all ties, cutting the last thread between them.

Frustration bubbled inside Katrina as she tried reaching out, but there was no clue where to begin.

In a moment of desperation, Katrina held Daniela back.

Daniela glanced at her coldly.′′SO1now you finally know what it feels liketo lose someone who matters,don't you?"

In that instant, a cold sensation swept through Katrina's chest. Her eyes flickered."Daniela, are you telling me you planned all of this?"

Daniela shook her head. "Joyce made her own choice."

Katrina didn't believe her. She asked Daniela, "Did you send Joyce away?" Daniela just smiled and stayed silent, the quiet saying more than words ever could.

Katrina's mind raced, flooded with countless theories about Joyce.

But in the end, they all fell apart in the face of truth.

At the banquet for Daniela's new company, Katrina mindlessly held a glass of wíne.

Without warning, a waiter appeared at the door, his voice respectful as he called out, "Mrs. Fairburne."

Katrina was about to turn when a group of women near her started whispering and giggling.

"She's really throwing her life away for money?"

"Did you notice how tightly she's wrapped? There are probably marks alI over her skin."

"Still, marrying Doug is no small feat. She must have some remarkable strategies."

"Doug is worth billions and spends without a care. In Olisvine, only Daniela could rival him."

"Quiet, she's coming this way."

In a perfectly timed chorus, the women around them all greeted her. "Mrs. Fairburne!"

"Hello, everyone,"

A voice, smooth and undeniably familiar, sliced through the air, carrying a hint of a husky tone.

Katrina's body tensed. With a stiff movement, she turned to face the source of the voice.

Three months had passed since Joyce had vanished without a trace. Now, she was Doug's wife.

The realization hit Katrina all at once.

After Joyce's disappearance, Erika had never once mentioned Doug's name to Katrina.

Even when Katrina offered Erika money, she'd dismiss it with a simple, "Keep it for yourself."

Initially, Katrina assumed her mother was upset with her. But soon, she found Erika had bought a luxury house.

The realization hit Katrina like a lightning bolt-Erika must have introduced another woman to that wealthy man.

At the time, Katrina hadn't even considered Joyce.

After all, Doug had pursued her first, and she never imagined Joyce would take such a drastic step.

A step so bold, even Katrina herself would never dare to take.

Katrina's body shook under the weight of the revelation. She approached Joyce and asked, "Joyce, have you lost your mind?"

Joyce met her gaze with an cold stare, unfazed by the harsh question.

The crowd around them parted like the Red Sea, creating a clear path for Joyce.

"Joyce, do you even realize what you're doing?"

Joyce gave Katrina a subtle smile, her confidence unshaken.′′∥Venever been more certain of what I want."

If degrading herself meant a lifetime of luxury and admiration, she would embrace the title of Mrs. Fairburne without hesitation.

This was the life she had chosen, and she was prepared to live it forever.
###Chapter 315 Hope You Won't Make Me Wait Too Long


Katrina couldn't contain her emotions any longer. She yanked Joyce outside, her temper flaring, "Joyce, do you really intend to embarrass me like this?"

Joyce's demeanor was unaffected. Her face showed no emotion, utterly impassive. "Mom, I pleaded with you, yet you declined. You prioritized your own desires, neglecting mine. I had no choice but to depend on myself. Was | wrong? The reason I'm here today is because of you. You're the one who should be reflecting on this."

Katrina felt herself teetering on the edge of sanity. Her eyes bore into Joyce with a frosty intensity.. "Leave Doug now! Return home, and you'Il still be my daughter."

"Being your daughter means little to me at this point. What matters is preserving my integrity," Joyce responded indifferently.

Katrina's eyes welled up with tears. "I put so much effort into raising you, and this is how you repay me?I promised I would find a way to help you."

In her sleek, designer dress, Joyce maintained her composure."Oh really? Your help involved letting someone attack me with a knife? You had an option but chose not to take it. I was forced to carve my own path.I stand by my actions."

Tears rolled down Katrina's cheeks.

Joyce, however, stayed unmoved. "I see, Mom. Everyone looks out for their own interests. I understand. You weren't willing to make sacrifices for me."

Katrina opened her mouth to respond, but Joyce cut her off."There's no need for further discussion.I've made my choice. I've never managed to make you proud. If you feel disgraced by me, then feel free to declare to the world that you don't have a daughter like me."

With these words, Joyce began to walk away. Katrina hugged herself tightly, shlvering as tears streamed down her face, watching Joyce's figure recode into the distance.

At that moment, she realized she was on the verge of losing the daughter she had cherished all her life.

Doug was well-known for his notorious sexual escapades. Despite Joyce's attendance at the event in a stunning gown, her attire revealed no skin.

The rationale was clear to all present.

Beneath the outward elegance lay a life filled with pain and sacrifice.

Upon Katrina's return home, she found Daniela already there.

Bathed in soft lighting, Daniela looked as radiant as ever.Cedric was there too, feeding her orange slices one by one.

Cedric murmured something quietly.

Daniela looked at him with a mix of surprise and curiosity, to which Cedric simply offered a reassuring smile.

The atmosphere in the living room was warm and intimate.

Katrina lingered at the doorway, paralyzed, untilthe numbness in her feet jolted her back to reality.

Her daughter was enduring hardship. Why was Brylee's daughter being doted on by Olisvine's most distinguished man?

How could Katrina not feel envious?

How could she not harbor resentment?

How could she not be seething with anger?

As Katrina's hands formed tight fists, Daniela seemed to finally notice her. Daniela glanced her way, her expression indifferent and almost dismissive.

After a brief moment, she turned her attention away, completely ignoring the rage in Katrina's eyes. Katrina was seething with anger. Her fists tightly clenched, she approached Daniela. "Is this your doing? Dld you orchestrate Joyce's marriage to Doug?"

Daniela reclined on the sofa, fixing Katrina with a cold stare.

In the past, when confronted with accusations like this, she would simply respond, "You're overthinking it."

However,today, when Katrina pressed her, Daniela chuckled briefly and asked, "What if I did?"

Her cold gaze slowly rose to meet Katrina's. "What are you going to do about it?"

For a moment, Katrina was at a loss for words.

She felt an urge to lunge forward and strike Daniela. Yet, as her hand lifted, Cedric intercepted it and pushed it away.

Katrina staggered and nearly toppled over.

Observing Daniela's composedexpression, Katrina understood that this was Daniela's retribution for Brylee.

"You're trying to destroy me and Joyce. Daniela,you venomous snake!"

Daniela kept her eyes on the television, her face remaining stoic and detached. She did not even glance at Katrina again.

Katrina boiled with rage, yet she was powerless to act. Cedric's presence barred her from getting any closer to Daniela.

"Very well, Daniela, just you wait!"

Daniela's smile was serene. "I've been waiting for this. Just don't keep me waiting too long."
###Chapter 316 | Can Help You


Before speaking with Daniela, Katrina had called Joyce, but the latter had refused to answer. Then, she had dialed Alexander's number.

As the phone rang and connected, she began to talk to Daniela.

As soon as Daniela left, Katrina turned to her phone, tears welling up. "Did you hear that, Alexander? Joyce was manipulated by Daniela. She didn't betray y/ou of her own will. It was all Daniela's doing. Can't you see the cruelty that lies beneath Daniela's pretty face?"

Katrina was convinced that Alexander might become Joyce's saving grace in the future.

If Joyce were to regret her actions, perhaps Alexander might feel some sympathy for her.

"Katrina, I have always shown you a basic level of respect, yet now I feel you're making a fool of me."

Katrina was taken aback. "Alexander, why would you think that? You just heard Daniela's confession. I'm not deceiving you."

"Really?" Alexander gave a sarcastic smile. "It seems you believe I'm completely naive."

Katrina's brow furrowed.

Alexander continued, "If Joyce was truly unwilling, nobody could have compelled her. Besides, during our marriage, she showed a clear interest in other rich men."

Katrina's heart missed a beat.

"I hadn't brought it up before because | didn't think it was important. Our connection never deepened.It wasn't Daniela causing issues; it was the marriage itself. We never should have entered into it."

Upon hearing this, Katrina quickly interjected, "How can you say that? Alexander, I know you don't mean it.You're just too angry." Alexander, however, refused to listen further. "I'm clear about my feelings."

Katrina frowned, understanding that sometimes silence was preferable, as speaking certain truths could irreversibly damage paths back.

This time, however, Alexander was unusually direct.

"During that fire, I saved Joyce instead of Daniela, so you all assumed I harbored feelings for Joyce. If that's what you think, I'd rather clarify things now instead of later."

Katrina attempted to interrupt him, but Alexander persisted bluntly, saying,"|′Vealways been unclear about my feelings, and now, I deeply regret that."

Alexander emphasized his regret. "Given another chance, I would've defended Daniela fiercely. But now,merely glimpsing her feels like a privilege."

A profound emptiness washed over Katrina.

She decided not to question whether Alexander's regrets stemmed from Daniela's newfound prominence or from a realization of his enduring affection for her.

She knew only one thing: the backup plan she had for Joyce was now gone.

Their call had concluded quite some time ago.

However,Katrina couldn't shake the sound of Alexander's final words echoing in her mind.11|should have told you earlier that I love Daniela. Regardless of her status today, my love remains unchanged. Even if she orchestrated my situation with Joyce, I am happy. So,please stop calling me."

The conversation ended right there.

Despair washed over Katrina as she looked around.

At that moment, all her strategies for Joyce were conclusively ruined.

When Daniela walked into the company the next morning, seeing Alexander there didn't surprise her.

Alexander was no fool; his success wasn't based on luck. He could sense something off in Daniela's behaviot.

"Katrina called me yesterday. You were aware, weren't you?

Daniela didn't attempt to hide it. "Yes, I kneve."

Alexander experienced a blend of sadness and a hint of happiness.

He was saddened because Daniela had shown him her more ruthless side, which wasn't typically exposed to someone cared about.

Yet, he felt a sense of happiness that Daniela chose to reveal this aspect to him.

Could this mean she trusted him, even slightly?

A small smile appeared on Alexander's face.

"I've warned you before about Katrina; she's dangerous. Desperate times lead to desperate measures. Why didn't you listen?"

His voice was questioning, yet his gentle tone carried more warmth than accusation, sounding almost tender.

Daniela's expression immediately contorted in disgust, as if she had just tasted something foul. She stepped back.

Her defensive stance saddened Alexander. "Daniela, I mnean no harm. I'm merely here to remind you. There are many ways to seek revenge, but you opted for the harshest one. Why choose such a path? You're the CEO of Elite Lux now. Your mother passed away long ago. Why allow someone from your past to spoil your promising future? You know there's more to life than vengeance. Think about the family and children you once dreamed of, or the hobbies that bring you joy. These could help you overcome your resentment.Daniela, perhaps you could give me a chance to help you let go of this hatred. You have to trust me now."
###Chapter 317 Do You Want To Dispel The Rumors


Alexander's sincere confession was heartfelt.

Unbeknownst to them, someone recorded the entire exchange on camera.

At that moment, Daniela was bathed in the morning sunlight.

She had never fully grasped the concept of love. She thought she liked Cedric, but couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was about him.

However, as she gazed at Alexander now, her understanding suddenly clicked into place.

She offered a smile, yet her eyes remained cold as she met Alexander's look. "I can't believe how blind I was before."

Alexander's confident expression wavered for a moment.

"Alexander, we're fundamentally different. You're fixated on power and wealth. To you, they are more important than any personal connection. When Katrina brought me to the rooftop, you were fully aware of what was unfolding. Yet, you were too frightened to intervene. You maintained your distance, feigning concern for me. You said all the right things but never left your comfort zone."

At her accusation, Alexander's sense of alarm intensified, and he started to desperately defend himself.

But Daniela stopped him with a raised hand, her tone steady. "I know what you're going to say, but I don't base my judgments on words alone. Actions are what count. Alexander, I don't wish to dwell on the past,and to be honest, I see no role for you in my future.Can we agree on that?"

Daniela sought someone who would be unwaveringly loyal, ready to face any ordeal alóngside her, not a slick deceiver who offered comforting words without genuine intent.

Alexander's hopes crumbled instantly.

He stood immobilized, his facade dismantled, his instinct was to refute everything. But how could he possibly deny it?

Overwhelmed, he struggled to maintain his poise, yet he remained silent.

Daniela had seen straight through him.

She saw his selfishness and his smooth, misleading words. He was like a man laid bare, his flaws completely exposed.

He was utterly humiliated.

As Alexander looked away, Daniela was already striding towards the Elite Lux building.

Her steps were decisive, never faltering or glancing back. Each step she took seemed to slice through his heart.

The footage of Alexander's heartfelt confession to Daniela quickly spread across the internet.

Cedric had just returned from a business trip and was en route to the Elite Lux building.

His secretary, who was sitting next to him, broached the subject of the trending video. "Mr. Phillips, there's a lot of talk online. Don't you want to see what it's about?"

It was a simple comment.

The secretary was aware that Cedric usually maintained a strong sense of self-assurance and typically disregarded online gossip or comments.

Phillips Group's public relations team was essentially just for show.

"Let me see it."

When those words echoed in the car, the secretay was momentarily stunned, and the driver was just as surprised.

Still in a state of shock, the secretary handed over the phone.

Cedric, bathed in the morning light and impeccably dressed, tilted his head with a dignified air as he began scrolling through his phone.

"Is Alexander trying to rekindle an old love?"

"Show some self-respect.Should this even be trending? It's disgusting for both Daniela and us."

"That's right! I've always said Cedric is the genuine article! I heard he and Daniela were old schoolmates.Maybe he knows something about their history!"

"l agree! They're always so low-key. There's barely any information about them. But whenever they're seen together, they seem like the perfect couple."

"Check this out, I was in their class! If you're curious about the details, just check my profile. P'll spill all the secrets!"

Cedric's eyes remained fixed on the last comment for an extended period.

The secretary observed Cedric and noted a gentle smile breaking across his usually stoic face.

It became apparent to the secretary that Cedric had started following a specific account.

The car had been stationary outside the Phillips Group building for some time now.

Cedric showed no signs of leaving the car while his employees gathered outside, wondering about their boss's unusual behavior today.

Every decision made by their boss, a man who dealt with millions every minute, was crucial for the company.

Consequently, all eyes were glued to the car door, anticipating its opening. Yet, it stayed shut.

"Mr. Phillips? We've arrived at the company." After spending thirty minutes exchanging looks with the driver,the secretary finally broke the silence.

Cedric, still engrossed in his phone, casually acknowledged with an"Okay."

He then passed the phone back to the secretary.

Upon reaching the elevator, Cedric instructed, "Send me that account's details." 
The secretary responded, "Okay, sir." While the reply was calm, curiosity stifl showed on the secretary's face.

As they neared the CEO's office in the elevator, the secretary, feeling a flush of curiosity, quietly asked, "Mr.Phillips, is what was posted on that account accurate?"

The secretary had only glimpsed at the account briefly.

That very account had shared many insider details, each garnering tens of thousands of shares. In just thirty minutes, comments had soared past a million.

The PR department, which had been inactive for some time, was on standby, ready to spring into action.They awaited Cedric's command to quash the rumors with decisive action and show that Phillips Group's PR was more than just a show.

The secretary viewed the PR director's message inquiring about the online rumors and asked Cedric,"D we need to address the online rumors?"

###Chapter 318 Popular Stories


The gentle chime of the elevator echoed.

Cedric stepped out, his voice calm. "There's no need to deal with the rumors."

The secretary gave a hesitant nod before asking, "Do you think Ms. Harper will be upset?"

The secretary was aware of how much Cedric cherished Daniela, but he wasn't sure where their relationship stood now.

Were they more than friends, or was it just a casual connection?

"No, she won't," Cedric responded, effortlessly interrupting the secretary's swirling thoughts.

Surprised, the secretary looked at Cedric, uncertain of what to make of his confidence.

Lately, he had noticed a remarkable shift in Cedric's manner.

Cedric, who once carefully weighed every move, now carried himself with a bold, new assurance without sacrificing his usual attention to detail.

The secretary couldn't help but wonder-were Cedric and Daniela together?

Despite his subtle attempts to probe Cedric, the secretary received no answers, a silence that typically hinted at a negative response.

Confusion tugged at the secretary's mind as he tried to make sense of it all.

The secretary paused, weighing his words carefully before asking, "Should I reach out to Elite Lux's public relations team to explore possible strategies so we're not caught off guard later?"

Cedric walked into his office. "Don't worry about it. Elite Lux won't be involved in this."

The secretary observed as Cedric settled into his chair, unlocked his phone, and began scrolling through Twitter. He quickly located the account of the person responsible for the leaks and followed it The secretary left Cedric's office and checked the post himself.

Just as he started reviewing it, a call interrupted his focus, and he quickly set his phone aside to attend a meeting.

By noon, after sifting through some documents, he approached Cedric again to gather his signatures.

Cedric scrolled through his phone in complete silence, lost in thought.

The secretary didn't rush him but stole a quick glance at Cedric's screen.

To his surprise, Cedric was still fixated on that post, undisturbed by the passing hours.

As the workday drew to a close, the secretary gently knocked on the office door and said, "Mr. Phillips, if there's nothing else, I'll be heading out."

Without lifting his gaze from his phone, Cedric instructed, "Reach out to the forum administrator about this account. Ensure it doesn't get banned."

The secretary nodded."Got it."

However, once outside, his curiosity got the better of him, and he checked his phone immediately.

To his surprise, the post had evolved into an entire fan fiction saga inspired by the rumors surrounding Cedric and Daniela.

Some of the scenes were undeniably provocative, enough to leave anyone blushing.

By the time ten o'clock rolled around, the secretary had caught up on the latest updates.

Now it made sense why Cedric had been so absorbed in his phone-he had been reading too.

Meanwhile, fresh news began to make the rounds.

This time, it was about Joyce and a man caught in a steamy hotel rendezvous. Late-night footage revealed Joyce pressed against the window, the man just behind her.

This scandal exploded online, gaining as much traction as Daniela's rejection of Alexander.

The screenshots from the footage spread like wildfire, quickly paired with the audio of Joyce's confession about setting fire to Daniela's wedding.

Before long, Olisvine was ablaze with gossip, as everyone echoed that Joyce had gotten exactly what she deserved.

Daniela arrived at the Harper family villa to find Katrina kneeling at the entrance.

When Daniela stepped out of the car, Katrina immediately surged forward, desperate in her voice. "Daniela,please, I beg you. Spare Joyce. I'm the one to blame. Everything is my fault!"

Coldness filled Daniela's eyes.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Cedric appeared from the car behind her.

Rather than approaching Daniela, he made his way to a large tree across the street.

There, he seized a man with a camera hanging around his neck and dragged him towards Daniela.

"Mr.Phillips..."

With a chilling look, Cedric's gaze froze the unlucky reporter in place. Meanwhile, the secretary, still seated in the car, sighed in sympathy for the man's misfortune.

"Which media outlet areyou from?" Cedric asked, his voice sharp, cold, and lacking any hint of compassion.

The reporter, sensing the danger, tried to escape, but Cedric caught him by the collar, holding him firmly in place.

Glimpsing the press badge pinned to the man's chest, Cedric turned to his secretary, who had just left the car. "Do you have the number for Blaze Media's head?"

###Chapter 319 | Listen To Her


The secretary handed Cedric the phone number.

Without hesitation, Cedric dialed it and said, "Maximus Hlewitt, you truly are one of a kind."

The reporter stood frozen, listening as his boss offered profuse apologies over the phone, his voice trembling as though he were on the verge of tears.

Although Cedric had released the reporter's collar, the man remained rooted to the spot, too terrified to move.

After the reporter took the phone from Cedric, his boss's voice shouted from the other end, "Kent Weaving,are you out of your mind? Didn't I make it clear toavoid any coverage involving Mr. Phillips? What on earth have you done?"

The reporter whispered, "I haven't taken any photos yet."

"If you had, it would be the end of me! Who told you to photograph him?"

In a low voice, the reporter replied, "Katrina Harper paid me a hundred thousand. She didn't say much. She just wanted some photos. Then, out of nowhere, she knelt down. Before I could even use my camera, Mr.Phillips appeared. Boss, I'm confused. Didn't you once say journalism sometimes requires unconventional methods?"

"Yes.Unconventional methods are necessary-but not if they lead straight into a trap!"

The reporter exhaled sharply. "Is the situation really that serious?"

"It most certainly is! Mr. Phillips is the major shareholder of our company. How can you not understand the gravity of this?"

The reporter's mind went blank.

Standing before Cedric, he stammered out an apology. "Mr. Phillips, I'm so sorry. I had no idea you were the major shareholder of our company. The offer was substantial, and I thought a few photos wouldn't be an issue."

Cedric's piercing stare cut through him.

Clutching his camera, the reporter bowed repeatedly before hurrying away.

Meanwhile,Katrina remained kneeling in front of Daniela. And Daniela made no effort to stop her.

Filled with frustration and anger, Katrina glared critically at the reporter.

She was still kneeling before Daniela. The scene was picture-perfect, and a single image could dominate the trending news about Joyce if it reached the internet.
/
But her hopes quickly crumbled.

As the reporter dashed away, Katrina's frustration boiled over.

Fuming, she got to her feet and shouted, "Hey! I paid you! You can't just leave!"

Her voice echoed, but it was too late. The reporter was already out of reach.

Stunned, Katrina froze in place.

Daniela, still seated, observed her with a cool detachment. Her eyes reflected a cold indifference, as though Katrina were no more than a passing nuisance.

Even after the reporter had disappeared, Katrina remained rooted to the spot.

Without a word, Daniela moved forward, brushing past Katrina with her shoulder, snapping her out of her daze.

Daniela continued on without hesitation, heading towards the garden-a place haunted by memories of her mother's tragic fall.

She knew Katrina was preparing for one last desperate move. But she felt no fear. Instead, an odd surge of excitement coursed through her. As Daniela sat in the living room, Cedric entered and said, "Katrina is desperate and on edge. She's bound to make a move soon. I'm arranging extra protection for you."

Daniela remained silent as he spoke.

Lillian stared at Cedric in surprise before turning to look at Daniela.

Daniela nodded. "Okay." Her tone was sweet and compliant.

Suddenly,Lillian began coughing harshly.

Daniela glanced at Lillian, who waved a hand dismissively. "It's nothing.I just heard a spooky story."

Cedric,indifferent to their interaction, frowned, grabbed his phone, and stepped outside.

Once at the door, he wasted no time making a call. "Logan, I need a team of mercenaries. Yes, only the top-tier bodyguards."

Lillian watched Cedric intently as he spoke near the doorway.

"Daniela,why not tell Cedric that you're..."

Before Lillian could finish her sentence, Daniela's attention shifted slightly, prompting Lillian to ask curiously,"Are you not going to tell him?"

Daniela replied calmly, "No. He worries too much about me. If he knew, it would probably keep him up at night."

After a moment of thought, Lillian nodded in agreement. "Indeed."

When Cedric came back, Daniela was absorbed in her phone.

He was about to speak when Katrina burst through the door with an icy demeanor. Without a word,she walked in and headed straight upstairs.

Daniela and Cedric had anticipated Katrina would take some action, but they were caught off guard when she once again proposed divorcing Caiden. Daniela Tound the sight of the divorce ägreement rattyer arnusing.

She never expected Katrina to be so terrified of dying.

The divorce agreement was placed in the fiving room. Caiden noticed & but only gave l a cursory glance before looking away.

Katrina, however, demanded he sign ft.

Pointing to Daniela, who was eating, Caiden said, "Talk to her. Whatever Daniela decides, Pl goālong with.lf she approves, I'H sign it."

Katrina's hatred for Caiden was evident. "I truly regret marrying you. Asshole!" she said, before lunging at him, her long nails slashing across his face.

Caiden was :not the type to stand by and take it.

He had long been dissatisfied with their situation and blamed Katrina for everything.

If not for her manipulations, he might have been content with Brylee forever.

Now, he realized that the freedom of living off others far outweighed the fear of growing old alone.

With that reflection,his regrets ran deep.

That day,his frustration erupted into unrestrained fury.
###Chapter 320 The Past That Should Be Forgotten


Caiden grabbed Katrina's hair and slapped her repeatedly, each blow ringing loudly through the living room.

The maid was paralyzed in shock, while Daniela stayed composed, not bothering to look up as she continued her meal.

Only when Katrina was left reeling and covered in blood did Caiden release her. He was breathing heavily.

Katrina crumpled to the floor, unable to say a word. Her shoulders shook as she glared at him through her messy hair, her eyes full of anger.

Caiden spat at her in disgust before turning and walking away.

The room returned to a heavy silence.

Trembling, Katrina struggled to lift herself, her face feeling numb. She knew she had to get to a hospital-her face was her livelihood.

Limping towards the door, she paused by the dining room for a moment, trying to steady herself. "Feeling satisfied now, are you?"

Daniela didn't even glance at Katrina and continued having her meal as if nothing had happened.

"Daniela Harper, don't get too confident. No one can claim victory until it's all over. Your mother thought she had it all under control, but she never saw her death coming. You're her daughter, so be careful-don't end up like her!" Katrina's eyes blazed with rage as she shot a hateful look at Daniela.

Daniela, unfazed, kept eating, a small smnile tugging at her lips. But this time, it wasn't her usual smile.It was a smile of genuine amusement, as though Katrina's words were nothing but laughable.

"What's so funny?" Daniela's voice was cold and almost mocking.

"I'm laughing at your foolishness. I don't know what the future holds, but one thing's certain.Everything you care about, and everyone who ever cared about you, has already walked away. Katrina, have you ever considered this?"

Katrina cast a harsh look at Daniela's side."W?"

"I have the power to destroy you, yet I haven't. Have you wondered why? There's a réason I've kept you around all this time. Aren't you curious?"

Katrina snapped back, "You just want to see me isolated, with no one left on my side. You're cruel, Daniela."

Daniela chuckled, shaking her head as she went back to eating without a care.

Under the bright lights, she seemed calm and unaffected, which only left Katrina feeling more confused.

The uncertainty gnawed at her, filling her with unease.

"Then why? What are you trying to say, Daniela? Why haven't you gotten rid of me yet?"

Katrina's heart raced with worry.

She kept her eyes on Daniela, throwing question after question, but Daniela said nothing.

Her silence only fueled Katrina's frustration and rage, intensifying like a fire out of control.

Ignoring her pain, Katrina staggered towards Daniela, her voice raspy with fury. "What are you planning?What do you want from me?"

But Daniela remained silent, not even bothering to acknowledge her.

Katrina was nearing her breaking point, but the brutal beating she'd endured was too much. As Daniela stood, Katrina's legs buckled, and she crumpled to the floor.

Struggling to push herself up, she found her body too weak to cooperate. On her knees, she managed to summon the last of her strength and, with a frustrated gasp, demanded, "Daniela! What are you plotting?"

Daniela gave Katrina a cold, mocking look as she stood over her. Without saying anything, she walked past Katrina and left without looking back.

Katrina found herself in the hospital shortly after. It didn't take long for the headlines to turn, exposing the real Katrina to the publíc.

A reporter appeared on camera, disclosing how Katrina had bribed him. He called on viewers to reject such corrupt actions and formally apologized to Daniela.

Katrina's reputation in Olisvine was left in tatters.

She knew she couldn't leave the Harper family without something to show for it in the divorce. Otherwise, all her years of effort would have been for nothing.

After lying in the hospital bed for what felt like an eternity in silence, Katrina finally dialed Alexander's number.

She realized how powerful Daniela truly was. Trying to fight back without a solid plan would only end in defeat.

She knew that the only way to succeed was to catch Daniela off guard and strike when she least expected it.

Her thoughts turned cold and calculating.

In the harsh light, her eyes looked even more ominous, full of dark schemes.

She reached for a spare phone and dialed a number she hadn't called in over ten years.

The voice on the other end of the line was thick with irritation."What do you want?"

Katrina's voice was low and threatening. "Daniela's targeting me. She knows about the truth behind Brylee's death. If you help me, I'll keep everything hidden. But if you refuse, I'll make sure every secret comes to light. Then we'll see if Daniela still wants you by her side."
###Chapter 321 The Car Exploded





The voice on the other end was low, its coldness cutting through the line. "Katrina, have you lost your mind? Why are you even mentioning that? So many years have passed!"


Katrina could feel herself slipping, as though her grip on the situation was slowly fading.


Perhaps,it had already slipped away entirely


"I don't want to bring it up either. But Daniela won't let me go. The one losing it now is her!"


Katrina knew reconciliation with Daniela was impossible, that much was clear.


Her decision had already been made-to leave the Harper family and divorce Caiden-but Daniela wasn't backing down.


Every move Daniela made had been carefully  "What's the worst that could happen? Does Daniela even have proof? These events happened ages ago.Why drag them up now? If I'm stuck in this mess,you'll be dragged down with me!"


"Do you think I want to talk about this?" Katrina's voice cracked as she stormed through the courtyard,her steps frantic. "But Daniela is relentless! Have you seen the latest about Joyce? She's pushed me to this point, and she won't stop. She wants nothing more than to destroy me. If you don't do something,I'll pull you down with me!"



Fury twisted Katrina's face, her teeth grinding together as her eyes burned with vengeful fire.


"You're the real fool here! And you think you can bring me down? If this goes wrong, I'll drag you and Joyce down with me! You had the poerfect hand,and you ruined it!"


Anger surged through Katrina, her body trembling with frustration. "Do whatever you need to do. But if l die, everything will come to light. And you-along with everyone else behind you-will fall with me!"


After those words, Katrina's gaze shifted. She froze,her breath catching for a split second.


Then, with the phone still pressed to her ear, she slowly lifted her gaze.


Across from her, a surveillance camera blinked steadily, its red light flashing ominously.


Katrina was shocked.


In a panic, she ended the call abruptly.


The following day, Daniela left for work.


Her driver, ever observant, broke the silence, his voice low. "We've got two groups tailing us."


Daniela leaned back in her seat, her expression casual."I understand."


The driver's eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, his voice calm as he said to Daniela, "There are now three groups tailing us." With a subtle turn of her head, Daniela's gaze shifted to assess the situation.



A flash of cold intent gleamed in her eyes,so fleeting that even the driver, sharp as he was, failed to catch it.


The car pulled up at Elite Lux. As Daniela stepped out, both Lillian and Ryan appeared from the building.


"Daniela!" Lillian greeted her, her eyes scanning the crowd of passersby. "Why would Katrina go this far?There are at least five groups tailing you!"


A realization settled in Daniela's mind, slowly taking shape. The pieces clicked together. "It's not Katrina.She doesn't have the reach for this."



Lillian glanced at Daniela with caution, "Then who's behind this?"



Daniela answered, "I don't know yet. But if we want to catch them, we need to be patient. They're too impatient. It's only a matter of time before they make their move."



Lillian gave a brief nod.


From that day forward, a strange series of events began unfolding around Daniela, each one more bizarre than the last.


There was a time when she was on her way to a cafe for a business meeting.



As she stepped out of the building, a vase toppled from the twentieth floor, shattering just inches from her.


The security team rushed upstairs without delay, but when they arrived, there was no sign of what had happened.


Later, on her way to work, her car's tire exploded,and within moments, both the steering wheel and brakes malfunctioned.



That evening, as she parked after work, a fleeting figure darted past her, barely visible in the shadows. Lillian had been keeping an especially close watch on Daniela in recent days.


She couldn't help but comment, "They're not holding back. These must be top-tier mercenaries. If they keep failing, they'll escalate to more drastic tactics soon."


However,Daniela remained unruffled, her voice calm as she responded, "Let them try."


The relentless string of incidents surrounding Daniela had escalated to a point where even Cedric couldn't ignore them any longer.


"It's nothing," Daniela murmured gently, her head resting on Cedric's chest that evening. "Lillian's by my side."


"But she was hurt today, and both of you are women.How can you handle this?"


Cedric's hands trembled as the memory of the harrowing event replayed in his mind.


The car, out of contro, veered recklessly on the overpass, its tires spinning wildly until the front slammed into the guardrail, finally bringing it to a stop.


Lillian's hand was injured.


With no hesitation, Daniela, Lilian and the driver scrambled out of the car. Barely a minute later, the vehicle erupted in an explosion.


From a distance, Cedric watched in horror, his legs giving way as he staggered out of his car.
###Chapter 322 Accident




Nothing terrified Cedric more than the idea of something happening to Daniela. The mere thought gripped him with unease.


He couldn't fathom why Daniela remained so poised,even knowing Katrina had caused Brylee's death.


It was as if she were a predator, patient and calculating, toying with Katrina while staying in complete control.


At that moment, another thought crossed Cedric's mind.


Someone else must be pulling the strings behind Katrina, and Daniela had already figured it out. That was why she hadn't acted yet.


It felt like a high-stakes game, with Daniela slowly cornering her opponent, waiting for them to expose their next move. Cedric had assumed Daniela would be shaken.


Instead, she called the police and sent Lillian to the hospital, her composure unshaken.


This only deepened Cedric's confusion.


Business was Daniela's arena, but corporate battles couldn't compare to the raw intensity of real-life threats.



So why was she so unshaken?


As they drove back, Cedric couldn't help but steal a glance at Daniela.


Feeling his eyes on her, Daniela turned to him."What's going on?"


Cedric asked, "Are you scared?"


Confusion flickered across Daniela's face. "Scared of what?"


After a brief pause, Cedric pressed on, saying, "The explosion. When the car blew up, didn't that scare you?" At his question, Daniela's lips curved into a gentle smile."No."



"Not scared? Or is this just something you've dealt with before?" Cedric asked bluntly.


Shaking her head, Daniela shrugged nonchalantly."Nope. I'm just a businesswoman. I don't get mixed up in stuff like that. I was just too slow to react.I suppose I'm a bit detached from situations like these."



Cedric's gaze lingered on Daniela for a moment before he shifted his focus back to the road.


He had the urge to ask her if there were secrets she hadn't shared with him, beyond being the CEO of Elite Lux and an accomplished businesswoman.


But as soon as the thought crossed his mind, he realized he hadn't revealed everything to her either.


It didn't bother him, though. They had all the time in the world to truly understand one another.


Once Cedric headed for the shower, Daniela made her way downstairs to the living room. Lillian,her gaze flickering toward the stairs, asked, "Aren't you going to tell him?"


Daniela shook her head. "I'll tell him eventually. Not now, though. The situation is still too murky. If I share it with him now, all I'll do is add to his anxiety. Let's focus on solving the problem first."


A look of admiration flashed in Lillian's eyes as she gazed at Daniela. "You've really evolved, Daniela.There was a time when you said if a man couldn't handle your identity, he wasn't worthy of you. Are you worried Cedric will be intimidated by you?"


With a quiet sigh, Daniela replied, "What I fear is not his fear of me, but my inability to protect him."


Exposing the enemy often meant making hard sacrifices. She had no intention of involving Cedric in the chaos, and she certainly didIn't want him to be hurt in any way.


"Work with Ryan. Grant Phillips Group the airline agency rights. That will keep Cedric busy. By the time a month passes, I'll have everything in place on my side."


Lillian nodded, acknowledging the plan."Understood."




When Daniela entered the bedroom, Cedric was already out of the bathroom.


The hum of the hairdryer filled the silence.


Cedric, still facing away from Daniela, broke the quiet after a long pause. "I've told you before.Everything can be negotiated, but your safety isn't up for debate."



It was clear to Daniela that Cedric had sensed something was off.


She wasn't ready to discuss it yet, so instead,she pressed her soft form against his back, seeking comfort.
###Chapter 323 You've Been Quite Engrossed Online Lately
The room was filled with the sound of their heavy breaths, growing more frantic with each passing moment.



As they reached the climax, Cedric stopped suddenly.


Daniela blinked, confused and flushed, and whispered, "What's wrong?"


Cedric looked at Daniela lying beneath him. She looked like an angel. Her long hair spread out like a waterfall, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.


"Are you hiding something from me?" Cedric asked,each word sharp as he moved.


Daniela fought back tears from the physical strain.


She answered his questions, none too important, but  always dodged the ones that mattered.


Cedric stared at her, who was biting her lip, and felt his resolve beginto crumble.


With a sigh, he decided to shift the conversation.


As the night stretched on, Cedric wrapped his arms around Daniela, the weight of sleep tugging at him.Before drifting off, he whispered near her ear,"You know what you're doing. I've already made myself clear. Your safety always comes first. You're playing with fire, and the thought of it, the worry it brings me,it cuts deep."


The following morning, as Cedric made his way to work, his secretary burst in with enthusiasm, saying,"You won't believe it! The world's largest airline wants to form a partnership with us!"


The offer was something they'd dreamed of for years but had been out of reach.


Phillips Group had tried time and again, but obstacles had always stood in their way. Now, the opportunity had come to them, and there was no denying the excitement it stirred.


The secretary could hardly contain his excitement,almost giddy with the news.


The airline's reputation was unmatched worldwide,with dominance in the industry that was nearly unmatched.


If Phillips Group secured the partnership, they could rest easy for decades.


With a serene smile, Cedric remained unfazed. The secretary grinned and said, "Congratulations!"


Cedric's eyes flicked over his phone, his expression a mask of indifference. "And what did they have to say?"


"Not much, but they did emphasize how much they admire Phillips Group's reputation. If we're on board,they want to seal the deal within a month."


Cedric paused, his thumb stilling on the screen. "A month?" "Yeah. That's what they said. I was a bit taken aback by the timeline, but they insist their company moves quickly and decisively."


The secretary, confused by Cedric's lack of enthusiasm, couldn't help but wonder why he wasn't more excited. After all, this was a major opportunity.


Breaking the silence, Cedric gave a directive, saying,"I want a full report on this company."


The secretary blinked, taken off guard. "A multinational company like that? You really think we need to investigate them?"


Given the company's size and global reach, it would take considerable time and effort to dig through their layers.


Cedric caught the slight hesitation in his secretary's expression and said, "Look into any connections with Elite Lux."



The secretary nodded, now clear on the direction.


Cedric never liked to lean on others for business advantages. He wasn't interested in pursuing deals linked to Daniela.



With that understanding, the secretary quickly began his investigation. Half an hour later, he returned with an update. "This company has no connection to Elite Lux."



Cedric's gaze turned sharp, his curiosity piqued."And what about Daniela?"



The secretary's confusion grew as he replied, "No connection there either." He couldn't understand the shift in Cedric's focus. Had Cedric been reading too many gossip-filled online novels about him and Daniela? What else could explain such a bold assumption?



The secretary knew Elite Lux had a stake in aviation,but it was a side project, not their primary business-a detail Cedric had already long understood.


After a thoughtful pause, the secretary asked, "Are you suspecting something here?" "Not exactly," Cedric replied dismissively as he picked up his phone, opening one of those serialized novels about him and Daniela. "Inform them we're not moving forward with this partnershipo for the time being."


The secretary's phone hit the floor with a sharp clatter. His jaw dropped, wide enough for a fly to swoop in. "What?" It took several seconds before he could form words. "Sorry, but could you repeat that?I didn't quite catch it."


The truth was, he heard it loud and clear but couldn't bring himself to believe it.


Why in the world would Cedric let such an opportunity slip through his fingers?


He studied Cedric's unruffled face and then his eyes,which remained glued to the phone. It dawned on the secretary that Cedric's obsession with online distractions might be getting out of hand.


As he delivered pastries to Daniela, the secretary couldn't help but vent, saying, "Cedric hasn't been able to look away from his phone for days. He even turned down a massive deal because of it."


Daniela and Lillian already knew about Phillips Group's decision to decline the partnership.


They shared a look.


With a hint of concern, Daniela asked, "Is he really addicted to the internet?"



She hadn't realized Cedric had developed such a habit at home.



"True," the secretary complained, remembering the huge business opportunity. The whole company was gearing up, with some departments already preparing data, only for Cedric to dismiss the collaboration. "The entire Phillips Group is in chaos.Everyone's talking, wondering why the CEO would reject such a significant deal. Is there something changing within the company?"


As he walked away, the secretary turned back with one last plea to Daniela. "Please, talk to him. Convince him not to let distractions derail his focus.I've already reached out to the airline company and asked them to hold off, hoping there's still a chance.Cedric listens to you. Help us bring him back."


His face held an expression of sincere sorrow as if the weight of the loss crushed him.


Cedric's secretary's connection with Daniela went back years; they had been classmates.



The shift in their tone made the conversation feel more genuine and relaxed.


It was evident that his concern was real.


Later that evening, Cedric arrived to pick up Daniela from work. After a series of unforeseen events,they finally made their way back home.


As they stepped inside, Daniela said, "I heard you've been pretty wrapped up in the online world lately?"


The moment she spoke, Cedric's head snapped up."What did you say?" "Why are you turning down the offer from Dreamfly Airlines?"


"Did my secretary tell you about that?"


Daniela glanced at Cedric. "He didn't say what you're so focused on."


As she spoke, Daniela noticed Cedric's neck turning red.
###Chapter 324 Not Fighting Back





Daniela was taken aback.


It had been ages since Cedric blushed like that, a rarity compared to when they first started seeing each other.



"What kind of naughty things have you been browsing online?" she teased.


Cedric looked away at her words, making Daniela laugh.


She didn't think much of it, assuming it was just a typical curiosity for a young man. She wasn't one to demand that Cedric had no secrets, so she simply smiled and let it pass.


"Is it just an internet obsession that's keeping you from Dreamfly Airlines?" she asked.


"I'm not ready," Cedric replied. Daniela glanced at him and laughed again.


Cedric was a master in business. Did he really need more time to prepare?


Still, Daniela didn't push him further. She had her own ways to make sure Cedric would eventually accept the partnership.


The next day, as soon as Cedric stepped into the office, his secretary was already waiting for him.


"Good morning, Mr. Phillips. Cutler Stout is waiting for you."


Cedric looked at the secretary, surprised. "Cutler?"He picked up his pace.


"Yes, he's been waiting for you for over an hour."


Cutler Stout wasn't just anyone. He had been Cedric's middle school teacher, the one who pulled him out of his rebellious phase.


Even through high school, Cutler remained a steady influence, guiding Cedric like a father. People often said Cutler had always treated Cedric as his own flesh and blood.


When Cedric reached the top of the stairs, he found Cutler waiting at the door with a smile.


Now in his fifties, Cutler had long since left teaching behind. His expertise in aeronautics had brought him success, making him a respected figure in the field.


When he saw Cedric, he approached him cheerfully.


"Cedric, I just landed a huge contract, and you were the first person who came to mind. You know Dreamfly Airlines, right?"


Cedric's secretary felt a twinge of regret. That golden chance was supposed to go to Phillips Group.


"I've signed a major deal with them, but we still have some details to work out. I'd love to partner with you on this. They've already given us the advance, and if we play our cards right, we could see a fantastic profit. What do you think?" Cutler's eyes lit up with excitement. Times had been tough economically, and everyone was anxious.


Landing such a large order could ease their worries for the next ten years.


Cutler spoke with a beaming smile and bright eyes.


Cedric realized he could've easily found someone else for this job-someone who might have been easier to work with and could bring in more cash.But he was the first person that Cutler had approached.


Cedric could see that Cutler really wanted to help him succeed.



"What's up?" Cutler asked after noticing Cedric's silence. "Do you have any worries?"


Of course, Cedric did have worries.


He wasn't naive; passing on such a golden opportunity was tough.


However, he couldn't shake the feeling that Dreamfly Airlines might somehow be linked to Daniela. He had no proof, just a gut feeling.


With all the chaos surrounding her lately, he couldn't help but feel anxious.


"No. It's just that Phillips Group has been really busy.Maybe you should look for someone else."


"Too busy for what?" Cutler asked, a look of confusion crossing his face. "You run a business, but you're fretting over having too much on your plate?Hang on a second. Do you honestly believe | would ever harm you?"


Cedric quickly responded, "Not at all! It's just that I've got so much on my plate right now."


Cutler remained skeptical. "You're the CEO! All you need to do is make decisions. How can you be too busy? What exactly are you referring to? Don't you have a team to delegate tasks? I won't argue this point with you. You'd be out of your mind not toseize this chance. That's it. If you're too swamped, have someone else reach out to me. I'll leave the contract here. If you stiIl see me as your mentor, don't waste any more time talking."


With that, Cutler confidently left the office.


The secretary walked in, scanned the contract, and couldn't help but comment, "After all these years, it's clear that Cutler still has your best interests at heart.Just look at that amazing profit-sharing deal. I'm not sure anyone else in Olisvine could top that."


Cedric was well aware of that reputation. Still, his thoughts were clouded by concerns for Daniela.


This anxiety was persistent, gnawing at him no matter how hard he tried to shake it off.



"You haven't truly experienced love yet. Once you meet that special someone, everything will make sense," Cedric said.


The secretary immediately countered with a shake of his head. "I'd prefer to pass on that experience,"


Becoming someone he barely recognized was the last thing he desired. Ultimately, Cedric affixed his signature to the contract, but he stripped away most of the obligations, retaining only the consulting role.Symbolically, he marked the contract amount at just a single dollar.


Cedric kept up his daily routine of driving Daniela to and from work.



Daniela hadn't mentioned the string of strange and dangerous incidents that had become a regular part of her workday.


One day, a sniper's bullet shattered the floor-to-ceiling windows of the office while she was inside.


Another time, the water dispenser sparked with electricity just as she bent down for a drink.


During a meeting, the projection screen came crashing down without warning.


And the list went on.



A relentless series of hazards. Lillian, lounging in the CEO's office with her games,looked up and said, "Daniela, you've got nerves of steel. Aren't you going to do something about all this?"
###Chapter 325 Regret





A dangerous glint sparked in Daniela's gaze. "Yes."


Later that evening, she stepped into the house to find Cedric in the living room.


He kept his eyes down, his face unreadable.


Only when they found themselves in the bedroom did Cedric pull Daniela close and say, "I'll be away for a two-day business trip."


Daniela smirked. "Then go."


"But I'm worried."



"Worried about what?"


Cedric stayed silent, choosing to be intimate with Daniela all night. He didn't stop until his secretary called.



Their time together spanned ten passionate hours. 
After a lingering kiss to say goodbye, Cedric left the house.


Exhausted, Daniela slept for a full day and night.


She couldn't shake the feeling that Cedric's goal was to wear her out completely, so that she wouldn't go out.


When she finally regained her bearings, Daniela made her way downstairs.


With a mischievous grin, Lillian commented,"Daniela, is Cedric so worried about you going out on your own that he did this?"


Daniela paused, closing her eyes for a moment.


Was it really that obvious? Did Cedric's concern show so plainly to everyone around her?


Later, she went to work. On her way downstairs, she crossed paths with Alexander.


It wasn't exactly a coincidence.


Alexander had come to see Daniela. After pausing for a while, he approached, clearly hoping to exchange a few words with her.


But as his eyes caught the scarf around her neck,he couldn't ignore the red mark hidden just behind her ear.


A sharp twinge seized Alexander's chest.


Without thinking, he stepped in front of Daniela,blocking her path.


"You..." Alexander began, his voice heavy with emotions that swirled in his dark eyes.


The words caught in his throat, leaving him unsure of what to say next.


It felt as though someone had carved out a piece of his soul, leaving an aching void.


What was the point of regret now?


At that moment, he couldn't help but think he had been utterly foolish.


Divorcing Daniela had been his greatest mistake. He had already confessed his remorse.


But even with that admission, why did it feel like a second chance was forever out of reach?


Alexander felt as though a blade had pierced straight through his chest.


Tears threatened to spill from his reddened eyes.


"Daniela..." he whispered after what felt like an eternity, his voice trembling. "Could you wait for me just a little longer?"


Daniela's expression didn't waver. She didn't even bother to respond.


To her, love that arrived too late was worthless.


And truthfully, Alexander had never held her heart.


Silently, Daniela stepped around him and walked away, leaving him frozen in place.


Alexander stood there, watching her disappear into the distance. A cold, hollow despair seeped into him,numbing everything else. "You might not know, but Daniela is with Cedric now.Yesterday, when he was supposed to leave for a business trip, they stayed locked in their bedroom all day and night. She only came downstairs today. I'm sure you can guess what they wNere doing." Katrina appeared unexpectedly, a sly smirk tugging at her lips.


"They're already living together?"


A low, amused laugh escaped Katrina. "Well, of course. I've always thought their relationship seemed a little too comfortable. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they're married by now."


"That's not possible," Alexander said, his denial almost frantic. "Daniela isn't the type to act on impulse like that."


Deep down, Alexander clung to the selfish belief that any moment of weakness Daniela had should be reserved for him alone, not shared with another man.He refused to let that happen.


Watching Alexander's struggle unfold, Katrina gave a slow, almost sinister smile. With a mocking sigh, she added with false sympathy, "Honestly, Cedric can't hold a candle to you."


Katrina's words were so fake that after thinking for a long time, she couldn't come up with a single reason Cedric was any less than Alexander.


After a brief pause, she said gently, "You and Daniela share years of history. Back when she was chasing after you, Cedric was just a classmate. She picked you. It's just that somewhere along the way, things fell apart. Now, her focus is elsewhere. Still, I always thought it was a shame. Back then, she hid her true identity from you. But now, living with Cedric, she's openly the CEO of Elite Lux. You never got to experience her best."


The weight of her words made Alexander realize his emotions had slipped out of control. Quickly regaining his composure, he replied coldly, "There's no need for these insinuations."


"You misunderstand me," Katrina said smoothly, her voice laced with feigned innocence. "What wouldI gain by doing that? I'm genuinely speaking out of concern. That's all."


Turning slightly, Alexander gave Katrina a skeptical look. "What are you trying to say?"


"If you want to live under the same roof as Daniela, I know a way."


Suspicion flickered in Alexander's gaze, but he didn't outright reject Katrina.


Katrina smiled knowingly. "Stay at my place for now.I'll tell everyone I'm introducing you to my niece. That way, you'll have an excuse to stay close."①


Alexander's expression didn't soften. He wasn't so easily swayed. "What's the catch?"


"I want the Harper family's villa."


Alexander took a moment to consider, then nodded."Alright, it's a deal."


A satisfied smile played on Katrina's lips as she continued, "Pack your things and move in. Cedric's not home today, so it's the perfect time. Oh, and just a little tip: don't always wear that serious expression.Girls these days aren't into that. You've got to soften up and show some care. Daniela's got her own wealth now; don't expect her to pamper you as she did before."


Alexander didn't say a word, but he understood exactly what she meant.


Daniela had changed into someone entirely different,someone with influence and a solid foundation behind her.


Even though she had once been married, her newfound status had only elevated her alure.


How could Alexander afford to be careless now?


That afternoon, he moved back into the Harper family's residence.


But this time, Daniela wasn't there to welcome him.


She watched with a cold stare as Alexander carried in his luggage, her face set in a frown.
###Chapter 326 Leave Or I'll Have Someone To Escort You Out
"Do you really think you can just stroll in here as if it's some kind of hotel?" Daniela asked coldly.


Caiden stood by, watching the scene unfold with a hint of amusement on his face.



Alexander hadn't expected Daniela to say that.He began to explain gently, "Katrina told me she's been feeling unwell and doesn't have anyone to look after her. She was hoping I could stay for a few days to help. You don't mind,right?"


Once he finished speaking, Alexander picked up his luggage and started walking inside.


However, Daniela retorted, "Actually, I do mind."


Alexander froze for a moment, staring at Daniela in disbelief."What did you say?" The Harper family's villa, once owned by Brylee at the height of her wealth, stood as one of the most luxurious properties around.


With more than 30 guest rooms, there was pleny of space for Alexander to settle in.


Alexander never imagined Daniela would turn him away, not even offering him a single room.


"I said I mind," Daniela repeated, her voice steady and firm. "This is my home, and you have no right to stay here."


Katrina was about to speak, but Daniela interrupted her. "Just because I've been quiet doesn't mean Katrina gets to call the shots here. Got it? I don't agree,so you can't stay."


Katrina bit her bottom lip, a touch of embarrassment crossing her face. "Daniela, don't be so bossy. It's just for a few days. Plus, we all know each other. So,why make it harder for him? What did I do wrong?Tell me, and I'll fix it. Just don't make things difficult for Alexander,alright?"  At that, Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "Fine."


Katrina was momentarily surprised, and then a smile spread across her face. "Alright. I'll let Alexander-"


Before Katrina could finish, Daniela continued, "I told you before. If you don't behave, there's no place for you in the villa. Do you remember?"


Under Daniela's indifferent gaze, Katrina felt a surge of anxiety wash over her. She muttered, "How can you be like this? I didn't mean anything by it. I've already made that clear."


Daniela picked up her phone to call the moving department of Elite Lux. "Send a team over."


After hanging up, she returned to watching TV,completely ignoring the situation.


Thinking the matter was settled, Katrina told Alexander to head to the guest room.


Not long after, nearly 100 people arrived, beginning to move Katrina's and Caiden's belongings out of the house and into a small shed nearby. Daniela! You're taking this too far!" Katrina exclaimed.


Daniela's gaze stayed icy as she replied, "I can make things even harder for you. Want to test me?"


Katrina was stunned for a moment, then gritted her teeth. "I'm not moving out of this house."


Daniela said nothing, her silence heavy in the air.


Whether Katrina stayed or left was never a decision she had the right to make.


The leader of the moving staff approached Daniela and reported, "Ms. Harper, the move is complete."


Katrina didn't have many personal belongings, and the shed provided barely enough room for them. The task was finished quickly, thanks to the large group of movers.



Daniela pointed at Katrina with obvious hatred and instructed the leader, "Take her away. Make sure to station security at the front door. Don't let anyone in without permission." Events unfolded with such speed that Caiden found himself unable to respond before it was all said and done.


Frustrated, he shouted, "Daniela, this has nothing to do with me. You're taking it out on the wrong person."


Daniela ignored him, her attention staying fixed on the TV.


That night, the villa was enveloped in silence.


Daniela glanced at Alexander, who stood motionless at the door.


Her gaze returned to the TV, and she asked coolly,"Will you be leaving on your own, or should I have someone escort you out?"
###Chapter 327 A Joke




Alexander had never anticipated the icy chill in Daniela's demeanor towards him.



He was in a daze for a long time, his expression vacant.


Even as he walked out of the villa, he still hadn't come to his senses.


It wasn't until someone suddenly gave him a hard pull that he snapped back to reality.


It was Katrina, her face etched with indignation, her voice a fiery burst of anger. "Daniela's a fucking monster. There's no line she won't cross!"


Feeling a pang of heartache, Alexander struggled to compose himself.


His thoughts were too scattered to entertain Katrina's grievances, and just as he turned to leave, she stepped in, cutting him off. "If you walk away now, you're sealing your fate."


Alexander built his life on pride, but today, he felt the bitter sting of humiliation as if someone had torn it from him. "Why should I even bother staying? She's made it clear she wants nothing to do with me."



Katrina offered a thin, almost mocking smile. "So that's it? You're just giving up? Remember how Daniela fought for you once? Where's your resolve now? Think it over. If you go now, there's no coming back-this is the end for you and Daniela."



A bitter taste filled his mouth, but the memory of Daniela's unwavering support despite his silent treatment sparked a flicker of warmth in his weary heart. "What do you suggest I do?"


Katrina's eyes glinted with a mix of resolve and strategy."There's a guest wing near the villa, with five vacant rooms. Stay there with us. It's a start."


Without hesitation, Alexander nodded. "Fine." Katrina tilted her head slightly and insisted, "You need to be more patient. Otherwise, why would she be drawn to you? Besides, you were in the wrong before. Swallowing a bit of pride won't kill you."


Alexander turned away, his gaze drifting towards the brightly-lit villa in the distance.


A determined spark flickered in his eyes as he silently vowed that one day, Daniela would personally invite him to take his place there.


When Cedric returned, his first encounter was with Alexander.


"Cedric, what's the deal between you and Daniela now?"


Alexander's heart thudded faintly, haunted by the nagging fear that they might already be married,and he needed to confirm his suspicions.


"Why are you here?" Cedric asked instead of answering his question.


The directness of his question threw Alexander off balance. He remembered a time when Cedric never had the confidence he was showing now. This newfound assertiveness, as if he had already claimed both Daniela and the villa as his own, unnerved Alexander.



"Are you two dating?" Alexander asked. "Or are you just..."


Before he could get another word in, Daniela pushed open the door and stepped outside.


She glanced at the two men standing side by side,her eyebrow arching inquisitively. "I've got to go to work. Now that you're back, why don't you rest for a bit?"



Cedric had returned after cramming two days' worth of work into just a day and a half.


He simply nodded, watching as Daniela strode towards the parking lot, her steps in sync with Lillian's.


The moment Cedric stepped back into the villa, Alexander bolted outside, chasing after Daniela's fading presence.


Alexander only managed to catch up with Daniela once she had already arrived at the company.


"Daniela, Cedric already told me about everything,"he declared, blocking her path.


Daniela eyed him with a blend of fatigue and indifference. "If you find yourself with this much free time, perhaps you should invest it in your own company's affairs."


Alexander locked eyes with her, his gaze sharp and unwavering. "Cedric told me you two are just that kind of relationship."


Her expression unchanging, Daniela responded evenly, "And what kind would that be?"


"You two are merely sexual partners."


A soft chuckle escaped her. "Well, if that's what he's told you, then I suppose you have your answer." As she spoke, Alexander's mind scrambled to weave this new information into his narrative of her-Daniela, ever the romantic obsessive.


Once, she had been hopelessly entangled with him;now, it seemed, she was in love with Cedric.


Comforted by this thought, his initial worries began to dissolve.


"Daniela, I understand you're a mature woman now,but such fleeting relationships seldom last. Marriage offers more stability."


Daniela eyed Alexander with incredulity, her gaze sharp as if sizing up a man who'd lost his sense.


Alexander, always keen to assume the role of the wise mentor, now basked in a newfound sense of superiority, knowing Daniela had unfulfilled desires.


With a grandiose flourish, he posed a question,draped in an air of generosity. "Have you ever considered that perhaps I might be a better fit for you than Cedric?" Amused by his audacity, Daniela quirked an eyebrow."A better fit for what, exactly?"


Frustration flickered across Alexander's face, his patience fraying as he mistakenly thought Daniela was feigning ignorance. "For an intimate relationship.I believe I'm far more suited for you than Cedric.We'd be remarkably compatible."


Daniela's response was a sarcastic sneer, her amusement turning to disdain. "Let me get this straight-you just trashed this kind of relationship,and now you're eagerly signing up for it? Are you always this full of shit?"


At her sharp words, Alexander's cheeks flushed a bright red. "Yes, but that doesn't apply to me.Daniela, we've been in each other's lives for what feels like forever. You know the kind of man I am.l would never harm you or use you for my own gains.Moreover, entering into this kind of relationship could be our stepping stone to something more permanent, like marriage."


He straightened, his voice taking on a tone of benevolence. "And let's not forget, I'm willing to overlook your past with Cedric. But should we move forward together, I expect you to show the same integrity and not entertain his advances anymore."


Daniela's laughter echoed in the crisp morning air,unrestrained and clear. "Hearing you talk like this-it's almost like listening to a comedian at work."
###Chapter 328 He'd Have Nothing Without Daniela
Alexander's face went blank, his expression completely frozen.


Daniela's voice broke the silence. "Old habits are hard to shake, aren't they?"


Alexander's brows furrowed, and he opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela cut him off before he could say anything. "Do you have any idea what you look like right now? Like one of those arrogant people who think the world owes them something.You carry yourself as if you're untouchable,expecting everyone to grovel just to catch your attention. You think you won't hurt me? There are plenty of couples who stay together even when they're distant, but we couldn't even last that long.We were divorced after just one day of marriage,which proves you were never the right choice. And honestly, how could you even compare to Cedric?"


It felt like Alexander had walked into a dream, only to be ripped from it and slapped awake in the most brutal way. His went as white as a sheet.


"Do you really believe you can compete with Cedric?" Daniela's patience had clearly run thin.Though her voice remained calmn, her words hit with brutal precision. "To me, you don't even measure up to a fraction of him. Just thinking about you disgusts me."



With that, she didn't spare him another look. She spun around and walked into Elite Lux.


Alexander remained where he was, a cold emptiness settling deep in his chest.


Daniela had always been poised and polite, yet she had said his very presence repulsed her. The words hit Alexander like a blow, leaving him shattered.


Aimlessly wandering the streets, he found himself outside a department store. Through the glass  windows, he spotted Joyce inside, shopping with flair, enjoying herself, and acting superior with every small victory.


When she caught sight of him watching, she glanced over from a distance. She hesitated briefly, then smirked and sauntered towards him.


"Care for coffee?" she suggested casually, already making her way towards the cafe across the street.


The cafe was warm and inviting, with soft classical music playing in the background. But Joyce's eyes were icy as she spoke. "You look like you've hit rock bottom. Let me guess-Daniela turned you down?|saw you two talking earlier. Alexander, let me give you a little reality check. Stop wasting your energy.I'd bet Daniela and Cedric have been together for a while now. She's stubborn, and if you hadn't been so cruel back then, she wouldn't have turned to anyone else. But now Cedric treats her like she's priceless.She'll never leave him. Why would she, when she's got someone as exceptionaI as him? She's no fool,Alexander.She won't come back to you." Alexander raised his coffee to his lips, trying to appear composed, but his knuckles whitened as his grip on the cup tightened. "So, you're just here to mock me?"



Alexander was always a realist. Daniela had her own success and looked at him from a higher pedestal,which, frankly, made sense. But Joyce, who had no shame about selling herself, was in no position to make fun of him.


Alexander scoffed. "You're no better than me. Just as foolish. Do you even realize how you've got your current life? Everyone in Olisvine sees it, but you walk around acting like you're above them?"


Joyce didn't hesitate. She shot to her feet and flung her coffee straight at Alexander."You jerk!"


Alexander wiped his cheek with a paper napkin and said, "Seriously? With all your experience, you should be able to handle tis."


Joyce marched over, her hand lifted to slap Alexander, but he grabbed it with ease and then  forcefully shoved her to the ground.


A passerby caught the scene on camera and uploaded it online.


Before long, the comments came flooding in, and they were surely brutal.


"Are these two getting back together?"


"Neither of them is worth anything. A match made in hell!"



" heard Alexander saw Daniela before meeting up with Joyce."


"Leave Daniela out of this! She's with Cedric."


Thanks to a popular serialized novel, Daniela and Cedric had become an incredibly beloved couple among fans.


At first, people just watched the spectacle unfold,but once Daniela's name was thrown into the mix,fans went wild, flooding Bennett Group's website in protest. This was the first time a fan protest of this scale had been directed at someone outside the entertainment industry.


Richard stared at his screen in disbelief as Bennett Group's website crashed, filled with hateful messages. His anger was reaching its boiling point.


He wasted no time dialing Alexander. "We lost five more regular clients today. Alexander, Daniela is your only lifeline. If she's willing to help, we might still have a shot.Otherwise..."


Richard didn't need to finish the thought;Alexander understood exactly what he was implying.


The Bennett family had endured one setback after another and hadn't launched any significant projects in ages. If more regular clients pulledout, Bennett Group could be facing bankruptcy.


Alexander had never thought he'd find himself in a position where he might have to beg Daniela for mercy to keep Bennett Group afloat.  Feeling defeated, Alexander made his way back to the Harper family's residence.


But this time, Katrina wasn't as welcoming as she usually was. She had seen the news and was aware of Bennett Group's situation to some degree.


In a detached tone, she remarked, "You're doing this for yourself now, so there's no need for me to pamper you anymore, right? You know what needs to be done. If you want the money and the company,forget your pride. Get on Daniela's good side, and you'll find your way out."


Alexander stared at Katrina, whose attitude flipped faster than a page turning, and forced a bitter smile.


These people were so incredibly pragmatic!


He knew exactly what needed to be done.


Winning Daniela wasn't just about personal gain; it was the doorway to all the wealth and power in the world.


Without her, he'd be left with nothing but empty hands and shattered dreams.


At that moment, Alexander realized how far he'd fallen. His pride, his dignity-they were long gone.From now on, he'd have to beg for Daniela's favor,clinging to the hope of a second chance.


What was self-respect worth anyway?


Without Bennett Group, it was just an illusion.


His family's legacy, everything they had built over generations, couldn't end like this. Not in his hands.He couldn't let that happen.
###Chapter 329 Feeling Like She Was Being Watched
As Daniela pulled her car into the villa's driveway, an uneasy sensation prickled at the back of her neck.She couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her.



She blinked, her eyes darting sharply around the surroundings, but whatever presence she felt seemed to have vanished.



With a skeptical arch of her brow, Daniela shrugged off the feeling and stepped inside the house.



Later that evening, while they lounged on the couch watching TV, Cedric told Daniela, "I've had your secretary set up a desk for me in your office."



Daniela glanced up, her expression blank. "Hmm?"



"My office is under renovation." Daniela chuckled.


Cedric asked her, "Is that okay?"


"Sure," Daniela replied with a faint smile.


Cedric wasn't naive. With the whirlwind recently surrounding Daniela, he silently vowed to stay close and vigilant.


He was resolute to find out who dared to target his woman.



Katrina approached, telling Alexander, "If you want to spend more time with Daniela, you need to head to Elite Lux. There's plenty of space there."


As she spoke, her eyes drifted over his frame, a satisfied smile tugging at the corners of her lips.



Alexander's expression darkened at the way Katrina's gaze lingered on him. With a frown of distaste, he turned away and retreated to his room without a word.



In the shower, his mind churned. All or nothing.


He decided to gamble.


After his shower, he went to the mall and picked out an outfit.



Behind him, two sales assistants whispered, their curiosity barely contained.


"Who would've thought such a good-looking guy would be in that line of work? I can't help but wonder how he'll look in it."


Alexander ignored them, his pace quickening as he exited the mall and headed home.


At home, Katrina noticed the distinctive logo on the bag. She smiled knowingly at him. "You're really pulling out all the stops, huh?"


Katrina knew the brand all too well as she was a frequent customer.


It was renowned for its bold, sensual, and provocative themes, subtly showcasing the intimate dynamics between men and women, making it utterly captivating.


Once upon a time, Caiden had loved seeing her in such pieces.


Katrina retreated to her room, her heart racing as memories flooded back. She pressed herself against Caiden,her voice soft and pleading. "Hon-"


Caiden cut her off coldly, shoving her aside. His face twisted in disgust. "Don't start acting up. I wouldn't be stuck in this damned place if it weren't for you Katrina! Don't even think about touching me again.I want a divorce."



Caiden was infuriated.


Since marrying Brylee, he had grown accustomed to a life of luxury, not this humiliation.


Being exiled to such a small house at his age was a bitter pill to swallow, and Katrina only made it worse every time he laid eyes on her.


Still, she had the audacity to approach him, and he wished he could tear her apart.


Caiden turned away, closing his eyes as he warned coldly, "Find somewhere else to sleep. If you come near me again, you'll regret it."


Katrina stared silently at the back of Caiden's head,her eyes narrowing in frustration.


Fine. If Caiden wouldn't give her what she wanted,someone else would.


She let out a huff. Passing Alexander's room on her way to another guest room, she suddenly stopped,her eyes narrowing with curiosity and intrigue.How would Alexander look in that outfit?


The next morning, Alexander was up early. After a quick shower, he left smelling fresh, a bag slung over his shoulder.


Katrina watched him from the corner of the hallway,a knowing smirk tugging at her lips.


Alexander headed straight to Elite Lux, determination in his stride.  But a security guard stepped forward, blocking his way at the entrance. "Sorry, sir. I can't let you through without an appointment."


The last time, the guard had failed to stop him and was harshly reprimanded by his supervisor.


This time, when Alexander appeared, the guard was ready, his stance firmn and his eyes sharp.
###Chapter 330 He's Regretted Divorcing You
Alexander held the bag, his tone calm and friendly as he said, "I'm just going to Daniela's office to drop something off, and then I'll be right back. Don't worry, I won't cause you any trouble."


The security guard shot him a hard look. "No appointment, no entry!"


Alexander's polite tone now didn't mean he'd take responsibility if things went south.


Alexander leaned in and lowered his voice. "I can personally vouch for a position at Bennett Groupo for you if anything goes wrong."


Hearing that, the guard burst into laughter."Are you serious? Can Bennett Group even compare to Elite Lux? Do you have any idea what I make here every month?" The guard flashed his fingers. "This much. Can Bennett Group top that?"


Elite Lux's jobs were highly coveted. The guard had used his connections to get in and planned to stick around until retirement.


Would he throw away his lucky break for the so-called Bennett Group?


The guard dismissed Alexander with a wave. "Get going! No more of this nonsense."


Alexander hadn't anticipated Elite Lux's security pay to be so high, nearly on par with a project manager's salary at Bennett Group. He composed himself and pulled a check from his pocket. "Just a little something to show my gratitude, and I'll take full responsibility if anything goes wrong."


The outfit he had bought yesterday still lay in the bag, and Alexander was determined to make today a success.



The guard looked at the amount on the check before saying, "Add another zero."


Alexander made his way upstairs with the bag,a sharp, cold pain tightening in his chest.


His visit to Elite Lux had already set him back by 100thousand dollars.


He gritted his teeth, his resolve strengthening. Today,he was going to win Daniela over, no matter what it took.


Meanwhile, Cedric was behind the wheel, driving Daniela to work.


As they pulled away from the villa, his phone vibrated in his pocket.


However, he didn't pay it any mind initially.


His attention was on Daniela as they laughed and chatted happily.


But then, the phone rang, cutting through the conversation.


Cedric quickly glanced at the caller ID-it was Ryan. A faint frown appeared on Cedric's face as he answered the call. "What's going on?"


"Are you on your way tothe office?"


"Yeah."



"Is Daniela with you?"


Cedric hesitated for a moment, maintaining his calm."Why do you ask?"


With that, Ryan understood Daniela was right beside him.He whispered,"Alexander's at Elite Lux."



"What's he doing there?" Cedric responded indifferently, shifting the phone to his other ear.


"No clue. He's carrying a bag. I zoomed in to see what's inside and sent it to your phone. Check it out."


Cedric ended the call and quickly glanced at his phone.



He immediately understood the reason for Ryan's call. Alexander stepped into the Elite Lux building, his grip tight on a very plain-looking bag. The surveillance footage revealed a faint glimpse of a smaller bag inside the larger one.


The writing on the smaller bag was sleek, black, and subtly provocative.


Just two words, but Cedric could make them out clearly: "Midnight Secrets."


He quickly searched on his phone and found it was the name of an adult store.


Daniela, sitting next to him, noticed Cedric's gaze slowly hardening. "What's wrong?" she asked,concerned.


Cedric smiled. "Nothing, just a spooky story I heard.I thought it was kind of funny."


Just as he finished speaking, his phone vibrated once more.


This time, Ryan had sent a text. "He's upstairs.Should we stop him?" Cedric didn't respond right away.


His eyes scanned the latest market share reports of Bennett Group's subsidiaries, and in an instant, he made up his mind.


He squinted and replied to Ryan, "No need. Let him do whatever he wants."


Another message from Ryan popped up. "He just told the secretary he's heading to Daniela's office.The lounge door's never been locked. Is Alexander really that desperate?"


Cedric commanded, "Let him be."


Ryan responded, "Got it."


Cedric ran his tongue over his teeth, a flicker of cold,dangerous intent flashing in his eyes.


He believed in fair play, but resorting to underhanded tactics to win Daniela's favor was a step too far.


It was downright despicable!


Even as those thoughts churned in his mind, Cedric hesitated.


It wasn't fear of Alexander that held him back, but concern for Daniela


He bit his bottom lip, then turned to meet her gaze."I don't think we've ever really talked about your past with Alexander."



Daniela raised an eyebrow in surprise. "You want to talk about it now?"



Cedric pursed his lips. "It's a long drive. Can we talk?"



Daniela didn't mind. She hadn't brought it up before because it didn't seem necessary. But if Cedric wanted to talk about it, she was okay with that."What do you want to ask?"


At her question, Cedric fell quiet again. The past didn't concern him. He only cared about whether Daniela would be in his future. "So what do you think of Alexander now?"


He asked what truly mattered to him, his voice careful, as if their relationship wasn't fully settled yet.


Daniela's response was direct and firm. "He's in the past. I don't think about him."


After a moment, she continued, "I don't waste time thinking about someone who's just a stranger now."


Cedric nodded, his eyes narrowing slightly. "And what if he regrets it? I can see he's always regretted divorcing you."


Daniela gave a small nod. "True, but that's not what matters to me. What's important is the person I love and the one who holds a special place in my heart. In a situation like this, I don't consider anyone else.I simply follow what feels right for me."
###Chapter 331 Alexander Become A Nationwide Sensation
Daniela was always blunt.


Cedric's lips slowly turned into a smile as he looked at her.


She met his gaze and asked, "What's going on? Do you want me to regret it?"


"Of course not!" Cedric laughed nervously. "I'm terrified. If you told me you still had feelings for him,I'd crumble right in front of you."


Daniela gave a small smile. "I don't look back or dwell on the past. So, you can relax."


Cedric felt a wave of relief, his grin growing. "I'll make sure | always impress you, so you'll be happy with me forever."



Daniela didn't believe Cedric needed to put so much  effort into winning her over.


He was already well-known as the most handsome man in Olisvine.



She had seen his sense of responsibility, his ambition in his career, and his strong character.


If he hadn't possessed all of that, she never would have placed her trust in him.



Cedric gave a cheerful "Mm-hmm" before dialing Phillips Group's PR department, directing them to reach out to all major media outlets in Olisvine and send them to Elite Lux.



Ryan personally went down to meet the reporters,making sure all 56 media outlets were settled in the lounge.


The lounge hummed with low conversations.


"Is this news real or fake? I got the call, and I'm still in shock."


"It has to be real. Haven't you noticed how Bennett Group's stock has been dropping fast? It seems they can't keep it together, so Alexander is trying something new."


"So, he values money more than his own dignity,huh?"



"This is a risky move."


"I'd say Alexander is just too sure of himself. Daniela divorced him a long time ago, and with Cedric's strong, handsome presence, who would choose Alexander?"



The whispers carried on.


Daniela and Cedric's car pulled up in the underground parking lot.


"Sweetheart, I'm craving a sandwich from the shop across the street. Could you grab one for me?"Cedric asked, his voice soft, which was unusual for him.


It was a simple request, and Daniela readily agreed without hesitation.  "I'll head upstairs first. My secretary has some files for me," Cedric said.


Daniela nodded, and Cedric reluctantly let go of her hand, giving it one last gentle squeeze before releasing it.


He then turned and made his way upstairs without another word.


The entrance was crowded with the entire Elite Lux executive team and more than a hundred media reporters.


The door to the CEO's office swung open abruptly,revealing a man in a mesh top and barely-there bottoms. He turned towards Daniela, with a smile,and in a low voice, he said, "Daniela, I love you.Please, give me another chance. I'll do anything for you."


The words lingered in the air, thick with tension.


Alexander stood rooted to the spot, unable to move.


Flashes of light blinded him, one after another,filling  the spacious office with their harsh echoes.


The executives of Elite Lux were busy recording the scene on their phones.


Alexander's scalp prickled with discomfort, the sensation of being completely exposed overwhelming him. It was as if there was nowhere to hide, his every move laid bare for all to see.


A breeze swept in through the open door, lifting the already thin fabric of his nerves.


The crowd collectively gasped.


"Wow!"



Just then, Daniela arrived with the sandwich, ready to ask what was going on, but Cedric quickly covered her eyes and guided her away.


"What's going on?" Daniela asked as Cedric led her,his arm wrapped around her waist.


"Alexander is in your office."


Daniela's head snapped towards him in shock. "What's he doing here? And with all these reporters?"


Cedric chuckled, guiding her towards the stairwell,pulling her close as he kissed her.


"What's happening?" Daniela gasped for air.


"He's trying some absurd seduction trick."


Daniela's mind went blank for a second. "Who?"



"Alexander Bennett."


Daniela looked confused. "Seduce me?"



"Yes." Cedric kissed her again, keeping her focused."Don't think about it. Don't ask. If you want to see, I'll wear it for you later."


Daniela was completely new to this and couldn't even begin to imagine it.


Her curiosity sparked, and she smiled. "Alright, then you can wear it later. Should I buy it for you?"


Her innocent expression was warm, offering a gentle Cedric gritted his teeth, looking at her, fighting the surge of desire inside, and smiled helplessly."Yes!"


He was tempted, but the situation wasn't right.


All he could do was hold her tightly, gently biting her neck. "When we get home, I'll satisfy you."


Daniela's eyes glimmered as she chuckled.


Cedric realized they couldn't linger any longer, or something would definitely happen.


After taking a moment to steady himself, he led Daniela out of the room.


By the time they stepped out, the once-bustling office had fallen completely silent.


Lillian was leaning against the wall, scrolling through her phone, her expression one of amusement. She looked up at them and said with a grin, "Well, you two missed an unforgettable scene. Alexander,completely humiliated, changed his clothes and ran  off. The reporters were all over him, chasing him down. It was something to see. And now? It's all over Olisvine's media sites. Alexander's a nationwide sensation now. It's a huge deal, and let me tell you,he really mnade a fool of himself this time."
###Chapter 332 Her Most Submissive Slave
Daniela only learned about the incident through the news later that day.


Cedric couldn't help but feel a twinge of worry,unsure if Daniela might still have lingering feelings for Alexander.


But the moment she heard about what happened,she turned to her secretary without hesitation and asked, "Alexander didn't go into my lounge room,did he?"



She had a meticulous streak and was a bit of a neat freak.


She couldn't tolerate anyone she wasn't close to intruding on her personal space, not even slightly.


"No, he didn't. Don't worry; I made sure it was locked beforehand." Disgust spread across Daniela's face. The mere thought of someone changing clothes in her office was utterly unacceptable to her.


Without hesitation, she instructed her secretary to have the entire office thoroughly disinfected.


The incident quickly caused Daniela to trend on social media.



It was likely a moment Alexander desperately wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole.


He was baffled, unable to comprehend how so many people had suddenly shown up or how things had escalated so dramatically.


The shareholders of Bennett Group pulled out their investments, and loyal clients abandoned ship. The company now teetered like a fragile house of cards on the verge of collapse.


Richard's anger reached such heights that he ended up being rushed to the hospital.


The city buzzed with mockery, and he felt like the butt of every joke.


Alexander gripped the steering wheel with such force that his knuckles turned stark white.



When he arrived at Katrina's place, she greeted him with a sneer. "Alexander, you're completely useless.You couldn't even manage such a small issue. Now,you've humiliated yourself on a national scale. And you still believe you can win Daniela back? That's nothing but a pipe dream."


Alexander shot Katrina a frosty glare. "You were the one who pushed me into this mess. Let me tell you,Katrina-if the Bennett family goes under, i'll be on your shoulders."


Having said that, he grabbed his luggage and walked out without a backward glance.


As he approached his car, his eyes caught sight of Joyce standing under a sprawling tree across the street.



Her lips curled into a derisive smile as she watched him.



Alexander had no intention of engaging and silently reached for his car door, but her voice rang out unexpectedly. "I can help you."



He froze mid-motion and turned to scrutinize her with narrowed eyes.


"Don't look at me like that," Joyce said coolly. "Doug may have his flaws, but when it comes to money,he's never stingy. In all of Olisvine, aside from Daniela, I'm your only chance at help."


He couldn't deny it.


Doug was indifferent to money and lavishly generous with the women in his life.



For him, tossing out a billion dollars was barely a stretch.



Joyce noticed the change in Alexander's eyes and gave him a casual smile.


She raised her wrist, showing overlapping red marks -some faint, others disturbingly deep.


The sight was unsettling, but she didn't seem to care at all.



"What's the catch?" Alexander finally asked, his voice guarded.


"Didn't you always look down on me? Didn't you believe I'd open my legs for money, letting men treat me as they pleased? Fine, Alexander. If you want my help, then you'll serve me in bed."


Her gaze turned colder as she went on, "You think I'm low and worthless? Maybe | am. But you're not any better. I want to shatter that pride of yours and show you the true power of money-that even a once-proud CEO like you can be made to bow. Didn't you parade around in that ridiculous outfit to see Daniela? Fine. I want you to put on that ridiculous outfit again, kneel at my feet, and serve me."


Joyce's words, though sharp as a blade, were born from a wound that ran deep. During the year she had been married to Alexander,she had endured relentless neglect and cold indifference.



His cold, dismissive stares had been a torment that haunted her every waking moment.


If Alexander thought she was beneath Daniela, then she would shatter that illusion herself.


She would strip away every ounce of his pride and turn him into a devoted, obedient slave at her beck and call.


The thought of his humiliation thrilled Joyce, sending a ripple of cruel satisfaction through her.


"In your dreams!" Alexander's fury boiled over, and he spat, "Don't even think about it!"


"Is that so?" Joyce replied with a confident smirk."You'll come around. I'll give you two days, Alexander -two days to realize your place. If you do, put on the clothes you wore for Daniela and meet me at this hotel." She then tossed a business card in his direction,hitting him squarely. "If you don't show up in two days, you'll lose the chance to ever seek me out again. So think it through."


With that, Joyce turned and strode off, her high heels clicking with confidence.


She was certain Alexander would show up.


His insecurities and his need to uphold his pride in front of others wouldn't let him stay away.


To Alexander, Bennett Group was his everything-his identity, dignity, and sense of worth.


So,he was bound to come back.


And when he did, he would end up being her most submissive slave.

###Chapter 333 Disappointment and Despair
Joyce had been married Doug for a while. She had mastered the art of torturing people.


Alexander couldn't imagine lowering himself to the extent Joyce had.


So, when Joyce presented her conditions, he scoffed at them.


Determined to claw his way out of the abyss, he threw himself into action.


He began slashing profits to attract partnerships,attending minor events he once dismissed as beneath him, and courting small businesses he had long ignored.


Alexander wasn't clueless-far from it. His years in business hadn't been idle. He knew the game. So,the day he scored a new client, he was all smiles as he swung by to pick Richard up from the hospital.


"This deal looks promising. But with such a hefty deposit, can you manage it?" Richard sighed heavily.


"I'll figure something out. You just focus on getting better, Dad," Alexander replied.


Richard fell silent, his brows furrowing in thought.Finally, he said, "I still have over five million on hand.For the rest, you might have to consider selling our villa."



Alexander stiffened, his jaw tightening. "But you've always said the villa is Grandpa's legacy. You swore we'd never touch it, no matter what."


Richard said with a weary sigh, "But what choice do we have? We can't just sit back and watch the Bennett family fall apart."


Alexander's eyes darkened. After a moment, he spoke, his voice quiet but firm. "Don't worry,Dad.I'll find a way to save the Bennett family-and the villa." With that, Richard waved him off, retreating upstairs to rest.



The Bennett family's assets were already mortgaged to the hilt.


Even so, they were still short by over ten million.


For a man who had grown up surrounded by privilege, who had once basked in the glow of Daniela's unwavering devotion, Alexander found himself in uncharted territory.


Never in his wildest dreams did he think ten million wouId ever keep him up at night.


He reached out to every connection he had across Olisvine, but even after exhausting every favor,he was still eight million short.


Just as desperation began to creep in, his phone buzzed with a message from Joyce. "Have you thought it through?"


The sight of her name made his blood boil. His grip tightened around the phone, his knuckles turning white.


He didn't want to think about it.


But as his options dwindled, he felt the walls closing in.


He'd been hanging by a thread, down to his last roll of the dice.


The weight of her words-be Joyce's slave-hung over him like a guillotine.


Joyce wasn't just offering help; she was dangling it like bait, knowing full well the humniliation it would cost him.


That evening, as Daniela left work, Alexander waited for her outside.



"What do you want?" Daniela asked, her tone laced with disdain. Just the sight of him seemed to sour her mood.



"| need to talk."


If he had to swallow his pride, he'd rather do it in front of Daniela.



"Can you lend me ten million dollars?" he asked.



Daniela raised an eyebrow.


" need it urgently," he continued. "Just for a month.I'll pay you back with interest. Market rate, of course."



Daniela just looked at him. "Given our history, do you really think it's appropriate to come to me? Or do you think we're close enough for this kind of favor?"



He opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela cut him off with a shake of her head. "We're divorced,Alexander.What makes you think you have the right to ask me for anything? Do you have no shame?"


His cheeks flushed, the sting of her words sharper than he'd anticipated. "It's not like I'm asking for charity. I said I'd pay you back-with interest."


Daniela retorted, "Do you think I need your interest?That's not the point." Of course, she didn't. He knew that.


"But I've run out of options," he admitted. "I don't know who else to ask."



Daniela's frown deepened. "And that led you to me?"


Her cold indifference was like a dagger to his chest.


"Do you really hate me that much?"


"It's not about hate, Alexander. It's about moving on.There's no reason for us to stay connected anymore.We're not in the same world. Can't you see that?"


Daniela had ascended to a realm of unimaginable wealth and power, while Bennett Group teetered on the brink of collapse, unable to scrape together even ten million.



They really were living in completely different worlds now.


The sky grew darker eventually.


A cold wind swept through the streets, carrying the first drops of rain. As the storm rolled in, Alexander stood alone,his despair as heavy as the weight of the falling night.
###Chapter 334 At Your Service





Ultimately, Alexander sold off every/valuable thing his family owned.


After careful calculation, he found himself still lacking over a million.


To gather the remaining million, he humbled himself,going so far as to beg.


But in the entire city of Olisvine, no one was willing to lend him even a million.


Even with the promise of repaying double, not a single person agreed.


"Look, it's not that I don't want to lend you the money, but my father has made it clear. You married Daniela, then started something with Joyce. People already questioned your integrity. Then, you divorced Daniela and married Joyce. Now you're still chasing after Daniela. A man like you isn't someone we want to be connected with."



"I kept in touch with you quietly before, but afteryour visit to Daniela's office was exposed, everyone started saying you have no morals when it comes to money. My family warned me that if I kept dealing with you, they'd break my legs."


"I'm just being honest with you now. All the big families have received similar warnings. Your reputation is shot, and you're not going to get the money. Just let it go, man."


Alexander stood there, frozen, a cold chill creeping down his spine.


He hadn't realized just how badly his reputation had taken a hit.



With a slow, defeated nod, he turned and walked out into the pouring rain, feeling utterly lost and empty.


Once again, Alexander found himself at Daniela's doorstep, asking for a million.


"Even if you see me as a beggar, you still wouldn't give me that much,would you?"


Physically drained and mentally worn, Alexander had come face-to-face with the worst of human nature in recent days, and now, facing Daniela, he was no longer the confident man he once was.


Daniela was busy, and when her secretary came to call her for a meeting, she dismissed him with, "I can't lend you the money," before ending the call.


However, Alexander didn't give up. He waited downstairs at Elite Lux, his pride hanging by a thread.


Even though it was hard, he preferred swallowing his pride in front of Daniela rather than begging Joyce for the million.



When Daniela came out of the building, Cedric was by her side.


They were chatting, exchanging light smiles-the kind she used to give him.



A wave of jealousy and regret washed over Alexander. "Daniela, do you have a moment?" Daniela raised an eyebrow in surprise. Alexander seemed more humble than she'd ever seen him.



"l've already said everything I needed to," she replied, curious about why Alexander was coming to her now.



She was aware that the upper-class circles had turned their backs on him, and she had no intention of making things worse, nor did she plan to offer any assistance.



In fact, she was intrigued. Why did Alexander believe she would lend him money and continue to come to her?


If he thought she still cared for him, it was downright absurd.


"I know, but I really need to talk to you," Alexander said,his urgency clear. A new partnership was in the works, and any delay could disrupt everything.


If that happened, the Bennett family would be on the brink of bankruptcy. In moments like this, pride and arrogance could be set aside.



"Just five minutes. Give me five minutes, please. It's too crowded here. Let's step aside for a moment.I promise, after this, I won't trouble you again. Is that alright, Daniela?" His voice was soft, his eyes pleading.


"Just five minutes, or I won't feel at peace. I know you're frustrated, but please, just five minutes to wrap this up,alright?"


Alexander wasn't sure why he was saying any of it.His thoughts were jumbled, his words lacking logic.


Just as he moved to reach her, Daniela stepped back. She walked a few steps to the side with Alexander, Cedric trailing behind them.


Alexander, no longer caring, blurted out, "I know you won't just give me the money. How about we make a deal?"



Daniela glanced at him with indifference, her expression as if he were just another stranger. "What kind of deal are you proposing?"


"If this business works out, I'Il give you a twenty percent commission. That's about five million. How does that sound?"



Daniela responded coolly, "I refuse. Elite Lux doesn't deal with small projects."


Alexander had expected that response before approaching her. He bit his lip and glanced briefly at Cedric, who was standing a few steps away.He turned back to her, taking a deep breath before asking, "What about me?"


Daniela was taken aback, confused by his sudden words.


"I'll give myself in exchange for the million. I don't mind serving you, even alongside Cedric. Whatever you want from me, I'll do it. No time limit, no boundaries. I just need that million. Does that work for you?" Daniela was stunned. She never expected Alexander to make such a proposition.


The once-proud Alexander, who used to refuse to tip less than a thousand, had clearly fallen far since his divorce from Joyce.


"Daniela... The outfit I wore to your office the other day... You didn't notice it, but I can wear it again if you prefer. I'll do whatever you ask, as long as I get that million. A million isn't much to you. I'm willing to stay by your side, even if you end up wvith someone else later. I won't make a fuss or cause any issues.You can think of me as someone at your service.Does that sound good?"


Just as Cedric turned his head, he caught sight of Alexander kneeling before Daniela.


He lowered himself slowly, his forehead gently resting against the tip of Daniela's high-heeled shoe.His body language screamed complete submission.
###Chapter 335 No Other Choice Left





Cedric frowned but stayed silent. He stood there, his eyes carefully watching Daniela.


People often had things they could not get when they were young.


And when they finally have the means, they strived to make up for that regret.


It wasn't always about deep affection; sometimes, it was simply the persistence of obsession.


It was their way of flaunting their newfound success.


Cedric had encountered many individuals like this.


He couldn't judge if it was right or wrong-it was just a personal choice.


But he knew Daniela was different from the rest.


True to form, a moment later, Daniela asked, "Are you serious right now?"


A smile crept across Cedric's face, the tension within him loosening.


Alexander, still kneeling on the floor, remained motionless.


"You want me to give you money and watch you wear something like that? Alexander, what are you even thinking? I can't make sense of it, and frankly, I couldn't care less. It doesn't just annoy me-it disgusts me."


With that, Daniela turned and walked away. She made her way over to Cedric and asked, "Do you have a spare pair of shoes in the car?"


Cedric fetched a pair from the trunk, and once Daniela changed into them, she tossed the heels Alexander had touched straight into the trash.


She then climbed into the car without a second thought.


Cedric made a move to follow but hesitated for a brief moment before heading towards Alexander.


Alexander, using his knees for support, gradually rose to his feet.



"Do you understand where you messed up?" Cedric inquired. "She's not Joyce, nor you, nor anyone from that crowd outside. Daniela has a sharp mind, and by using tactics like this, you're completely underestimating her. This will only end poorly for you. With Daniela, it's already too late."


After delivering his words with cold finality, Cedric turned away with a sense of dignity and left without a glance back.


Alexander stood frozen, lost in thought, unable to shake off Cedric's words.


It took him a while to gather himself before he made his way home.


When he walked in, Richard was there, pacing nervously."What happened?"


Alexander simply shook his head in response. Richard was in a state of panic. "What now? The loan's interest is piling up every day. Are we really going to declare bankruptcy? Daniela is being SO cold to you. It's just a million! She won't even lend a hand? I'll go talk to her myself!"


Alexander gave a hollow, bitter laugh. "You're going to ask her for help? Dad, you were never exactly kind to her in the past. Why would she lift a finger now?"


Richard was left speechless, unable to respond.


Alexander dragged himself upstairs, each step feeling heavier than the last.


It was clear to him now that Daniela wouldn't offer any help.


Alexander's eyes carried a cloud of despair as he made his way back to his room.


He sat there in silence for what felt like hours, his mind replaying memories of Daniela.


Daniela had once protected him, brought him home  late at night, and was always the first to step up when the company was in jeopardy.


It was thanks to her that Bennett Group had flourished.


Yet, her constant support had blinded him to the true extent of her contributions.


Or maybe her deep affection for him had made him forget that she had the power to walk away as well.


Even after the divorce, and despite Daniela's firm stance that their relationship was over, Alexander could never fully accept it.


Deep down, he clung to the belief that a part of her still hesitated to let go.


He convinced himself that as long as that flicker of hesitation remained, she wouldn't simply stand by and do nothing.


But now, confronted with the undeniable truth, he found it hard to accept.


Lowering his gaze, his eyes fell on the contact list on 
his phone.


The screen was filled with names-people he had reached out to over the past weeks.


But one name stood out, untouched. He hadn't dared to call.


He understood that making this call would mean crossing a point of no return.


Still, as much as he hated to admit it, it seemed like there was no other choice left.
###Chapter 336 Her Face Twisted With Satisfaction
Joyce chuckled over the phone. "Doug's back, so l don't have time for you lately. But hey, if you send me a nude photo, it might brighten my day. I'll call you once I have a look."


Alexander wasn't naive. He understood exactly what she was up to-she wanted leverage over him.


"Absolutely not," he shot back instinctively.


"Suit yourself," Joyce replied with a teasing laugh. "If I don't get that photo in five minutes, I'll move on to something else. The choice is yours. Alexander, have you still not grasped the situation? You're the one who dialed my number, practically begging me,remember?"


Before he could respond, the line went dead with a sharp click. Standing on the balcony, Alexander felt a cold dread creep over him.


A million! It was just a million! Did it really have to come to this? The idea of taking such a photo made his skin crawl. What if it leaked? How could he ever hold his head high again?


But soon, desperation drowned out his hesitation.


With his pride in shambles, he snapped the photo.


Within five minutes, the photo was sent, and the money hit his account instantly.


Tears welled up in Alexander's eyes, smudging the numbers glowing on his phone screen.


Once the money was transferred, the partnership was finally sealed.


The deal turned out to be highly profitable, with the other party already making an advance payment of five million. Looking at the money, Alexander felt a mix of emotions. This was what his dignity had cost him.


A month later, the project was running smoothly.


In the meantime, Alexander managed to land a municipal contract, offering Bennett Group a temporary lifeline.


That evening, at the celebratory dinner, just as Alexander was preparing to move ahead with renewed determination, a message from Joyce popped up on his phone.


There wasn't a single word-just an image of an opulent hotel suite.


The message was clear without needing an explanation.




His smile faltered, and the wine he sipped suddenly tasted like acrid.


He returned home, collected his belongings, and got ready to head out.


Richard sat on the sofa, his eyes fixed on Alexander  as he came down the stairs. He could already guess what Alexander was about to do.


The man who was once the pride of the family had fallen so far.


Richard was overwhelmed with sadness but still held on to a tiny shred of hope. "Can't we just give the money back to Joyce?"


"It won't work," Alexander answered in a steady tone."She's not after the money. What she wants is a way to release all the coldness I once showed her. She needs someone to bear the weight of everything she suffers with Doug."


It was a price that money couldn't cover.


That photo request back then? It was all for this moment-when she could manipulate him without uttering a single word.


Alexander spoke no more and walked out the door.


"Alexander, I'm sorry," Richard said, his voice heavy with regret. "It's on me for being so hard on Daniela back then. If I hadn't, she wouldn't have left you.She's not the type to turn her back on old bonds.I was wrong. I destroyed you."


But it was far too late.


Nothing could be undone now.


Alexander reached for the doorknob, turned it, and left without a glance behind him.


At the hotel, he hesitated briefly at the door before entering.


Inside, Joyce was already waiting. Dressed in a sheer silk nightgown that shimmered under the light, she moved with effortless grace, pouring herself a glass of wine.



"You made it," she remarked nonchalantly.


Alexander gave a small nod, took a seat across from her,and slid a check across the table.


Joyce glanced at the figure-it matched exactly what she had sent him before. "And what's this supposed to mean?" she questioned.


"You gave me the money before. I'm paying it back now."


"| don't need the money."


"I'm aware," Alexander replied, his expression unchanging as he set a bag containing specific clothing on the table.


Joyce glanced at it, her smile growing broader.


"I'm willing to be with you for one night, but just that -afterward,we're square."


Joyce took another swirl of her wine and laughed again. "That wasn't the deal, was it? You need to realize, Alexander, that the terms and how long this lasts are in my hands now. You never seem to grasp your place. But it's fine. This time, I'll let you have your way. One night's not enough. How about a whole day and night instead?"


Alexander clenched his jaw, his face tightening with  tension.


Joyce chuckled, clearly enjoying the sight of him. "I just love this look on your face-swallowing your pride, yet with no option but to give in. A full day and night is the least I'll accept. If you don't agree,you're free to walk away right now. But don't complain when I get ruthless."


As Alexander stared at her assured expression, his hatred burned, but there was no escape.


The business he had fought so hard to build had to be preserved.


He couldn't let go of the Bennett family's legacy,something that had stood for over a century.


Joyce was certain Alexander would comply.


She turned on some classical music and stepped into the bathroom for a bath, leaving the door ajar.


From there, she had a perfect view of Alexander's inner turmoil and slow unraveling.  Joyce couldn't help but smile.


When she had chosen Doug, she hadn't felt much different from how Alexander felt now.


But that was just how people were.


Once there was a first compromise, there would be a second.


Each time she gave in, it made it easier, and soon the struggle was forgotten, becoming something she just accepted.


After all, the discomfort was only temporary, but the happiness that money brought lasted forever.


Joyce smiled as she watched Alexander get up from his seat.


Slowly, he started to take off his clothes, one piece at a time.


It was strange, considering she and Alexander had only been together once before.


It wasn't particularly memorable, especially when compared to Doug's rough ways.


But Joyce was thrilled by the sight.


She wasn't in love with Alexander; it was about her pride.


Didn't Alexander look down on her when they married?




Now, seeing him kneeling before her, kissing her feet,Joyce's face twisted with satisfaction.
###Chapter 337 The Blame Lay with Katrina

Alexander initially assumed the ordeal would be over within an hour.


Women and indulgence had never been his weakness, nor did he care for indulgence.


Yet when Joyce unleashed her endless repertoire of tricks, Alexander was taken aback.


In that moment, Alexander understood why Joyce had managed to remain Doug's woman for so long and even become his wife-it was no coincidence.



As tension built, the veins on Alexander's forehead throbbed, and he couldn't help but wish it were Daniela in Joyce's place.






One full day and night crawled by. When Alexander finally left, his body felt drained and heavy.


Joyce, her lips curling into a smug smile, called out,"Feel free to reach out if you ever have the need again."


With his disciplined workout routine, Alexander boasted a chiseled physique far superior to Doug's,whose age had long dulled his vigor.


Joyce, meanwhile, lay sprawled across the bed, her deep sleep lasting for hours.


As Alexander exited the hotel, his phone vibrated,notifying him of a money transfer.


He glanced at the screen.


His bank account showed a deposit of fifty million.


For a brief moment, Alexander hesitated, tempted to stick to his principles.


Yet Joyce's earlier words echoed in his mind-beforehand, morality had seemed insurmountable, and the idea of taking money felt wrong.


Now, with fifty million staring him in the face,Alexander rationalized it as fair payment for a day and night's work. Why refuse? He convinced himself it was well-earned.


With a final glance at his phone, Alexander silently accepted the deposit.


Using the funds, he steadily expanded his business,and Bennett Group's operations began to bounce back piece by piece.


Over time, Joyce approached Alexander several times, dangling alluring offers in front of him.


But Alexander declined each time.


He was determined to forge his own path to success in Olisvine.


His confidence in himself was unshakable.


Daniela remained indifferent to such affairs. She knew Caiden had beaten Katrina up multiple times. Eventually, Katrina approached Daniela, wearing the same submissive demeanor Alexander once had."I'm not asking for much. Give me five million, and I'll divorce Caiden right away."


Daniela responded with a soft chuckle. "I never wanted you two to divorce. Haven't you realized that by now?"


Katrina countered, "But you've got no proof, so you can't do anything to me. Instead of keeping me around as a daily nuisance, why not let me leave?swear I'll disappear from Olisvine-you can pretend I'm dead."



Daniela offered a faint smile. "You want me to pretend you're dead?"


Katrina nodded eagerly, her desperation evident.


"That's not quite the same as being truly dead,"Daniela commented dryly.


Katrina narrowed her eyes. "Daniela, I came here to settle things peacefully, but if you're unwilling, don't blame me for being ruthless. Do you want a repeat of those 'accidents'?" she warned.


Daniela's faint smile lingered. "Feel free."


Katrina stormed away, pulling out her phone as soon as she reached the yard.


"Is this all you're capable of? Back when you had me take care of Brylee, you were so decisive. Now I'm being targeted by Daniela while you sit back and reap the benefits like nothing ever happened. Do you really think that's fair? Make Daniela disappear within a week, or I'll spill everything to her about what happened back then. I'm warning you, Daniela isn't like Brylee. She has powerful allies, with money and influence. They could crush you with ease, and you know it. You've got one week-if Daniela's still alive,we all go down together."


Katrina ended the call angrily, her gaze drifting towards the villa as her eyes narrowed.


Turning around, she suddenly spotted Caiden. It was obvious he had overheard her phone call.


"You'd better act like you heard nothing and keep your mouth shut, or you'll be the first to go," Katrina hissed before walking away.


The following day, as Daniela arrived at work, she noticed Caiden loitering in the parking lot.


"Daniela, I swear I had nothing to do with any of it.Please, let me move back into the villa," he pleaded.


Just as Daniela reached for her car door, Caiden hurriedly said, "I overheard Katrina on the phone yesterday-she admitted to killing your mother.You shouldn't be blaming me."


Daniela's brows furrowed slightly. "Are you claiming you had nothing to do with it?" she asked, her tone colder than usual.


Caiden's gaze wavered nervously.


"If it weren't for you, my mother would still be alive.Your greed and vanity set all of this in motion. Do you truly claim no responsibility? You could've fallen for anyone else. You could've just divorced my mother.But you were too tied to her money to let her go. And in all these years, did it never cross your mind that Katrina might've been the one who killed her?"


Caiden quickly retorted, "No, really, I didn't. It was all Katrina! I share some blame, but the majority of it falls on her. You can't pin everything on me!"


Attempting to gain her sympathy, Caiden added,"Daniela, I'm getting old-I can't handle much more of this. The small house is freezing, and I just can't endure it anymore. Let me come back to the house.Deal with Katrina however you want, but please, just let me return."



###Chapter 338 The Man Behind




Daniela chuckled icily. "You don't know? Then why did you plead with Cedric to send you to Zentara?"


Caiden's heart raced, his eyes widening in disbélief as he stared at Daniela.


"Why did you refuse to share a room with Katrina and insist on sleeping in the guest room? Or why did you suddenly feel the need to deliver that fruit knife downstairs in the middle of the night? Do you truly not know, or have you just been pretending all along?"


Her words stripped away his facade without mercy.


A cold shiver coursed through Caiden. After a long pause, he asked, "So you've known all along?"


Daniela didn't deny it. "Why else do you think I move back to the villa?" Caiden was left reeling in shock. Suddenly, the events of the past weeks all began to make sense."So,you came back on purpose. You just wouldn't let Katrina get away."


Daniela said nothing, her silence confirming everything.


Caiden's heart quaked as he gazed at Daniela, as though seeing her true self for the first time.


He had never fathomed that Daniela could be this calculating.


"But I didn't kill your mother. I'm still your father.Can't you show me mercy? I don't need much-just a hundred million, send me abroad, and I swear I'll never return. I'll leave everything of the Harper family to you. That's all I ask. Is that too much?"


Daniela let out a bitter laugh. "Even now, all you care about is money."


Shaking her head, she refused to entertain him any longer. Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away.


That same day, Daniela threw Katrina and Caiden out of the small house.


Reduced to the doghouse, Katrina snapped, charging at Daniela with a kitchen knife in hand.


Daniela narrowed her eyes, standing her ground with eerie calmness.


Suddenly, a figure stepped in front of her, acting as a shield.


Katrina was kicked to the ground, her unhealed illness flaring up violently.


Blood spewed from her mouth, mingling with the rain, eerily mirroring the blood that had pooled beneath Brylee's lifeless body.


An ambulance arrived to take Katrina away. As the paramedics loaded her into the vehicle, she fixed Daniela with a venomous glare and screamed,"Daniela, you ruthless bitch! You'll get what's coming to you-just wait!"


Daniela stayed composed in Cedric's comforting embrace.


Caiden was paralyzed with fear, his legs trembling beneath him.


He hastily packed his belongings that night and fled to the countryside.


That very day, Daniela went to Harper Group.


Before Caiden's departure, she ensured he transferred Harper Group's ownership entirely to her.


"Daniela, what brings you here today?" asked her aunt, Elyse Dury.


Elyse, who had been managing her own business,offered to assist Daniela after her return.


Given Brylee's close relationship with Elyse,Daniela had no qualms about her managing Harper Group.


"I'll be taking over the management of Harper Group from now on. Thank you for all your hard work, Aunt 
Elyse."


"Oh, Daniela, don't be so formal. We're family. Your mother's gone, so it's my duty to look after you. If you weren't my niece, I wouldn't have left my job to come here. Brylee only had you, and I'm here to ensure you're safe."


Elyse had shared a close and affectionate bond with Brylee.


As soon as Daniela stepped into Harper Group, Elyse presented her with the account books. "Since you're taking over, it's wise to conduct a thorough audit.There are several discrepancies that need attention."


Elyse, armed with her extensive financial expertise,approached everything with precision and care.


Once Elyse concluded, the department heads of Harper Group arrived to give their progress updates.


Each one voiced their appreciation for E|ysec′⁡S leadership during this transitional period.


"I finalized this order on my last trip. Daniela, let me know if you think anything needs adjustment," Elyse said.


Daniela skimmed through it; the details were precise,and the contract was flawless.


"Alright, review it and tell me if there's anything else to adjust. I'll take care of it. I've also had your office revamped with high-end furnishings. Let me know if anything feels off, and I'll fix it," Elyse offered.


A small group of staff entered the office together.


Lillian glanced around and remarked to Daniela, "The view might not rival Elite Lux, but there are plenty of thoughtful details. Your aunt really takes care of you."


Daniela's expression stayed neutral, and she offered no response to the remark.
###Chapter 339 You Will Get What Is Coming To You
That evening, there was a department gathering.


Daniela was present, accompanied by Lillian.


At the event, Elyse was undeniably the center of attention, radiating vitality and charm.


Her relationship with Daniela was well-known,ensuring she was treated with deference. Toasts made in Daniela's honor invariably included compliments for Elyse.


As the evening progressed, Elyse approached Daniela,smiling.


"Darling, you've truly excelled. I'm so proud of you1.1bet your mother is too, watching over you with joy.We used to talk about everything.I promised her that if she ever had a daughter, I'd cherish her as my own.Sadly, I didn't keep that promise. Your hardships in the Harper family were unbearable, and | was helpless to intervene." Elyse's eyes welled up as she recounted.


She paused, searching Daniela's face for any sign of emotion, but finding none, she embraced her. "My dear,you seem so much more reserved now. It's my fault. Please, if anything is bothering you,you must share it with me."


Daniela distanced herself from Elyse, her response detached. "Nothing is troubling me."


Elyse accepted this, nodding. "You've always been perceptive, even as a child."


Drying her tears, she leaned closer, lowering her voice. "What are your thoughts regarding that woman?"


"Which woman?" Daniela asked.


"Katrina," Elyse answered. "Be cautious around her;she's shrewd. Your parents had a wonderful marriage until she came along. I suspect she played a role in  mother's tragic death."


Daniela played idly with her wine glass, her voice casual."Really?"


"Absolutely," Elyse insisted, her tone filled with conviction. "I often visited your home back then.I witnessed your father growing close to her in the villa. Had it not been out of concern for your mother's feelings, I would have exposed their affair much earlier. And sure enough, after your mother died, Katrina assumed her place. It's too coincidental to be innocent."



At this, Daniela's laughter was sharp and cold. "Aunt Elyse."


"Yes?" Elyse answered, but Daniela didn't speak for a while.



Elyse looked up abruptly, meeting Daniela's indifferent gaze.


There was an unmistakable distance to Daniela,something Elyse couldn't quite connect with.  As Elyse was about to say more, Daniela spoke evenly. "Three years ago, before my marriage to Alexander, I asked you a question."


Suddenly, Elyse's smile vanished, her face suddenly tense. She stuttered, "Did you? What was it that you asked?"②


A flicker of recollection crossed Elyse's features, her complexion turning ashen.


Daniela replied, "I asked whether Katrina had an inappropriate relationship with my father and if her involvement had anything to do with my mother's death."



At that time, Elyse had dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand, saying, "Impossible! Your mother was a business genius. What harm could Katrina, just a maid, do to her? It was purely an accident. Don't dwell on it. Let the past stay in the past."


Daniela vividly recalled Elyse's dismissive gesture from that conversation.Elyse had been so certain back then.


She was one of the very few Daniela had truly trusted.


But now, Elyse's words were at odds with her previous assurances.


Elyse's expression momentarily tensed but quickly smoothed over. "You were on theverge of marrying Alexander at that time. I feared revealing more might disrupt your plans. Besides, given your circumstances then, I wanted to protect you from potential harm."


Elyse quickly crafted a plausible explanation, aligning her reasoning neatly. "Now, however, your circumstances have changed.You wield more power,and I believe you deserve the truth. Daniela, surely you don't hold my earliersilence against me?"


Daniela's gaze dropped to her wine glass as she murmured, "No, I don't."


"I knew you'd understand. As your mother's cousin, my loyalty to you is unwavering. Daniela, you must recognize the danger Katrina poses and address it."


Daniela took a sip from her glass and rose. "I'm feeling rather weary. Aunt Elyse, I'll be leaving now."


With those words, she walked away.


Elyse watched Daniela departure, shaking her head slightly before seamlessly blending back into the gathering.


In the car, Lillian turned to Daniela and commented,"I think your aunt has a point. Katrina is a problem.Why not take care of her sooner rather than waiting?"


Daniela, seated in the back, observed the passing scenery, her eyes gradually narrowing.


On the day Katrina was discharged from the hospital,Daniela was just leaving her office.


"Daniela! Your reckoning will come soon enough!"
###Chapter 340 A Massive Bed





Daniela wasn't in the best of moods. Turning her head, she fixed Katrina with a blank expression, her gaze coId and intimidating.


Katrina clamped her mouth shut, instinctively retreating a step in fear.


Daniela advanced towards her slowly, step by step,forcing Katrina to back away until she hit a dead end.


Daniela closed the gap between them, standing just inches away. "Katrina, if it's trouble you want, I'll gladly give it to you. Keep pushing me, and you'll face the consequences."


Though fear flickered in her eyes, Katrina refused to back down and feigned confidence. "You think I'm scared of you?"


Daniela let out a derisive snort, slid her hands into her coat pockets, and walked away without another word.


Katrina brushed off the warning, assuming it was an empty threat.


It didn't take long for her to realize how wrong she was.


A domestic financial crisis struck, obliterating all the secret investments Katrina had made behind Caiden's back.


Even the funds Joyce had recently provided her were wiped out.


Katrina stared at her depleted bank account in shock,a wave of unease washing over her.


Desperate, she called Joyce, but her calls went unanswered.



When the servant brought up the unpaid living expenses for what felt like the fiftieth time, Katrina lost her temper.


"Aunt, can't you be reasonable for once? It's been just a week since I last paid you. Do you even realize how much I've given you in the past? I'm facing a minor setback, and you're acting like | can't pay.What's the meaning of this? Do you really think I'd cheat you over a sum this small?"


The servant sneered, curling her lips. "Who knows?You're only here because you forced yourself in.What's past is past. Right now, you owe me my salary. If you're so capable, why don't you pay the 5,800 dollars first?"


Katrina shut her eyes for a moment. "You're underestimating me. 5, 800 dollars? Make it a hundred thousand before you come back to me."


The moment the words left her mouth, the servant untied her apron. "Forget it. I've had enough. Keep your money.I quit!"


With that, the servant flung her grease-stained apron at Katrina, who yanked it off in disgust as the woman stormed out.


With no other options left, Katrina decided to seek out Joyce.


Sitting in the lobby of Joyce's home, Katrina's ears picked up on the unmistakable sounds coming from upstairs, leaving little to the imagination.


Katrina felt an unsettling weight in the air, but the servants around her carried on as though nothing unusual was happening, their faces devoid of emotion.


She sipped her coffee, trying to mask her discomfort.


The muffled sounds from upstairs changed, evolving into anguished screams and finally into desperate,gut-wrenching pleas.


The harsh, guttural cries were punctuated by the sharp crack of a whip, reverberating through the grand villa.


Katrina's hands shook, the coffee cup trembling against its saucer.


She'd always known Doug had a dark side, but she hadn't imagined it was this depraved.A chill of dread coiled around her.


Just as she gathered the courage to leave, the eerie silence upstairs brought her to a halt.


The door creaked open, and Doug emerged at the top of the staircase.


His sharp, narrow eyes locked onto her, a glimmer of amusement flickering within them.


The intensity of his gaze sent a wave of unease washing over her.


Katrina rose to make her escape, but Doug's voice pinned her in place. "Are you here for Joyce?"


She forced herself to respond, "Yes."


"Second room upstairs. Go on in."


Without another glance, Doug pushed open the patio door and strolled into the yard, golf club in hand.


Katrina remained frozen, waiting until she was absolutely certain he was out of sight before heading upstairs cautiously.The door stood slightly ajar, and a faint, metallic scent of blood seeped through the opening.


A servant brushed past her, carrying a cup of coffee in and emerging moments later with a rumpled quilt.


Katrina hesitated before pushing the door open. The room was dimly lit.


Standing in the doorway, she called out softly,"Joyce?"




Her words seemed to trigger the automatic curtains,which drew back with a mechanical hum.


Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, pooling onto the polished floor.


Only then did Katrina grasp the scale of the room-an expansive two hundred square meters, barren except for a massive bed and an adjoining bathroom.

###Chapter 341 For Money


Amid the disarray, Joyce sat nonchalantly, one hand tracing the edge of the freshly changed sheets, the other clutching a cigarette.

She inhaled deeply, her head tilted slightly back, exhaling a plume of smoke with a detached air."What is it you want?"

She didn't even glance at Katrina, her indifference speaking louder than any words could.

Katrina's brows knitted tightly. Her eyes fell on the bruises marring Joyce's skin. "You can't stay with someone like him. If he loses control, he could kill you. How could you get invoIved with a man like that?"

Joyce flicked the ash from her cigarette, her face remaining unreadable, unmoved by Katrina's concern.

"What is it you want from me?" Joyce's voice dripped with weariness, cutting through Katrina's attempt at sympathy. "Spare me the act and get to the point."

Katrina's frown deepened. "Joyce, I'm only saying this because I care about you. You're in your prime.Why would you throw it away on a man like Doug?"

Joyce rose from the bed. The marks covering her bare skin were glaringly evident, yet she moved with a calm indifference, unbothered by her own vulnerability.

She walked to the bathroom, stepping under the spray of the shower.

Streams of crimson trickled from her skin, swirling down the drain, only to reveal fresh wounds beneath.

She showed no sign of pain, as though she had grown immune to it.

Draping a towel around herself, she cast a scornful glance at Katrina and chuckled bitterly. "Spare me that pitying look. Doug and I are married. What happens in our bedroom is no different than what you did to keep Caiden happy. You're no better than me."

Memories of Katrina and Caiden making out-scenes witnessed by both Daniela and Joyce-flashed vividly through Joyce's mind.

Katrina froze, her lips trembling as tears welled up and spilled down her cheeks.

"And isn't this what you always preached? That a woman's purpose is to please men? I'm just living the way you taught me. Tell me, did I get it wrong?"

Katrina wept openly now, her head shaking in denial, unable to reconcile the image of her cherished daughter with the woman standing before her.

A wave of disappointment, heartbreak, and despair consumed her. She couldn't bear it.

"From the very beginning, you drilled it into me-money always outweighs dignity," Joyce said, her tone icy and unyielding. "You shaped me into this person, so don't pretend to be upset now. I don't need your pity.Just tell me why you're here. Doug's desires are insatiable, and he'll be back any moment."

Katrina pressed her hand over her mouth, disbelief etched across her face.

A part of her wanted to walk away, dragging Joyce along with her. But reason quickly took over; she couldn't even sustain herself at the moment.

After all, the reason she was here today was to ask Joyce for money.

The words stuck in her throat, but Joyce showed no urgency.

She reclined casually on the bed, her gaze fixed on a news report detailing the latest economic crisis,which had shaken multiple industries, including Alexander's Bennett Group.

A faint, sarcastic smirk tugged at Joyce's lps. "If that's all, you should go. I have other things to handle,"she said, grabbing her phone to place a call.

"Actually, I do," Katrina burst out, stopping Joyce just as she was turning away.

Joyce already knew why Katrina was here; it was all about the money.

Katrina had entered, urging her to leave Doug, but when it came to asking for cash, Katrina was hesitating.

Joyce feigned ignorance, waiting for Katrina to spit it out. Katrina bit her lip nervously. "I've gone bankrupt. Can you lend me some money?"

"How much do you need?" Joyce replied coolly.

"Five hundred thousand," Katrina murmured hesitantly.

Joyce responded with a derisive laugh. "Weren't you always calling my money dirty? Funny how it doesn't seemn so filthy now, huh? You're such a hypocrite."

Katrina's expression stiffened, shame washing over her like a wave.

"Just go. I'll send it to your account tomorrow," Joyce replied indifferently, her eyes fixed elsewhere as she strolled onto the balcony with her phone in hand.

Katrina cast Joyce a lingering glance, her teeth sinking into her lip before she turned and left.

On her way down, she crossed paths with Doug climbing the stairs.

His eyes roved shamelessly to the neckline of her blouse, and a lecherous chuckle escaped his lips.

Instinctively, Katrina hastened her steps, eager to escape.

Just as she reached the door, Doug's voice rang out from the staircase. "Katrina, isn't it? My offer to your mother still applies. Anytime."

A shiver ran through Katrina at his comment. She spun around, her glare brimming with disdain, before bolting out of the house.

"Ugh!" Katrina staggered past the guard post, bending over as she retched uncontrollably.
###Chapter 342 You Won't Walk Away Unharmed Either


As Doug stepped into the room, his eyes landed on Joyce, who stood on the balcony. Her expression was distant, and her eyes were clouded with unreadable emotions.

He moved closer, but before he could study her face, Joyce seemed to snap back into the present.

With a smile, she leaned in and kissed him, her hands undoing the knot of her bathrobe.

Doug lifted Joyce into his arms, his eyes momentarily looking out the window.

Outside, Katrina was doubled over, throwing up by the doorway.

With a smug grin, he flung Joyce onto the bed, ready to force more torment upon her.

Katrina's stomach churned as she leaned against the gate, the world spinning violently. Looking back, she saw a haunting image-Joyce pressed again the window.

Overwhelmed by fear, she stumbled away, too terrified to glance back at the scene.

Back at home, Katrina couldn't shake the sound of Joyce's cries. They rang in her head, relentless and cruel, driving her closer to the edge.

In desperation, she picked up her phone and dialed her mother.

"Mom,you need to help Joyce," she begged, her voice trembling.

The familiar sound of shuffling cards came to an abrupt stop on the other end, followed by a long pause.

Finally, Erika spoke, her tone calm and indifferent. "What are you talking about? What's happened to Joyce?"

"Mom, Doug's horrible! You don't know what he's done. I saw Joyce a few days ago-there wasn't a single part of her left.unharmed. You were the one who introduced he to Doug, and now I'm begging you, please help her. She's your granddaughter!" Erika's voice remained cold. "What nonsense are you saying? Erika's tonewas dismissive. "What nonsense are you saying? Joyce married Doug to secure a comnfortable life. Just because it's not what you'd choose doesn't mean she's wrong. She's clever and practical-this was her decision. Why would you stand in the way of her good life?"

Katrina felt her strength leaving her, teetering on the edge of breaking down completely. "Good life? Is that what you call it? Mom, have you even looked at Joyce? She was once full of life, so pure, and now,she's like a prostitute. Please, I'm begging you-set her free. I know Doug paid you. Just tell me how much, and I'll owe you every cent. I swear I'll repay you. Just save her!"

"Katrina, have you lost your mind?" Erika's voice grew colder, dripping with disdain. "Joyce is doing just fine.And what money are you talking about? Don't accuse me of things that aren't true! If you want to live a poor life, that's your problem, but leave Joyce and me out of it. Besides, how Joyce ended up is because of your so-called parenting, isn't it? And now you dare point fingers at me? Huh! Doug's generosity far surpasses anything Caiden ever gave."

With those cutting words, Erika ended the call abruptly.

Katrina sank to the floor, her entire body shaking uncontrollably.

The realization hit her like a storm-someone she once trusted implicitly had betrayed her so completely.

Katrina racked her brain for ways to scrape together funds, but with no experience or useful connections,she found herself trapped. Her hatred for Doug burned fiercely, but she still found herself using the money Joyce had sent her, an irony she couldn't escape.

In the end, something inside her broke.

She dialed a number from her contacts, her tone sharp and unyielding. "Hand over a hundred million, or I'll spill everything to Daniela about what happened back then. I've got nothing to lose, but you? You've got plenty at stake!"

The person on the other end, which had been trying to soothe her, went quiet after her sharp warning.

"I'm serious! If Joyce and I can't live a peaceful life, you won't come out of this unharmed either!" Katrina added
###Chapter 343 Are You Out Of Your Mind


In a quiet corner of the Elite Lux building, a conversation unfolded.

"I think Katrina's gone off the deep end. What's our next move?"

A voice echoed from the shadows, cold and distant. "The pawn has served its purpose. Get rid of it."

"Got it."

The conversation ended as quickly as it began, leaving behind a faint pile of ash, untouched by the breeze.

Lillian took a step forward, her gaze sharpening as she dialed Daniela. "They're getting ready to make their move."

Katrina waited restlessly, her nerves fraying as she anticipated the funds to come through.

Beforehand, she went to visit Joyce. "Joyce, I'm pulling together the money. Get ready to leave-l'll come for you soon. I don't care about anything else anymore; I just want you safe."

Joyce sat across from Katrina, her face a mask of indifference.

With a cigarette delicately balanced between her fingers, she said, "I don't need your help. I'm perfectly fine."

Katrina's frustration bubbled over. "Fine? You call this fine?"

The morning light filtered down, casting a soft glow on Joyce's hollowed cheeks. She smoked with the ease of someone who had done it countless times, taking a deep drag that made her cheeks sink further.

No longer the proud heiress of the Harper family, she now seemed like a socialite adrift in a life of indulgence.

Katrina's heart. ached as she whispered, "I regret everything. If I'd known this would happen to you,l would've taken the hit myself." Joyce had no interest in listening.

She savored the thrill of being praised. In the Harper family, Daniela's brilliance always outshone hers, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't seem to catch anyone's eye.

But with Doug, things weren't the same.

Doug might have been cruel, but he was generous. To the world, she was his wife. Sure, people might mock her behind her back, but in her presence, they had no choice but to smile and bow.

Even if the admiration was superficial, Joyce still thrived on it.

What did Daniela's achievements matter now?

She had everything she needed-a life of luxury, entirely on her own terms.

Even someone as proud as Alexander had no choice but to bow down to her, and that made her feel like it was all worth it.

Katrina just couldn't grasp it.

"I don't think so. I'm happy with my life now. If you've got nothing more to say, don't come looking for me again."

Katrina stared at Joyce in shock."All my efforts... Do you know who they were for? I even went so far as to...Do you have any idea how much I've sacrificed for you?"

Katrina spoke with all the sincerity she could muster, but Joyce didn't flinch.

She had become like a pampered pet in a golden cage, with her instincts dulled and her ability to survive on her own forgotten. All that remained was her vanity.

"Joyce, please listen. Soon, I'll have a lot of money. Come with me. We'll leave and start over somewhere far away."

Just then, Joyce's phone buzzed in her pocket. She checked it quickly before standing up.

"I told you, I don't need it. Doug woke up and wants to see me. Don't bother looking for me again.I'm doing just fine." Without another word, Joyce turned and walked away.

Katrina stood frozen, her heart aching as she watched her leave, tears silently trailing down her cheeks.

In a sudden burst of desperation, Katrina grabbed something from her bag and rushed towards Joyce,wrapping her arms around her tightly. Joyce frowned, but before she could pull away, Katrina slipped a USB drive into her bag.

"Joyce, I regret it. If I had known this is how it would turn out, I never would've married Caiden, never would've crossed Daniela. I would've chosen a simple life with you."

Joyce shoved Katrina aside, giving her a long look before leaving quietly.

She didn't look back, so she didn't see the regret in Katrina's eyes.

As she reached home, her phone rang once more.

She checked the screen and saw a mnessage from Alexander.

"The Bennett family is short eight million because of the economic crisis. Can you help again?"

Joyce smirked. If she was Doug's trapped pet, only good for pleasing him, then Alexander was slowly but surely heading into her trap too.

Without a second thought, Joyce sent Alexander a room number, deleted the chat, and walked into the house.

That evening, as Doug flew overseas, Joyce, too lazy to go out, sent an invitation to Alexander to come over.

When Alexander stepped in, he saw Joyce sprawled on the sofa, nearly naked, her body covered only by a sheer scarf that barely served a purpose.

Her wrists had marks from restraints, which made him pause in surprise.

He frowned instantly and asked, "Are you out of your mind? Inviting me here?"

He never imagined Joyce would be so audacious. Joyce giggled, the foul stench from her mouth unmistakable.

She didn't care. Grabbing a glass of water, she downed it along with the disgusting fluid without hesitation.

Alexander stood off to the side, watching the entire scene unfold, his stomach twisting with unease.

Finally, he couldn't hold it anymore and rushed to the bathroom, vomiting.

Joyce listened to Alexander gagging in the bathroom, and her expression grew more distant.

However, just as he came out, the coldness in her eyes melted away, replaced by amusement.

"Alexander, what's the matter? Can't take it?"

Alexander's brow furrowed as he prepared to leave.

But Joyce didn't stop him; instead, she lighted a scented candle.

When she turned back, she saw him standing by the door, unsure whether to stay or go, and couldn't help but laugh. "Why aren't you leaving? Is it because you haven't gotten the money yet? Seems like your pride isn't worth much. If you actually left, I might even admire you."

Alexander stood stiffly, feeling torn.

Joyce leaned back on the sofa, her voice soft but commanding. "Come here."

Her tone was like someone calling a pet to come.
###Chapter 344 You Don't Deserve Her


Alexander didn't move right away, and Joyce wasn't in a hurry either.

She stretched out lazily, starting a game on her phone-it was one made by Daniela's gaming company. The sound of gunfire from the game echoed through the room, and Alexander couldn't help but think Joyce was a little nuts.

When the round wrapped up, Alexander finally walked to her.

Joyce didn't look surprised at all. She gestured for him to sit on the sofa, then casually draped her legs across his lap. "Give them a good rub."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Aren't you worried Doug will find out?"

Joyce burst out laughing. She laughed so hard she had to hold her stomach, unable to stop."Worried? Not at all. And you're not either, are you, Alexander? Otherwise, what are you doing here? Seriously, stop acting all high and mighty with me. At the end of the day, we're both cut from the same cloth."

Joyce caught the disapproval in Alexander's furrowed brow when she mentioned"we're both cut from the same cloth."

A smirk tugged at her lips as her confidence grew.

She loved the feeling of getting under his skin, especially when it came to someone like Alexander.

"Alexander, do you even understand why Daniela chose Cedric in the end?"

As soon as she finished speaking, Joyce felt a little more pressure on her legs. It wasn't painful, just a subtle discomfort, but she didn't mind it.

There was something twisted about the way she enjoyed seeing Alexander's strained expression. "You're so full of yourself. You always think the world revolves around you. When Daniela came back, you were convinced she still loved you. But Cedric? He was different. He made her his world. He put everything into her, and no woman can resist that kind of devotion. While you were still stuck in your ways, Cedric had already claimed her heart."

For a moment, Alexander's hands stopped moving, and his eyes grew cold, locking onto her. A flash of something dark passed through his gaze-murderous,even.

Joyce saw it, and it only made her laugh harder. "You know, when I was messing around with men and had a kid, your father once said Daniela wouldn't have done anything like that. He said I was no match for her. If Cedric were in your shoes today, he wouldn't be crawling back to me, begging for money like you. He wouldn't lower himself. So you're not better than Cedric either. You were never worthy of Daniela.You and I?We're the same. So stop chasing things that are beyond your reach. Do you really think you deserve it?"

Joyce's words cut deep, offering no space for mercy.

She laughedagain, but this time, it was more maniacal. "Do you honestly think rebuilding your company will change anything? That Daniela will look at you differently? What do you think-you're going to make it that big? How laughable! Every time your business hit a crisis, who was there to bail you out? Daniela,remember? Your so-called 'business talent' doesn't even hold a candle to hers. You're just like everyone else-ordinary. And that's why, when Daniela left, you couldn't even handle a small setback. And here you are again, begging me for money. Let me guess, are you going to say it again tonight? That you'll 'serve me just this once'? Go ahead, say what you want, but in the end, you'll always crawl back to me, using my money to feed your fragile pride."

Her words hit like a series of heavy blows.

Alexander sprang from the sofa, his chest rising and falling with barely controlled anger. "Joyce, that's enough!"

Joyce didn't move, staying stretched out on the sofa.

Alexander's voice turned icy. "Just because you toss me a few scraps doesn't give you thé right to humiliate me like this."

That was the last straw. Alexander stormed out of the house, his anger palpable.

The door slammed behind him, the force of it echoing with a sharp bang. Joyce didn't care at all, a smirk curling on her lips.

"Don't you think you've gone too far? What if he doesn't come back?" Erika stepped into the room.

Joyce didn't even glance up, her focus still on the game. "If I don't crush his pride, how else am I supposed to keep him as my little pet?"

Erika hesitated. "But what if he really doesn't come back?"

Joyce shrugged, still not looking up. "Then he doesn't come back. What do I need with a disobedient man?I already have to put up with Doug. Why would I bring another man into my life to step on me? With money, I can have any man I want. Alexander's not worth this kind of stubbornness."

At that moment, Cedric's determined face flashed in Joyce's mind.

If it had been Cedric, she might have given it some thought.

"Joyce, you've got more going for you than your mother. Well, your mother seems to be plotting to take you away," Erika said, concern creasing her face.

Joyce kept playing her game. "Relax, I'm not going anywhere. I'll make sure you get the money every month,and I'll even send more-just give it to my mom and tell her to drop those crazy ideas. I'm perfectly fine here."

Erika's weathered face lit up with a smile."Yes, moments like these don't come often. How could you leave?You can't leave."
###Chapter 345 Assassination


Joyce didn't have the energy to deal with Erika.

Standing off to the side, Erika threw a quick glance at Joyce before quietly slipping one of her expensive scarves into her bag.

Joyce noticed but chose to ignore it, finding it too trivial to cae about.

Wearing a sickly-sweet smile, Erika chirped, "So, Joyce, when are you going to pull the reins tighter on Bennett Group?"

Without much interest, Joyce replied, "When the moment's right. There's no rush-just wait."

When Joyce had first approached Erika to set up an introduction to Marvin, Erika had demanded a company.

In a sprawling city like Olisvine, Erika had her sights set on Alexander's business.

Buying it outright wasn't an option since Alexander would never let it go willingly. So, Erika's game was patience,waiting for the moment his defenses crumbled.

"Don't tell me you're catching feelings for Alexander again?" Erika's words lingered in the air like an accusation.

Joyce's expression turned icy.

Realizing she might've crossed a line, Erika let out a nervous laugh."Oh, forget | said that. You divorced him because he's cold and detached. No way you'd go back to that. Besides, he's still hung up on Daniela,not you. Let's keep this simple-don't let emotions ruin the plan."

Joyce's face remained blank. "Get out. I gave you my word, and I'll deliver. Just stay out of my hair until then."

Erika chuckled awkwardly and left, but not without snagging an antique vase on her way out. Joyce tossed her phone aside, no longer interested in her game.

She stared at the stark white ceiling, her lips curling into a bitter smile.

With the kind of money she had, why would she settle for Alexander?

Meanwhile, Katrina was anxiously checking her account, waiting for the funds to arrive. But her balance remained unchanged.

Frustrated, she crossed the street, her mind distracted, when a speeding car came hurtling towards her.

Frozen in fear, Katrina couldn't move. Her thoughts went blank, and her legs felt like they were glued to the ground.

As the car drew closer, her eyes widened, breaths coming quick and shallow.

At the very last second, a powerful hand yanked her backward.

She stumbled, nearly losing her footing.

A split second later, the car zipped past, narrowly missing her by mere inches.

Katrina's breath hitched in her chest. For several moments, her mind refused to catch up with what had just happened.

With trembling hands, she turned to glare at the retreating white car.

Her stomach dropped as she recognized that license plate instantly.

The other party wanted her gone.

The realization was too much to bear, and before she could even turn to see who had saved her, her vision blurred, and she collapsed into unconsciousness.

Standing over Katrina's unconscious body, Lillian stared blankly before pulling out her phone. "Daniela,she fainted.What now?"

On the other end, Daniela's voice was cool and direct. "Just come back." Without hesitation, Lillian complied, leaving the scene as Katrina lay sprawled on the pavement. An ambulance arrived shortly afer to take her away.

Katrina had braced herself for retaliation, but even in her worst fears, she hadn't imagined they'd go as far as attempted murder.

The doctor had said she needed to stay under observation for another day.

Just as Katrina turned off the lights and closed her eyes, a sound from the window jolted her awake.

Her heart raced in her chest.

She opened her eyes, barely catching sight of a cold gleam in the darkness. A sharp blade was coming down in the moonlight.

All Katrina could do was squeeze her eyes shut.

"Seems like they're desperate to silence her. She knows too much."

Katrina's eyes snapped open at the sound. To her relief, it wasn't an attacker but Lillian.

In the pale light of the moon, Lillian was engaged in a fierce struggle with a bulky man, fighting with nothing but her bare hands.

Katrina gripped her head tightly, panic overwhelming her as she tried to scramble away from the corner.

Fear consumed her-she couldn't bear the thought of dying.

"Hey!"

The fighting suddenly stopped.

Trembling, Katrina slowly let go of her head and looked up to see Daniela and Lillian standing in the doorway.

Lillian stood with her arms crossed, her voice cold. "Where do you think you're crawling off to?"

Tears flowed down Katrina's face as she looked up, desperation in her eyes. She crawled to Daniela's feet, her voice shaky. "Someone's trying to kill me!"

However, Daniela's expression was unreadable. "Who?" she asked.

Katrina's face contorted with emotion, and she hesitated.

"Why do they want to kill you?" Lillian's question was sharp and probing.

Katrina's heart tightened at the pressure of the question. The anxiety coursing through her became almost unbearable.

She released her grip on Daniela's shoe and stammered, "No one..."

Daniela nodded, her voice cold. "Katrina, people only get one life. You won't always be lucky enough to be saved. If you really want to die, I won't stop you."

Without another word, she turned and walked away.

Lillian followed closely behind her.

As the car sped down the road, she turned to Daniela and asked, "Shouldn't I stay with her? If they try again, taking her out would be so easy."

Daniela's fingers tightened around the steering wheel, her face calm and focused as she drove. "They won't act tonight. After two failed attempts, they'll rethink their approach. Besides, making Katrina feel like she's constantly under threat is far more effective. If she feels untouchable when you're around, she won't spill anything."

Soon enough, the car came to a stop at the Harper family residence, where Cedric was already waiting by the door. "What's the reason for being so late today?"

Daniela smiled smoothly. "Just got caught up with some work at the company."

Cedric nodded, his eyes scanning Daniela's shoes, noting they were different from the ones she had on earlier in the morning. "Did you change your shoes?"

"Yeah, they got dirty, so I switched them out and threw the old ones away." Though Daniela wasn't someone known for extravagance, she did take cleanliness seriously.

The fact that she had discarded her shoes implied someone had touched them.

"So, what happened?" Cedric asked.

Daniela simply smiled and waved it off. "Oh, nothing major. I just spilled some coffee on them at the office."

He gave a nonchalant nod, accepting her explanation."Alright,then."
###Chapter 346 Is He Really This Good


Cedric wasted no time in seeking out his hacker friend.

Data lines looped endlessly on the computer screen but Daniela's information was still scarce.

"I can't quite crack it," Killian Reynolds muttered through a mouthful of sandwich, clearly irked. "Cedric,where did you find this girlfriend? She's incredible."

Cedric sighed."Are you sure this profile is fake?"

Killian nodded confidently. "It's fake. A casual user wouldn't notice anything, but for hackers like me, the layers of security scream custom protective programming."

Cedric squinted thoughtfully.="Aren't you supposed to be the best hacker in the country? Giving up already?"

Killian chuckled. "I'm the best in the country, sure, but what can I do when the other side is the best in the world? Cedric, are you certain Ryan's the one who built these hidden codes?"

"No one else around Daniela is close to her level of computer skills," Cedric replied firmly.

Killian took another bite of his sandwich, shaking his head. "Then it's nothim."

"Why not?" Cedric asked.

"Ryan's good, no doubt but I know his style. His codes are complex but not impossible to crack. This one,though, is deceptive. It looks simple on the surface, but so hard to figure out to decode."

Cedric arched a brow. "Maybe Ryan's leveled up while you've been slacking off. He is one of the top experts in the world, after all."

Killian scratched his head, a sheepish grin forming. "Really? So much progress in such a short time? Let me give it another shot." Determined not to concede defeat, Killian's fingers danced across the keyboard with relentless precision.

Meanwhile, across town, an alert popped up on Ryan's screen. "Daniela, someone's trying to breach the program you wrote. They're after your profile."

Daniela strolled over, her gaze flicking to the monitor.

The intruder wasn't half bad.

Ryan quickly began typing a counterattack, his movements swvift and precise. Beside him, Daniela casually placed a takeout order.

When the delivery arrived, Ryan gestured for Daniela to step in and take his place for a moment.

Daniela glanced at the screen and with a few seemingly random keystrokes, she effortlessly resolved the issue.

"That's it?" Ryan asked, utterly dumbfounded.

Daniela nodded, already unpacking their meal. "Yeah. Now eat before it gets cold."

Ryan stared at the screen, typing a few more lines to double-check before leaving.

Back at Cedric's place, he stood behind Killian, watching the battle unfold onscreen. At first, it seemed like an even match. But then, without warning, Killian's system crumbled.

Not only had his hacking attempt failed, but his computer was now riddled with a dummy program so absurd it seemed like a taunt.

Killian's pride took a nosedive.

Cedric had never seen anyone humiliate Killian so thoroughly in the cyber world.

As Cedric looked down at Killian, he noticed Killian's expression had darkened significantly.

Killian shut his eyes in frustration, then turned his head sharply. "Cedric, whoever's on the other end, I swear on my life, it's not Ryan!" Just as Killian finished speaking, the rebooted computer flashed a mocking text in bold. "Get lost, idiot!"

Killian took a deep breath and closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, his gaze was still burning with fury. "I swear, I'm going to kill whoever's on the other side! Did you see that, Cedric? They're mocking me! Toying with me!"

For the next week, Killian launched counterattack after counterattack, calling in favors from every contact in his hacker network.

The outcome?

All he saw were rows of computers being counter-hacked, along with those bold, mocking words. "Get lost,idiot!"

Cedric watched Killian slump in his chair, utterly defeated. Even his elite allies had been outmaneuvered.Cedric leaned back, lost in thought. Was Ryan really this good?
###Chapter 347 Crack The Code


Killian couldn't shake off his restlessness and insisted that Cedric take him to Elite Lux.

Cedric agreed and took him there.

The moment they entered the building, Ryan was already waiting for them.

"What brings you here?" asked Ryan, who had a strained relationship with Killian.

Killian, who had been beaten by Ryan earlier, wasn't in the mood to respond kindly. "Whnat's your problem?Am I not allowed here?"

Believing Ryan didn't realize he had been the one defeated, Killian shot back, "What's the issue? Can't I visit Daniela? Does it matter to you?"

The three of them headed towards Daniela's office, where Daniela and Lillian were enjoying a late-night supper.

Cedric walked over, grabbed a pair of disposable gloves, and started peeling shrimp for Daniela.

Killian sat down in the chair across from them. "Daniela, when are you going to fire Ryan? I can take his spot."

At first, Daniela had picked Killian to be the network security officer at Elite Lux.

However,Ryan had offered himself for the role, and after some thought, Daniela decided to keep him.

Somehow, Killian learned about it and started holding a grudge against Ryan, convinced that Ryan had taken away one of the rare chances to work closely with Daniela.

"Really? You think you can handle it?" Ryan scoffed, leaning against the wall."D。you even know what you're capable of?"

Killian wanted to snap back, but after his defeat, he couldn't summon the energy. He clenched his jaw and gave Cedric a look, signaling his desire to sneak into the server room to check if the impressive work he had seen earlier was really Ryan's doing.

Cedric chuckled, then turned to Daniela. "Killian wants to learn some tricks. Is it okay if he checks out the server room?"

Daniela, as usual, agreed with his request and nodded. "Sure. Go ahead."

As soon as she gave her consent, Killian sprang to his feet and rushed towards the server room.

Thirty minutes later, Killian stood at the entrance of the crucial server room, his gaze fixed on the ceilingin frustration.

When did Ryan get so good at this?

Killian couldn't hide his frustration.

Ryan noticed the dark look on Killian's face and let out a scoff.

"Did you write those last lines of code?" Killian squinted, his disbelief obvious.

"Isn't the proof right here in front of you?"

Killian was left without words, his frustration taking over. "How did you suddenly become so capable?"

Ryan didn't even look up. "Did I? Or is it just that you're too weak?"

Completely defeated and disheartened, Killian walked out.

Ryan crossed his arms and glanced over at Daniela, who had been standing quietly beside him."Aren't you going to tell him you wrote those last lines of code?"

"Is it necessary?" Daniela answered.

"I've always wanted to know-why did you pick me instead of Killian. He was your first choice, wasn't he?"

Daniela nodded. "He was." "Then why did you change your decision?"

"Because he was too loud," she replied flatly.

Killian had never known that the reason Daniela replaced him wasn't because of his skills, but because he was too noisy.

For the first time, Ryan felt thankful for being a man of few words.

"Does this mean Killian is investigating you? He works for Cedric, so it's your lawful husband looking into you."

Daniela nodded again. "I don't mind. Let him try." But he wouldn't uncover anything.

Cedric was well aware that Daniela could see through him, so he decided to come clean right away.

"Killian's been feeling down. He thinks Ryan has completely surpassed him. Ryan's gotten so good that Killian feels like he has no way to keep up. He's been asking me where Ryan learned all his skills, and now he's thinking of finding a mentor himself."

When Daniela heard that, she couldn't help but smile with a hint of mystery. "Have him solve that piece of code, and I'll have Ryan reveal who his mentor is. After all, there's always a test when you want to learn from someone, right? Let that code be the challenge."

Cedric looked at her, clearly puzzled."Shouldn't you have Ryan consult his mentor? Killian's skills are solid,and with the right guídance, he could probably figure it out pretty quickly."
###Chapter 348 Two Choices


Flashing a smile, Daniela stated, "I have a solid connection with Ryan's mentor. If Killian really pulls this off,I'll back him up as a spokesperson."

In the days that followed, Killian's obsession with decoding the mystery deepened.

Meanwhile, Cedric watched on with a blend of patience and anticipation, hoping Killian would master the cryptic code, apprentice under its enigmatic creator, and unearth the secrets Daniela had carefully concealed.

Yet, as weeks turned into a month, Killian's frustration became palpable. He had anxiously tugged at his once lush hair, now thinning rapidly, but still, no breakthroughs emerged.

Realizing the answers might forever elude him, Cedric abandoned his wait.

With a resolute stride, he made his way to Elite Lux to confront Daniela in person.

However, just as he approached Daniela's office, the secretary stopped him with a curt note that Daniela had left with Lillian.

Elsewhere,hidden within the walls of the Harper family estate, Katrina had been living under a veil of dread.Now, forced into the open, her anxiety surged.

As their car exited the villa's gates, the driver turned, his face etched with concern. "Mrs. Harper, we're being followed."

A wave of fear washed over Katrina, her complexion draining.

"Drive faster! Lose them!" she commanded, her voice quivering.

The driver nodded just as their car was abruptly rammed from behind. Katrina's head snapped forward,colliding with the seat in front of her. The impact left the driver scrambling to regain control, his hands trembling on the wheel. "Hurry up! We need to move faster!" Katrina's voice was laced with urgency as she leaned forward in her seat, her eyes wide with panic.

The driver, sensing the gravity of the situation, pressed his foot harder against the accelerator.

The car surged forward, cutting through the wind with a fierce howl.

Katrina's gaze was fixed on the road as the car swerved skillfully to dodge the other vehicles, her heart pounding against her chest. Despite the chaos, the relentless pursuit of the car behind them only intensified. As they took a sharp turn onto a narrower road, Katrina's hands shook visibly as she fumbled with her phone to dial Daniela's number.

In that moment of sheer panic, it was Daniela's name that sprang to her lips-not Joyce, not Caiden,but Daniela, the stepdaughter she had wronged for so many years.

"Daniela, I'm in real trouble here. Please, you have to help me. If you do, I'll tell you everything," Katrina pleaded into the phone, her voice trembling.

On the other end of the line, Daniela's response was eerily calm, as she eyed the wreckage of a vehicle ahead,its front end horribly twisted. "And what is it that you're going to tell me,Katrina?"

Katrina was quick to respond, desperation clear in her voice. "Listen, I know you've been digging into your mother's death. Help me now, and I'll spill everything. I'm just a pawn in a much larger game. Don't you want justice for your mother? Save me, Daniela!"

"You better not be lying," Daniela warned, her voice chillingly cold.

With a sharp turn and a heavy foot on the gas, Daniela sped away like a racer chasing the finish line. Back in her own vehicle, Katrina's breath hitched as they nearly collided with another car.

She squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.

But then, there was a massive thud-a sound that seemed too soft for the collision she anticipated. The car rebounded gently and rolled to a stop.

Silence enveloped the interior, punctuated only by the ragged breathing of the driver, who was just as shaken as she was.

As Katrina slowly opened her eyes, her gaze landed on Daniela, who stood firm, giving sharp, decisive orders to the emergency crew.

For a fleeting moment, Katrina forgot everything-hatred, jealousy, resentment, unwillingness. These feelings dissipated in to thin air. Overwhelmed by an unexpected sense of gratitude, she yearned to embrace Daniela in a thankful hug.

"You saved me!" Katrina exclaimed, her voice trembling as tears brimmed in her eyes. However, Daniela's face was a mask of stoic indifference, untouched by Katrina's outpouring of thanks.

Daniela's voice was cold, dismissive. "I saved you today. You better keep your promise, or I'll deal with you in the same way."

Katrina's heart hammered in her chest as the weight of their recent ordeal crashed back upon her."Send me away. I need to disappear-somewhere far, where no one can reach me. Daniela, you bought an island,didn't you? That's where I need to be. Only there will I be truly safe."

For the first time, Katrina felt a genuine regret for her actions towards Brylee.

If she hadn't been so cruel, perhaps Daniela's kindness would have extended to granting her this escape.

But regret was useless now-the damage was already done.

"You're not going anywhere, Katrina. It's time for you to face the consequences of your actions," Daniela declared, her tone unwavering. "Death would be too merciful for you. You have two choices-confess everything and turn yourself in, or face a much harsher fate. Choose wisely."
###Chapter 349 Does That Bother You


A shiver ran through Katrina as her eyes locked onto Daniela.

"Please, let me go! P'll confess everything, but I can't surrender myself. I just can't. If I do, everythingI′Ve built will be destroyed."

Daniela's eyes were icy as she gave a small nod. "Looks like you've already chosen the path that'll destroy you. Fine, I won't stop you. But don't expect any help from me again."

Without another glance, Daniela slid into her car, showing no interest in letting Katrina speak further.

In desperation, Katrina ran after the car, her voice cracking as she cried out, "Daniela! Don't leave me! Take me with you! l'll tell you everything. Isn't that enough?"

Her voice was raw, and soon she crumpled to the ground, struggling to catch her breath.

Tears flowed freely down her face as she stared at the unfamiliar faces surrounding her, her fear spiraling out of control.

She was paralyzed by fear. Yet no one stepped forward to offer her solace or protection.

Her trembling hands reached for her phone as she dialed Caiden's number.

When he answered, his voice was icy."Do you realize what you've done to me? I used to have a daughter l was proud of, and now I have nothing. I'm stuck in this godforsaken place, being ridiculed as a man who depends on women. You've ruined everything, even turned my brothers against me. You're the one to blame! And now you want me to help you? I wish you were dead!"

The word "dead" cut through Katrina, and she couldn't bear it.

She hung up the phone in haste and called Joyce instead.

Joyce was in the garden when a maid approached her. "Ma'am, a man named Alexander Bennett is here to see you." Joyce smiled and dismissed Katrina's call.

Turning to the maid, she said, "Let him in. And you can go ahead and leave after that. I've got a dinner party tonight, so you'll have tomorrow off. I need to catch up on some rest."

The maid nodded obediently. "Understood."

As Alexander stepped inside, the maid quetly gathered her things and left, leaving the space feeling unexpectedly empty.

Joyce continued tending to the flowers, tose that Doug particularly adored.

She could hear the footsteps behind her, drawing nearer.

She recognized it was Alexander, even before he came into view.

He stopped behind her, standing in silence for what felt like an eternity.

Joyce, however,wasn't pressed for time.

She leaned into the moment and waited for Alexander to give in.

She enjoyed the stillness, savoring the power of the moment.

At last, he spoke, his voice steady but resigned. "I can agree to your long-term lover. Just tell me your price."

At his words, Joyce's lips curled into a sly smile.

The rush of satisfaction was undeniable.

Alexander had once looked down on her, and deep inside, he still did, but he had no choice now but to submit.

She thrived on this feeling of control, loving every second of it.

She turned her head slowly, her eyes glinting with interest as they met Alexander's.

"What did you say? I didn't quite catch it." Her voice dropped, icy and mocking. "Say that again?" Alexander knew that coming to Joyce meant sacrificing his pride, but even now, he couldn't shake the feeling of disgrace.

He found himself wishing Daniela were the one standing before him instead.

With Daniela, it wouldn't feel like humiliation-it would have been playful, even enticing.

He stood frozen while Joyce watched him patiently.

She gave him time, waiting for him to finally surrender, piece by piece.

"I'll say it again." Alexander clenched his jaw, grinding his pride into dust. "I accept your terms. What do you have to offer me?"

Joyce let out a sharp, wild laugh, almost manic in its tone. With a smug look, she turned to Alexander and asked, "This is the money I earned through sleeping with Doug. Does that bother you?"
###Chapter 350 Had Daniela Seen It As Well


Alexander clenched his jaw, refusing to say/a word.

His pride wouldn't let him.

Joyce let out a soft laugh, clearly enjoying every second of his discomfort without any rush.

With a sly smile, she walked closer and started to undress him. First, she slid off his jacket, then unbuttoned his shirt, and finally reached for the belt on his trousers.

The sharp "click" of the belt buck<le seemed to hit a nerve, echoing in his mind.

Instinctively, Alexander's hand shot up, holding the belt in place.

Joyce laughed again, teasing, "What's the matter?" Her fingers easily brushed his hand aside."Don't tell me you've forgotten your brilliant plan to save Bennett Group."

Alexander's gaze burned, his eyes streaked with anger and shame.

The sheer humiliation coursing through him left him trembling faintly.

Joyce's smirk grew wider as she smoothly pulled the belt free. "You really should've considered all this before stepping into my world, don't you think?"

Her words lingered as her hand glided over Alexander's firm stomach, fingers lingering just above his waistband.

Just as her fingers inched lower, Alexander's hand shot out and gripped her wrist firmly.

Joyce's crooked smile stayed in place, unbothered. She was in no rush, quietly watching and waiting to see how Alexander would respond.

"Wait." His face reddened as he hastily gathered his clothes, dressed, and bolted from the house.

He moved quickly, his pace frantic, like a man fleeing something he couldn't face. The moment her hand started to move lower, a sudden vision of Daníela filled his mind. At that moment, he realized he no longer cared about being the CEO of Bennett Group.

A wild thought took hold of him-he wanted Daniela more than anything else.

Nothing else mattered; he'd sacrifice everything just to have

He couldn't accept the idea that they'd keep slipping away from each other forever.

By the time Alexander reached Elite Lux, Daniela had already left, and Cedric was sitting comfortably in her office.

Killian, meanwhile, was completely consumed by the code that was making him lose his mind. He insisted Daniela's office was his creative haven and vowed not to budge until he solved it.

Teetering on the edge of a breakdown, Killian was glaring at the endless lines of code when Alexander strode in.

His eyes darted to Alexander the second he entered.

His expression soured as he narrowed his eyes, clearly unimpressed by Alexander's appearance.

"Where's Daniela?" Alexander demanded. Cedric's smile felt like a dagger to his chest.

This should have been his life! Yet here was Cedric, the outsider, sitting smugly, having stolen it all.

The more Alexander thought about it, the more his mind darkened.

If Cedric wasn't in the picture, maybe Daniela would come back to him. Could they find their way back to what they once had?

Fueled by this thought, Alexander's glare hardened as he spat, "Phillips, don't you have your own office?Showing up here is bad enough, but dragging someone else along? You think Daniela's foo polite to throw you out, so you've just decided to overstay your welcome, huh?"

Cedric wasn't the type to back down from a fight.

He'd never cared for Alexander, but he chose to remain civil for one reason only. He didn't want Daniela's decade-long commitment to Alexander to seem utterly meaningless.

He hoped they could go their separate ways with grace. Yet, Alexander had a knack for testing limits.

"Who do you even think you are?" Killian was the first to snap. "Alexander, I'm so done with your nonsense.Everyone knows you sold yourself to Joyce for cash. What now? She kicked you to the curb, and you've come crawling back to Daniela? Have you no shame?"

Those words hit Alexander like a punch to the gut-it was the one thing he didn't want to face. A dark look crossed his eyes. "Don't you ever say that again!"

Killian stood his ground, unbothered by Alexander's threat."Oh,,did I lie? Can you honestly deny selling yourself to Joyce for cash? Everyone in Olisvie knows by now!"

Alexander tightened his fists and took a step towards him, full of anger.

Cedric raised a hand, blocking his path.

Alexander's glare shifted to Cedric instantly.

Unfazed, Cedric met Alexander's hostility with ease and said, "Joyce spilled the beans herself. She's even spreading videos of you two in bed."

The words hit Alexander like a blow. His eyes.widened, and his face went pale."What did you just say?"

Killian, standing behind Cedric, called out with a smirk, "Come on, Alexander, stop acting tough.Joyce even made a group chat to make fun of your lack of skills in bed. Weren't you the golden boy once? Didn't all those women adore you? Now they can grab an uncensored video of you and Joyce in bed for just five bucks!"

Killian gestured towards the screen. "Want proof? I can hack into Joyce's files and give you a free peek."

Alexander stumbled, barely managing to stay upright.

So everyone saw him serving Joyce in bed?

Had Daniela seen it as well? What could she possibly think of him now?

Would she feel hurt?

Would she look at him with disappointment?

A storm of emotions churned inside Alexander's chest.

Cedric watched Alexander's face shift between shock and despair, then spoke evenly. "She knows. But she didn't care enough to say a word."

And that was the plain truth.

Ryan was the first to stumble across the leaked videos and had shown them to Daniela's driver.

While the driver was watching, Daniela accidentally heard the audio.

The driver quickly apologized, and the car raced down the road in awkward silence.

Worried about losing his job for watching such videos on duty, the driver pleaded with Ryan to speak to Cedric on his behalf.

As they were discussing the issue, Daniela happened to pass by.

Cedric addressed it head-on, explaining the driver's concerns to Daniela.

Ryan chimed in, "Honestly, Joyce is brutal. Filming that secretly and airing it everywhere? Now everyone knows Alexander stooped so low for money.Crystal-clear footage, too. Imagine being that proud and falling this far. If it were me, I'd just disappear."

While speaking, he kept sneaking glances at Daniela, eager to gauge her reaction.

Cedric trusted Daniela entirely. Yet, even he couldn't help but wonder how she truly felt about all this.Because, in the end, she mattered to him.

What if the woman he'd finally won over was slipping away?
###Chapter 351 He Gave Up On His Dignity


Daniela's expression didn't waver, not even for a second.

With a detached grunt, she shifted her focus back to the meeting minutes, her demeanor unruffled.

Ryan blinked in surprise, sharing a look wvith Cedric before trailing after her."Daniela, aren't you even a little shocked? Don't you have anything to say about what happened?"

Daniela's tone was steady. "What exactly am I supposed to say?"

Ryan narrowed his eyes, suspicion etched on his face. "I'm beginning to wonder if you ever actually liked Alexander. Didn't everyone say you were in love with him for ten years?"

Daniela gave a simple nod. "I did."

Ryan's doubt deepened. "Is this how someone acts after loving someone for ten years?"

Ten years-a whole decade.

In a lifetime, a decade is no small span of time.

For ten years, Alexander had been the center of Daniela's heart.

And now, he had plummeted from his pedestal, reduced to a shadow of his former self in front of the world.

Yet, Daniela's emotions seemed completely untouched.

Ryan found it impossible to wrap his head around it.

Could this really be what love looked like after ten long years?

Ryan ran a hand through his hair, glancing at Daniela as she continued signing papers without a flicker of emotion. "Cedric, do you think she really doesn't care, or is it all an act?"

Cedric remained silent, unsure. Later that night, he pulled Daniela into his arms and murmured, "If that's the kind you prefer, I can be like that too."

Half-asleep, Daniela let out a soft "Mm," the meaningof Cedric's words slowly registering in her mind.

As she slipped into slumber, she murmured, "Cedric, I see how hard you're trying to be the perfect husband.I truly value that, but what matters most is that you're both my husband and your true seIf. Whatever role life may bring, stay true to who you are."

Daniela's love had always been expansive-never about chaining the one she cherished.

To her, love that sought to possess and control wasn't love at all.

By now, Cedric was convinced that Daniela's heart was his and his alone.

Alexander couldn't help but notice the calm confidence radiating from Cedric.

Once upon a time, he had that same unshakable poise, but his arrogance grew from years of taking Daniela's love for granted.

The soft click of the office door opening broke the silence, and it swung inward.

Daniela stepped in, her smile warm and a bag in hand, her gaze landing on Cedric.

She raised the bag with a small grin. "Your favorite dish. I packed some for you. If you like it, I'll grab more next time."

Alexander remained off to the side, a bitter wave of humiliation washing over him.

Once, no matter where they were, Daniela's eyes would find him first. Now, it was as if he didn't even exist.

"Daniela." Alexander's restraint crumbled, and he spoke up.

Shame burned through him, especially after the exposure of Joyce's videos, but he forced himself to muster courage.

He was ready to let go of every shred of his pride. Daniela's love was the only thing he craved now.

＂I need to talk to you. I know you won＇t agree to a private conversation， so r月 say  here，＂ he bturted， his voice trembling with resolve.

Daniela hadn't even reglstered Alexander's presence until now.

Her brows furrowed the instant his voice cut through the room. "How did you even get up here?" she asked coolly.

Her icy question froze Alexander mid-confession. For a moment, he could only stare at her, utterly stunned and silent.

After a long pause, his voice quivered as he finally spoke, tinged with accusation.nDo you have any idea how much bravery it took for me to face you?"
###Chapter 352 | Regret Divorcing You


Daniela remained utterly clueless, her expression one of confusion, yet she was indifferent.

Alexander, however, was desperate and frantic. "I know you've seen my videos with Joyce, but here l am,still standing before you. Do you have any idea how much courage this took?"

His voice cracked with sorrow as he asked, "Do you even realize what this means?"

Alexander's face drained of color, yet he stood tall, refusing to hide his vulnerability, determined to set his pride aside for Daniela.

He locked eyes with her, urging, "Do you see how determined I am?"

Alexander desperately sought some sign of emotion, some hint of the passion she once had when chasing after him.

But she remained unmoved, her calmness unwavering.

Alexander was lost, unable to comprehend Daniela's reaction.

"Why should I care?" Daniela asked in a detached tone.

Alexander stood frozen for a moment, all his hope, vulnerability, and careful emotions crumbling in an instant. His voice wavered. "What did you just say?"

Daniela, unaffected, stood in stark contrast to Alexander's unraveling. She felt like a distant observer in this exchange.

Thinking he hadn't heard her properly, Daniela repeated, "Why should I care?"

Daniela was direct and forthright."To me, you're just a memory from the past, someone | waited for endlessly. I don't see the purpose of you coming to me now with all these things to say."

Alexander raised his voice, desperation clear. "I want us back together. Can't you see that? Daniela, I regret divorcing you. I want us to be a couple again."

Daniela's brows knitted slightly at his words.

Alexander pressed on, "You once told me I didn't understand love. Maybe I was already in love with you back then. It's just | hadn't realized my feelings. Daniela, don't you see? I love you."

He yelled, his voice filled with raw sincerity, as though his love for Daniela was the deepest truth.

"I could have stayed with Joyce, but you kept haunting my thoughts, every smile and frown of yours etched in my memory. I couldn't continue with her. Daniela, I was slow to realize, but I now see that you'll always have a place in my heart. Don't you remember how wonderful we were together? I want to go back to that time.Can you love me again?"

Without hesitation, Daniela shook her head. "No. It's not possible."

Alexander's face flushed with anger. "Why not? Is it because of Cedric?"

Daniela answered calmly, "It's because I don't like you anymore. Or maybe, like you, I was slow to realize l never really did. Honestly, this conversation today feels like a waste of time."

A cold shiver ran down Alexander's spine ather words.

He opened his mouth to respond, but Daniela interrupted, her voice more direct than ever. "I have someone I truly love now, and I understand what real love feels like. I never loved you before, I don't love you now, and I won't in the future. So,l′dappreciate it if you didn't come to Elite Lux anymore. It won't bother me, but it would inconvenience my secretary, and I don't want to create unnecessary misunderstandings for the person I love."

Daniela's final words stirred jealousy in Alexander's heart.

His eyes darkened as he shot a sharp look at Cedric.

In a mocking tone, he asked, "How can you be so sure that what you feel for Cedric is love? You chased me for ten years, and now you say it was all an illusion. What makes you think your feelings for Cedric won't fade like mine did in the future?" His expression twisted with doubt. "How can you be sure Cedric will be your one and only love?"

Alexander, regaining his confidence, confronted Daniela. "What makes you so sure Cedric won't end up like me?"

He then turned to Cedric, his gaze hardening as he warned, "Don't get too comfortable! Daniela loves with all her heart, and what you're enjoying now is what I once had. My downfall could easily be your future.What makes you think you're better than lam?"

In the end, Alexander felt a strange satisfaction.

The future was unpredictable, and he was determined to plant seeds of doubt in their relationship.

His sense of triumph grew stronger.

Cedric's brow furrowed.

It was one thing for Alexander tospeak to Daniela, but to make her question her feelings and upset her was completely unacceptable.

He tightened his gaze, ready to speak out, but Daniela spoke first."It's completely different."

Her words hung in the air, leaving everyone stunned.

All eyes were now on Daniela.

Alexander's face registered shock. "How is it different?" he demanded.
###Chapter 353 Do You Really Not Want Me Anymore


As the words hung in the air, Elyse knocked and stepped into the room.

She paused upon seeing the gathered people, her gaze sharp. "Alexander? You have the audacity to be here?"

Alexander ignored Elyse completely, his focus solely on Daniela. "What's so different? Daniela, you pursued me for ten years. What haven't you given me?"

Daniela's response was a soft chuckle, her smile filled with the same self-assured confidence.

Alexander narrowed his eyes, watching her intently. Standing in front of her, he caught a brief movement of her lips. A single word left her mouth, and a cold shiver ran down his spine.

Cedric, Killian, and Elyse were standing by Daniela's side, so they didn't see the word Daniela mouthed.

It was a word so powerful it left Alexander speechless, defenseless, unable to form a single counterargument.

Alexander's eyes filled with a deep frustration as he glared at Daniela, feeling completely wronged.

"Daniela, is this how you treat me? Do you know why I'm here? I'm here to tell you l don't want Bennett Group, I don't care about my pride, I want nothing but you. If you still want me, I'll be the man behind you,like your father was for your mother.I will love you unconditionally. Is this how you repay me?"

Daniela spread her hands casually. "Yes, that's right."

With that, her attention seemed to shift away from Alexander. She glanced past him to Elyse standing in the doorway. "Aunt, is there something you need?"

Elyse nodded, walking forward, briefly glancing at Alexander as she passed by.

In that moment, Alexander seemed stripped of all his previous arrogance, like a stray dog. He appeared to have finally come to terms with his situation. He was trembling uncontrollably, and his eyes lost all focus. Elyse said, "I've secured some major contracts for Harper Group that need your signature."

Daniela smiled warmly. "I've always trusted your work, Aunt."

Elyse smiled in return. "Nina's graduated now. She's always been frail. I was thinking of having her work at Harper Group.What do you think,Daniela?"

Daniela signed the contracts, her smile soft and approving."Sure, arrange a position for her as you think best."

Elyse laughed lightly. "She's not capable of much, so a regular clerical position will be fine."

As Daniela handed over the signed contracts, her smile was warmer than Elyse's. "I recall Nina studied finance.Let her learn in the finance department."

Elyse chuckled. "No, she's a bit too careless. Let her stay by my side as a clerk. If she can't handle it, I'll personally take care of it."

Daniela nodded. "It's your decision."

Elyse smiled once more. "Nina's waiting outside. She was determined to see you as soon as she heard | was here."

With that, Elyse walked to the door, calling for Nina to come in.

Nina Dury, Elyse's eldest daughter, entered the room with a fragile, delicate air about her, her head lowered in a shy gesture.

Yet as she passed Cedric, she faltered, before standing opposite Daniela and calling her name quietly."Daniela."

Daniela offered a soft smile in return.

Nina's voice was gentle as she spoke."Daniela, I don't want to stay by my mother's side forever. May I apply to join Elite Lux?"

Before Daniela could say a word, Elyse's expression hardened, her brow furrowing. "Nina, have you lost all sense of your limits? Elite Lux isn't the place for you. Your health is fragile, so stay with me and prepare for marriage. Why can't you just listen?"

At these words, Nina couldn't hold back, and her tears began to fall."Mom,I've graduated. I want to prove myself. I don't want to follow you forever. I've grown up and can stand on my own. Though my health isn't perfect, Daniela can look after me."

Elyse stood, hands firmly planted on her hips, too furious to say anything more.

A heavy silence fell over the office as all eyes turned to Daniela, waiting for her response.

Daniela maintained her calm smile. "It's good to see Nina has such ambition. Joining Elite Lux is perfectly fine."

Nina's face lit up with excitement at Daniela's words.

Just then, Lillian opened the door, and from where she stood, she caught Nina stealing a glance at Cedric.

Had it not been for Lillian's sharp instincts, she might have missed it entirely.

Nina kept her head lowered, her face hidden behind stray strands of hair, her expression a mystery to those around her.

Elyse chuckled. "I told you, Daniela, she's a bit of a troublemaker. Go ahead and spoil her. Nina, tell Daniela what position you'd like."

Lillian's expression soured. It was clear to her that this was all a performance, a scheme to land Nina a spot at Elite Lux.

She cast a glance at Daniela, who was unbothered, before taking a seat.

Daniela smiled warmly at Nina, asking,"So,what do you think, Nina?"

Nina's voice remained soft, yet every word was unmistakable."|want to learn from you, Daniela. You've always been the one I look up to."

Elyse laughed. "Don't be silly. I'm happy Daniela is your role model, but your future should focus on finding a husband."

Nina pouted, clearly displeased with her mother's words.

Daniela chuckled. "Alright, Nina can start in the secretarial department tomorrow."

Elyse's laughter echoed once more.

After a few more exchanged pleasantries, Elyse left with Nina. As they passed Cedríc, Nina's ears flushed red, and she let out a soft chuckle.

Her chuckle was so soft that only those nearby, like Killian and Cedric, could hear it.

Killian raised an eyebrow, exchanging a glance with Cedric.

Once they had left, Lillian stood, her dissatisfaction clear. "Those two are masters of manipulation! What a performance they put on this morning!"

Alexander remained rooted to the spot, entirely disregarded by Daniela.

He was seething with anger, yet a sliver of hope still lingered as he asked, "Daniela, do you really not want me anymore?"
###Chapter 354 Is There Someone Else Behind Her


Daniela was taken by surprise as she gazed at Alexander. "You're still here?"

Alexander inhaled deeply. Usually, with his pride, he would have walked out by now.

But today,something was different.

His fists tightened, as if he were throwing all caution aside, unwilling to back down until he had his answer."I need you to answer me."

Without hesitation, Daniela answered, "I refuse."

Alexander nearly lost his breath. "Did you ever love me?"

Daniela hesitated briefly, then replied, "No."

Alexander nodded, his voice cold. "Alright. Daniela, I hope you never regret what you've said today. One day,I'll make you see me in a new light, reconsider me, and you'll want me again. But by then, I'll be out of your reach."

With that, Alexander walked away, his pride shattered.

Killian nudged Cedric. "When Alexander said Daniela had given him everything, what did she say that left him so defeated?"

Cedric had an inkling, but he still made his way downstairs. He called out to Alexander, "What did she say to you? We didn't catch it."

Alexander suspected that Cedric was purposefully trying to mock him. He narrowed his eyes. "You don't know?"

Alexander thought Cedric was more manipulative than that woman named Nina he had just encountered.

Cedric raised his hands in mock innocence. "I don't know, and I am curious."
Alexander was enraged by Cedric's response. He shot Cedric a furious glare.

Earlier,he had told Daniela, "You've given everything for me. How am I any different from Cedric?"

Daniela had replied, "It's different."

Unseen by the others, she had mouthed, "Myself."

"Daniela has always gone above and beyond for me, but she never gave herself to me," Alexander yelled at Cedric, his frustration boiling over. "She'd do anything I asked, yet she wouldn't even let me hold her hand,let alone anything more personal. But you've crossed that line with her, haven't you? So,tell me,Cedric,does it make you feel proud? Does it feel special to have what she kept from me? Well, don't get too comfortable. People change, Cedric, and mark my words-sooner or later, Daniela will realize I'm the one she's truly meant to be with."

Alexander's words were sharp and icy, each syllable cutting through the air like a blade.

Cedric's lips curved into a faint, smug smile as he replied,"Oh? Is that what she let you believe?"

Fury radiated from Alexander like heat from a wildfire, his clenched fists trembling.

With a final, venomous glare, he spat, "The future is long-we'll see who wins in the end!" Turning on his heel, he stormed off, refusing to glance back.

In the office, Lillian's brows knitted together. "Daniela, why on earth did you hire Nina as your secretary at Elite Lux? She's going to be hovering around you constantly."

It felt like handing Elyse a front-row seat to every move Daniela made.

Daniela's smile was calm, almost serene. "To catch the big fish, you need the right patience."

Lillian nodded, though her frown lingered. "Nina might look fragile, but her eyes? They're always darting around,especially when Cedric's nearby-there's a predatory gleam you can't miss."

Daniela nodded slightly. "Elyse has been living comfortably off my mother's shares for years. Her daughters? They've grown up spoiled, thinking the world owes them something. Nina might be petty, but her sister Natalie, who's abroad? She's the real one to watch." Back then, Brylee had poured her heart and soul into supporting Elyse and her family.

And what clid she get in return?

A cruel, tragic ending. Kátrina never tálked about the defails, but Daniela had pieced the story fogether on her own.

"Lately, Katrina's been through hell-eight car accidents, six other incidents. She's been breaking down,crying, begging to see you, Daniela. Do you want to talk to her?"

Daniela shook her head firmily. "No,not yet. Some people only realize their mistakes after they've been broken down enough. Just make sure she stays alive."

Lillian gave a curt nod. "From the looks of Katrina's recent string of disasfers, Elyse's hand in this is unmistakable. But something tells me it's not just her. Is there someone else pulling strings behind her?"③

Daniela didn't say a word. She stood quietly by the floor-to-ceiling window, her gaze fixed on the bustling traffic below, her eyes thoughtful.
###Chapter 355 Senior From High School


Alexander departed from Daniela's office, making his way to Joyce's residence.

Joyce greeted him without a hint of surprise.

She was well aware of Daniela'snature: generous to a fault unless betrayed, then utterly unforgiving

Alexander wished to reconcile, but he knew Daniela's forgiveness was out of the question.

Upon arriving at Joyce's place, Alexander began to undress immediately. Stripped bare, he stood while Joyce appraised him, her gaze evaluative. "So, are you truly committed this time?"

Alexander's expression was cold, his disdain for Daniela palpable though she still occupied his thoughts."Yes.I am decided."

Joyce's laughter rang out, tinged with warning."Alexander, you can't just waltz in and out here on a whim."

His brows furrowed at her statement. "What are you implying?"

"You should know I'm neither short of money nor of companions. This isn't just a spot for quick cash.Got it?"

It dawned on Alexander that Joyce was proposing a continuous, intimate relationship.

With a cunning smile, Joyce laid out her terms. "One year, at my disposal. You will comply with all my requests. In return, I'll ensure Bennett Group thrives."

The memories of those compromising videos darkened Alexander's mood further.

Joyce's chuckle softened. "Don't worry. Sign this contract and I'll treat you fairly. Those Videos were merely to curb your lingering feelings for Daniela. Stay true to me, and I promise no more games."

Alexander was staggered by how completely Joyce seemed to dominate him now.

"Do you need time to consider?" Joyce asked. His jaw clenched, Alexander dismissed the need for delay. "No need."

Joyce clapped her hands, a light sound in the tense air. "Excellent. Here's the contract. Abide by it, and 1'elevate Bennett Group. Break it, and your company becomes mine." Joyce slid the contract across to him before retiring to the bathroom to undress, leaving him with decisions to ponder.

The faint sound of running water echoed from the bathroom as Alexander fixated on the contract before him,his fists clenched.

His hand shook visibly as he gripped the pen.

Alexander convinced himself that with sufficient wealth, Daniela would regret her indifference. He was determined to gain prominence, to change how Daniela perceived him.

With hands that barely steadied, Alexander affixed his signature to the document.

From the steamy bathroom, Joyce's voice floated casually.nce you're done signing,join me."

Resolutely, Alexander made his way to the bathroom.

Steam enveloped the room where Joyce, unclothed and relaxed, perched on the edge of the sink smoking a cigarette.

Upon his entry, she flicked her cigarette away with a smirk."Carry me to the bath."

Alexander's eyes were glazed, and he moved as though he were a mere automaton.

He moved robotically, bending down to lift Joyce and placing her in the bathtub. Joyce smiled, pinched Alexander's chin, and instructed, "Come in."

Alexander complied without a word.

As Joyce stretched out in the soothing water, closing her eyes with a satisfied expression, she commanded as though weaving a spell, "Kneel. Kiss me."

As the night wore on, it became clear to Alexander that his proud, self-respecting persona was crumbling under Joyce's demeaning demands. Three days later, when Doug returned, Alexander left the villa through the back door, clutching the check Joyce had given him.

After some distance, he glanced back.

Joyce hunched over the window, with Doug behind her, yet her gaze seemed to cut through the distance,locking with Alexander's.

As Alexander held the check, a wave of revulsion overwhelmed him, and he vomited forcefully by the roadside.

Recovering, he clenched the check, straightened up, and strode into the darkness, a resolve hardened within him.

Back at the office, Daniela was immersed in her work. Lillian, watching the news, turned to Daniela with a click of her tongue.

"Have you seen this? Alexander is now completely under Joyce's control."

Daniela, recently preoccupied with acquiring new companies and engrossed in her projects, barely registered the gossip.

Observing the shift in focus, Lillian redirected the conversation. "Katrina also met with Joyce recently.Joyce apparently handed her ten million, which Katrina used to fortify her security. Should we step in?"

Daniela quirked an eyebrow. "Doug's pretty open-handed with Joyce. There's no need for us to get involved. Besides, isn't Nina starting tomorrow? Elyse is far more eager to see Katrina dealt with than we are."

The following morning, Nina made a striking entrance in a vibrant pink ensemble, capturing everyone's attention. Known for her polite demeanor, she courteously greeted everyone at the company.

As Lillian escorted her through various departments, Nina's charm quickly won over many of her male colleagues.

Hailing from the Dury family, renowned for their attractiveness, Nina adeptly used her beauty to influence those around her.

Yet, she tended to look down on those she considered beneath her.

Her motivation for joining Lux Elite was clear; she had already marked a target.

When Lillian and Nina returned to the secretary department, Nina's gaze locked onto Cedric.

Ignoring Lillian, Nina approached Cedric.

With one hand behind her back and the other extended, Nina offered a shy smile."Cedric, you were my senior from high school, and I'm so happy to see you again at Elite Lux. It's great that we'll be working together once more."

Cedric appeared taken aback.

Nina's expression softened, her eyes misting over, yet she maintained a strained smile. "We attended the same high school, though you were quite prominent, so you may not recall me. We once collaborated on a class project or perhaps a bulletin board."

Cedric struggled to remember. He responded with a polite nod.

As he moved to enter Daniela's office, Nina called out to him again.
###Chapter 356 Sorry


"Would you like something to drink? Can I get you anything?" Nina's voice floated gently, imbued with a light smile,seemingly innocent.

Cedric looked at her and replied briefly,thank you."

Unfazed, Nina kept up with him, her smile steady. "Maybe you're not a fan of coffee? I'm really good at making fresh juice."

As soon as Cedric heard this, his expression slowly hardened. "Nina Dury."

Nina's eyes sparkled with anticipation as she fixed her gaze on Cedric, responding promptly,here."

Cedric's expression showed a hint of annoyance. "Remember, you were employed by Elite Lux, not Phillips Group. Your duties are to Daniela, not to me. Focus on her needs instead of mine."

Nina's smile abruptly stiffened.

Cedric then glanced at Lillian, who seemed to be enjoying the exchange with a hint of amusement.

"Could you please take your colleague away?"

With that, Cedric turned and entered Daniela's office.

Nina bit her lip, her eyes welling up with unshed tears.

Lillian let out a quiet laugh."Well, I'm up for either coffee or juice. Mind making one for me?"

Silently, Nina nodded and walked towards the pantry.

Entering the office, Cedric found Daniela was not there but in a meeting. The previous night, he had acquired a splendid sapphire jewelry piece at an auction. Intending to surprise Daniela, he was about to place it in her lounge when the door to the meeting room swung open.

Without looking back, Cedric assumed it was Lillian. "Keep an eye on your team members. Ensure they don't get ideas above their station."

After making his point, Cedric retrieved the jewelry from its bag and set it on the lounge table, opening the box to inspect it.

Nina stood behind him, holding a freshly brewved cup of coffee.

As she glanced over, her eyes landed on the jewelry, which radiated a captivating green shimmer.

She gasped in awe.

This piece was said to have been part of an ancient queen's dowry to her daughter, an item of immense value.

Many collectors had contested aggressively for it the previous night.

Ultimately, a mysterious affluent buyer acquired the jewelry, leaving behind a note that read,′′Apriceless jewel for a beloved."

Nina stared at Cedric, her expression one of disbelief.

Rumors had circulated about Cedric's infatuation with Daniela, but could he truly justify spending billions on a piece of jewelry just to win her over?

Cedric's generosity seemed boundless.

As Nina watched him, her heart pounded with intensity, captivated by Cedric's profile.

She thought such a man truly deserved the finest partner.

A look of admiration and yearning filled her eyes.

Realizing they were alone in the office, Nina approached Cedric and"accidentally" tilted her coffee cup.

The coffee stained Cedric's immaculate white shirt.

Cedricturned, expecting Lillian, but instead, he met Nina's apologetic gaze.

She appeared flustered, rapidly grabbing tissues. "I'm so sorry, Cedric. I didn't mean to. This was clumsy of me."

While apologizing, she reached out with a tissue towards Cedric's midsection.

Cedric frowned, instinctively stepping back. He was about to respond when the office door swung open.

Lillian entered, mid-conversation. "Daniela, about Nina..."

She halted abruptly upon seeing the scene in the office.

Daniela entered behind her.

"I apologize, Daniela. This was my mistake. Please don't misinterpret what happened," Nina pleaded,her voice tinged with distress as she bit her lip.
###Chapter 357 The Bait


After she finished speaking, Nina bowed her head and began to weep quietly, giving the impression that something significant had occurred between her and Cedric,who had earlier been alone with her in the office.

Lillian's expression soured as she observed Nina, the situation leaving a bad taste in her mouth.

Nina kept her gaze down, oblivious to Daniela's reaction. In a soft voice, she added,"1apologize,Daniela."

Cedric was about to clarify things to Daniela when she entered the room and replied,′′|sthat so? What exactly are you apologizing for?"

Daniela's calm question seemed to diffuse the tension Cedric had been feeling.

Nina frowned. Was Daniela genuinely this undisturbed?

Perhaps Daniela harbored no romantic feelings for Cedric, or she trusted him implicitly.

Nina suspected it was the former; trust was seldom granted freely in their circles.

Feeling a glimmer of hope, she reassured herself that if there was no romantic link between Daniela and Cedric, she might still have a chance. "Look, Daniela, I accidentally spilled coffee on Cedric earlier. It was purely an accident."

Lillian scoffed dismissively, "Really? Is that it? Your expression just now suggested Cedric was at fault for something far more serious."

Nina widened her eyes, her expression filled with an adorable sense of disbelief."How could you say that?There's absolutely nothing improper between Cedric and me. Lillian, why would you entertain such unsavory ideas?"

Lillian met her gaze with a mocking sneer. "We're not fools here; your motives are quite transparent."

As soon as she heard those words, tears that had been brimming in Nina's eyes began to spill over. "Lillian, have I done something to offend you? Why must you cast such aspersions about me? Cedric is a distinguished guest at Elite Lux. I hold him in high regard. Is that objectionable? Must everyone agree with you? I didn't realize you were so overbearing, Lillian."

Lillian bristled at the accusation. "Excuse me! What did you just call me?"

Nina remained composed, her tone even. "Overbearing."

Lillian was visibly agitated, ready to confront Nina further, but Daniela intervened. Nina, misinterpreting Daniela's action as support, allowed herself a smug expression.

Just as Nina was about to add more, Daniela's look became stern."Are you sure you want to continue this?"

Nina hesitated, then closed her mouth.

Daniela's voice was cold. "Lillian is your supervisor here. If you're unable to show the necessary respect and can only behave courteously towards Cedric, maybe you'd be better suited as a secretary at Phillips Group."

Nina cast a quick glance at Cedric. Indeed, she had ambitions to join Phillips Group, but Cedric had not yet made such an offer. She had only recently secured her position at Daniela's company, and being dismissed on her first day would be disastrous, especially in her mother's eyes.

"I apologize," Nina quickly said, her tone smooth and practiced. "Lillian, I accept full responsibility. I'll reflect on my behavior.Please don't hold this against me."

Nina was aware that Daniela, likely out of respect for her mother, wouldn't dismiss her hastily. Thus,her remorse was not entirely genuine.

After her plea, she turned to Daniela, attempting to charm her."Daniela, l've apologized. Let's not dwell on this. I was really frightened when | accidentally spilled coffee on Cedric. Can we move past this, please?Your mother always forgave my mistakes; she wouldn't scold me if she were here. Daniela, you're wonderful.You won't stay upset with me, right?"

Nina delivered her apology with a seemingly innocent smile, her underlying motives well-hidden. Even the finance manager,pausing at the door to deliver his report, found himself momentarily moved by her act. Daniela issued a mild reproof to Nina before dismissing her.

As Nina exited, she cast multiple glances back at Cedric.

When Nina had finally left, Lillian exhaled deeply, turned to Daniela, and warned, "Daniela! Nina and Elyse are far more manipulative than Katrina."

Daniela responded with a light chuckle, "The Dury women are worldly; their broad experiences,connections, and influence grant them a certain stature in their social circles. They're not limited in their views like Katrina. It's best to keep your distance to avoid any potential harm."

Lillian was about to reply when Cedric added, "I'll be on guard as well."

Daniela looked at Cedric, who was visibly cautious, and smiled, shaking her head.

In the following days, Nina kept a low profile at work. She was hardworking and adjusted well to her duties,though she occasionally showed emotional instability and her eyes involuntarily followed Cedric.

For the most part,however, her conduct was impeccable.

Observing this, Lillian suggested to Daniela, "Should we see if she takes the bait?"

At the moment, Daniela was busy signing documents.

Upon hearing Lillian's suggestion, she paused and looked up, asking, "The bait?"

Lillian glanced towards Cedric, who was focused on his work near the office entrance. "Nothing great is achieved without some risk."

In Lillian's opinion, Daniela was always stringent with herself, and she believed Daniela should apply the same standards to others.

Previously, to draw Katrina out, Daniela had not hesitated to use herself as bait.

Thus, employing Cedric as bait now seemed trivial by comparison.

After all, it was just a strategic move. They had comprehensive protection in place to ensure Cedric's safety, eliminating any cause for concern.
###Chapter 358 Can't You Speak More Gently


Lillian was certain of Cedric's loyalty; she knew he would consent to being the bait.

In her view, Nina was more cunning than Katrina but not particularly hazardous.

It would simply involve capitalizing on Cedric's charm.

It was nothing too serious.

Once Lillian finished proposing the idea, she awaited Daniela's approval.

Daniela, however, remained quiet.

"Daniela?"

Lillian, thinking Daniela might not have heard her, was about to reiterate her suggestion when Daniela responded with a firm, "No."

Lillian was startled by the response.

"Anything that might put Cedric at risk is out of the questionn111Daniela declared decisively.

Lillian was caught off guard. "But it's not really dangerous, is it?"

"Regardless," Daniela replied, her voice steady and authoritative. "He shouldn't be dragged into my personal affairs."

Cedric was invaluable.

Daniela regretted involving him in her complex life, burdening him with concerns for her well-being.

She refused to expose him to any risk.

Absolutely not. Lillian was struck by Daniela's determination.

Daniela seldom expressed her feelings openly. Lillian had never been under the impression that Daniela deeply cared for Cedric.

At best, she considered that Daniela valued him as a friend and had begrudgingly embraced their relationship.

Lillian found herself questioning her assumptions.

Could it be that Daniela truly had deeper feelings for Cedric?

Lillian pondered over this until Katrina showed up, looking utterly disheveled and distressed.

Daniela initially suspected Katrina was fleeing from someone, but as soon as she entered the office, Katrina began sobbing.

"Daniela, are you going to address the situation with your dad? As a high-profile CEO, it can't look good to have a father accused of domestic abuse,right?"

Nina observed quietly from the doorway, her eyes widening at the accusation.

Daniela glanced up and caught sight of Nina by the door. "He is not my father."

This revelation caused Nina to look taken aback, while Katrina, though surprised, seemed somewhat prepared.

"So, you're saying you won't intervene with your father mistreating me? He's been excluded back home and has returned to town. He threatened to harm me unless you allow him to stay at the Harper family villa."

Daniela was aware that Katrina had recently been funded by Joyce. Despite hiring bodyguards, Katrina likely had funds remaining. "Are you asking for my help?"

"Yes," Katrina replied.

"Very well. What's your price?" Daniela asked.

Katrina was taken aback by the question. "You're wealthy, and yet you're asking me for money?" Daniela responded calmly, "I'm a businesswoman. I don't provide help without something in return. You know this as well as anyone."

Katrina tightened her lips, visibly frustrated. "How much are you asking?"

Daniela responded with a smile, lifting a single finger.

"Ten thousand?"

Daniela scoffed derisively, her face conveying disdain.

"One hundred thousand?" Katrina's expression darkened.

Daniela shook her finger mid-air.

"Really, Daníela! A million? Why not just rob a bank while you're at it?" Katrina exclaimed.

Daniela's face showed no emotion. "If that's unacceptable, we can end this discussion. Feel free to seek help elsewhere."

Katrina was seething with anger. She considered finding another solution, but everything depended on Daniela's approval since she controlled the property.

"One million, covering three months' rent. Additional days will incur further charges. Mull it over and return if you wish to discuss further." Daniela's demeanor was firm, indicating she was prepared to dismiss Katrina if necessary.

Katrina clenched her jaw. "I don't have that kind of money," she declared, then dramatically sat down on the floor."If you leave me no choice, then I won't leave."

After all this time, Katrina had come to understand that staying by Daniela's side was safer than facing the unpredictable dangers of the outside world or returning home to endure Caiden's beatings.

Observing Katrina on thefloor, Daniela let out a slight smirk."Are you trying to pressure me?"

That smile was what Katrina dreaded most about Daniela.

It always seemed to prelude severe consequences, as if the sword of Damocles hung over her head. Daniela's approach was consistently understated but impactful.

"Get up," Daniela commanded, her expression suddenly stern, her intense gaze prompting Katrina to rise swiftly.

"Can't you speak more gently?" Katrina's voice shook slightly, betraying her nervousness.
###Chapter 359 He Would Be Hers Tonight


Daniela flashed a smirk and said, "You claim to have no money, yet Joyce has plenty."

Katrina's expression tightened. "Joyce avoids me. She only sends me twenty thousand dollars a month."

Replicating Katrina's earlier tone with a playful smile, Daniela said, "There's a banquet tonight where Joyce will be present. I'll bring you along. As her mother, she won't be able to dismiss you."

Katrina realized Daniela was cleverly using her own logic to corner her. Though hesitant, she saw no alternative.

Daniela instantly read Katrina's reluctance. "You've always been there for Joyce, far more than Caiden ever was for me. It's only fair that Joyce supports you."

Katrina found no fault in that logic and remained silent.

Lillian then took a disheartened Katrina to change into the evening attire for the event.

As they prepared to depart, Katrina caught sight of Nina by the doorway.

Her reaction was immediate: pupils dilating and complexion paling as a shiver ran through her.

Instinctively, she sidestepped and hurried out of Daniela's office.

Nina, lingering at the door,reflected on her observations.

Initially, she had underestimated Daniela, attributing her success to mere luck.

However, witnessing Daniela command a room during meetings changed her perspective.

Daniela's dominance and the respect she commanded were undeniable.

Today, as she watched Daniela handle Katrina with such deft authority and strategic conversation, Nina was convinced of Daniela's complexity. Quietly, Nina bowed her head and texted Elyse:

"Daniela will be at the banquet tonight, wrapping up around eleven. I'll keep Cedric busy, Handle Daniela on your end!"

After sending the text, Nina shifted her focus to Lillian.

Lillian appeared experienced in handling difficult situations. Nina knew she had to find a way to prevent Lillian from attending the banquet, isolating Daniela for the evening.

After a brief pause, Nina swung open the door to Daniela's office, wearing a bright smile and adopting an overly sweet tone. "Daniela, it seems like I'm not on your radar at all."

"Why?" Daniela responded with a light chuckle.

"Are you attending the banquet tonight? You haven't considered inviting me to join you for some networking.Are you only taking Lillian? We are family, after all."

Daniela arched an eyebrow. "Is that so?"

"Yes, we are all part of the Dury family. We should stick together and lift each other up. Please, Daniela, I'd love to go to the banquet with you tonight. Leave Lillian behind."

Daniela's smile was gentle, her voice teasing, "You're quite demanding, aren't you? Why can't Lillian come?"

Nina made a face, resembling a sulking child. "I just had a small argument with Lillian. I need some space.Daniela, please, just take me."

Daniela gave a nod."Okay."

Nina's face lit up with delight. She quickly glanced at Cedric, who was preoccupied with his phone, and her heart skipped with excitement.

"Daniela, may I stop by Elite Lux's high-end designer section to pick a dress?"

Daniela gave her permission with a nod, "Of course, go pick something nice."

Nina's eyes sparkled. "Thanks so much, Daniela!" As Nina exited the office, she strutted confidently, assured by her victory

Tonight, she believed, Cedric would be completely captivated by her.
###Chapter 360 Unnecessary To Keep Katrina Any Longer


Lillian escorted Katrina to Elite Lux's exclusive wardrobe to pick out an outfit. Amidst the splendid array of garments, Katrina selected a particularly luxurious gown.

The moment she wore the dress, she felt unstoppable.

From the top floor of Elite Lux, Katrina gazed down at the city below, overwhelmed by a sense of supremacy.

Katrina savored this feeling, vowing silently to always live in luxury.

By 6 P.M., Katrina was riding in Daniela's car, gliding smoothly along the streets.

Nina occupied the front seat, while Katrina and Daniela were in the back.

Turning her head, Katrina looked at Daniela, whose poise and confidence were palpable against the backdrop of shifting city lights, mnaking her seem in complete control of her fate.

"Why are you helping me?" Katrina asked in confusion.

Daniela,previously resting with her eyes shut, opened them slowly.

In the car's confined space, her low chuckle resonated, reigniting Katrina's unease. "Why are you laughing?"

Daniela remained silent, and shortly after, the car arrived at the event venue.

Katrina quickly spotted someone she knew and walked over to engage them in conversation.

Nina, still waiting for Cedric to arrive, struck up a casual conversation with Daniela.

"Why do you bother helping Katrina?"

Sipping her drink, Daniela answered,"She's still my stepmother, despite everything. I can't let her face utter humiliation. We are family, after all. Whatever her past actions, I expect her to come around to my side eventually." As she spoke, Daniela's gaze shifted back to Nina, who appeared contemplative.

With a mimicked innocence, Daniela continued, "In her old age, when she can no longer walk, who else wil she depend on but me? Katrina is no fool; she understands the stakes. It's just that she's not ready to shift her loyalty yet. I'm patient. I know she'll confess whatever I need to hear within a few days."

Nina's frown deepened at Daniela's confidence. "You're certain of this?"

Daniela responded with a serene smile, her face illuminated softly by the ambient lighting, giving her an almost otherworldly appearance.

Nina couldn't help but admire Daniela's composed demeanor, even as she felt a pang of jealousy for her seemingly effortless grace.

Distracted by her thoughts, Nina barely caught Daniela's next words. "Katrina has been my stepmother for years. I understand her well. It's no more chalenging than negotiating in the boardroom."

After making this comparison, Daniela fixed her gaze on Nina, who looked visibly unsettled and excused herself to make a phone call.

Daniela continued to engage politely with the guests, accepting a glass of wine with a reserved smile.

In the garden, Nina was on the phone.

"Did Daniela say this herself?" asked the person on the other end of the line.

Nina relayed the conversation. "Daniela seems convinced Katrina will confess soon."

The response from the other end of the phone was a prolonged silence, followed by a chilly declaration.
"Understood. If that's the case, we no longer need to wait."

Nina replied, "Yes. Just make sure it's handled cleanly."

"Don't worry."

Hanging up, Nina spotted Cedric making his way into the hall dressed in a sharp black suit. She straightened her dress and confidently approached the gathering. Daniela, observing Nina's reentry, allowed a slight curl of disdain to touch her lips.

When Katrina finished mingling, she found her place at the dinner table, comforted slightly by seeing Joyce's name next to hers.

Yet,what she saw next caught her off guard.
###Chapter 361 You ldiot



Katrina's brows knitted in confusion as she grabbed Joyce by the arm, her voice filled with disbelief."Joyce, are you out of your mind? Keeping Alexander a lover is one thing, but why would you bring him to the banquet? If Doug finds out, not only will your marriage be over, but your life will be in danger too."



Joyce took a seat calmly. "Mom, don't make it a bigger deal than it is. Doug thinks little of anyone in Olisvine except Daniela. He barely interacts with anyone here and only comes home for two days each month. When he does, he's too wrapped up in having sex with me to care about rumors."



Joyce spoke with unshakable confidence. "And let's not forget, Doug's desires are endless. Do you really think he's being faithful? Why can he step out,but l can't?"



Katrina's expression darkened. "Joyce, don't you get it?Whoever controls the money controls everything.Men can be unfaithful, but they won't tolerate their wives stepping out. It's not about love-it's about ownership. By being his wife, you're his image, and if he finds out you've betrayed him, he won't let you go.You've got a good life, yet you're throwing it away for Alexander. I heard he charges a million per night for  a night with you. Is he some kind of goldmine?"


Joyce glanced over at Alexander. The sharp edge that once defined him had softened, replaced by a docile,submissive aura. She was oddly drawn to this state of submission. Being the center of Alexander's universe thrilled her.



"Mom, you've never been through it,so you wouldn't get the satisfaction," Joyce replied, her tone casual.


Katrina paused, shutting her eyes for a moment. "Fine.I didn't come here to argue. Daniela promised to let me stay in the Harper family's villa if I give her a million dollars."


Joyce frowned just a bit upon hearing that. "You've been asking me for money a lot recently. I remember giving you some just a couple of weeks ago. Mom,I might have married a rich man, but he doesn't treat me like a person: Money doesn't come easy,you know?"



Her frustration was evident in her voice.



Without another word, she quickly wrote out a check and tossed it towards Katrina.



The check landed awkwardly, slapping Katrina's face,a clear sign of Joyce's impatience.



Katrina was shocked. She looked down at the check on the floor, then stared at Joyce in disbelief. Unmoved, Joyce turned her head, catching sight of Daniela making her way to the table.


A smirk spread across Joyce's face, as if she were eager to flaunt a rare prize.


"Alexander, peel a shrimp for me," she commanded,her tone firm, catching the attention of those nearby who loved a bit of drama.



They eagerly awaited to see how the once-proud man now knelt for money under Joyce's control,wondering if Daniela, his ex-wife, still had any ounce of sympathy left for him.


Alexander gripped the shrimp in his hand, already numb from the many humiliations he had endured.


Joyce took pleasure in showing him off, flaunting how the man who once rejected her now groveled like a dog desperate for her approval.


He had long since hardened to such demeaning moments.



But today was different-Daniela was here.


A new wave of humiliation hit Alexander, despite Daniela's silence. His cheeks slowly turned red with shame.


"He can still blush? I thought all his pride had been wiped out."



"Right? Did you hear? Just yesterday in a bar,Joyce made Alexander kneel and lick spilled beer off the table."



The room buzzed with shock, everyone leaning in,eager for more. "And then? What happened?"



The speaker dragged out the words with a mocking tone. "Then Joyce tossed him a million, and he just took it. So, you see-men shouldn't get too cocky.Watch out, or you might end up like Alexander, with your dignity crushed underfoot."


The room erupted in laughter as the words sank in.


Alexander's hands shook ever so slightly as he held the shrimp.


Joyce saw Daniela and sneered, keeping her eyes on her face.



Daniela had always been the one people noticed, and that was still true.


Most of the men in the room were watching her.



Daniela ate calmly while Cedric whispered something to her. She nodded, and he smiled gently, his eyes full of affection.


Only Joyce could see it, but Cedric gently squeezed Daniela's fingers in a gesture full of tenderness.



Cedric was a powerful figure in the business world,yet before Daniela, he always lowered his guard, offering her nothing but affection.


Joyce's hands balled into fists, her eyes blazing with fury.


"Alexander! You fool! You can't even peel a shrimp right. What use are you?"


And with that, a sharp slap rang through the room.
###Chapter 362 Katrina Died



The lively atmosphere filled with laughter and toasts suddenly stilled into an uncomfortable silence.


At a nearby table, Richard could feel a heavy unease settle over him. The sound of the slap made him stand up in stunned disbelief.


He understood how hard it must have been for Alexander to submit to Joyce like this.


He had heard the whispers and clenched his teeth,hoping that once Bennett Group's situation improved,Alexander would finally escape Joyce's grasp.


He never imagined Joyce would stoop so low. She actually humiliated Alexander in front of everyone like that.



Just as Richard was about to step in, Joyce's icy voice cut through the tension. "Peel this plate of shrimps for me!"



Alexander's fingers quivered as he sat still, lost in the heavy silence of the moment.


He could feel the scornful gazes of the others boring into him, yet he remained unmoved. He didn't care anymore.



The only thought that mattered to him now was Daniela.



What would she think of him now?



Would she see him the way everyone else did,like he was just embarrassing himself?



Would she regret pushing him away, leaving him in this mess?



Alexander bit his lip, his eyes wavering as he slowly looked up.



One quick glance, and his heart nearly broke.


Daniela wasn't even looking his way. Cedric showed up with a small plate of roasted ribs and set it in front of her,smiling.



She looked up in surprise as Cedric held out a piece of rib to her lips, his smile soft and inviting.


From where Alexander sat, he could see Daniela's lips part to take the piece of meat, with Cedric's fingers brushing her lips in the briefest touch.


Daniela smiled, her eyes lighting up, as her lips brushed against Cedric's fingertips, over and over.


Cedric, known for his cold and distant reputation,was full of smiles and warmth that no one could have predicted.



Alexander clenched his fists, his heart aching so much it felt like he couldn't breathe.



Every mnoment, every touch, should have been his.



But Cedric had cruelly taken it all away.



It was all because of him.



If Cedric weren't in the picture, Alexander was sure everything would've been different. Daniela would've changed her mind.



The weight of everyone's gaze made Alexander's chest feel heavy, and he couldn't shake the rage burning inside him.



The look in his eyes left everyone stunned, unable to look away.


Joyce, observing from the sidelines, grasped the situation.



She snorted derisively, her voice laced with mockery."Stop fantasizing. You're no longer part of her life. If she truly cared, do you think your struggling company would still require you to exhaust yourself trying to fix it?"



Joyce crushed every last bit of hope Alexander had His fists, once clenched tight, loosened, and his anger drained away as he lowered his gaze. With a heavy heart,heresumed peeling the shrimp, his movements stiff and automatic.



Joyce smiled faintly, exchanging a brief, distant look with Daniela.



Daniela turned away, and Joyce chose not to approach,unwilling to ruin her own mood.



As the banquet neared its conclusion, Katrina stepped forward to speak with Joyce once more. "Joyce, I regret everything."


Although Katrina had expressed regret before, this time,her remorse was unmistakably sincere.



"Joyce,I'll find a way to get some money. Let's leave and start fresh somewhere no one knows us. I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong values, the wrong upbringing, and that's how you became who you are.If I could go back, I wouldn't take any shortcuts. I'd raise you right-raise you to be the most incredible girl in the world."


Joyce blinked, pulling at her lips in a faint smile. "Mom,let's not dwell on the past. It's pointless. We should focus on living well now." And with that, she turned and walked away without a second glance.



Katrina stayed frozen in place, her eyes following Joyce until she disappeared down the road.


After a moment, she typed out a message to Joyce."Joyce,I really loved your yellow bag when we had coffee last time.Could you let me borrow it next time?"



A minute after sending the message, Katrina felt the cold press of a dagger against her back.



Tears streamed down her face as she realized what was happening. She had known this day would come,but she hadn't expected it to be so soon.



Her vision started to fade, and her body gave out,collapsing weakly.



She could hear the panicked screams of those around her and the warmth of blood flowing quickly from an unseen wound.



Struggling, she managed to crack open her eyes.



For a moment, she thought she saw Joyce rushing towards her-her only daughter, the one she loved more than anything.



"Mom? What happened? Mom, please! Help! Is there a doctor here? Someone, please help me!" Katrina's consciousness slowly slipped away.


In her final moments, all she could hear were the heavy footsteps. She forced her eyes open and saw Caiden standing outside the crowd-the man who had once propelled her to the heights of success.


He stood at a distance, his gaze cold and indifferent as it locked with hers.



He made no move to approach her.


As she weakly raised her hand towards him, he spat on the ground with utter disdain.



In that instant, Katrina's fragile spirit broke beyond repair.
###Chapter 363 She Knew How To Charm Anyone
 Caiden's harsh spit of disgust echoed through the air,instantly grabbing Joyce's attention.



She was about to scowl when she saw Katrina's hand,which had been raised, slowly drop.


Panic surged through Joyce, and she cried out in distress,"Mom!"


Daniela stood just off to the side, her eyes tracking the dark figure in black.


She quickly followed, her eyes briefly scanning Caiden's expression, which was as cold and emotionless as stone. A slight frown tugged at her brow.



She couldn't deny her dislike for Katrina, but one thing was clear: Katrina would do anything for Joyce,even if it cost her life.



Caiden, on the other hand, was a different story. He was selfish, wrapped up in his own world.


With a firm resolve, Daniela took a step forward,determined to follow the figure in black as it moved towards the door. Cedric caught sight of Daniela and rushed to follow,but by the time he reached the entrance of the hotel,the busy street outside had already swallowed her up,leaving no trace.



He quickly dialed for the bodyguards, then turned to find Lillian standing nearby, looking completely unfazed by the whole situation.



"What's with that look on your face?" Cedric asked,his voice laced with confusion. Lillian's bond with Daniela was solid, yet she seemed oddly unmoved by her sudden disappearance.


"Huh?" Lillian acted surprised, pouting her lips and putting on an exaggerated worried face. "I'm just so worried. Really panicked. We've got to find Daniela fast. A girl like her shouldn't be out alone after the banquet."



Without waiting another second, she disappeared into the night.



Cedric's features stiffened. He felt something was off,but his concern for Daniela kept him from thinking too much about it.


As he rushed down the street, he finally spotted Lillian at a corner, casually munching on something from a food vendor, completely unbothered.


She instructed the vendor, "Make it extra spicy, with a real kick. Thanks!"



Cedric was at a loss for words.



Moments later, Ryan appeared, just as laid-back,even ordering a beer.



As Cedric walked up to them, Lillian nearly choked on her noodles, and Ryan ended up spraying beer all over the place.



"Cedric, weren't you looking down the other street?Why are you here?"



Cedric squinted his eyes. He had never questioned Daniela's connection with them, but now he was sure of something. "You're keeping something from me,"he said with certainty.



Cedric had a feeling. It was something important,something that would surprise him.


Back at the banquet, Nina searched frantically but couldn't find Cedric anywhere.


From the shadows, Elyse stepped out and said, "Stop looking.He left with Daniela."


Nina stared at her, wide-eyed. "Who did they leave with?"



"Dark Night," Elyse replied calmly. Dark Night was one of the world's most elite mercenaries, known for his secrecy. He only ever appeared to Elyse, always under the cover of night.


Nina froze, struggling to believe it. "What are you talking about, Mom? Are you serious? Dark Night is the best.How could Daniela possibly go with him?"


Elyse was shocked too, but she had seen Daniela leave with Dark Night.


What unsettled her even more was that Dark Night hadn't replied to any of her messages since then.


An uneasy feeling began to stir in her chest.


"This can't be right, Mom," Nina said, her voice tight with disbelief. "Dark Night never fails a mission, and there's no way he'd let a fragile woman follow him. If anyone found out, it would ruin his entire reputation."


Dark Night was a top assassin, offered millions every year,but he chose to remain by Elyse's side.



Why?



Because even the most powerful men couldn't resist beauty, and the women of the Dury family were undeniably breathtaking.



Nina, sensing her mother's growing concern, quickly tried to reassure her. "Mom, go home. Dark Night  could have returned by now. Daniela's disappearance works perfectly. I was already looking for a way to handle Cedric."



With that, she walked into the night.


Her white dress made her look like a ghostly vision.She saw Cedric on the street and quickly adjusted her strap before walking towards him with fake urgency.


"Cedric, have you found Daniela? I'm so worried about her."



Her tears sparkled under the moon, something she had practiced many times in front of the mirror.


Nina was confident-she knew how to charm anyone with just a look.



Over the years, this trick<had never let her down.
###Chapter 364 Cedric Actually Rejected Her
Surprisingly, Cedric's focus was elsewhere, and he seemed irritated by Nina blocking his path.


Nina briefly shut her eyes,wondering if something was wrong with Cedric's sight.


How else could he resist her appeal?



Nina took a deep breath, and just as Cedric was about to turn and walk away, she let out a soft, dramatic "Oh dear!"



Her plan was for Cedric to turn around, and then she'd pretend to faint.


But unfortunately, Cedic didn't even look back and just kept walking. Nina gritted her teeth and fake-fell to the ground.


This time, her "Oh dear!" was much louder, enough to catch Cedric's attention. He turned around, but his expression was one of clear impatience.


Nina brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear and said in a sad tone, "Cedric, I twisted my ankle. Could you help me up?" She raised her arms and pouted. Cedric paused for a moment. "You, take her back to the Dury family," he ordered, looking at his bodyguard.


Nina was shocked.



Before she could protest, the strong bodyguard crouched down and picked her up.


Nina cried out, quickly jumping out of the bodyguard's hold. "I think I'm fine now. My ankle's better."


Cedric shot her an irritated look before walking off,still searching for Daniela.



Nina had no care for what happened to Daniela.



She kept pace with Cedric, her voice soft yet persistent. "Cedric, you've been walking for more than half an hour. Aren't you tired? How about we take a break at this hotel?"



Nina made the suggestion, but seeing Cedric remain unaffected, she pushed further. "Cedric, you really don't have to worry. Daniela is strong, almost like a man. She probably went home. There's a nice cafe nearby. Let me buy you coffee."



Nina couldn't help but admire Cedric's striking profile,made even more captivating by the glow of the night lights.


Her heart fluttered with desire, and without thinking,  she reached out and tugged at his sleeve. In a soft,teasing tone, she said, "Cedric, could you slow down a little? You're walking so fast, I can hardly keep up."


Cedric was anxious and frustrated.



He had a short temper, and Nina's constant attempts to get close had drained all his patience.


He suddenly spun around and looked at Nina coldly,who was staring at him with longing eyes.


His voice was cold as he asked, "What do you want?"


Nina bit her lip, replying, "Don't you know what I want?"



She reached out playfully, trying to touch Cedric's chest, but he stepped back to avoid her.


"I really don't," he answered, his voice distant.



Nina cast her eyes down, her voice gentle and alluring."I understand your feelings for Daniela, but the truth is,she's only focused on her work. If she cared about you,she wouldn't have kept you waiting all this time.Cedric, I've had feelings for you for so long. Don't you notice me? When I was younger, my aunt always said I resembled Daniela a lot. People used to think we were twins. I care about you, Cedric, and I'm not bothered by the idea of being the one you lean on when she's out of reach. I don't mind at all." She took a step closer. Nina's words came from the heart, and soon, tears began to fall.


People passing by glanced over, pitying the delicate woman.



"Do you really think you can compare to Daniela?"


Nina believed her honesty would touch Cedric, but instead,he gave her a cold and dismissive reply.


She was taken aback. "Cedric, Daniela doesn't feel the same way about you. No matter how much you try,you're just another one of her admirers. She enjoys the attention, but she won't treat you like a boyfriend.Can't you see that? You're just a backup to her. The moment someone else catches her eye, she'll leave you behind."


Cedric answered bluntly, "Is that so? I'm fine being a backup. I'm happy to be Daniela's backup forever."


Nina's face darkened at his words. "What did you just say? Cedric, are you out of your mind? You're the wealthiest man in the country, the one every woman dreams of. You should be soaking up their admiration,and yet you're willing to settle as Daniela's backup?That's insane."


Cedric was nothing if not direct.


When it came to relationships, he was careful, always Nina's words came from the heart, and soon, tears began to fall.


People passing by glanced over, pitying the delicate woman.

Cedric was nothing if not direct. When it came to relationships, he was careful, always keeping a respectful distance from women.


He never hesitated to make his rejections clear.


"Yes, I'm okay with being Daniela's backup, but I don't need a replacement. No one can replace her, not in this world. You might look like her in some ways,but you have to understand, beauty goes beyond appearance. There's something about Daniela that you'll never have. You might seem similar on the outside, but inside? It's a whole different story. You'll never match her, not now, not ever. Do you get it?|can't stand anyone but Daniela getting close to me,touching me, or trying to please me. It makes me sick!And I won't tolerate a single word spoken against her in my presence. From now on, stay away from me.And don't call me Cedric. Call me Mr. Phillips,understood?"



Without another word, he turned and walked away, his back cold and unyielding.



Nina was left standing there, stunned, trying to process what she had just heard.



After everything she had done, Cedric rejected her so decisively, without a care for how it made her feel.
###Chapter 365 It Doesn't Make Any Sense
Cedric turned on his heel and walked away as soon as he finished speaking.


Nina stood rooted to the spot,her gaze fixed on his retreating figure.


"Well, what did I tell you? Someone like you could never capture the interest of a man like Cedric!" Elyse showed up beside Nina, her face calm and completely unsurprised. "Men like him? They're drawn to women who shine, not ones who stumble in their shadow.You'd do better waiting for Daniela to come back-save yourself the embarrassment."



Nina bit her lower lip, her fists curling tightly at her sides.



Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at Elyse with sadness. "Mom, do you really think I'm destined to fail at everything? Am I always inferio to Natalie in your eyes?"



Elyse's response was cold and cutting,her calmness cruel. "Isn't the proof right there? You're not just a disappointment to me, Nina. Even Cedric thinks so." With that,Elyse turned away and left.



Nina stayed behind, her shoulders trembling as tears spilled freely.


Silently,she made a vow-a vow to prove everyone wrong, to show them that she wasn't just Natalie's lesser sister.



Later that evening, Daniela returned home, leaving Dark Night to her subordinates to handle.


At the villa's entrance, Caiden was waiting. The moment he saw Daniela approaching, his words tumbled out. "The police said Katrina was stabbed to death."



As Caiden spoke, he carefully studied Daniela. "You don't seem surprised," he ventured cautiously,his voice tinged with unease.


Truth be told, Caiden was scared.



Daniela's gaze flicked over him, his emotions plainly written across his face.



She slipped off her shoes and asked, "What exactly are you trying to say?"



Caiden swallowed hard. There was something about her-a quiet menace that simmered just beneath the surface. Usually well-concealed, today it seemed more apparent, now bubbling closer to the top. "I don't mean anything by it. I just hope you don't get the wrong idea," he replied, avoiding her gaze.


Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "The wrong idea about what?"



He flinched at her tone. "I know you never liked Katrina. You always thought there was something suspicious about your mother's death."


Caiden was eager to distance himself from the situation. "But I swear, whatever happened,I wasn't involved. It had nothing to do with me!"


His gaze was fixed on Daniela, as he waited for her reaction.



Daniela entered the room and poured herself a glass of water. "Is that so? You're absolutely certain it has nothing to do with you?"


Caiden's eyes went wide with shock in an instant.


Daniela turned her head slowly, her clear, steady gaze locking with his. "Do you think Katrina had something to do with my mother's death? And who do you believe is responsible for Katrina's murder?"



Daniela let out a low chuckle, her tone laced with audacity. "Or is it that you think I killed Katrina?"



Her words came out with unnerving candor. Caiden froze, caught off guard by her bluntness. He had expected evasion, maybe deflection-not this direct confrontation. His eyes darted nervously, guilt flickering. "I don't know. All I know is that it has nothing to do with me. If you're planning to stir up trouble, don't drag me into it."


Without waiting for a reply, Caiden spun on his heel,intent on fleeing the suffocating tension.


But he hadn't taken more than a few steps when Daniela's voice echoed behind him. "You can't outrun the consequences of your actions."



The words hit him like a blow to the back, forcing him to halt.



A shiver crawled down his spine as he stood frozen in place. Slowly, almost unwillingly,he turned around.


What he saw made his blood turn to ice. Daniela stood with unwavering confidence, her arms raised, hands mimicking the shape of a gun.



At that precise moment, a gust of wind barreled through the hallway, slamming the door shut with a deafening bang. The sound reverberated like a gunshot, perfectly accentuating her mock gesture.


His breath hitched, and the chill of terror settled deep into his bones as Daniela's smile widened. He stood there, rooted to the spot,words failing him as dread coursed through his veins.


Without another glance, Daniela turned and strode gracefully into the house.


When Cedric returned later that evening, he found Daniela already home.



"You're back," Daniela greeted him, her smile warm and composed.


Cedric lingered by the doorway. "You came home earlier than I expected."


"Yes. The banquet was draining. I needed some time to myself."



Cedric stood at the door, quietly watching Daniela.After a moment, he stepped inside. "Katrina is dead.Did you hear about it?"



Daniela nodded. "I saw it on the news."



"You don't seem surprised," Cedric observed.



Daniela's smile didn't falter. "Why should I be? I was there when it happened. I saw everything unfold with my own eyes. Isn't it natural that I wouldn't be shocked?"



"This doesn't add up," he replied.
###Chapter 366 What Am I To You
Daniela let out a soft laugh. "Hmm?"


"I said, this doesn't add up." Cedric rarely spoke so seriously.


In all their time together, he had always been gentle with Daniela-patient and considerate, never raising his voice, let alone challenging her like this.


But now, his expression was grave,his face stripped of its usual warmth or even a hint of a smile.



Although there was only a sofa separating them,Cedric suddenly felt as though Daniela was an ocean away.



For the first time, he realized he might not know her as well as he thought.


"You're completely convinced that Katrina killed your mother. If you wanted to take action against her,there are countless ways you could've ensured her death-or even made her suffer a fate worse than death."



Daniela listened quietly.



Cedric's voice was steady and deliberate as he  continued, "But you never made a move. It wasn't out of fear-fear has never held you back. You've always known that some things are worse than death, like a life filled with misery. You made sure Caiden saw who Katrina truly was, exposed her real self to Joyce,and let everyone witness her selfishness. You cut her off from everyone, leaving her utterly alone. You wouldn't have gone to such lengths just for her story to end so abruptly today."


Daniela's lips curled into a soft, almost playful chuckle."But she's gone now, isn't she?"



The open window let the curtains dance in the breeze,giving the room an almost haunting atmosphere and making the figure near the doorway seem otherworldly.


Cedric felt a sharp twinge of sorrow. "Yes, Katrina is dead,but you don't seem surprised. You're not unsettled, and it's clear her death hasn't thrown off your plans. That can only mean you knew this was going to happen all along."



Daniela arched a brow, caught off guard by Cedric's perceptiveness.



There was more than just warmth in her gaze-there was a quiet admiration as well.


Daniela explained, "I didn't kill Katrina." Cedric responded without hesitation, "I know. If you let Katrina die, it means there's a bigger plan at play.It has to tie back to the conspiracy surrounding your mother's death."



In that moment, the carefully guarded layers of Daniela's secrets were stripped away.


She offered a soft smile. "Anything else?"



Cedric's voice was steady as he asked, "What do l mean to you?"



Daniela hnad braced herself for a biting remark,expecting Cedric to unleash his frustration.


But instead, his tone softened, losing its usual sharpness, as he asked quietly, "Daniela, what am I to you?"



Daniela's smile faded completely. She stood rooted in place, unable to move.


In the stillness of the villa, bathed in harsh lights,Daniela could almost feel the vulnerability hiding beneath Cedric's usually impenetrable exterior.


He had laid his heart out for her to see. His voice,though soft, carried an edge of pain."I've never tried to control what you do. You've always known the only line I draw is your safety. I thought you understood that,but now I see you don't. You never value your  own life. Whether it was confronting Katrina on the rooftop, putting yourself at risk with the real culprit,or chasing after that man in black alone tonight-it's always the same. Daniela, I don't ask for much, but l need to know this. What do I mean to you, Daniela?"


Daniela bit her lip, her hand at her side tightening into a fist.



She wanted to brush it off, like she always did, but this time, she couldn't bring herself to smile or pretend it didn't matter. Cedric's words were too heavy, too honest.


She stayed silent, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.


Cedric, watching her, nodded slowly, as if the truth was already settling in. "You won't even give me a fake answer now, will you? You've always left me with a way out. That's why our relationship is a secret.When it's just us, you let me be with you however l want, but the moment anyone else is around, you keep me in the shadows. People think I'm just some guy chasing after you. But is that what it is, Daniela?Are you so good at hiding your feelings for me, or..."



He took a shaky breath, his eyes dark with sorrow.



Daniela's heart clenched at the rawness in his voice.



Then came the sharp, mocking edge in Cedric's tone. "So,what am I to you? Am I just someone who can be discarded whenever you choose? Do you see me as your husband, or am I just someone you feel obligated to show affection to?"



The words had been buried deep inside him,festering for too long. Cedric had told himself countless times that as long as Daniela stayed by his side, nothing else mattered.



If she didn't want to talk about it, he wouldn't push.If she didn't want to go public with their relationship,he would quietly remain her hidden partner, happy to be in the background, seen as nothing more than a friend by everyone else.



None of it had ever bothered him.


But seeing Daniela continue to put herself in danger,he could no longer keep his feelings contained.


As soon as the questions left his lips, he regretted it.



The silence in the villa stretched on, and Cedric's heartbeat thundered in his ears.


He was terrified of the answer he might hear. The thought that Daniela might end their relationship made his stomach churn.



When he felt her about to speak, panic hit him. For the first time ever, Cedric turned and ran, too scared to face what might come next.
###Chapter 367 Katrina Died With Unfinished Business
That night, Cedric ended up sleeping in Daniela's lounge at Elite Lux.



The next morning, Nina walked in and was taken aback when she saw him there.



Her eyes widened in surprise, but as soon as she remembered how bluntly he had rejected her the night before, she paused, quietly collecting herself.


"Good morning, Mr. Phillips," Nina greeted,her voice steady and calm.



She knew well that men often valued what was hard to get, not what was always there for them.


So she kept her cool, maintaining a slight aloofness.She even tried to mirror Daniela's usual smile,offering a soft grin.



Cedric greeted back and left Daniela's lounge without a second glance.


Nina watched his retreating figure with a smirk,then quickly looked down at her phone.


"Mom,it seems like Daniela and Cedric had a fight!!!" Nina texted, making sure to add three exclamation marks for emphasis.



She could feel the excitement bubbling up. This was her chance.



If the two of them had fought, that meant there was some kind of crack in their perfect relationship.something that couldn't easily be fixed.


Now,all she needed to do was get Cedric drunk. With her slight resemblance to Daniela, she was sure it would be enough to win him over.


Nina's chest swelled with pride as she imagined her plan coming to life.



Standing nearby,Elyse frowned slightly.



She didn't buy Nina's theory.


After all, what kind of man, after arguing with his woman, would sulk and sleep in an office lounge? It didn't add up.



If Cedric truly didn't care for Daniela, he wouldn't have stayed behind like that.


But Elyse said nothing.


She was used to Nina making a fool of herself, so she let her continue with her little schemes. When Natalie returned, that would be Elyse's true support for the future.


Elyse nodded, turning to Nina. "You better take this chance while you can."



Nina's eyes brightened as she eagerly nodded in agreement.


That day, Daniela didn't come back to Elite Lux.



Katrina was dead, and according to Caiden, she didn't deserve much of a send-off.


He was cold and detached, as if he'd never spent years of marriage with her.


"Anyway, that's how I feel. She's gone, and no amount of mourning will change that. So why make a fuss? Isn't it embarrassing enough?" he said, his voice void of any emotion.



Joyce glared at him, her disappointment cutting deep.


"Caiden Harper! I've already said I'll cover the costs.You won't pay a dime. But my mother's funeral has to be grand. She was your wife, for God's sake! Can't you at least do this for her?"



Joyce clenched her jaw, the memory of a hot summer day flashing in her mind. She was just a little girl, standing at the top of the stairs, watching Caiden and Katrina together, their breathing loud in the silence.


She wanted to go down, to run to her mother and ask,"Mom,what are you doing? Why are you with him?"


But she stayed where she was. It was as if she understood something, but not completely. She simply stood there,silently watching for a long time.


What she couldn't make sense of as a child, she now understood as an adult.



She had always believed Caiden and Katrina had married,despite the scandal, because they loved each other.


But now, all she could see was Caiden's ugly true nature.



"Either you take Katrina away, or if she's going to be buried as my wife, it's on my terms. Don't make a spectacle of it. Just bury her quietly. I've been humiliated enough because of her. Why should I keep suffering for her even after she's dead? She's gone,Joyce. Don't you get it? The living are what matter."


Joyce was stunned by Caiden's shamelessness,her eyes wide in disbelief. She couldn't believe he could be this cold. "Is that all she is to you now? Just a dead body?" Caiden didn't hesitate. "What else?"



Joyce's heart shattered. She nodded, then turned to Daniela. "What do you think? Will you let me take my mother's body?"



Daniela had never seen Joyce so firm before, but she couldn't help a faint smile. "It's your choice."


Joyce narrowed her eyes at Daniela. "Really? You don't see her just as a body, do you?"



Daniela arched an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.



Joyce continued, "I know you always believed my mother was responsible for your mother's death. But I've asked her, and she swore she had nothing to do with it. Daniela, you've wronged someone who had no part in this."



Daniela's face remained stoic, her tone cold. "I didn't do it, Joyce. You need to think this through. If it had been me, Katrina would have been long gone by now,a hundred times over."



Joyce scoffed in mockery. "Do you expect me to buy that?"



Daniela's expression stayed cold. "I don't care if you do or not. Even if I had done it, what could you possibly do about it? Some might kiss up to Doug for his wealth, but to me? He's nothing." Joyce's face drained of color at Daniela's biting words.



Daniela let out a soft chuckle, her eyes glinting. ”didn't do it, but given everything that's happened,I can't say I'm upset with how things turned out."



Just before Katrina died,she whispered an apology in Daniela's ear, saying, "I know I was wrong. Please, for the sake of my death, spare Joyce."



Daniela smiled and leaned in just as close and whispered,"In your dreams."


When Katrina finally passed, her eyes stayed wide open for a long time, as though unwilling to let go of something.



The word around town was that Katrina had died with unfinished business.
###Chapter 368 Did I Disturb You
In the end, Joyce decided not to take Katrina's body away. If she did, it would've sparked all kinds of rumors.


And on top of that, Doug wouldn't have let her bring back a dead body.


Business people were often scared of bad luck and superstitions.


Joyce knew she couldn't go against Doug, so she walked away, her heart heavy with sorrow. She kept looking back, her eyes filled with resentment,locking onto Daniela with a cold, murderous gaze. "Daniela!Just wait! I'll make you pay for this," she muttered under her breath.



The day of Katrina's burial was kept incredibly simple.


It was so basic it almost felt sad. What they'd done for her barely qualified as a funeral.


Caiden wasn't there at all. The housekeeper mentioned he'd gone fishing first thing in the morning.


The once-glamorous woman had such a lonely,desolate end. Daniela lingered for a moment in front of Katrina's simple tombstone, then turned and walked away slowly.



She hadn't thought she'd run into Alexander there.



"You really went too far," Alexander said coldly.


Daniela arched an eyebrow at him.


He went on, "Joyce cried all night. She's sure you planned Katrina's death. Doug's got power, and with his money, Joyce could build an empire. It's not out of the question."



"Oh really? She can give it a try," Daniela said, staring at the fading sunset with a neutral expression.



Alexander opened his mouth, but Daniela's icy gaze stopped him, a half-smile playing on her lips. "I lost my mother too, suddenly, and had to grow up fast.Joyce is too naive. I'm actually curious to see how far she can go. Honestly, I'm kind of looking forward to it."



Alexander clenched his jaw. "She'll use me against you.Don't you see that yet?"


Daniela let out a soft laugh. "In that case, I'll take back what I said. If her big move is just you, I'm not interested. You're not even worth being my opponent."She flashed a faint, sarcastic smile at Alexander. Ignoringthe pale color draining from his face, she turned and walked away.



By the time she reached the foot of the mountain,she saw Cedric standing there, holding an umbrella.


The chilly, intense vibe around her melted away instantly as she saw him. "You're here!"


Cedric didn't say a word, just pressed his lips together,and tilted the umbrella towards her.



He had driven himself here. Daniela climbed into Cedric's car and her driver followed behind.



"Are you upset?" Daniela asked, though comforting others wasn't exactly her thing.



She'd never been one to hold back with those around her,always speaking her mind.


Cedric was an exception, though.


"If you're not going to tell me the truth, then don't bother trying to coax me. I'm not angry, and I don't need your pity."



Daniela's first try at offering comfort was a complete flop.



Later when she told Lillian about Cedric's response,Lillian burst out laughing so hard she had to hold her stomach. "Looks like you've offended him this time."



Daniela sighed. After Cedric dropped her off, he headed back to Elite Lux's lounge to rest.


Since they'd gotten together, they hadn't spent much time apart.



Honestly, Daniela wasn't used to being apart from him.


But for the moment, she wasn't sure how to comfort him-or maybe, she just hadn't figured out how to open up yet.



She sat quietly on the swing in the courtyard, her eyes tracing the bright moon hanging in the sky.



She wished Cedric could wait just a little longer.



In six months, she promised herself, she would have everything sorted out. By then, the danger would be behind her, and she would finally be able to tell the world that Cedric was her lawful husband.



And then, he would understand the depth of her feelings.



Nina had been watching for a few days now.



Lately, Cedric had been going back to the lounge to sleep every night, no matter how late it was.


Even if he went to a banquet with Daniela, he'd always come back after dropping her off.



Tonight was no exception.


Nina went home, enjoyed a long hot bath, put on some perfume, and slipped into sexy lingerie beneath a big trench coat. Then she headed straight for Elite Lux.



As the night grew darker, Nina watched the elevator numbers rise, her heart pounding in anticipation.



Tonight,everything she'd dreamed of, all the effort she'd put into this moment,would finally pay off.


With a bottle of wine in hand, she couldn't help but smile as she pushed open the door to Daniela's office.


But as the door swung open, her smile instantly froze."Ryan? What are you doing here?"



The door between the CEO's office and the lounge was open, revealing Ryan and Cedric sitting at the table,sipping red wine.



Both Ryan and Cedric were surprised to see Nina.



Cedric furrowed his brow. "What are you doing here?"


He was still wearing his deep blue silk shirt from the banquet, his long legs fitting perfectly in his trousers.


Typically serious and distant, he seemed more relaxed  now.


Under the moonlight, Cedric looked incredibly handsome, almost like he wasn't real.


Nina swallowed nervously, her voice barely above a whisper. "I came back to the secretary's office to grab something. I saw the light on, so I came in. Did I disturb you?"



Cedric turned his gaze away, speaking without emotion. "No. You can leave now. Close the door behind you."



Nina curled her red lips into a smile. "Are you upset?This wine is really good. Want to give it a try? It has an amazing taste."



She raised the bottle of wine and, without waiting for his response, walked into the room with it.
###Chapter 369 Seduction



Nina uncorked the bottle of wine with a practiced ease that spoke of experience.



Before Cedric could even furrow his brows, she had already filled the glasses and set them neatly in front of him and Ryan.



Nina's alcohol tolerance had been honed deliberately,so much so that saying she could outdrink almost anyone wasn't far from the truth.



Ryan and Cedric, for their part, were no strangers to holding their liquor.



Ryan's tongue loosened as the alcohol worked its magic. With a mischievous grin,he turned to Nina as she took her seat. "So, are you into Cedric?"


Nina ducked her head, her lips curling into a bashful smile as a blush bloomed across her cheeks. "Oh,don't say that! If Daniela hears, she'll be upset. Besides,someone like Cedric is way out of my league.He's like a star shining high in the heavens, and I'm just a tiny speck of dust on the earth-completely unworthy."


While speaking, Nina's eyes flickered up ever so briefly, her gaze resting on Cedric's lips. The sight sent a soft flutter through her chest. Cedric remained largely quiet, his silence only fueling the quiet adoration blooming in Nina's heart.



Determined to hold his attention, she worked tirelessly to find topics of conversation, all while skillfully refilling their glasses without drawing notice.


Cedric, brooding and moody, continued to drink with little hesitation.



Ryan matched him drink for drink, and despite Nina having made threetrips downstairs to fetch more wine,neither man seemed remotely affected.



"We're out of wine?" Ryan asked, casting a glance at the collection of empty bottles littering the table.



"Yes, that's it," Nina said, spreading her hands in mock defeat.



She had hoped Ryan would take the hint and leave,but instead, Cedric rose to his feet and said, "If we're out,you two should go."



At Cedric's words, Nina quickly jumped in. "Oh, wait! I just remembered-l've got a bottle of excellent vintage at home. You two stay put, and I'll bring it over."



With that, Nina pulled out her phone and dialed Elyse.



"What? Cedric actually drank your wine?" Nina's voice brimmed with excitement. "Yes! They're upstairs right now, waiting for it. Mom, you still have those century-old bottles, right? Please send someone to bring them over. After tonight, Cedric will be mine."


Elyse sounded doubtful. "Are you sure Cedric actually asked for your wine, or is this just your idea?"



Irritated, Nina shot back, "Mom, what's thatsupposed to mean? You've always thought Natalie is better than me. Do you really think Cedric should just sit around and wait for her to come back instead of noticing me?"


Elyse stiffened,realizing Nina had read her thoughts perfectly.



Nina's voice turned shaky, tinged with tears. "I'm not asking you to favor me over anyone. I just want a little fairness. It's just a few bottles of wine. Can't you give them to me? Natalie's incredible, I get that, but I'm not any less! I'll prove to you that, for Cedric, I'm the only one who matters."



Elyse sighed, clicking her tongue. "Look at you-getting all worked up when I've barely said anything.Fine, fine. It's just a few bottles of wine. I'll have someone send them over. You're my daughter, after all. Give it half an hour."


With that, the call ended. Nina stayed downstairs, waiting impatiently.



She felt not a shred of gratitude towards Elyse.



Nina was well aware Elyse had only caved because she feared Cedric might actually take an interest in her.A few bottles of wine were hardly a sacrifice.


True to Elyse's word, the wine arrived exactly half an hour later.



Nina stepped into the elevator, deliberately movig at a slow pace.


Earlier, Ryan and Cedric had downed a fair amount.Nina knew some people only felt the effects after a delay, and when it hit, it hit hard.


She hoped Ryan was one of those delayed ty/pes.


Once Ryan passed out, she intended to stride in with the wine and murmur sweet, carefully chosen words into Cedric's ear.



In her mind, there was no way Cedric could resist her charm.
###Chapter 370 If You Say You Want To Leave
Nina paused outside the room, hesitating for a moment.



A wave of unease swept over her.



She worried Cedric and Ryan might either leave or drink themselves into oblivion. After all, she'd heard that when men got too drunk, certain functions stopped working.



Forcing a smile, she slowly eased the door open.


Stepping inside, she came to an abrupt halt.



Ryan was still deep in conversation with Cedric. Nina shut her eyes momentarily,swallowing her frustration.



She couldn't fathom what could keep two grown men talking for this long.



How much longer did Ryan plan on hanging around as the third wheel?



Nina approached with a practiced smile, carefully refilling their glasses.



She settled beside them, playing the gracious host as  day faded into night.


At one point, Cedric stood to adjust the heater,and Nina's eyes instinctively trailed down to the exposed skin beneath his loosened collar.



Her gaze lingered for mere seconds before Cedric shifted again.


Nina tilted her head with a bashful smile. "Mr. Phillips,it's truly an honor to meet you. When I learned you frequented Elite Lux, I told my mother I wanted to train under Daniela-just to have a chance to see you more often."



Cedric turned his gaze to the window, staring at the moon. The faint fragrance Daniela often left behind still lingered in the air.


He found himself missing Daniela, far more than he was willing to admit.



Nina had been speaking for a while now, clearly fishing for a reaction from Cedric.


She paused, but he remained silent, his eyes fixed on the moon, lost in his thoughts.


Cautiously, Nina ventured, "Are you thinking about Daniela?"



Cedric wasn't easy to engage, so Nina chose to steer the conversation towards the one subject that might capture his attention.


She started recounting stories about Daniela and her childhood.


Nina described how deeply connected Daniela had been with Brylee and how everything in her life unraveled after Brylee's passing.


Cedric leaned in slightly, his focus sharpening as he listened.


He displayed no sign of impatience, silently taking in every detail Nina divulged about Daniela's past.


"As a child, Daniela used to laugh endlessly. Her smile was radiant. But after Brylee's death, that smile vanished and never returned."



Nina's eyes met Cedric's for a fleeting moment, and her heartbeat quickened in response.


"It had to be some deep-seated trauma, like Daniela lost her capacity to love. Even when she was with Alexander, she chased him and did everything for him,yet she never truly let him in. Even then, we suspected she might never fully open her heart to anyone again."



Nina's tone carried a calm yet resolute certainty.



"Mr. Phillips, please don't take it personally. It's not that she dislikes you; it's that she doesn't know how to like anyone. To her, relationships feel too fragile, and  deep down, she struggles to trust anyone. That applies to anyone she might end up with, honestly.Maybe it's for the best you two aren't together.She doesn't coddle anyone, and she's not one to express her feelings. Whoever ends up with her someday will have a challenging time. My mother always says that even if Daniela marries someone, she'd never fully accept them in her heart. She just doesn't let her guard down."



With a faint, innocent smile, Nina added, "When Alexander brought up divorce, Daniela agreed without hesitation and never looked back. When someone ever wants to know if Daniela truly loves him,he could tell her he's leaving. If she tries to stop him, then she genuinely cares."



Cedric's fingers tightened around his wine glass as he sat in prolonged silence. At last, he asked, "So what you're saying is, if Daniela genuinely loves someone andhe tries to leave,she'll undoubtedly try to stop him?"


Nina nodded confidently. "Exactly. She bottles everything up. If she ever speaks up and asks someone to stay, it means that person holds a permanent place in her heart."



Nina poured herself another glass of wine. After taking a sip, she said, "But honestly, Daniela probably won't let anyone stay close to her. She's too guarded. She had loved Alexander for ten years, yet now she's cast him aside without a second thought."


Nina shrugged casually. "From what I've heard,Alexander only ended up with Joyce because Daniela rejected him. That's why he's so desperate to hold on to Joyce-he has nowhere else to go."


As she spoke, Nina stole a quick glance at Cedric.


She was sure that after hearing this, Cedric, regardless of his feelings for Daniela, would see it was time to let go.


Wasn't Cedric the sharpest man around, famous for steering clear of unnecessary risks?


Pressing her lips together briefly, Nina said, "You're an incredible man with no shortage of admirers. Why not explore a bit more? Your ideal match might already be right there,waiting for you to see her."


Her words were heavy with implication.



She felt confident Cedric would understand her meaning.


Tilting her head slightly, she took another sip of her wine.



The moonlight spilled across the floor outside, casting a radiant glow.


Together, the three of them drained bottle after  bottle.



Nina carried most of the conversation, while Cedric appeared lost in his thoughts.


By the time dawn broke, Nina's head spun with dizziness. Cedric arranged for a female driver to take her home, while Ryan lay slumped over the table,completely unconscious.


Cedric's eyes, however, remained piercing and focused.


He scanned the room quietly, taking it all in.


Nina's words echoed repeatedly in his mind. "If you say you're leaving and Daniela asks you to stay, that's how you'll know she truly cares about you."


Cedric's fingers clenched tightly around his glass.


Suddenly, he rose and strode towards the restroom.


Despite the early hour, he turned on the cold shower.



Refreshed, Cedric changed into clean clothes,grabbed his keys, and headed straight to the parking lot.


The moment the engine roared to life, he drove off without a second thought.

 
As Daniela opened her door, the first thing she spotted was Cedric's car parked outside.
###Chapter 371 Give Me Another Chance
Daniela saw Cedric too.



As she got closer, the sharp scent of alcohol hit her.



"Have you been drinking?" she asked, her eyes darting towards his car.



There was a driver sitting inside.


Relieved, she let out a small breath before adding,"Why are you here so early?"



The night before, Ryan had told her he'd be going out for drinks with Cedric.


When Ryan didn't come home, Daniela eventually gave up waiting and went to bed after midnight.


This morning, when she asked the building's security guard,he mentioned that Ryan and Cedric had been out drinking until the early hours. Naturally,she thought Cedric would still be sleeping.


"I just wanted to stop by," Cedric replied. On the drive over, his mind had been racing as he pieced together the questions he wanted to ask. But the second he arrived and saw Daniela step out,every word he'd practiced vanished. His mind was a mess.


He wanted to prove he was worth something.someone deserving of love, even though he knew it was a risky move.


Alexander had once warned him that he'd end up just like him, but Cedric brushed it off as nonsense.



He had gotten this far on his own.


While he wasn't on Daniela's level financially, he never saw himself as beneath her.



Cedric had his own unique sense of pride.


Yet, relationships were the one area where he felt completely out of his depth.


His pulse pounded in his ears, and he feared blurting something out only to be met with the response he dreaded most.


After a moment of inner struggle, Cedric finally forced himself to speak, meeting Daniela's curious gaze. "I'm heading out on a business trip. Just came to grab my luggage."



Daniela studied him carefully. "A business trip? That's strange. I haven't heard about Phillips Group closing  any out-of-town deals lately."


Cedric's response was stiff. "It's an old client. Just keeping up connections."


The moment he said it, he noticed the tension in his tone and quickly added, "It's, uh, sort of urgent."


Daniela gave a small nod. "Okay."


He feIt her gaze linger on him and tightened his fists."Actually, it's not that urgent."


Daniela frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"


Cedric,still hesitant to let the matter rest, couldn't bring himself to ask directly. His mind raced in all directions before he finally blurted, "So do you want me to leave?"



Daniela looked at him and asked, "Is something bothering you?"


"If you just ask me to stay, I won't leave. I'll stay here in Olisvine for good," he replied.


Daniela figured he was probably still under the influence of last night's drinking. "If you've got work to handle, just go. It's only for a few days-it's not a big deal."


Disappointment surged through Cedric at her casual response. He clenched his fists tightly, his voice dropping to a low murmur. "So, it really doesn't matter to you if I'm here or not, does it? Am I just like Alexander in your eyes? You stayed with him out of gratitude, and with me, it's out of pity, I guess. You couldn't bear to see me falling apart, so you gave me a chance. But you never truly cared about Alexander, and you don't care about me either. When he said he was leaving,you didn't hesitate to let him go. And now that I'm saying I'll leave, you're completely fine with it. You didn't even think to ask me to stay. That just proves you don't feel anything for me."



Daniela stared at him, confused. "What are you saying?Are you even talking to me? I can't hear you."


Cedric shook his head, weariness etched across his features. "Forget it. I'll just grab my things."


Sensing something wasn't right, Daniela opened her mouth to say something, but Lillian's voice called out from afar.


Daniela responded and turned back to address Cedric,only to see he had already disappeared into the villa.


Meanwhile, Elyse was at home when a phone call nearly sent her over the edge.


Standing by the front door, she took Nina from the driver, her expression clouded with unmistakable  displeasure.


She placed Nina onto the sofa with little care before recording a voice message to send to Natalie.



"Darling,when are you coming back? Nina's stupidity is driving me insane! I can't believe I gave birth to such an airhead. She asked me for fancy bottles of wine to get Cedric drunk, and guess what? He was completely sober, and she got wasted instead and was sent home.Do you know what that means? It means even when she threw herself at him, he didn't want her! What a humiliation for this family!"



Elyse ended the recording with an exasperated huff.


A reply came from Natalie minutes later. If one wasn't listening closely, her voice could easily be mistaken for Daniela's.



"Mom,don't stress. Whatever's happening with Cedric and Daniela, he's going to be mine in the end."



Elyse's eyes lit up with astonishment. "Sweetheart,your voice-it's uncanny how much it sounds like Daniela's. How on earth are you pulling that off?"



Natalie, ever the psychologist and a keen observer of human behavior, had a small smile in her tone as she replied, "It's just a little trick I picked up. I've been experimenting lately. Don't worry, I'll be back next week." Elyse was so overjoyed she nearly clapped her hands.


Natalie had always been her pride and joy-the type of daughter who excelled in every field, earning the admiration of teachers and the envy of other parents.


"Alright, sweetheart, I'll be counting the days," Elyse said warmly before ending the call.


But her excitement evaporated the second her eyes landed on Nina, stretched out on the sofa.



Nina had slept the entire day.



When she finally began to stir, she noticed Elyse sitting on the couch,watching the news.


Elyse heard the movement but didn't bother to look over, her voice cold as she asked, "You're awake?"


Nina blinked, still piecing together her fragmented memory.



She pulled off the blanket covering her and frowned at her wrinkled dress. "Mom, how did I get home?"



"The driver brought you back. Nina, do you remember what I told you when you were little?"


Nina adjusted the blanket nervously, her unease growing. "What do you mean?"


Elyse's gaze didn't soften as she continued, "I told you  that a person should only try what they're actually capable of. You recall that, don't you?"



Nina bit her lip but didn't reply.



Elyse's simmering anger boiled over as she gestured at Nina's disheveled state.



"Look at you! Do you even realize how ridiculous you looked? If you don't have the skill, stop pretending otherwise.You wasted my expensive wine, and Cedric doesn't even care about you. He never has. From this moment on, don't even think about stepping foot in Elite Lux again."



Nina's eyes widened in disbelief. Panic set in as she sat up straighter. "No, Mom! Please, just give me another chance! I can make it work!"
###Chapter 372 Nina's Unwillingness
Elyse shut down Nina's pleas without a second thought.


To her, Nina was trapped in a delusion.


There was no way Cedric could ever have feelings for Nina.



Had Cedric truly been interested,even a little, he wouldn't have let the chance slip by yesterday.


The fact that Cedric hadn't even touched Nina spoke volumes.


"You need to tell Daniela today that you're returning to Harper Group to help me,Elyse instructed.


Nina cried out, her voice trembling with desperation."No! Please,give me another chance!"


Elyse gave Nina a frosty look before turning her attention back to the television. "I've already told you,Cedric doesn't like you."



"Is that so?" Nina rose, her face bathed in the ghostly glow of the TV screen. "Is it that Cedric doesn't like me, or are you just scared he might?" Elyse snapped back, "What nonsense are you talking about?"



"If it's not true, then why are you pushing me back to Harper Group? Is it because my sister is coming back?You're trying to make room for her, aren't you? As soon as I leave, you'll have Daniela bring Natalie into Elite Lux, right? Why is it always like this? Why do you favor her over me? Natalie likes Cedric, and so do 1.1won't give up! Cedric didn't make a move last night because he's not like other men you can judge by ordinary standards. He respects me enough to hold back. He didn't want to do anything while I wasn't fully sober."



Nina's voice took on a more assured tone.



Elyse laughed derisively in response. "You're just dreaming."



"I'm not leaving Elite Lux or Cedric. This time, I'm fighting for my own happiness!"



Elyse turned her head slowly to look at Nina. She had never anticipated her typically obedient daughter would challenge her so openly. "Do you know where Cedric went after dropping you off?"



Nina looked taken aback. "Where did he go?"


"He packed his bags and left the country. If he truly cared about you, would he really be avoiding you like  this? Nina, you've already embarrassed yourself enough in front of Daniela. How am I supposed to get anything from her now? I don't care what you have planned, but today, you're going to tell Daniela you want to go back to Harper Group. Refuse, and I'll cut off your financial support."



Daniela sat in her office, still reflecting on Cedric's strange behavior when Nina knocked and entered. Her eyes were swollen and puffy.


"Daniela..." Nina choked out, tears streaming down her face, her appearance pitiful. "My mom says I'm useless at Elite Lux and wants me to go back to Harper Group. But I really enjoy working for you,Daniela. I'd do anything to stay with you."



Elyse stood at the doorway, intending to escort Nina back to Harper Group. Instead, she overheard Nina's pleading, and her expression darkened.


"My mom threatened to freeze my card if I didn't listen. Please, talk to her for me. I promise I'll follow your instructions. Just say a few kind words for me.I swear I'll behave."



Nina had an uncanny ability to appear pitiful.



The sight of her tears falling made anyone nearby want to offer comfort.
###Chapter 373 Where Is Cedric's Room
The door flew open with a sharp crack as Elyse stepped inside.



Before Daniela could react, Elyse struck Nina across the face with a resounding slap.



"What are you even saying? What do you think you can do here? All you do is cause trouble for your cousin. Come on,let's go!"



With a forced smile, Elyse turned to Daniela and added, "Daniela, Nina's just being childish. Please don't take it personally. I'll take her away so you can focus on your work."



Nina collapsed to the floor, her eyes filled with sorrow.



She shoved Elyse's hand away and fell to her knees at Daniela's feet. "Please, help me! My mom always favors my sister and wants me to step aside for her sake.But | want to stay by your side and prove myself."



Nina repeatedly slammed her forehead onto the floor with dull thuds.


In no time, blood started to trickle from her forehead. Crimson streaks ran down her face, yet Nina, once delicate, seemed unfazed. She was resolute,determined to stay at all costs.



Nina understood all too clearly the fate that awaited her.



If she didn't fight for what she desired and failed to win Cedric's heart, she would be no better than Joyce.


Joyce at least had Katrina to devise plans for her,but she had no one but herself.


In this harsh world, she had to forge her own path,even if it meant stepping on anyone in her way.


Gripping Daniela's leg tightly, Nina pleaded, "Please, I beg you.Let me stay with you."


Elyse stood off to the side, her eyes burning with fury.



She longed to strangle Nina right then and there,but her gaze landed on a reporter inside Daniela's office.


All she could do was grit her teeth and force another smile. "Daniela, this isn't your issue. Nina's spoiled because of me. I'll take her home so she doesn't bother you."


Elyse reached out, attempting to pull Nina away.



But Nina clung desperately to Daniela's leg, preventing Elyse from moving her.


Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "It's alright. Let her stay.Nina listens well and doesn't cause me any trouble."


Elyse's face immediately clouded with anger. She had planned for Natalie to make her way into Daniela's good graces.


Daniela had already seen through Elyse's scheme.With a serene smile, she said, "I heard Natalie will be back soon from overseas. Let her join us at Elite Lux as well. We're family, after all, and the more hands,the better."



Elyse's smile was strained. She didn't want Nina stirrng up trouble. If Cedric fell for Nina, what would become of Natalie?



But since Daniela had made her decision, Elyse couldn't protest.



She forced a laugh, her voice tight. "Daniela, thank you.That sounds great."



A short time later, Elyse excused herself to use the restroom. Upon her return, she saw Nina leaving Daniela's office.



She shot Nina a cold, unfeeling look, her usual warmth replaced by disdain. "So you think you can stand on your own now?" Nina smiled faintly, brushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "I got a chance,and I intend to fight for it."


Elyse sneered,her voice laced with disdain. "You even needed my money to be admitted to a college. Do you really think Cedric would fall for someone like you?"


Nina wasn't the least bit angry. Mimicking Daniela's usual composed demeanor, she replied, "If you truly think Cedric won't give me a second glance, why are you so worried? I've never understood how a mother can be so blatantly biased. It used to hurt me."


Taking a small container of hand cream from her pocket, Nina applied it gently to her hands. "But now,I don't bother myself with that. I can't control what you think.I can only carve my own path."


She smiled, then pulled out a tissue and dabbed at the blood on her forehead right in front of Elyse. "Oh, by the way, Daniela said I could move into her villa. You were planning to cut off my credit card, right? Well,go ahead. I've got a salary now. I can take care of myself."


Elyse was shaking with rage. She narrowed her eyes,her chest rising and falling with each labored breath.



Nina felt a surge of satisfaction. She had longed to speak her mind, and now, she had done it all in one go,relishing the feeling of triumph. No longer willing to live in Natalie's shadow, Nina was determined to make her own name and claim Cedric for herself.



She wanted everyone to see her worth.


Elyse stumbled out, nearly staggering with fury. She muttered into her phone, "Natalie, get a ticket and come back now!"



That evening, Nina moved into the Harper family's villa.



Before bed, she asked Josie, "Which room does Cedric stay in?"



Josie shot her a wary look.



Nina smiled politely and said, "I'm not up to anything.I just don't want to get lost and cause an awkward situation."



Josie's expression stayed stony as she tossed laundry into a basket. "If your intentions are pure, you won't get lost. Stop looking for shortcuts."


Nina wasn't offended at all.



She'd endured far worse from the Dury family, and these small gestures didn't bother her in the least.


She smniled softly and said, "You're overthinking things. I really don't have any ulterior motives. If you'd prefer not to say, that's fine. Looks like your hands are busy,and you haven't taken good care of them." Nina pulled out a small tube of hand cream from her pocket and handed it to Josie. "This brand works well.Give it a try. If you like it and run out, just let me know.I'll get you more."



With that,she walked towards the guest room across the hall.



Josie looked at the hand cream on the table, her brow furrowing into a thoughtful frown.
###Chapter 374 What's Caught Your Eye
Moments later, Josie pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the price of the hand cream.



The small bottle of hand cream was worth a staggering ten thousand dollars..


Josie hesitated, then placed the hand cream back into her pocket before turning to head into the kitchen.



Daniela came home late that night.



As she entered, Daniela quickly messaged Cedric. As she passed the kitchen,Josie opened the glass door and greeted her, "Good evening, Daniela."


Daniela turned toward her,replying, "Good evening."



Josie retrieved the hand cream from her pocket.Daniela instantly recognized the brand. "What's going on?"she asked.



"Nina gave this to me," Josie replied.


Daniela smiled at themention of it. "This brand is excellent. It's a luxury brand."


Josie looked uneasy. "It's not about the hand cream. I wanted to tell you that Nina isn't as simple as she seems. She gave me such an extravagant gift. She must have some agenda. Before going to her room,she even asked me which room is Cedric staying in."



Josie had been feeling anxious lately.



Ever since Daniela and Cedric got together, he hadn't traveled far. But this time, when he left, he was in a bad mood and had been gone for a week.



When Josie asked Cedric if he had argued with Daniela,he remained silent.



Her anxiety deepened.


She began to wonder if Daniela no longer cared about Cedric.



"It's fine," Daniela said, smiling. "Just focus on your work, Josie. Whatever Nina gives you, feel free to accept it."



It was like a free meal.Why not take it?


Daniela went upstairs, leaving Josie behind, her brow furrowed with worry.


She couldn't help but wonder if Daniela and Cedric had truly fought or broken up. Otherwise, Daniela's reaction wouldn't be so strange.



She had already warned her about Nina's ulterior  motives, yet Daniela remained unbothered.



Did Daniela not care at all anymore?



Josie's heart skipped a beat as she sensed something was wrong.



Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and called Cedric, hurriedly recounting everything that had just transpired.



Panic filled Josie's voice as she spoke into the phone."Cedric, when are you coming back? You've put so much into winning Daniela's heart-don't give up now.I'm not seeing any urgency from her. She doesn't even seem jealous, which isn't right in a relationship."


Cedric was already feeling agitated. Josie's words struck him like a dagger to the heart. He felt a wave of dread wash over him.



Daniela had returned home just to change. Before leaving again, she saw Josie on the phone, pacing in the courtyard.



From behind the glass, she couldn't hear their conversation, but it was obvious that Josie was so frantic she seemed ready to jump out of her skin.



Daniela cast a brief glance in her direction, lifted the hem of her dress, and stepped out the door.


Josie turned and saw Daniela leaving. She quickly said  to Cedric, "Daniela's gone out. She only came back to change. She put on a stunning dress-looks like she's heading out for a date.Please,when will you be back?If you don't hurry, I'm afraid another man might steal her away."


Josie wasn't entirely to blame for her distress.


Daniela rarely went to banquets. She wasn't fond of socializing or drama. In the past, whenever she did attend events, Cedric was always by her side.


Tonight, though, she was going alone.


Josie couldn't stop herself from overthinking.


When Daniela arrived at the banquet, many key figures from the finance world had already gathered.


The host of tonight's event was a VIP, so her attendance was essential.


The moment Daniela entered the hall, she turned heads.



Her magnetic presence and breathtaking beauty made her the center of attention wherever she went.



As soon as Daniela stepped inside, Doug's eyes were instantly drawn to her.


His eyes lit up, a reaction that didn't go unnoticed by Joyce standing beside him. Joyce paused for a moment, then smiled teasingly."Honey, what's caught your eye?"
###Chapter 375 You Still Care About Me
Doug wrapped his armn around Joyce's waist, his eyes locked on Daniela as he whispered, "Is that your half -sister?"



Joyce nodded. "She's breathtaking,isn't she?"



Doug had no desire to attend such an event, but Joyce had promised to introduce him to a beautiful woman,so he begrudgingly agreed.



The moment he saw Daniela, he was undeniably captivated.


His pulse quickened with excitement, and he could barely contain his eagerness to approach her.


He extended his hand, his voice smooth. "Good evening, Ms. Harper. I'm Doug Fairburne."


Daniela sized up the man standing before her.



He was a middle-aged man with a protruding belly and thinning hair.



Standing in her high heels, Daniela was a little taller than him. She cast a quick glance at his thinning hair,then at Joyce, who was draped in jewels next to him, and offered a faint smile.



Joyce's discomfort was palpable.


What was Daniela trying to say with that smile? Was Daniela looking down on her? Did Daniela think she had chosen such an unappealing man purely for his wealth?



Doug's financial power allowed Joyce to be arrogant in front of everyone-except Daniela.


She couldn't summon any arrogance around Daniela,who held unmatched power in the business world.


Even Doug, who spent money freely, was nothing in the face of Daniela's influence.



But Joyce knew Doug's weaknesses. His judgment was clouded by desire. Who knew what could unfold?


"Daniela, meet my husband, Doug." Joyce intentionally raised her voice, making sure the gossiping crowd heard every word.


A fake smile stretched across Joyce's face as she waited for Daniela to extend her hand.



She was certain that once Doug shook Daniela's hand,he would be haunted by the encounter, eager to pursue her.


If she couldn't deal with Daniela directly, she'd let Doug take care of it.


She longed to see Daniela suffer the same fate she was trapped in.


Joyce's smile deepened,full of malice.


Doug's hand remained outstretched, waiting for Daniela's response.



Every eye in the room was on Daniela.


Bathed in the spotlight, Daniela stood tall and smiled with poise. "Apologies, I'm a bit obsessive about cleanliness."



Doug's smile faltered, his expression tightening.



Then, Daniela's gaze flicked towards Joyce. "How have you and Alexander been these days?"



Joyce hadn't anticipated Daniela's swift retaliation.Her face drained of color, and she quickly glanced at Doug.



Doug's expression darkened completely.



Daniela maintained her smile. "Doesn't your husband know about your little rendezvous while he was away?Oops, my mistake. I shouldn't have said that. Sorry."Her apology was casual, her demeanor unaffected.


Joyce flustered, waving her hands frantically as she  tried to explain, "It's not what it seems! Let me explain -Alexander is my ex-husband. We just exchanged a few words,nothing more."


"Is that so?" Daniela asked with a smile. "Then why have I seen you both going in and out of the Grand Hotel multiple times? Am I mistaken, or was that really you two?"


Joyce clenched her jaw, glaring at Daniela, her eyes burning with fury. "Enough!"


Daniela's smile barely wavered. "I'm only stating the truth. Is that a crime? Using your husband's money to maintain a lover isn't exactly a good look. But then again, your husband is a lot older than you, so in some areas, you might have more energy. I can see why you'd need someone else to help you out."


Daniela savored the drama, unconcerned with the fallout. "Don't you agree,Doug?"


It wasn't merely an affair-it was like publicly humiliating Doug, painting him as a fool for all to see.


Doug could feel the weight of everyone's eyes on him,his face contorting in humiliation for the first time.



"Thanks for the reminder. Excuse me," Doug muttered,yanking Joyce and, despite her protests, tossing her into the car. The car didn't pull away; instead, it rocked violently in place.


The tremors persisted until the banquet finally came to a close.


At some point, Alexander appeared behind Daniela. "Is this about me?"



Daniela turned her head slightly, stepping aside."What are you talking about?"



"You didn't want me with Joyce, so you exposed our affair to Doug on purpose. You still care about me,don't you?"
###Chapter 376 Is It Difficult To Answer The Question
Alexander's gaze on Daniela was intense, almost obsessive.



He needed confirmation, an answer that would prove everything that had transpired wasn't just a product of his imagination.



Daniela chuckled upon hearing his words.



Her smile, bathed in moonlight, was so captivating that it left Alexander breathless.



He stood there, completely stunned, unable to look away.



"I truly envy your confidence," Daniela remarked,before opening the car door and driving off,Alexander stood there, bathed in moonlight, as the car disappeared into the distance. He stood motionless for a long while.



The moment was captured by a reporter and quickly shared online.



One netizen commented, "Why is Daniela with Alexander?" Another questioned, "Why didn't Daniela attend the banquet with Cedric tonight?"


A third comment read, "There's something strangely sweet about Daniela and Alexander standing together under the moonlight."


A fourth user added, "Are they getting back together?Oh my! The drama in their circle is a real show."


A flood of comments from netizens followed the post.



Josie forwarded the comments to Cedric, asking, "Is it possible that Daniela wants to reconcile with Alexander? When are you returning?"



Cedric remained silent, offering no response this time.



Upon returning home, Daniela found Nina sitting on the sofa in the living room, watching TV, smiling innocently, the image of sweetness. As soon as she saw Daniela, Nina greeted her cheerfully, "Hey,Daniela!"



Daniela looked down, typing a message to Cedric.



Passing by Nina, Daniela's eyes were drawn to the slippers on her feet.


Nina glanced down at her slippers, then back up at Daniela, asking, "What's wrong,Daniela?" Daniela quickly averted her gaze, replying, "Nothing."



She headed upstairs and sent a message to the driver,requesting a pair of men's slippers.


After her shower, Daniela checked her phone again,but Cedric had still not responded.


She figured he was just busy.


She went downstairs, retrieved the slippers, and placed them neatly on the shoe rack by the door. Nina stood with her hands behind her back, a smile on her face,and asked, "Did I wear the wrong shoes?"



Daniela straightened up after neatly placing the slippers and said, "Cedric also stays here. He's a bit of a neat freak. You wore his slippers by mistake, so 1bought a new pair. Just be careful not to mix them up again."



Nina was truly surprised by her response.



She had assumed Daniela wouldn't care about such small details. When she moved in, Josie had warned her not to mix up the slippers, but she had intentionally worn Cedric's.


Josie hadn't noticed, but Daniela had spotted it right away when she entered.



She had even arranged for new slippers. Even though Cedric was on a business trip abroad and wouldn't be back for a while, Daniela still made sure to prepare slippers for him.



Could anyone truly believe that Daniela felt nothing for Cedric and that their connection was merely physical?


Nina couldn't believe that for a second.



Daniela remained unfazed by Nina's scrutiny; she was always direct and unapologetically honest.



"Daniela,what exactly is your relationship with Cedric?"Nina asked suddenly, just as Daniela was about to head upstairs.



The room went silent.



Nina stood by the entrance, the sensor light gradually dimming until she was swallowed by the darkness.


Persistent and calculating, Nina kept her tone light,though her question was blunt. "I've heard rumors that Cedric is pursuing you. Now that I'm here, I see he lives in here too. Does that mean there's more between you two than just him pursuing you? Are you in a relationship?"


Nina watched Daniela's figure, her eyes never leaving her. Her phone screen lit up faintly, showing Elyse's name.


As she called Elyse, she discreetly hit the record button.





"Daniela, is it so hard to answer? What exactly is your relationship with Cedric?" Nina pushed further.
###Chapter 377 Natalie Dury
Daniela glanced over her shoulder at Nina.



Nina was taken aback by how calmly Daniela handled the situation, even in such a tense moment.


"Believe whatever you want about us," Daniela said,her voice steady. "If we are something in your mind,then that's what we are."



Nina quickly shot back, "Really? People are saying Cedric stays here not because you love him, but because you just need a man. They say you're using him for your own desire."



Nina matched Daniela's pace, her voice growing sharper."I think I agree.You don't love Cedric,do you?Otherwise,how could you let people gossip about him like this?"



Daniela paused at the stairs,her fists clenching at her sides.She stayed silent, contemplating for a moment.


"If you stay quiet, I'll take that as an admission." Nina continued,taking full advantage of Daniela's silence.



Daniela didn't care about Nina's words; she feared nothing for herself. But when it came to Cedric, it was a different story. She couldn't risk him being hurt. With everything so uncertain, she saw no value in continuing the argument.


Daniela stayed quiet, and started up the stairs.


Just as she lifted her foot, Nina's smug voice rang out behind her. "Cedric, did you hear that? I told you.Daniela doesn't love you. She just admitted it."



Daniela froze mid-step, her heart pounding.



After a long, tense pause, she slowly turned her head and saw Cedric standing at the entrance with his luggage.


He looked drained, his eyes bloodshot, chest heaving with each heavy breath, his face full of stunned disbelief.



Their gazes locked from across the long hallway, the darkness between them seeming to stretch forever.



Nina stood triumphantly to the side and said, "Cedric,you heard that, right? Daniela just wants a man around,which is why she let you stay here. Do you still want to stay now?"


Nina continued, "Daniela, I'm sorry, but if you don't love him, you should be honest. I've only known Cedric briefly, but I can tell he values sincerity. It's not right to toy with his emotions like this." Nina said all of this, but Cedric remained silent, his expression unreadable.


Daniela remained silent as well. She didn't know what could possibly mend the situation.



The memory of Cedric's earlier confrontation resurfaced-he had always questioned her real intentions.



Nina lingered, phone in hand, as the three of them stood in suspense, waiting for a resolution.


This drama couldn't just end abruptly.



Daniela gripped the stair railing, her eyes faraway as she spoke. "It's up to you, Cedric. If you want to leave,I won't stop you."



With those words, Daniela turned and ascended the stairs,retreating to her room.


Once inside, she didn't sit. She waited, hoping Cedric would come up. She needed to explain herself to him.But he didn't come.


Over an hour later, the only sound she heard was the hum of a car engine starting outside.


Standing on the balcony, she watched the black car disappear into the darkness. After a moment, Daniela pressed her lips tight and lowered her gaze.



It hit her-she had hurt Cedric deeply.



That night, Daniela couldn't sleep. She sat wide awake on the wooden floor.



Old habits were hard to shake off.



She had become accustomed to having Cedric by her side at night.



With him gone, she couldn't bring herself to crawl into bed alone. Instead, she pondered whether revealing their relationship would be the right move.



Would that finallymake Cedric happy?



Would it clear away all his doubts and fears about whether she truly wanted him in her life?



Daniela spent the entire night mulling over this thought.


As morning light filtered into the villa, exhaustion clouded her mind.



Suddenly, an impulsive thought bloomed in her chest.



She wanted to shout to the world that Cedric was her husband. No more secrets, no more hiding. She couldn't wait another second.


She quickly changed into fresh clothes, put on her shoes, and hurried downstairs.


A powerful impulse drove her-she had to see Cedric right now.



But that rush of determination vanished the moment she reached the first floor. There, she saw Nina and Natalie.



"Hello, Daniela," Natalie greeted her with an air of polished professionalism. "I'm Natalie. It's been a while."
###Chapter 378 Cedric


In that moment, Daniela's impulsive urges were tempered by reason.


She stopped in her tracks, her eyes locking onto Natalie, whose features mirrored her own. A subtle smile appeared on her lips. "Natalie, it's been a while."


Natalie, a top-tier graduate with international experience, stood in stark contrast to Nina. She radiated a confident, composed aura.


At a remarkably young age, Natalie had founded a publicly traded company.



"Daniela, my mother sent me to help you," Natalie said, her smile calm and confident. "I majored in Finance and minored in Law, with additional studies in Psychology and Investment Banking. I believe I can be a more effective assistant than Lillian. I've prepared a workflow diagram based on Nina's tasks. Please take a look, and if it suits you, we can begin today."


Natalie's tone carried an undeiable air of superiority,her confidence evident. Though she framed it as a suggestion, there was an underlying tone of authority.


Nina, usually quiet and obedient, couldn't help but feel dwarfed by Natalie's presence. There was no denying that Natalie's professionalism was both commanding and efficient.


Daniela glanced between the two women."Alright.Natalie is competent and reassures me. You two can handle the details. I'm off for a morning run."


With that, Daniela left the villa.



On her way, she received a message from Ryan."Natalie just returned!"



Daniela responded,"I saw her."


"What? She even visited you? I believe she had something to do with what happened to your mother back then."



Back then, Brylee had been manipulated by a psychologist Katrina had brought in. The only reason the psychologist had been allowed to stay in the house was because Natalie had claimed to have feelings for him.



Natalie had persuaded Brylee to let him stay.Otherwise, someone as cautious as Brylee would never have allowed an outsider to remain in her home.


While Katrina was the direct instigator, Elyse and Natalie were the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes. Before leaving the villa, Daniela took one last look behind her.



The sky above was heavy with an impending storm.



The air was thick with the scent of rain.



The weather mirrored the day Brylee had died in an almost eerie way.



It all felt as though destiny had orchestrated these moments.



The shadows began to surrender the faces of those who caused Brylee's death, and Daniela vowed to hold every one of them accountable.



Seated in the villa's plush sofa,Natalie surveyed her surroundings with an air of ownership, her tone dripping with condescension. "Mom says you've been quite the rebel lately."


Nina stood to the side, feeling herself shrink under Natalie's domineering presence. "I'm just going after someone I care about. I don't think that's wrong," she retorted after mustering her courage.



Natalie let out a frigid laugh. "Ridiculous. If this house lacks a mirror, perhaps you should seek one elsewhere.Even if Cedric were completely blind, he wouldn't spare you a second look. In terms of looks, intellect,or capability-do you genuinely believe you're on the same level?"



Nina bit her lip. "I won't give up until the end. Love isn't always won by the most capable."


Nina clung to the belief that she still had a chance.After all, not every affluent man was drawn to domineering women.


"And even when it comes to talent, you don't measure up to Daniela," Nina added, refusing to back down.


Natalie's confident demeanor cracked instantly. "How dare you!" she snapped, the words striking her raw nerve. Her lifelong failure to outshine Daniela had always been her most painful insecurity. "Nina, are you trying to provoke me? I might not touch Daniela, but making you pay would be far simpler."


Nina clamped her mouth shut, knowing it wasn't wise to push further.



"Mom's plan is to remove Daniela, marry me to Cedric,and elevate our family to the top. You'd do well to cooperate-or don't blame me if I show no mercy."



Natalie's threat hung in the air. Nina bit her lip. "Cedric might not even fall for you."



At the mention of Cedric's name, some of the tension left Natalie's face.



She had nursed feelings for Cedric since their school  days, and her celebrated return after a flourishing career abroad had been fueled by her long-held yearning.



She was resolved to win Cedric's affection and revive the dreamshe'd clung to for years.


Overflowing with confidence, Natalie fixed Nina with a cold stare. "You will assist me," she declared.


Exiting the villa, Natalie made her way to Elite Lux.


Elyse had informed her that Cedric, who had arrived the previous night, was in Daniela's private lounge at Elite Lux.



Without hesitation, Natalie swung open the office door and found Cedric standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, looking flawless in his tailored suit.


The sight of him sent her heart racing, as if her lifelong ambition had just stepped into reach.


From his composed posture, Cedric exuded the effortless elegance she remembered, his quiet dignity bathed in the soft glow of morning light.


Warmth rose to Natalie's cheeks. Clearing her throat,she addressed him. "Cedric."
###Chapter 379 Cedric's Background
As Cedric turned his head, Natalie couldn't miss the shadow of disappointment that flickered across his face.



It was clear he'd been expecting Daniela to walk through the door.


Natalie decided to let it slide. She gave him a polite smile, handed him a cup of coffee,and said,"Good morning, Mr. Phillips. I'm Ms. Harper's new personal assistant."



After speaking, Natalie gave Cedric a polite nod.



Without wasting a moment, she turned her attention to tidying up Daniela's desk.



Shortly after, she exited the office without uttering another word.



Meanwhile,Elyse lingered by the doorway,her brows drawn together in quiet concern as she observed the scene.



"Do you really think Cedric will notice you if you keep hiding your true self?" Elyse asked. Gazing through the office door at the man inside,Natalie replied, "Mom, you just don't get it. Most men don't value what comes to them too easily. They take for granted anything that falls into their laps."


Elyse nodded thoughtfully. "It seems you're sure about your plan. I'll take Nina home later so I don't get in your way."


"It's fine," Natalie replied with a calm air as she applied lipstick in front of the mirror. "That fool being around only makes me shine brighter."


With that, Natalie gathered the files from the table and strode back into Daniela's office.


Cedric remained by the floor-to-ceiling window,prompting her to cast him a quick, indifferent glance.


"Mr.Phillips, I hope you don't mind me asking, but are you a fan of the renowned painter Monica Miller?"Natalie asked with a warm, easygoing smile.



Cedric's expression shifted to one of surprise. "How could you possibly know that?"


Monica was undeniably a celebrated artist, and Cedric hadnever shared his admiration for her with anyone.



Natalie's lips curved into a knowing smile as she gestured to the handkerchief in Cedric's breast pocket. "The pattern and style are so reminiscent of  her work. I used to admire her, too, but I was quite disappointed when I heard she retired."


Cedric was on the verge of replying when the office door swung open.


Daniela stepped into the doorway, fully aware Cedric had been waiting for her but surprised to see Natalie there as well.


Trusting her instincts, Natalie quickly briefed Daniela on her work progress before stepping out and closing the door behind her.



At that moment, she epitomized the role of a capable and efficient secretary.


Outside, Nina had caught sight of the brief exchange between Cedric and Natalie. Her face twisted with jealousy.


Natalie noticed Nina's envious glare and responded with a faint, disdainful sneer. "Idiot," she muttered under her breath before walking away.



But Nina wasn't done. She hurried after Natalie."Would you dare show Cedric the real you? You're just hiding behind a mask!"



Natalie didn't even bother to dignify her with a response.



With her gaze lowered, she slipped her hand into her  purse,retrieving a small wallet adorned with an oil-painting motif. A gentle smile graced her lips.


In the office, Cedric remained by the window,unmoving, as if rooted to the spot where he had stood all night.


Daniela lingered by the door,hesitant, uncertain about how to take the first step forward.


There were countless explanations she owed him,yet faced with Cedric's presence, the words seemed to evaporate from her mind.



Perhaps, she thought, an apology could serve as a starting point.


But she knew Cedric would probably say, "It's all right."


And then she would have to admit, "I still can't make our relationship public. Can you understand?"



But what could Cedric say in response to that?



She could feel it in her gut-no matter what she said,Cedric's spirit would remain bruised.



Daniela had done everything to shield him from the burdens that were hers to bear, yet in the end,he had carried them for her instead.



She couldn't bear to see the once-proud man seem diminished in her presence. Daniela's hands curled into tight fists.


Should she declare their relationship over? The words refused to form.


Daniela stood in silence for what felt like forever before finally speaking. "I'm giving you the right to choose."



Cedric's gaze turned stormy in an instant.


He attempted a nod and a faint smile.


But it came off more like he was on the verge of breaking down.


"What do you mean?" Cedric asked sharply, his eyes locked on Daniela. Despite the calm he had tried to cultivate in recent days, his voice betrayed his tension."What are you talking about? A breakup? Or a divorce?Make it clear!"



At that moment, a cold ache spread through Daniela's chest.



Her fists tightened until her nails pressed painfully into her palms, forcing her to cling to rationality.


"Either one. The choice is yours," she said, her voice void of emotion.


The silence that followed weighed heavy in the air, pressing down on them both.


Cedric gave a slow nod, though a bitter smile ghosted across his lips. "Should I be grateful you've allowed me this final shred of dignity?"



He had returned, weary and worn, only to be greeted by these icy words.


"I'd have preferred your lies. At least then I could believe you felt something for me instead of forcing me to choose between two cruel options."



His voice faded into silence.


Cedric said nothing more. He swung the door open and walked out.


Lillian stood frozen by the door, stunned. "What happened?" she asked Daniela.


Daniela stepped further into the office, with Lillian following close behind. "Daniela, there's no need for this standoff. Even if Elyse has support, you can manage it."



Daniela didn't reply. Instead, she handed Lillian a folder.


Lillian glanced down at the folder. "Where did this come from? Cedric's background? Wasn't he raised in an orphanage? How..." As her eyes skimmed over the words, Lillian froze in place.





Moments later, she burst out, "What on earth is this?It's unbelievable!"
###Chapter 380 Hypnosis


Joyce had been confined in a dark cell for five torturous days.



She had come to believe that she might not make it out alive.



At times, she even caught herself hoping for death as an escape.



But Doug wouldn't allow her to die. He kept her wrists chained to the headboard, torturing her while giving her IV drips.



A cold fluid flowed through her bloodstream.



Joyce tilted her head back. Her body had become so numb that it barely responded anymore. Tears slowly streamed down her face as she silently promised herself that if she survived, Daniela would one day experience everything she had endured.



Joyce couldn't remember how many times she had lost consciousness or howv many times she had come to. In one of her brief moments of awareness, she glanced down at Doug, who was torturing her.


"Doug, aren't you curious about how it feels to fuck Daniela?" Doug stopped his actions, looked up, and squinted at her. "Joyce, are you trying to get yourself killed and take me down with you?"


His grip tightened, making Joyce's heart squeeze in pain. "Daniela is great, sure, but you're not bad either."


"Doug, I was raised the countryside. Daniela is different. When Brylee was pregnant with Daniela,she supposedly consumed every supplement imaginable.As a result, Daniela turned out with flawless skin and striking looks. She is an exceptional beauty. You take pride in possessing every woman you encounter, but until now, your conquests have been nothing more than ordinary flings. Doesn't that bother you?"



Doug was on the verge of snapping at Joyce, but he hesitated.



In comparison to Daniela, the women he had been with truly did seem ordinary.



Daniela was someone he hadn't been able to touch.



A menacing spark flickered in Doug's eyes, and Joyce noticed it.



She stretched out on the bed, and felt herself nearing a breakdown.



She remembered his earlier warning. If she humiliated him,her life would end right there on that bed. Struggling to breathe, Joyce whispered, "I can help you. Just don't kill me, and I'll help you capture Daniela."



Doug looked at her with doubt.


Joyce continued, "I'm at your mercy. I can't escape. If I fail, you can end my life then. You're done with me,aren't you? Are you scared you won't be able to handle Daniela? Didn't you boast that once a woman has been with you for a night, she'll never desire anyone else? Are you not interested in putting that to the test?"



Doug stayed kneeling, motionless for a long moment.


He knew Joyce was using Daniela as a bargaining chip to save herself, yet the idea of conquering Daniela was too captivating to dismiss.


Whenever he glanced at Joyce these days, he envisioned Daniela instead.



The mere thought of Daniela under him excited him.



He was convinced that if Daniela agreed to be with him,he would leave behind all his harshness and treat her with tenderness.



Joyce watched Doug rise and leave. Shortly after, a team of doctors hurried in from the corridor. As exhaustion overwhelmed her,one final thought surfaced.



The suffering had stopped.


Later, Joyce approached Alexander, her face still marked by scars.



"Doug is aware of our actions," Joyce said, her thick sunglasses barely hiding her new injuries. She casually adjusted them and told Alexander, "I've struck a deal with Doug."



Alexander stared at Joyce without saying a word.Rarely did anyone who crossed Doug get away so easily. "What did you promise him?" he asked.


Joyce paused to sip her coffee. Her trembling hands,visible up close, revealed the extent of her injuries."Daniela."



Hearing her name, Alexander felt a tightening in his chest. "What did you say?" he asked sharply.


"Doug wants Daniela. Once it's settled, he's offering me three hundred million as my divorce settlement.With that money, Bennett Group would no longer face any financial problems."


Alexander's eyes narrowed, and his brow furrowed."Daniela wouldn't get involved with Doug. And you expect me to believe you'd actually put that three hundred million into Bennett Group?"



Joyce flashed a faint smile. "You're right about the first part.Daniela wouldn't willingly be with Doug. But what if she thought Doug was Cedric? I know an expert hypnotist. As for the money, I wouldn't help unless I had something to gain. After my divorce from Doug, I'll need a reliable partner. Marry me, and I'll make sure Bennett Group gets the support it needs,whenever it's needed."


Alexander's face grew more gloomy. He remained silent for a long time.



Seeing his reluctance, Joyce let out a mocking laugh."What, you need this long to decide? Are you still attached to Daniela?"



Joyce sneered, covering her mouth as a scornful smile spread across her bruised face. "Since when did you become so sentimental, Alexander? Or do you think I'm not suitable to be your wife? Consider the three hundred million, Alexander. Look at where you stand now.Finding someone like me is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so don't let it slip by."
###Chapter 381 Daniela Would Belong Entirely To Him
Alexander hesitated, his words caught in a tangle of indecision.



Impatience etched across Joyce's face as she leaned forward. "What's there to think about? Daniela doesn't care about your pity. Remember how she treated you when you begged for her help?"


Alexander remained silent, gripping his glass of iced water as if the chill could settle his restless mind. His mind spun in circles, searching for answers that never came. He couldn't shake the image of Daniela trapped in Doug's cruelty, unable to escape.



Joyce caught Alexander's hesitation and smirked."Still clinging to the idea of being with Daniela? To achieve that goal, you must first make her Doug's woman."



Alexander looked at Joyce in confusion.


Joyce's tone remained casual, almost dismissive."For ten years, you ignored Daniela, Alexander. That's not something you can fix with a few kind gestures.Now she's on top of the world and sees you as insignificant.If you want to stand by her side again, you'll have to  knock her off that pedestal first. Let her fall so hard that she's desperate for someone to catch her. That's when she'll need you. Do you understand?"



Alexander's stern expression softened little by little as he listened.



Joyce could tell her words were sinking in.


"You're still planning to marry me, right?" he asked.


"I am, and you don't need to worry. All I care about is the title of your wife. Once we have a child, I'll turn a blind eye to anything you do outside of this arrangement. But I have one demand: Daniela cannot bear any children. The Bennett family's legacy belongs to my son."


Alexander let the silence stretch between them, his brow furrowed. "That's all?" he asked,his voice tinged with doubt.


Joyce offered a slow, deliberate nod.


She had finally come to terms with the mistakes she made. Katrina had once cleared the path for her success, but she'd foolishly wrecked it.


Now, she was determined to take control again,convinced it wasn't too late to set everything right.


Joyce still had a chance to right the ship, hold on to the title of Alexander's wife, and bask in the comforts  of wealth. Her son would inherit the Bennett family's wealth, ensuring her place in the future.



"So, Alexander, what's your decision? Are you in?"Joyce let her words hang in the air, her voice carefully measured. "Or You don't want Daniela anymore after Doug sleeps with her?"


A quiet laugh escaped her. "Don't fool yourself,Alexander. You're not a virgin. What right do you have to pass judgment?"


Alexander, unmoved, took another sip of water."What is it that you expect from me?"



A victorious smile played on Joyce's lips. "I thought you might have some lingering feelings for Daniela,but clearly not. It's really that simple. Don't complicate things. Life at the top is always messy. A single night-what's it really worth in the grand scheme?"



Joyce's voice was steady, laced with control, as she continued,"I've already made arrangements with Doug.He'll collaborate with Daniela's company. He'll flood it with money quickly to create the illusion of success.That'll give you the perfect chance to get close to her. Once she lets her guard down, I'll have someone hypnotize her. From there, it'll all unfold as planned."


Unease crept over Alexander,but deep down,he knew there was no alternative. A quiet vow formed in his mind: one day, he would find a way to make things right with Daniela.


He would buy a villa for Daniela, where he could keep her close and protect her from everything else.


In his mind, Daniela would ultimately be his, with no one else standing in his way.
###Chapter 382 Some Things About Her Would Never...
Lately, Nina had been working late into the night,hoping to cross paths with Cedric in Elite Lux.


At first, Natalie mocked her for it, but soon enough,she found herself inventing reasons to stay late as well.



Nina couldn't hide her irritation at Natalie's sudden change of heart. With a sneer, she said, "Wasn't it you who said if a man truly likes you, you don't have to chase him? That women who go after men are fools?So what now? You're playing a fool too?"



Natalie, calm and composed, remained seated at her desk,her eyes fixed on the CEO's office.



It was true-she'd said those things before. But Cedric was different. His politeness was impenetrable,and he never seemed to notice her attempts. Frustration simmered inside her, and she realized she needed a new strategy.



Natalie asked, "Don't you see it? Cedric and Daniela had a fight."



Nina curled her lip, unimpressed. "Of course,I noticed. t's hard to miss."



Ignoring Nina's tone, Natalie continued, "Look, we're not enemies. I'm not going to let Daniela take the lead.One of us deserves to rise above, and as sisters,we should support each other. Can't we deal with Daniela together?"


Nina paused, her mind turning over the offer. Then she said, "I know what you and Mom are planning. I can work with you. Daniela's wealth means nothing to me.All I want is Cedric."



Internally, Natalie cursed Nina for being so easily swayed.She smiled and said,"Fine."



Nina shot her a suspicious glance. "That was fast, even for you."



"Why wouldn't it be? Men are a dime a dozen. Once you have wealth, you'll find plenty who are both handsome and obedient. You could easily land someone better than CCedric."



Nina's doubt was evident in her eyes. Yet she held back, deciding not to argue. "So, what's the plan?How do we make this work?"



A sly grin appeared on Natalie's lips. She motioned for Nina to come closer, and Nina leaned in without hesitation. 
Elsewhere,Daniela wrapped up her work and prepared to leave. Cedric remained at his desk, lost in his own world.



It had been a week since Daniela's conversation with Cedric about making a decision. He still hadn't responded, and their interactions had become scarce.


He continued to monitor her meals three times a day,but once she finished eating, he would walk away without uttering a single word.


The Harper family villa had long since lost its appeal for him. Now, he seemed settled in the lounge at Elite Lux, as if planning to make it his long-term base.


Daniela closed her laptop, her gaze drifting to Cedric,who sat absorbed in his work."Are we going to talk?"



Without lifting his eyes from the screen, Cedric replied,"I'm tied up today. Maybe later."


Indeed, Cedric's schedule was packed.



His ambition in the corporate world seemed boundless,and rumors swirled about the competitor who had pushed him so hard that there was no room left for retreat.



Phillips Group's influence was growing swiftly, easing the worries of seasoned employees who had feared that a woman might distract Cedric from his relentless  drive.



Sighing, Daniela stood up. "Alright. Don't stay up too late,then."



She didn't know how to approach him.


Though she excelled in business, when it came to personal connections, she felt completely out of her depth.


Her heart longed for reconciliation, but Cedric was distant and unyielding. For the moment, she couldn't find a way through.


Just as she was about to leave, a knock echoed on the door of the CEO's office.


Nina entered with a bright smile, her voice smooth as she spoke. "Daniela, Mr. Bennett from Sunny Pharmaceuticals is hoping to have dinner with you to discuss a new round of cooperation."


The name Mr. Bennett referred to none other than Alexander.


Lately, Alexander had made waves in the pharmaceutical industry, his sudden financial surge raising more than a few eyebrows.


"I don't see the need for dinner. Tell them to come to my office tomorrow," Daniela responded without a flicker of hesitation. Nina maintained her cheerful expression, adding,"Understood, but he made it clear that this is a straightforward business collaboration. He hopes you won't let past issues cloud the bigger picture. If it's possible, he'd prefer a more informal setting."


Nina understood Daniela's stance well.


Business and personal matters never mixed in Daniela's world.



Nina continued, "Also, Misael Wayne will be attending.He's highly influential, and with his presence, they're confident the agreement can be wrapped up smoothly over dinner."



Misael had long-standing business ties with Daniela.Recognizing his importance, Daniela knew she would have to honor his position.


Just as she was about to give her consent, Cedric,who had been absorbed in his work, slowly raised his gaze."Weren't you going to talk to me?"



Taken off guard, Daniela blinked. "Now? You want to talk now?"



With a calm, almost detached expression, Cedric shut his laptop. "Yes."



Daniela turned her attention back to Nina. "In that case, tell Mr. Wayne I'll meet them in my office  tomorrow."


Nina bit her lip and didn't want to leave just yet. After a while, she managed a smile. "All right."


Outside,Alexander's secretary waited patiently.Having pulled a few strings to ensure Misael's attendance,Alexander hoped for a dinner meeting that evening.He stood ready in a newly purchased suit, exuding confidence and anticipation.


"Daniela has another engagement tonight. Please return at eight tomorrow morning," Nina said to them.


The secretary stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief.


Alexander also appeared caught off guard. It didn't take long for him to accept the situation, knowing it wasn't entirely a surprise.


He had always suspected that Daniela would be reluctant to accept a dinner invitation.


Nina, playing with a strand of her hair,flashed a coy smile. "Don't get the wrong idea. Daniela was about to agree,but then Cedric asked to speak with her. So she decided to stay."


At her words, Alexander's expression darkened noticeably.



A gentle sigh escaped Nina as she continued, "This happens often. She is deeply focused on her work, but Cedric gets possessive and needy. It's caused her a lot of trouble. But, of course,she will always protect those close to her, even at the expense of her own peace. We just have to hope Elite Lux won't suffer because of it."



Nina let her words linger in the air before turning to leave.


Alexander's expression darkened further, a hint of bitterness creeping onto his face.



He knew Cedric was nothing but trouble, and Daniela,still caught up in her own romantic fantasies, was only making things worse. Some aspects of her would never change.



In Alexander's mind, he alone had the power to break through her stubbornness.



A wave of frustration washed over him, and for a fleeting moment, he imagined storming upstairs to confront Daniela, to shake her out of her foolishness.
###Chapter 383 Do You Agree


If Alexander were honest with himself, he'd acknowledge the deep-seated jealousy he still harbored.



No matter how much time elapsed, he couldn't shake the feeling that Cedric had stolen Daniela from him.


The affection Cedric basked in now belonged to him.


This time, however, Alexander refrained from rushing upstairs in a fit of impulse.


Instead,he moved carefully, determined to ensure Daniela would find her way back to him.


As Alexander left, his gaze lingered on Daniela's office door.His fists clenched tightly before he disappeared into the night's shadows.


Meanwhile, inside the office, silence hung heavily.


Cedric had briefly lifted his gaze from the laptop, only to lower it back again.


Daniela sat quietly, waiting patiently in her seat.


After ten minutes, Cedric broke the quiet. His voice was even,yet edged with something unreadable. "You once said I had the right to decide."


Daniela met his gaze and replied, "Yes."


Cedric went on, "You said I'd decide on whether we continue or part ways."


Daniela still responded, "Yes."


Cedric said, "Honestly, I don't quite understand."



Daniela's eyes darted as her throat suddenly dried."What?"


Cedric's mind churned momentarily, thewords weighing heavily on him before he spoke. "If you don't trust me, why did you accomplish so much with me, even marrying me? But if you trust me, why keep parts of your life hidden?"


Cedric didn't believe her intentions were only to have sex with him.



He almost wished Daniela was after something tangible from him.


At least then, he wouldn't feel so vulnerable,constantly anxious about being rejected at any moment.


"Daniela, tell me the reason. Why won't you tell me?Why did you marry me if you're only going to shut me out?" His hands curled into fists as he struggled to  maintain his composure. "Don't make me feel like a fool."



The weight of his words hit Daniela like a blow.


She had never meant to make him feel this way.


Her only intention was to make him happy but everything had gone wrong somewhere along the way.


"I..." she began.


Cedric's back remained turned, his rigid frame a wall between Daniela and him.


His silhouette radiated an air of silence and severity."If you can't tell me the truth, don't lie either."


The words caught in Daniela's throat, leaving her unable to continue.



The room sank back into a heavy and oppressive silence again.


"I never meant to deceive you, but I can't explain the reason right now. What I said still stands, so the choice is yours." Daniela knew she was being unreasonable but she had no choice. "Or we could take a break for now and wait until later."



It was the only solution Daniela could come up with.



"Once l've sorted everything out, we can pick up where we left off," she added.


By then, the chaos would be behind them, and Cedric's past would no longer weigh him down.Daniela was certain she could smooth out every wrinkle and set things right.


"But if you're still willing by then, I'll return to bring you home," she concluded.


Cedric's lips twitched into a faint smile. "Really? Wait?Wait until the danger passes? Wait for the convenient moment? Wait until you feel it's safe? Daniela, what about me?"


Daniela froze, his words striking her harder than she'd anticipated.


Cedric's voice remained icy as he continued, "Does everything have to revolve around you? What about me? You don't care what I think. Is that it?"


Daniela fell silent, pressing her lips together as she struggled to find the right words.


After a long silence, she finally spoke, her tone soft but resolute. "Yes. If you want to be with me, just follow my plans. The choice to continue is yours. If you disagree,then you can choose..."


She paused momentarily, then continued, "You can call it off." At her words, Cedric slowly turned around. In the stillness of the night, he met Daniela's gaze,their eyes locking in the cold, quiet darkness.


A single glance was enough for Cedric to know that Daniela had already made up her mind.


He gave a nod, a self-mocking smile crossing his face."You're both decisive and efficient. I can only admit defeat."



Daniela bit her lip, the weight of knowing she had ruined everything settling in.


Cedric rose slowly, the chair behind him creaking loudly in the silent room. "Fine. I'll follow your plans and play by your rules."


Daniela felt a sharp ache in her chest. She was on the verge of saying, "Then that's it."


Then, she watched as Cedric stood up, his hands tucked into his pockets. His voice was cold as he said,"I won't ask why anymore. But whether it's out of sympathy or something else, Daniela, be ready for a lifetime with me."



Daniela was taken aback. She stared at Cedric, her expression blank with disbelief.


Cedric's expression turned steely in the darkness. "You said I was the one to decide, didn't you? Moreover, again."



Daniela's hands clenched silently on the table, her fingers digging into the surface.


Had he really agreed?


Considering Cedric's temperament, she had assumed that he wouldn't be the type to compromise.


"Daniela, did you hear what I just said? You wanted me to choose, and I've made my choice. So,you'll owe me for a lifetime. You'll be bound to me, relentless and unyielding. Do you agree? So now, it's your turn.Think it over, Daniela. Even if you fall for another man in the future, I won't let you go."


After finishing his words, Cedric walked straight towards the office door.



His steps quickened, as though he feared hearing a rejection. "I'll give you time to think about it before you answer me."



"I agree."


Her voice cut through as Cedric's hand hovered over the doorknob.



He didn't dare ask again. His hand gripped the doorknob, turning it, and without looking back, he muttered,"Alright."



Cedric walked out of the office as he spoke.



Nina and Natalie were standing outside the door.


Nina glanced at Natalie. "Do you think he'll come back tonight?"


A mix of emotions flickered across Natalie's face. "I'm not sure, but when Cedric walked out, he looked like he was relieved of a heavy burden. What does he fear so much?"



He was a formidable force in the business world. What could possibly scare him?
###Chapter 384 Coax Him For A Long Time

Cedric entered the elevator.



His fists slowly unfurled, the tension in his hands easing.



What was he so afraid of?



He feared that Daniela would look him in the eye and tell him to leave.


Was there really nothing to fear?



He was terrified.



Terrified to the point that he had buried himself in work,trying to numnb the gnawing anxiety in his chest.The thought that Daniela might not even let him stay in Elite Lux paralyzed him.



In love, it was always the one who cared the most who ended up hurt.


And he had lost.



He had lost to Daniela, completely.



When Cedric returned to the office, he pushed open  the door to the CEO's office, only to be taken aback when he saw Daniela sitting inside.



Despite his fear, frustration and anger bubbled up inside him. He walked in briskly, his voice sharp. "Why are you still here? It's so late."


For a moment, Cedric forgot entirely that it was Daniela's office he was barging into.



But Daniela, ever the understanding one,didn't flinch.



Instead, she softened, her eyes holding a quiet warmth as she looked at him. "I'm waiting for you."



Cedric's exasperation almost made him laugh bitterly.



Daniela was always so practical. Just moments ago,she had been firm, ready to walk away from him if he didn't give in. But the moment he did, she wrapped him in care and tenderness, showing just how much she had been waiting for him.


Cedric couldn't bring himself to accept this, yet,inexplicably, he always fell for it.


He tried to keep his face impassive, but the effort was futile. Instead, he pressed his lips together tightly,remaining silent.


Daniela walked toward him, a soft smile gracing her lips. "I was waiting for you. Let's go home, alright?" Cedric silently packed up his laptop cord, rolling it up with a methodical motion. "I'm sleeping in the lounge tonight."


Daniela didn't hesitate. "Then I'll stay with you."



Cedric refused to look at her, his gaze fixed on his hands. He couldn't risk meeting her eyes-he knew his resolve would crumble the moment their gazes locked."No need. I've gotten used to sleeping alone lately."


Daniela's heart skipped a beat at his words, and she stared at him in disbelief. "Are you serious? You promised, Cedric-forever and always. I won't accept this."



Cedric's anger began to fade,replaced by a faint pout."Daniela, this trick won't work on me. You can't just push me away and then try to sweeten things up with kindness. I don't like it when you act like this. I don't want to sleep with you tonight."



He was resolute, clinging to the need to remain firm.If he didn't, he feared losing every shred of control in this relationship-and his future would be in jeopardy.



Daniela let out a sigh, but as she turned to leave, she glanced over her shoulder. "Alright. Really not coming home with me? The lounge isn't as cozy as home.Plus, no one to chat with you. Aren't you planning to finish that astronomy book we were reading together?" Cedric was about to say "No", when Daniela leaned in,her lips brushing against his ear as she whispered something.


Cedric's fist, which had been resting on his leg,clenched instantly.


"Don't you want to look?" she teased, her voice low and seductive.


Cedric's throat tightened, his eyes darkening with an intensity that mirrored the shadows surrounding them.


Without a word, Cedric grasped Daniela's hand,leading her to his car.


The sleek, limited edition car tore through the empty streets, the night air rushing past as the engine hummed powerfully.



Later, in the dimly lit room, Daniela lay on the bed,her body drained of all energy. She teetered on the brink of unconsciousness when Cedric's voice sliced through the haze.



His gaze was cold and calculating as it locked onto hers. "If I hadn't agreed today, who were you planning to show this to?"



Exhausted, Daniela managed to breathe out, "Once things are settled, I'll use this to coax you back home." A few stray tears escaped the corners of her eyes,slipping down her pale cheeks.



The sight was enough to ignite something wild within Cedric.



The next day, Alexander sat in Daniela's office with a new proposal, waiting for her to return the whole day.


Nina asked, "Why didn't Daniela come to work today?She's usually here before anyone else."


Natalie narrowed her eyes, the familiar stingof jealousy burning within her.


She had already checked the surveillance footage-Daniela had stayed in the office until nearly midnight.


Moments later, Cedric had arrived and whisked her away with an urgency that was nothing like his usual indifference.



What had made him act so hastily?



What had caused such an unexpected shift in his demeanor?



It didn't take much to piece it together.


Nina's thoughts mirrored Natalie's, and she bowed her head,her sadness settling over her like a heavy cloud.



Natalie pressed her lips together, then pushed open  the CEO's office door. "Mr. Bennett, perhapsit's time for you to head back?"


Alexander narrowed his eyes, irritation flashing across his face. "What exactly is Daniela up to? Is she intentionally avoiding me, not even bothering to come to work?"



A flicker of disdain crossed Natalie's heart.


Alexander really did think too highly of himself. What had Daniela ever seen in him?



But she maintained her composed smile. "You're overthinking. Daniela isn't like that. It's just that..."



She paused, letting the air of mystery hang between them.



Alexander leaned forward, his curiosity piqued. "Just what?"



"It's just that today isn't convenient."


Alexander stiffened, processing her words.



He stared at Natalie, whose expression seemed almost too innocent. She chuckled, her tone light."Cedric seems to have quite the appetite when it comes to... certain things. And Daniela's health is delicate. Often after such nights, she's too drained to work the next day." 
Natalie sighed deeply, shaking her head as if pitying the situation. "Cedric can't seem to know when to take a step back."



She let out a small laugh, her eyes glinting. "But I'm sure you'd understand the bigger picture and act accordingly. I heard that Daniela didn't want Cedric to come back last night, but he threw a tantrum, and she had to coax him for ages."



Natalie watched as Alexander's face darkened, the satisfaction bubbling inside her as she kept her tone casual. "I just don't understand why she puts up with Cedric so much. If you ask me, you're far more handsome than him."



At the compliment, Alexander looked at her sharply,his eyes sharpening. "Really?"


"Of course," Natalie replied smoothly, her smile widening. "Someone as accomplished as you would be the perfect match for Daniela. Cedric, on the other hand,is too childish."



No one had ever flattered Alexander like that.



His chest swelled with pride, his mood lifting in an instant. He clicked his tongue in annoyance. "Cedric really isn't sensible, is he?"
###Chapter 385 With Her Full Consent
Daniela entered the office early,only to be met with the sight of Alexander already settled in.



Cedric had his workstation in Daniela's office.



"Are you the one overseeing Sunny Pharmaceuticals?"Daniela asked,cutting straight to the point.


Alexander nodded. "Yes, these are the evaluation reports and our latest financial statements."



Daniela skimmed through the papers before asking,"Is Doug the real power behind all this?"


For a moment, Alexander was caught off guard.



It was true that Doug was the one funding the venture,while Alexander managed everything else, even standing as the company's legal figurehead.


How had Daniela managed to figure out Doug's role with just a cursory glance at the documents?


Alexander, confident in his business acumen, was sure that only the sharpest professionals would catch any inconsistencies in the report. "How did you know?" Alexander blurted out, unable to hide his surprise. The words left him before he could stop them, and regret followed immediately.



"You don't need to be so taken aback. We simply see things differently," Daniela replied, her voice even and measured. "I'll go over the collaboration plan when l can. For now, you can return and wait for the update."



Throughout the exchange, Daniela's professionalism remained unwavering, her expression devoid of any warmth beyond the formality of the conversation.



It left a hollow feeling in Alexander, a sting that lingered.


However, he quickly shook it off. The partnership was essential, and there was no room for errors. He understood that regaining a woman's heart required more than just effort-it demanded a calculated approach.



With a respectful nod, he stood up. His voice gentle,he said to Daniela, "I'll be on my way,then."


The intimacy in his tone was obvious.



Cedric, who had been absorbed in his laptop across the room, noticed it and slowly looked up.


Their gazes met, and Alexander asked, "Mr. Phillips,may I have a moment of your time?" Ledric and Alexander left Daniela's office and paused t the end of the hallway.


Jina observed the two men from a distance,her eyes arrowing thoughtfully. She turned to Natalie and ausked, "Alexander seems to have his act together. Do ou think we should consider bringing him onto our teide?"



Natalie's gaze deepened as she pondered for a moment, then said, "Let's wait and see what unfolds."


leanwhile, at the other end of the hallway,Alexander ixed his eyes on Cedric's handsome features,bathed the glow of the lights. With a mocking grin,he neered, "Don't get too comfortable, Cedric. Just ecause you're in a good spot now doesn't mean 2ou've won."


Ji-edric gave a dismissive snort. "What do you mean by at? I don't even see you as an opponent."


z ene words hit Alexander like a blow, igniting his fury.
10 eoon't get too cocky. I'm the one who's been loved ,Daniela for ten years. I won't back down."
6W

edric's look at Alexander was one of utter disdain, as oadihe were staring at something worthless. "You're still ole knging to that? Do you really think you've got a ance? You're fooling yourself.Daniela has standards.id you're too tainted-better suited for someone like Joyce."


The mention of Joyce made Alexander's blood boil.


It stung like an open wound, a reminder of the shame he couldn't escape.



Cedric, uninterested in dragging things out, turned to leave.



But just as he stepped away, Alexander's voice rang out, laced with a chilling edge. "Don't wear her out too much in bed, Cedric. Daniela's not as strong as you think."



Cedric halted in his tracks.



A cold glance flickered across his face. He had no intention of sharing details of his private life with anyone other than Daniela, especially not with Alexander.



"Alexander, I don't care to discuss my private life. But just so you know, if I wanted to, I could wipe Sunny Pharmaceuticals off the map without breaking a sweat."



The words hit Alexander like a punch. His face shifted from arrogance to shock. "I dare you."



Cedric's smile was almost imperceptible, a flicker of amusement. "You really want to test me?" Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel,hands casually stuffed into his pockets.


Alexander gave Daniela the proposal in the morning,but Sunny Pharmaceuticals went bankrupt in the afternoon.



The news reached Daniela soon after, and she was taken aback.


Her brow furrowed as she asked, "What exactly did he do to set you off?"


Cedric was direct. "He was after you. And besides, if 1didn't step in, it seemed like he forgot who runs the game in Olisvine."



Daniela nodded, her expression unreadable, before discarding the proposal Alexander had handed her into the trash.



To anyone watching, Cedric might've seemed unshakable, but inside, he was tense. The lack of anger from Daniela gave him some relief, and he exhaled,the weight easing off his chest.


With a sense of satisfaction, he managed to obliterate several of Bennett Group's latest projects, all before the day was done.



As Cedric prepared to head downstairs to receive a parcel, Alexander appeared at the door. Without knocking, he stormed in. "Cedric Phillips,don't you know how to show some grace after a win?"


Cedric didn't even flinch, his face unreadable. After all,he was the untouchable CEO, the one everyone in Olisvine feared. "I don't bother with that."


Anger bubbled up in Alexander's chest. "You're worried, aren't you? Afraid that I'll become a real threat and take your spot next to Daniela?"



"Seriously?" Cedric chuckled lightly, amusement flickering in his eyes. "If you becoming a real competitor could challenge my spot, I'd focus more on market trends to make sure you never get that chance."



Fury blazed in Alexander's eyes, but Cedric remained unfazed, strolling upstairs without a second thought.



As the elevator ascended, Lillian couldn't help but laugh. "Cedric, your jealousy is something else. With the way you've handled things, no other man in Olisvine would dare make a move on Daniela. You could bankrupt someone in the blink of an eye."



Cedric remained silent.


Curious, Lillian pressed further, asking, "Does Daniela know?"



A slight smirk tugged at Cedric's lips. "I've done it with her full consent."



Daniela had once told him that in the rest of her life,it would only be him. In matters of love, she would indulge him, no matter what chaos he might stir.


Lillian wasted no time, quickly passing on their conversation to Daniela, who was immersed in reviewing a new international proposal for a company at the time.
###Chapter 386 Cedric Asked Me Out
At first, Daniela didn't quite catch what was said.



Lillian repeated it.


Daniela chuckled. "Did he really say that?"


Lillian nodded, her eyes gleaming with amusement."Yeah,you should have seen it. Cedric was practically glowing with pride when he said it."



Just as they were talking, Natalie pushed the door open, catching the tail end of the conversation. "Let him be."



Her smile was so indulgent, it didn't feel like it was meant for just any suitor.


Natalie's hands tightened into fists at her sides.



Alexander was truly a disappointment-completely no match for Cedric. Despite her best efforts to sow discord, they hadn't broken up.



Her gaze lingered in the room for a moment before her eyes shifted to Nina, standing just outside the hallway, her eyes soft and full of longing as she watched Cedric. Natalie moved towards her,her voice low as she leaned in. "Nina, staring at him like that won't get you anywhere. Do you even know how to win Cedric's heart?"



Nina's lips pressed together, a flash of irritation crossing her face.


She couldn't understand why Daniela and Cedric had suddenly reconciled.


Hadn't they been on the verge of breaking up? And now, after just one night, everything was back to normal?



In fact, it seemed like their relationship was even stronger than before.



Cedric was doting on Daniela like never before.


Sometimes, Nina felt like an intruder, embarrassed to even stay in the office.



In a foul mood, Nina shot back at Natalie, her tone sharp. "I don't know, do you? From what I see, Cedric barely even notices you. And to think Mom used to say how much you look like Daniela."


Natalie's teeth clenched, her eyes blazing with indignation. But in the end, she took a slow breath,swallowing her anger, and forced a smile. "Nina, I don't want to fight with you. We're sisters, and all this bickering will only hurt us in the end."


Nina glanced at her, the words lingering in the air between them. "Then tell me,how can I win Cedric's heart?"



Natalie's gaze drifted toward Daniela's office before she answered quietly, "Play to his preferences."



Nina narrowed her eyes. "Cedric doesn't have many interests. His only focus is Daniela."


A pause followed, thick with meaning.



Nina slowly turned to look at Natalie, her expression unreadable.



"Got it?" Natalie asked, a sly smile curling at her lips.


Nina stood still for a moment, her gaze distant, before she moved towards Cedric.



Inside, Cedric was alone. Daniela had gone to a meeting.



Nina placed a beautifully wrapped box on Daniela's desk, her fingers brushing over the packaging. On her way out, she paused by Cedric's desk. "Cedric, would you like to try the pasties?"



Cedric opened his mouth to decline, but Nina added with a warm smile, "I gave some to Daniela before,and she really liked them. So I brought another box  today."


As expected, Cedric's gaze flickered towvard the box Nina offered. The pasties looked exquisite, their delicate rose fragrance wafting up.


He picked one up, taking a small bite. He chewed thoughtfully, then nodded."Not bad."


Out of the corner of his eye, Cedric spotted the box of rose pastries resting on Daniela's desk.


Nina's smile was subtle but victorious as she turned and left.


The rose pastries were a specialty from Brylee's hometown-delicately fragrant, with just the right touch of sweetness. They were Brylee's favorite.


Daniela had developed a fondness for them, too.


Elyse, a master in the kitchen, often made them, and Nina would bring them to Daniela.


Nina had once found the task tedious, but today, she was eager.



When Daniela returned from her meeting,she casually picked up a pastry and took a bite. Cedric watched her,his attention focused.



Daniela glanced at him and smiled. "What's on your mind?" "Do you like these pastries?"



"Yes,I do."



"Hmm." Cedric nodded, then turned back to his work,though his thoughts lingered on the pastries.


Later that evening, as Daniela prepared for a dinner event, Cedric walked over to Nina, his curiosity piqued."Where did you get those pastries from this afternoon?"


Nina's heart leaped in her chest,her excitement barely contained.



She almost stumbled over her words. Natalie, standing nearby, couldn't hide her smile as she answered for her. "Nina made them herself. She's really skilled with these things. Mom always said Brylee adored these traditional-style pastries."


Cedric's gaze shifted to Nina, his tone filled with quiet interest. "You made them yourself?"


Nina's face flushed crimson, her heart hammering as she struggled to meet Cedric's gaze. "Yes, I did."


Cedric's eyes softened, his curiosity growing. "Could you teach others how to make them?"


Nina's joy was evident, her voice bright as she nodded eagerly."Yes, of course!" Cedric smiled politely. "Thank you. Tomorrow is the weekend. Could I have someone pick you up at eight in the morning?"



Nina's excitement bubbled up, her cheeks turning a deep shade of pink. "Yes, of course!"


Cedric gave a small nod, his voice calm and composed. "I'll pay you the market rate for teaching,plus an additional fee for your effort-totaling a hundred thousand. Does that seem fair?"


Nina quickly shook her head, hands waving in protest."No need, I'll teach for free."



A hundred thousand, just for teaching a simple recipe,felt far too much.


Cedric didn't press the matter further. To him,the price was irrelevant-as long as Daniela was pleased,even a million would be worth it.



He transferred the money to Nina without hesitation and turned to head back to his office.



Nina stared at the notification on her phone, her eyes wide with disbelief. She turned to Natalie, barely able to contain her excitement. "Natalie, did you hear that?Cedric asked me out. I need to get a stylish outfit.This time, I'll make sure I succeed."
###Chapter 387 I've Slept With Cedric
With a satisfied smile, Nina exited, leaving Natalie frozen in place. Her eyes lingered through the door,fixed on Daniela in the CEO's office, a sneer curling her lips.


Before leaving for a meeting, Cedric had kissed Daniela on the forehead.



Natalie turned to Daniela, her voice dripping with mockery. "I must say, I envy the bond you have with Cedric. Not many men are like him. Even when you insist it's just about the physical,he still stays."


Understanding the subtle challenge in Natalie's words,Daniela chose silence, waiting for more.


Natalie paused for a few moments, waiting for a response from Daniela.When none came,she smirked and let out a chuckle. "Daniela, I just overheard Cedric planning to meet Nina this weekend."


Daniela remained emotionless. When it came to attraction, she was completely sure of herself. She trusted in her appearance and Cedric's loyalty.

 
Natalie felt a twinge of disappointment, unable to  sense any emotion from Daniela.



Did Daniela truly not care about Cedric?



Leaning in slightly, Natalie couldn't resist pressing further. "Aren't you curious about what they'll be up to this weekend?"



She waited, the silence thick between them.



Daniela's gaze remained locked on the project proposal on her screen, completely ignoring Natalie's question.



There was no flicker of concern for Cedric in her expression either.


Natalie clenched her jaw in quiet frustration, lowering her eyes as she made her way out of the office.


In the hallway, she called her mother. "Mom, stop trying. I've tested her again and again. Daniela doesn't care about Cedric. If you want to hit her where it hurts,you'll have to dig into her personal affairs. Cedric won't work."



Elyse's voice crackled with doubt through the phone."Are you sure? Nina mentioned things were heating up between them. Cedric is Daniela's weakness, her Achilles' heel. Do you really think you've got it right?"


"Mom, do you not trust me?" Natalie's tonewas tinged with impatience. "I told you, they only have a physical  connection. If she truly cared, she'd be worried about him meeting someone else. Daniela doesn't care for Cedric at all."



On the other end, Elyse exhaled sharply, her voice laced with concern. "If that's the case, we're in trouble.Without a weakness like Cedric, we'll have to go after herself to get to her assets."


Though she spoke with resolve, unease lingered in Elyse's voice.


Determined, she made her decision.


With a small gift in hand, she stepped into Daniela's office.



A smile played on her lips as she said, "Daniela, you know, Nina's getting older. It's time she thought about marriage."



The moment Elyse spoke, Daniela knew exactly what was coming.



Without even lifting her gaze, she responded casually,"Oh? Do you have someone in mind?"


Elyse didn't hesitate. "Of course. Nina's particular,you see. After all this time working as your secretary, she's taken a liking to one of the men over at Elite Lux. But she's worried you won't approve."



A faint smile tugged at Daniela's lips. "Surely you're joking. The employees at Elite Lux are free to make their own choices when it comes to marriage."



Elyse took a slow sip of her coffee, her laughter gentle but knowing. "This one's a bit different, though.Your approval is important."


Daniela, still engrossed in her work, gave a brief nod."I'm listening."



Without hesitation, Elyse dropped the name. "Cedric."


"Cedric?" Daniela's pen hovered over the contract as she glanced down, her expression unreadable.



"Yes, Cedric. I'm here to ask if what you have with him is serious, or just a passing fling. If it's the latter, I think it would be best to let Nina and Cedric have their chance together." A knowing smile crept onto Elyse's face. "Cedric has a lot of potential. If he were to marry into the Dury family, he'd be quite the asset in the future,wouldn't you agree?"



Elyse was certain her question would make Daniela hesitant, expecting some vague or unclear answer.


"I've slept with Cedric," Daniela said.
###Chapter 388 This Is Not Impossible
Daniela's voice was as soft as a whisper, yet her words hit Elyse and Natalie like a thunderclap.



Their stunned expressions didn't escape her notice.andshe allowedherself afaintsmile."What?Surprised?"



The difference between suspecting something and hearing it confirmed with such candidness was undeniable.



Elyse broke the silence with a chuckle and asked, "So,does this mean you're planning to settle down with Cedric soon?"


Daniela's response was calm and unwavering."No."



She and Cedric had married long ago.


Elyse exhaled in visible relief. "Since you're not interested in settling down with Cedric,why not let Nina have him?"


Daniela's laughter was light, almost dismissive."Oh?Nina doesn't mind that I've been involved with Cedric?How generous of her."


Elyse waved her hand as if brushing off the remark. "lf Nina manages to get the man you've discarded, she should count herself lucky."


The comment drew a slight frown from Daniela, and her tone grew cold, the warmth fading entirely."Cedric is a great person. He's not a man l've discarded. Now, if there's nothing else, I have work to do.You should leave."



Elyse's voice softened as she asked,"What about Nina and Cedric?"



Daniela's answer was clipped and firm. "I've already said, it's a personal matter. Whether Cedric takes a liking to Nina depends entirely on her. Asking me won't change anything. Now,please see yourself out."



Elyse left, her cheerful smile betraying no offense taken.



At the doorway, Natalie whispered, "Mom, see? I told you, but you didn't believe me. Daniela really isn't interested in Cedric."



Elyse's carefully laid plan to use Cedric to unnerve Daniela crumbled.



Daniela appeared utterly unbothered, her calm demeanor betraying no possessiveness over Cedric whatsoever.



"Then call off the professional killers sent after Cedric. Redirect their focus to Daniela. Her assets are multiplying rapidly. By the end of the year, they'll reach their peak. Bring in the hypnotist to hypnotize her, and by New Year's, have her sign a will leaving everything to me. After that, let her meet the same end as Brylee."


Natalie gave a curt nod and said, "Understood. I'll take care of it immediately."


She started to leave but hesitated after a few steps.Turning back, she asked reluctantly, "What about Cedric? Are we really going to let Nina have him?"


Elyse exhaled slowly and asked, "Do you honestly have feelings for Cedric?"



Natalie nodded."I do."



Elyse fell silent for a moment before asking, "Even if it meant giving up Daniela's billion-dollar fortune,would you still want him?"


Natalie's gaze didn't falter as she replied, "I would."



Elyse relayed Natalie's intentions to Nina later that day.



She had expected Nina to agree without question,but instead, Nina rejected the idea outright.



"What's so special about Cedric?" Elyse asked. "He barely even smiles when he's around you two. What could you possibly see in him?" Nina's expression softened as a dreamy look crossed her face. "Mom, you don't get it. He's been my dream since I was young. I wouldn't trade him for anything.Tomorrow's chance to teach Cedric how to make pastries is mine!"



Elyse frowned, her voice turning cold. "With money,you could have any man you want."


Nina shook her head, a lovesick smile tugging at her lips. "But there's only one Cedric in this world."



In the end, Elyse sided with Natalie. The next morning,she locked Nina inside the house.



Natalie prepared for the meeting with a surge of confidence. Hugging Elyse before she left, she said,"Don't worry, Mom. Today, I'll win Cedric over with my charm!"



Elyse nodded firmly and gave the man beside her a slight push, directing him towards Natalie. "If Cedric stays unyielding, take him along. He'll assist in hypnotizing Cedric, ensuring you can capture his heart effortlessly."



Natalie gave a determined nod. "Alright, I'll do it."


Nina stood silently on the second-floor balcony, her gaze fixed on the driveway as Natalie drove off with the hypnotist. Her hands gripped the cold metal railing so tightly her knuckles turned white.



Why?



Why was everyone determined to go against her?


Why, just when she had glimpsed a sliver of hope, did it have to vanish so cruelly?



Why?



Tears of anger and helplessness rolled down her cheeks.



She seethed with resentment towards Natalie and Elyse for stealing everything that was supposed to be hers.


Natalie, meanwhile, headed to the meeting with unwavering confidence.


During the drive, she repeatedly sought reassurance from the hypnotist, her tone edged with urgency."Your techniques are perfected, right? There won't be any harm to his body, will there? This is the man I want to spend my entire life with. I can't bear the thought of causing him pain-not even a scratch.Make sure it's safe!"



Just before stepping in, Natalie stopped and issued a precise instruction. "Don't hypnotize him yet. Wait for my signal."


Deep down,she wanted to try winning Cedric over on her own first.


Maybe she could charm him without needing any tricks.





It wasn't an impossible dream.


She straightened her outfit, smoothed her hair, and entered with confidence.


It was a cozy little pastry shop. As she stepped inside with a radiant smile, a man with a neatly trimmed beard walked towards her.


"Hello. Are you the instructor teaching rose pastries?I'm Leo."
###Chapter 389 Daniela Might Truly Lose Herself

Natalie's expression instantly soured. "I couldn't care less who you are! Where is Cedric?"



"He isn't here. He said he had already settled the payment with you, and today, I'm here to learn how to make the rose pastries."


Natalie began to walk away, but the hypnotist behind her chuckled, asking, "Should I still assist you?"


By the time Natalie got home, Nina had already heard the news.



She was sitting on the sofa, peeling an orange. She looked up at Natalie and sneered. "What,Cedric didn't bother to show up? I figured you'd be coming back as his girlfriend."



Without hesitation, Natalie crossed the room and slapped Nina hard. "Bitch!"



Nina let out a laugh, clearly unfazed. "Bitch? Then what does that make you? A thief who takes what isn't yours!"



Natalie,burning with anger,retorted,"What's with that smug look? Cedric probably didn't even know I was

 coming, which is why he didn't show. It only proves that he isn't into you."



Nina remained unbothered, feeling quite pleased. "Oh really? If Cedric doesn't care about me, then he definitely doesn't care about you either."


The tension finally exploded, and the two women were soon locked in a heated argument.


Elyse tried to intervene but was quickly slapped hard during the chaotic scuffle.


Frowning, she couldn't help but wonder how she ended up with two daughters so fixated on romance.


Clearly, Cedric needed to be handled.


Without wasting another second, Elyse grabbed her phone and left.


Lately, Cedric had been picking Daniela up after work.


With the driver taking some time off, he was driving himself, and Daniela was sitting in the passenger seat.


As they made their way halfway down the road, Cedric suddenly felt something strange with the brakes.


He was about to pull over and check when, out of nowhere, a truck came speeding towards them.


There was no time to think, no time to react.  Instinctively,Cedric threw his body over Daniela,trying to shield her from the impending impact.


In a split second, the sleek, expensive car was torn apart, reduced to a twisted heap of scrap metal,surrounded by a thick cloud of smoke.



Elyse was in the crowd, watching from a distance.



She heard Daniela's frantic voice and saw as the medical team rushed to Cedric's side.



Daniela stayed close, accompanying her unconscious husband into the ambulance, her presence commanding the scene. As she stood by the ambulance, she cast a cold, sweeping glance at the onlookers, her eyes narrowing as they landed on one particular person.



Then,through the smoke and biting cold wind, she let her lips curve into a slow, calculating smile.


The ambulance sped off, leaving the scene behind,but Elyse remained standing, her body tense. She couldn't help but wonder if Daniela had seen her in the crowd.



But that seemed impossible. She had been standing outside the crowd, with the police line separating them,making it unlikely Daniela had noticed her from that far away. Elyse decided to leave and turned her car around,but as she hit the gas, an explosion suddenly shattered the silence.



The deafening blast echoed across the sky.



Elyse quickly looked up to see chunks of metal from the blast soaring high before coming back down with a crash.



The explosion sent the crowd into a frenzy, with the onlookers ducking and covering their heads.


The once dark sky was now burned with an intense red glow from the flames.


Daniela sat outside the operating room, tense and still,waiting for Lillian and theothers to arrive before she finally stood up, her movements shaky.


She played the video of the accident, her eyes glued to the screen.


"Daniela, you should get some rest. Ryan and I can handle things here," Lillian suggested.



Daniela watched the entire video without a word,then shoved her phone back into her pocket. A cold,menacing aura surrounded her. "I want the Dury family to pay dearly for this."


Lillian could only pray in silence, hoping Cedric would  pull through-because if he didn't, Daniela might truly lose herself.
###Chapter 390 Holding A Press Conference
Word of Cedric's car crash spread like wildfire across Olisvine.



By the time Alexander and Joyce arrived, Cedric had just been taken out of surgery.



Daniela sat in a chair by the door, her face serious.



She looked colder and more intimidating than anyone had ever seen.



She radiated an oppressive aura, making anyone nearby hesitate.



Just then, a reporter nervously walked up to her and asked, "Ms. Harper, can you tell us what happened during the incident?"



Daniela slowly raised her head, her gaze fixing on the reporter.


He froze in place, unable to shake the chill that spread through him.


It was a look so intense, so unwelcoming,that it made everyone around her uneasy. One by one, the people around instinctively stepped back, as if the very space around her had become unbearable.



Joyce, who had intended to walk over and make a sharp remark, found herself frozen in place. As she caught sight of Daniela's expression, her words died in her throat.



Inside the room, doctors were conducting a thorough post-surgery examination.


Daniela stayed seated by the door, allowing only medical personnel to enter.



Executives from Phillips Group had arrived,accompanied by bodyguards, but the guards weren't needed in the presence of Daniela.


Daniela, undeterred, stayed by the door the entire night.


Doctors and nurses moved quickly in and out,attending to the situation, while Daniela maintained her silent vigil.


At last, the lead doctor let out a relieved sigh. "He's stable now."



A slight sense of relief softened the tightness in Daniela's gaze. She stood, facing the cameras. Her eyes,bloodshot from two sleepless nights, remained cold and devoid of warmth.



"I know everyone is eager to know about the accident.r'll hold a press conference soon to clarify everything.Until then, I request that no one-whether media or business contacts-disturb Cedric. Let him have the space to recover in peace."



The reporters exchanged uncertain looks, knowing full well that many in the business world were itching to get in touch with Cedric at this critical moment.


Without turning around, Daniela told her secretary,"Keep an eye on anyone trying to get through. If anyone slips by in the morning, make them disappear from Olisvine by the afternoon."



With that,she sat down and sipped the oatmeal Lillian had brought her.


The door to Cedric's room stayed open, but only the secretary stood by, holding a pen, while no one else dared to enter.


Joyce pressed her lips together and whispered to Alexander, "Do you think we should go in and check on Cedric?"


Alexander shook his head. "Let's stay outside. If anything important happens, we'll hear about it. The  reporters are more on edge than we are anyway."


Cedric, the CEO of Phillips Group, had been gravely injured and was now in the hospital.


The news spread quickly, and Phillips Group's stock value dropped nearly 50% the next day.


Competitors wasted no time capitalizing on the situation.


The executives at Phillips Group tried every strategy they could think of, but they couldn't stop the freefall.


As the CEO, Cedric was the driving force behind the company. With him in crisis, investors naturally began to panic.


One by one, senior executives at Phillips Group grew increasingly anxious. Despite their best efforts, Cedric was still unconscious on the third day.



When the market reopened, the stock price hit yet another all-time low.


"Oh no, it's dropped again. Is Phillips Group done for?"


"I think it's more about Cedric being in serious danger than the company's future."


"I saw him when they took him out of the car.His face was covered in blood.""Do you think they're going bankrupt?"


"Bankruptcy probably won't happen, but they're talking about a leadership change. Turmoil looks inevitable. I'm selling my shares; it's too risky."


"I'm selling as well."



Those were the online comments.



This was the most serious crisis Phillips Group had ever faced since its inception.


In the past, no matter what came up, senior management always remained calm as long as Cedric was there.



Everyone knew that as long as he was in charge, no problem was too big to solve. He had a way of navigating through crises effortlessly, finding solutions when it seemed like there were none.


They had grown used to relying on him as their pillar of support.


In this moment of crisis, no one even considered appointing a new CEO. They were all deeply worried about Cedric's condition.


The PR manager blamed himself, his frustration clear in his voice. "This is on me. I've been taking it easy for too long. Whenever a problem came up, Mr. Phillips  handled it and gave instructions. All I did was follow them.Now that something serious has happened,and he's not here, I'm completely lost. If the stock keeps falling,I won't know what to do."



The finance manager added with a heavy sigh, "The reports from the past few days are hard to stomach.Just thinking about how our stock price has been falling is enough to make my heart race."


The marketing manager exclaimed, "What are we supposed to do now? With Mr. Phillips out of commission, it's up to us to protect Phillips Group for him."



The air was thick with tension as everyone spoke in low voices, worry clear on their faces.


In the hospital corridor, the atmosphere was heavy,with anxious expressions all around.


Noticing this, Daniela stood up from her seat, cutting through the whispers. She turned to her secretary and said, "Inform everyone that the press conference will begin in ten minutes."



All eyes turned to Daniela instantly.


None of them were holding their breath for her announcement.


No matter how skilled Daniela was, she couldn't  change the reality that Cedric was still unconscious.Even if he regained consciousness,his recovery would take time. The investors needed solid assurance. As the CEO of Elite Lux, Daniela technically had no authority to make official statements or decisions on Cedric's behalf.



So,while people's attention was momentarily lifted by her words, their fleeting hope soon evaporated.
###Chapter 391 This Was A Premeditated Murder
Prior to the press conference,Daniela made her way to Cedric's attending physician.


Lex Myers, a highly respected expert in his field,had known Daniela for years. As soon as she entered,she got straight to the point and asked, "How long until Cedric wakes up?"



Lex's face clouded with concern. "I can't give you a specific timeline. I've run all the tests, and while the car accident was severe, it wasn't catastrophic enough to leave him in a coma for this long. I'm still trying to figure out a few oddities in his medical data."



Daniela's eyes narrowed with sharp focus. "How long are we talking?"



"It could take a month, maybe longer. I have a hunch that what he ate might be connected, so I'll focus my investigation there," Lex replied,his voice tinged with uncertainty.



The coldness in Daniela's gaze deepened. "Are you implying that something Cedric ate caused this coma?"


Lex nodded solemnly. "It's possible. I've found  irregularities in his blood work, but nothing is definitive yet. I need more time to dig deeper."


Daniela absorbed his words in silence, a sharp clarity settling in.


Cedric's recovery wouldn't be quick.


With a steady nod, she turned to leave, her voice unwavering. "You have access to all of Elite Lux's medical resources. The labs are open to you.I won't wait a month. Ten days, Lex. I need answers within that time."


As Daniela stepped out of the doctor's office,Lillian was already waiting for her. "All the reporters from Olisvine are here."



A brief nod was Daniela's response. "Got it."


Instead of joining Lillian for the press conference,Daniela took a different path, heading to Cedric's ward.


She lowered herself into a chair by his bedside,her gaze lingering on him-motionless in his hospital gown.


For a brief moment, the stillness of the scene made it seem as though Cedric was simply deep in sleep.


"Cedric, you never understood why I kept our relationship a secret. You argued with me time and again,but I held firm. You always wanted to know why.  Now I can finally explain. I did it because I feared this.I feared that one day, you would end up like this.My life is a tangled web of burdens, some of which go back to my mother's death. I always thought that as long as I kept our marriage hidden, I could shield you from the dangers that come with it. No matter how much it upset you, I couldn't bring myself to cross that line."



However, Daniela realized hiding her marriage with Cedric was pointless. Those cruel people would never spare anyone close to her.



"So, today, everything changes. I'm making our relationship public. From now on, Cedric, I'll protect you, and I'll protect Harper Group, Elite Lux, and Phillips Group."



"Daniela, the press conference is about to begin."Lillian knocked on the door.



Daniela slowly placed Cedric's hand back beneath the blanket, her voice gentle as she whispered, "Rest,Cedric.I'll be back soon."



With that, Daniela got up and walked away.



The moment she crossed the threshold, the smile she had been wearing vanished.


The press conference buzzed with an air of chaos. Reporters, eager for answers, wvere consumed with curiosity over the sudden accident and eager to see how the young female CEO would navigate Phillips Group through this storm.



Some of them were quick to judge, questioning if Daniela, not being the CEO of Phillips Group, was overstepping her role.


Tough questions were on the horizon. The reporters had clearly come prepared, ready to press Daniela on every angle.


When the conference began, Daniela took her place at the center of the stage.


A microphone, waiting like a silent sentinel, stood before her.



As Daniela stepped into the room, an unmistakable shift in her presence rippled through the crowd-she was sharper, more focused than her usual self.


"Good afternoon, everyone," Daniela said, skipping the pleasantries. "Thank you for being here. By now,you're all aware of the car accident that involved Cedric and myself. This wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate attack on our lives, and the authorities are already involved. I won't get into the specifics right now. Today's conference is about the future of Phillips Group and ensuring full transparency for both the public and our investors."
###Chapter 392 Please Show The Proof
The moment Daniela's words echoed in the room, a wave of shock swept over everyone.



The executives of Phillips Group were stunned.



Daniela's unexpected boldness in stepping up to represent Phillips Group caught them off guard.


Her actions today didn't just reflect her own intentions:they subtly signaled to the public that Harper Group and Elite Lux would back all future business ventures of Phillips Group.



The executives of Phillips Group regarded her with a newfound appreciation.


At first, it seemed like Daniela would give a few courteous remarks and end the press conference.


However,to everyone's shock, she spoke again with certainty."From today until Cedric recovers,I will take complete control over managing Phillips Group."


As soon as those words escaped her, the previously hectic scene came to a complete standstill.


People froze in disbelief, their eyes widening as they  turned to stare at Daniela.



Daniela's voice was measured and unwavering,each word cutting through the air with precision. "It's clear someone has malicious plans to bring down Phillips Group. If that's the case, then bring it on. I didn't start this,but I won't shy away from it either. The first move has been made, and there's no turning back now.We'll see this through to the end, together. I'm ready to face whatever comes next."



Elyse was quietly observing from the corner of the room.



She had been eagerly waiting for Daniela to crack,hoping to see her break down in tears, lost and helpless,crushed by despair.


She had planned to use the chaos to take Daniela down just as she had with Brylee, but she hadn't expected Daniela to boldly declare war before the cameras.



Elyse leaned in and murmured something to a reporter nearby.



Seconds later, the reporter raised his hand, asking, "Ms.Harper,you mentioned taking over the management of Phillips Group starting today. Has this been approved by the senior members of Phillips Group, or is this just your own ambition?" question seemed to stir the room, catching the ention of the reporters present.


ou're undoubtedly capable, Ms. Harper,but this is illips Group we're talking about. Would they accept outsider's interference?"



hillips Group has become a powerhouse,with many erlapping interests with Elite Lux. Couldn't they be orried about competition impacting their business?"


he reporters' questions were pointed and hard-itting, grabbing everyone's attention.


midst the commotion, an executive of Phillips Group poke. "Let me share my thoughts. I've been with the ompany for more than ten years, serving as the inance director. With Mr. Phillips facing an wnexpected crisis, we deeply appreciate Ms. Harper's Jbunwavering support. We trust her completely, and with her leadership, we are confident in our path forward."


While the outside world might be unaware, everyone inside Phillips Group knew of Cedric's ongoing pursuit of Daniela. They had all seen firsthand the depth of his feelings for her.


In the unpredictable world of business, it was a rarity to find someone who stepped forward to offer help during such a turbulent time.



Daniela's readiness to take charge and support Phillips Group in such a stormy moment was met with sincere gratitude by all within the company.


From the crowd, a cold voice broke through. It came from a man in a black hat and mask. "Oh, is that so?The executives of Phillips Group might be confident,but what about the investors? Daniela isn't even part of Phillips Group. Are you conspiring with her to push Cedric out while he's in a coma?"



The room, which had been quiet, suddenly erupted into heated discussion.



"Yes,this kind of thing isn't unheard of. Who knows if Daniela is using Cedric's illness to get what she wants?"


"The executives seem to be going along with it.Maybe they've been bribed by Daniela!"


"Doesn't that spell disaster for Phillips Group?"


"Exactly, businessmen these days only care about money, and Daniela is known as one of the best at what she does. Isn't that clear?"


The executives of Phillips Group didn't know how to respond as the situation spiraled out of control.


Daniela remained calm as she addressed the room."Can someone tell me which reporter just labeled me an outsider to Cedric and Phillips Group?" Her words stunned the crowd below the stage into  silence.


Given Elite Lux's power, Daniela held significant sway.Whispering behind her back was one thing, but who would dare openly challenge her? Only someone foolish enough to invite disaster would dare.


The crowd recoiled, too intimidated to voice their thoughts.



The executives of Phillips Group seethed silently,cursing the troublemakers in their midst.


Daniela surveyed the room, her face a mask of seriousness. "So no one will own up to it? Should I review the surveillance footage? Let me find out which reporter called me an outsider to Phillips Group."


As she finished, Ryan made his way to check the footage.


In that moment, a hand shot up from the crowd,and a wiry man with a sharp face stood.



His tone was a mix of challenge and resignation as he said, "I said it. Did I say something out of line?Everyone knows Mr. Phillips has been pursuing you,but you've never returned his feelings, have you? How is that not being an outsider? Am I mistaken? If so,prove me wrong and show the proof."
###Chapter 393 Cedric And I Are Married
Phillips Group's executives couldn't stand by and watch Daniela being pushed into a corner.



One of them rose to his feet, his frustration written all over his face.



But before he could say a word, Daniela reached into her pocket and revealed a document. It was a marriage certificate.



The executives were the first to notice that,and they froze in shock.



The rest of the room stared at the document with growing curiosity.



Elyse's eyes narrowed sharply, a sense of unease twisting in her gut.


When Daniela finally raised the certificate for everyone to see, the room fell into stunned silence.



No one was more shaken than the reporter who had spoken out earlier.



His complexion turned ashen as he stared at the certificate."This is absurd!" he exclaimed, breaking the silence with a laugh that bordered on hysteria. "A marriage certificate? Really? Daniela,are you trying to tell us that you and Cedric are actually married? How could that possibly be true? Given your prominence and Cedric's status, a wedding between you two wouldn't go unnoticed. This has to be fake!"



The idea seemed inconceivable. If two titans of the business world like Daniela and Cedric had tied the knot, the news would have sent shockwaves through the corporate world. How could something so monumental have stayed under wraps?



"This has to be forged!"



Just then, Ryan stepped forward and played a surveillance clip, showing Daniela and Cedric at City Hall,officially registering their marriage.



The room erupted into gasps.


"It's real? I know that registrar! She handled my marriage paperwork,too!"


"I've seen her before as well. This is unbelievable!"



"So it's true? Daniela and Cedric are really married.This changes everything!"


Phillips Group's executives, initially as dumbfounded as the reporters, quickly shifted from shock to joy. Their expressions lit up with hope and relief as they exchanged glances.


This was a game-changer.


The solution to Phillips Group's crisis had finally appeared.


Cedric was no more alone. A celebration was no longer a distant thought.


Elyse and Natalie, standing at the edge of the press conference, watched the footage unfold on the screen. Slowly, both sank to the floor in shock.



"Mom, how could this be possible?" Natalie's voice trembled.



Elyse's eyes were cold, brimming with defeat. How could she have possibly predicted this? Until now,Daniela had kept her marriage to Cedric hidden from her.



Even when Cedric was invited by Nina to bake pastries,Daniela hadn't shown any jealousy.



So,all this time, she had been fooled by Daniela?



"Mom, what do we do now? We were planning to get rid of Daniela and claim her inheritance, but now she has a legal husband. If something happens to her,Cedric would inherit everything!" Natalie's voice cracked with anxiety. Elyse's gaze sharpened. "That means Cedric has to die too."





Natalie went pale at the words.


Elyse turned to her daughter, her voice low and menacing. "Isn't there someone who's been pursuing you at the hospital where Cedric is staying? It wouldn't be too difficult for him to take care of Cedric while he's bedridden, would it?"



Tears welled up in Natalie's eyes as she shook her head quickly. "No, Mom. I like Cedric. You promised that if he had a little accident, I could care for him,and we'd grow close. You said I'd be the one with him."



Elyse's expression hardened. "But that was before everything changed. Daniela's wealth must come to us. Don't you get it? You can always find another man,but a chance to seize Daniela's wealth doesn't come often."



Tears spilled down Natalie's face as she kept shaking her head desperately. "No, Mom. Please, give me one more chance. I'll make Cedric fall in love with me.Once that happens, I'll get him to sign over his fortune.It'll all be yours."



Elyse fixed her gaze on her daughter, her expression impossible to read. "Have you completely lost it?Cedric isn't the type to simply give up what's already  his. And after all this timne, there's been no indication that he's interested in either you or Nina."


Suddenly, Natalie dropped to her knees in front of Elyse. "Mom, please. Please, just one chance. I swear,I'll make Cedric love me."


Elyse's face grew serious. She couldn't believe her daughter-who had once been so promising-had fallen so completely for a man.


She knew then that Cedric could never be allowed to live.



Still, she gave a slow nod. "Alright. If you're this set on it, go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise, you'll never stop obsessing over it."


Natalie,overwhelmed with relief, burst into tears."Thank you,Mom!"



As she continued to wipe her eyes, Elyse subtly slipped her daughter's phone into her own bag.
###Chapter 394 The Hypnotist
Elyse stepped away to use the restroom, where she quickly sent a message to the doctor who was courting Natalie.


"Linden, once Cedric Phillips is gone,I'll be with you."


His reply came almost instantly, as if he had been waiting for her to reach out.


"Are you serious?"



Elyse quickly typed back, "Of course."



Linden responded, "It's a deal."



He then added, "Natalie, I'll take care of this as soon as possible, and then you'll be mine. I can't wait to start a perfect life with you."



Before leaving,Elyse erased the messages and added Linden under a new account.



"To avoid any problems later, use this backup account to get in touch with me from now on."



He answered quickly, "Got it."


A moment later, Liden messaged, "Can I get a little reward for this? After all, I'm doing something risky for you."


Elyse felt a wave of disgust but still took a provocative photo of her leg and sent it.


His eager response came almost instantly. "That's stunning. I can't wait for all the days we'll share together."



The thought of him alone made Elyse's stomach turn.She had met him before-a peculiar, disheveled man who always carried the smell of old, damp clothes.



But in order to manipulate him, Elyse forced herself to push aside her disgust and texted, "Me too."


Almost instantly, he replied with an inappropriate photo of his own.


Just at that moment, Natalie stepped in and asked,"Mom,have you seen my phone?"


Startled, Elyse swiftly tucked her phone away,returned Natalie's phone to her, and, with a cool,collected air, she walked out of the restroom.


Daniela's reputation in business was truly well-earned.



The day after the press conference, Phillips Group's stock skyrocketed, surpassing its previous highs.


The executives, who had been anxious and troubled,finally breathed sighs of relief. The entire Phillips Group not only admired and respected Daniela but now looked up to her with great reverence.



They followed her lead without question. Within just five days, Phillips Group's stock soared to new heights,shutting down all doubts.


A wave of optimism swept through everyone in the company.


Alexander stood frozen in front of the TV, watching every channel mention Daniela's name.



Daniela had tied the knot.



Daniela had saved Phillips Group.



Daniela had not only turned the company's crisis around but also lifted it to levels of success it had never seen before.



The way Daniela cared for Cedric was nothing short of inspiring.



Richard jabbed a finger at the TV, his voice sharp."Daniela saved Phillips Group. Why doesn't she save you? Does she have no heart? How can she watch you be used by Joyce and not even bat an eye? How could she be so heartless?"



His voice sent a chill down the room. It seemed like he was teetering on the edge of losing it.Or maybe,just maybe,he had already crossed that line.



Word had spread all over Olisvine that Alexander was being financially backed by Joyce, and people were making fun ofhim everywhere he went.


Once a respected figure, Richard was now treated like an outcast wherever he went.


He feIt like a shadow, an object of shame. His pride had been buried long ago.


At first, when Phillips Group's stock dropped, Richard stayed glued to the TV, secretly hoping it would collapse just like Bennett Group.


But after days of waiting, one press conference from Daniela not only revived Phillips Group but sent it into an unbelievable rise.


How could he stand watching this happen?



Richard exploded at Alexander in fury. "You must have been out of your mind to divorce Daniela! If you'd stayed with her, Bennett Group would still be flourishing.You pushed away such an amazing woman.This is al your fault. Just go get her back, however you need to. Bring Daniela back into your life!"



Alexander watched the TV, his eyes fixed on Daniela as she effortlessly took charge of the press conference.



A wave of jealousy overtook him.



Joyce called Alexander, commanding him to strip. He stayed frozen for a moment,refusing to move.



Joyce lay on the bed, a mocking smile on her lips."Are you still dreaming? Still imagining that Daniela will come back to you? The moment you bent to me,you lost any chance with her. Maybe she'd risk everything for Cedric, but that has nothing to do with you. Don't you get it? You and Daniela are finished.You belong to me now."



With that, she stood up, grabbed Alexander's tie, and yanked it loose,laughingharshly.


Once they finished making love, she stretched out on the bed, her expression dripping with smug satisfaction. "Daniela's probably buried in work. You need to go after her on the business front. Start by pulling some of Elite Lux's clients over to our side.Once you've gained a solid footing, make your move to get closer to her. After that,have the hypnotist do his work on her. Doug won't wait forever,so it's time to act quickly."
###Chapter 395 Do | Still Have A Chance
Lately,Doug had become more and more ruthless in bed.





Joyce was reaching her breaking point, but what could she do?



Money. That was the reason she had no escape.Doug's wealth held her in place, a gilded cage she couldn't bear to leave. She'd rather endure his torment than return to poverty.



What was the point of ambition?



Why should dignity matter?



Alexander had once walked with his head high, but now,he was forcedto swallow his pride and beg for scraps.



Humiliated, Alexander left Joyce's place, barely able to hold himself together. Before long, his car pulled up at the base of the Elite Lux building.



The security guards,upon seeing him,made it clear he wasn't welcome. They refused to let him see Daniela.


As the argument escalated, Lillian appeared, carrying ray of coffee. Her gaze landed on him, a smirk ling on her lips. "Alexander, is that you?"


a frosty voice, Alexander responded, "I must speak ith Daniela."


llian's disdain was evident. "Why? Failed to achieve our aims with Joyce and now you turn to Daniela?lexander, consider your actions. You're selling ourself now, aren't you? Just like a gigolo. Joyce has een telling everyone that you're available for ten thousand a night."


The color drained from Alexander's face. "Does Daniela know about this?" he asked, desperate for some remaining affection from her. "Cedric's in a coma.I could possibly..."


"What could you possibly offer? Alexander, do you really think you can entertain fantasies about our boss's wife?" An executive from Phillips Group, a recent regular at Elite Lux, overheard and exploded in anger.



The executive's fist connected with Alexander's face,and the sound of his nose breaking resonated through the lobby.



Head bowed, Alexander watched blood drip from his nose.



He wiped it away roughly, the pain intense. Despite wanting to retaliate, his attention shifted when Daniela walked through the door.


Seeing her, he momentarily forgot his agony. He wanted to break through the crowd to reach her side.


His desire was to beg her, to see if she would even glance his way once again.



This time, he was determined to value her as Cedric did.



Alexander longed to propose to Daniela that, with Cedric's absence, perhaps he could fill his shoes.


He had a multitude of things he wished to express to her.



His desire was to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness.



However,Lillian,the security staff,and the executives from Phillips Group were quicker to act.



They encircled Alexander comnpletely.


Daniela's retreating figure was all he could see as she mingled and laughed with investors, stepping into the elevator.



Ultimately, he found himself sinking to the floor,treated no better than slime underfoot. Yet,Alexander did not depart.



He remained seated, adamant about catching a glimpse of Daniela.



He knew he needed to act now, or once Cedric recuperated, any chance with Daniela would vanish.


As darkness fell, Alexander's eyes stayed glued to the elevator doors.



A passerby commented cheerily, "Daniela truly adores Cedric. Despite her hectic agenda, she makes daily hospital visits and even stays overnight. A prestigious global medical team is looking after him."


At that, Alexander rose unsteadily, clutching the speaker. "Has Daniela alreadyleft?"


The person answered, "Yes, she departed after the afternoon's engagements."


Alexander's grip on the speaker's clothing loosened and dropped. "She's gone? Already?"


Richard materialized beside Alexander, his expression tense. "Why not follow her? The hospital is far more accessible than here at Elite Lux. What are you so afraid of? Alexander, what have you got to lose? Go,plead with Daniela. Kneel if you must, and confess that you seek only her companionship,ready to stand in for Cedric. Daniela values loyalty. If you shed your  pride,she might just reconsider."


Staring vacantly, Alexander turned to Richard. "Do I still have a chance?"
###Chapter 396 Pay The Price
Richard's face looked worried against the cold,gray sky. He had become the target of too much ridicule recently and was desperately hoping Alexander would find a way to reconnect with Daniela, believing she could save Bennett Group. "Of course. She helped you just like she helped Cedric. You were the one she truly trusted with her heart. This is your only shot at breaking free from Joyce. Go ahead. The future of the Bennett family depends on you now!"



Richard drove Alexander to the hospital where Cedric was being treated. "Take the step, Alexander. You'll find happiness. This time,you have your father's full backing."



Alexander gave a solemn nod before walking into the hospital.



From a distance, Erika narrowed her eyes and muttered to Joyce beside her, "Alexander is so greedy."


Joyce just smiled coldly, unbothered.


Erika glanced at her, her voice filled with concern."Aren't you worried? What if Alexander actually ends up with Daniela?"



Joyce's laughter rang out,loud and unapologetic. Erika's expression was a mix of confusion and curiosity.



Joyce laughed until her sides ached. "Do you really understand Daniela? She can have any man she wants.Why would she want someone like Alexander? Trust me, she could have anyone, but Alexander will never be one of them."



Alexander never had the chance to find out if Daniela would feel pity for his current sorry state.



Before he could even enter, he was stopped by the bodyguards from Phillips Group.


They recognized him right away.


Minutes later, Alexander stumbled out, battered and broken. His nose and mouth were twisted, one leg clearly injured, and blood streaked his face.


Standing under the dark night sky, he cut a figure both pathetic and absurd.



Joyce stood in front of him, towering like a queen,her sneer sharp as a blade. "As long as you are Alexander,Daniela will never look your way again."


Struggling to keep himself upright with his hands,Alexander lifted his gaze to Joyce. "What exactly do you mean?"


Joyce's lips curled into a cruel smile. "I told you, in the  end, Daniela could be yours-but not if you are Alexander. Do you get it? Because as long as you are Alexander, she'll never forget those ten years when you treated her as if she didn't matter. She'll remember your indifference, your disregard, your scorn, and most of all,how you ignored her during the fire.Remaining Alexander means you'll never have any hope of winning her back."



A look of confusion crossed his face. Blood dripped from his mouth, but he didn't flinch. His voice was desperate as he asked, "But I am Alexander. How could I stop being Alexander?"


Joyce's smile turned even more sinister. "I have a solution, but it comes at a price. Are you ready to endure the cost?"


Alexander was lost, unable to comprehend her words,but his only focus was on one thing-finding a way to win Daniela's heart.



"I'll do it! Just tell me how!"


Joyce took in his battered form, her smile growing colder and more calculating.


She quickly arranged for a helicopter to whisk Alexander away.


The helicopter cut through the sky, leaving a long trail in its wake. Erika, confused, asked, "Where are you taking him?What do you mean he can't be Alexander anymore?"


Joyce smirked as she watched the helicopter disappear into the distance. Letting out a soft chuckle,she remarked, "In this world, if you have enough money and the determination to go all in, turning into a different person is surprisingly easy. I never expected Alexander to be willing to pay such a heavy price for Daniela."
###Chapter 397 Daniela Is More Beautiful Than Natalie
Erika looked at Joyce with disbelief. "Is plastic surgery what you're talking about?"



Joyce nodded. "Exactly. It involves completely transforming oneself to look like someone else.It's similar to sculpting a new identity, reshaping oneself from the inside out to imitate someone else, followed by professional training to mimic that person accurately. In five months, Alexander will be a different person."



Erika's eyes widened with curiosity. "Who is Alexander going to turn into?"


Joyce opened the car door in front of her. Before stepping in, she glanced towards Cedric's ward.



A soft,warm light glowed from inside.



She gave a slight smile and responded, "Cedric."



Daniela had not returned home these days. She spent all her available time at the hospital after work.



Experts from various countries were present there.



That day, the lead doctor came in with a serious look  and told Daniela, "Our suspicions wee true. The problem is related to the food. Please provide a thorough list of everything Mr. Phillips ate in the week earlier before his illness for our investigation."



Daniela nodded, and Ryan quickly started to review the computer surveillance footage.



Before leaving, the lead doctor introduced someone to Daniela. "This is Linden Potter, a graduate student I'm supervising this year. He will document Mr. Phillips 'reactions to the recent medications."


Daniela observed the man named Linden.


He wore a white doctor's coat, stood about five feet three inches tall, had a thinning hairline, and looked rather messy, with an unsettling air about him. His smile was cool, and his eyes, behind thick glasses,seemed chillingly detached, giving off an uncomfortable vibe.



Daniela held her tongue in his presence.


After Linden left, Daniela told the lead doctor, "I'd prefer a different doctor. Monitoring medication reactions is critical, and I cannot trust the care of my loved one to someone who doesn't even keep himself presentable."



The lead doctor quickly grasped the situation. "I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We had arranged for a  more experienced doctor for this task, but due to a flight issue, that doctor was delayed. Linden might seem a bit messy, but I will remind him to tidy up.In three days, the doctor we initially planned will arrive,and I will replace Linden at that time."



Linden came back with the medications, pausing outside the door to listen on the conversation.



He adjusted his glasses, a scheming grin spreading across his face.



He was surprised to find that Daniela was not only beautiful but also sharp. Just one look at him and she had requested his replacement.


Such a shame,he thought.



The doctor who was supposed to take the notes would never return.



Linden observed Daniela from outside, surprised once more by her appearance. He hadn't expected Daniela to outshine Natalie in beauty.



He had always considered Natalie to be the prettiest and had desired her for years.



Just as she seemed within his reach, he met Daniela,who was even more captivating.



Compared to Daniela, Natalie looked like an ordinary countrywoman. Linden entered with the logbook, his thick glasses concealing his greedy gaze. He smiled and assured them, "I'll be careful in recording Mr. Phillips 'reactions to the medications. Although I may not look very neat, I assure you of my precision in my professional duties."


Daniela kept quiet after that. She merely glanced at Linden's nails. For a doctor, his nails were unusually long, and the dirt beneath them caused her to frown.
###Chapter 398 If Your Offer Isn't Tempting Enough
Daniela didn't waste time with words. She reached out to some well-known doctors in her network,requesting that three specialists be sent immediately to support the attending doctor with every aspect of Cedric's care.



By that evening, the specialists had arrived, ready to step in.



Within the hour, Linden's tasks were completely handed over.


He arched a brow, silently acknowledging how impressive Daniela was-her quick thinking and decisive moves were truly remarkable.



Linden stepped outside and typed a message to "Natalie." "They've figured out what caused Cedric's coma and have started him on specific treatment."



"Natalie" responded almost instantly, "You need to get rid of Cedric now!"


Resting against the wall, Linden pushed his glasses up and let out a frosty smile. "Daniela's sharp. Doing something like this would put my career on the chopping block. What's in it for me?"


The reply came in the form of a picture. It was provocative, to say the least.


Linden stared at the image for a moment, then let out a chilly laugh before recording a voice message. "ls that the best you can offer?"


"You'll be generously rewarded once it's taken care of!"


Linden shoved his hands into his pockets and stared off at the horizon. "You can't be serious. What guarantee do I have that you won't turn on me when it's done? This situation is a lot more tangled than l expected. And let's not forget, Cedric's food problems trace back to you. If the truth comes out,you'll have a mess on your hands too."


Elyse listened to the voice message, her expression tightening as her brows drew together.


Damn Linden!



"What exactly do you want?"



Linden's lips curled into a smirk. "I want you."


Elyse's hands shook with anger.


This shameless bastard was clearly lost in his delusions.



Natalie was her precious daughter. Elyse had poured  time and resources into shaping her, ensuring she mastered etiquette and elegance. There was no way she would let someone like Linden drag Natalie into the dirt.



Natalie deserved someone like Cedric-someone exceptional-who would elevate her to be the pride of the entire socialite community.



Elyse's gaze turned icy as a sly plan began taking shape in her mind. "I don't trust you just yet. If you want to prove yourself, show me some real sincerity.I'm not asking you to take Cedric out right this moment, but I need to see if you can genuinely contribute to his downfall before I even consider giving you what you want."



Linden arched a brow and simply replied, "Alright."


Later that evening, Daniela was engrossed in her reading when the monitoring device let out a series of beeps. After a few moments, it went silent, returning to normal.



Standing close by with a notebook in hand, Linden glanced at Daniela's composed face. "There's no need to worry.Small fluctuations like this are fairly common."


Daniela's eyes swept over the team she'd gathered.Her tone was firm and cold. "Run the checks again."


She moved to the foot of Cedric's bed, silently  observing as the team carried out their examinations.


Once they confirmed there were no issues, Daniela's voice cut through the silence. "Run a blood test."


The team exchanged surprised glances before the attending doctor stepped forward. "Everything appears stable. The body occasionally produces subconscious reactions that can skew the data.There's no need for frequent blood tests-they could end up harming the patient."


Typically, at this point, family members would ease up and trust the doctor's judgment.


The medical staff in the room were also preparing to hand over their shifts.


However, Daniela wasn't about to back down. "I want to double-check, just to be sure," she insisted.


Linden leaned against the corner, raising an eyebrow,his gaze lingering on Daniela with a quiet intensity.


With little choice but to obey, the attending doctor reluctantly carried out a routine blood test.


By the time the results were due, most of the doctors had retired for the night, leaving just the attending doctor and Daniela waiting.



Linden strolled over with a smile and told Daniela,"Why don't you let my mentor take a break? He's  been through a lot today. I'll stay here and keep you company."



Daniela nodded at Ryan, signaling for him to escort the attending doctor to the lounge as she waited for the results.



Linden slid into the seat next to Daniela, flashing a confident smile. He had carefully styled his hair,manicured his nails, and chosen an outfit that made him look younger.


"You and Mr. Phillips seem to have a wonderful relationship," he remarked.


Daniela remained silent, her attention focused elsewhere.


Not one to be discouraged, Linden continued,"Couples often get anxious and flustered when facing challenges. It's impressive how calm and composed you are."


Daniela took a slow sip of her water, her expression unchanged. "I don't have the luxury of panic."


Linden chuckled, sensing an opportunity to change the subject. "I've heard your business is doing exceptionally well."


Finishing her glass, Daniela set it down with a deliberate calmness. "It's not about success. I'm busy  because I'm surrounded by people with hidden motives. With my partner in a coma, I can't afford to drop my guard. If I don't stay vigilant, those who mean to take advantage will win."


Linden was briefly taken aback by her words. But before he could respond, Cedric's report arrived,showing a chaotic mess of blood indicators.



Linden observed Daniela's composed expression.She exuded calm and logic, her brilliance shining through in that moment.


Linden watched as she took the report and knocked on the dean's office door.


That night, the entire medical team gathered to consult on Cedric's condition.



When the room cleared, Linden pulled out his phone,snapped a photo of Cedric's report, and sent it to "Natalie."



"So, are you happy now? Daniela's far too vigilant.After this, there's sure to be some major shifts around here. I won't be able to stick around for long. If your offer isn't tempting enough, I can't take this on for you."
###Chapter 399 Let Nina Go Instead Of Me
Elyse knew what Linden wanted. It wasn't just about sending a few pictures.


Her anger boiled, her teeth grinding, but she understood the opportunity to eliminate Cedric was a rare one that couldn't slip by.



After a heavy silence, she called Natalie over and showed her the message.


Natalie nearly spat in disgust. "What? Linden actually thinks he can sleep with me? When I was the most beautiful girl in school, adored by all the guys, Linden was hiding in the corner, too scared to even look my way! What's he thinking? He actually believes he can sleep with me? He's way out of his league! Someone needs to show him a mirror!"



Natalie couldn't hide her contempt.



Elyse snatched her phone back. "I don't like him either, but right now, Linden is the only one who can get close to Cedric.He said the medical team is about to be reshuffled, and soon, we won't get such a good chance again."
Hearing this, Natalie frowned, her voice sharp. "So what are you saying, Mom? You want me to sleep with this disgusting man?"


Elyse, of course, was reluctant. She had raised her daughter, stunningly beautiful and deserving of nothing but the best. "So, what do you think we should do?"



Natalie's anger boiled, her mind a whirlwind. Just the thought of Linden-a repulsive rat no one wanted around-daring to think he could sleep with her made her sick to her stomach.



Just then,she saw Nina nearby.


In some ways, they were strikingly alike.


Natalie's gaze turned cold and distant. "Mom,I have an idea."



Elyse didn't catch on right away, but when she did,she asked,"Do you think it will work? Linden's wanted you for years. He'll recognize you instantly."


Natalie spoke in a detached tone. "There are plenty of themed hotels these days with dim lighting. We can have Nina wear a silk scarf over her face. Since she and I share a similar look, Linden won't be able to tell us apart. Isn't the medical team about to be reorganized soon? Linden won't have time to figure it out." Elyse nodded,herexpression thoughtful."Alright,then."


With that, Elyse went off to find Nina.


Nina was taken aback. "Mom, what did yousay?"


Natalie stood off to the side, her expression cold and uninterested, her voice calm and factual. "Didn't you claim before that you'd do anything to have Cedric?Now's the moment to prove it. Cedric is in critical condition, and the only one who can help him is Linden. But Linden made it clear-he won't treat Cedric unless you're willing to sleep with him first."


Nina's mind was a whirlwind, her voice quivering with uncertainty. "I can't!"



Elyse spoke, her tone soothing. "Darling, why not? It's a small price to pay for something so important. Once you do this, Cedric will be forever grateful when he wakes up. You'll have made such a huge sacrifice for him-it'll win his heart, without a doubt."


Nina's thoughts spiraled in turmoil. "But if I go through with this, Cedric will despise me!"


Natalie scoffed. "Nina, are you out of your mind? Why would Cedric despise you? You're doing this for him.It's just one time. Why are you making such a big deal?This kind of thing is common in our circle. You said you'd do anything for Cedric, didn't you? So why are you backing out now?" Tears streamed down Nina's face as she clung desperately to Elyse's hand. "But Mom, I want to save myself for Cedric. I don't want to give myself to a stranger!"



Elyse shook her hand off. "Don't be so naive. This is your opportunity. Cedric never truly noticed you.You need to understand-this is your moment. If you don't take it, how else will you make him feel guilty enough to marry you? A small sacrifice now for a lifetime of wealth and security. What's the better choice here?"



Nina stood frozen, unable to move.



"Take your time, but make up your mind in five minutes. If you can't go through with it, then forget it.Let Cedric die. It's not like it matters to us." With those cutting words, Natalie turned on her heel and walked out.



The situation had hit her like a storm, and Nina felt completely lost. She gazed helplessly at her mother,her face streaked with tears. "Mom, is Linden really the only one who can save Cedric? Isn't there any other way?"


Elyse shook her head. "There's no other option."


Nina's head hung low, and her lips trembled as tears streamed down her face.



"Alright!" At last, she relented. She stood there, shaking, mustering every ounce of her strength to force out that one word.


Elyse smiled brightly, lavishing her with praise. "I knew you were clever. Once Cedric wakes up, he'll owe you everything. You'll be able to proudly tell him that you sacrificed something precious to save him. He'll be grateful to you for the rest of his life."


Nina wasn't certain whether Cedric would feel thankful, but the idea made her feel sick to her stomach.



She had guarded her innocence for so long, dreaming of giving herself to Cedric. But now, it was to be taken by a stranger.


Her head dropped, feeling heavy with despair. She even wanted to die.
###Chapter 400 Definitely



Nina knew she couldn't die. She still had the task of saving Cedric. She had to rescue the man she loved from danger.


When she saw Daniela at the hospital, Nina suddenly felt a strange sense of superiority.


It seemed to her that Daniela might not possess the same bravery she did. She was willing to sacrifice everything for love, not just talk about it.


Lillian gazed at Nina with a puzzled look and asked Daniela, "Has she lost her mind today? Where is she getting this arrogance from? Just look at her, acting as if she's Cedric's wife."



Daniela remained seated, her eyes fixed on Nina. She,too, noticed Nina's odd demeanor.



Typically, Nina was docile, particularly with a domineering sister like Natalie outshining her. Nina's existence was not exactly smooth.



Though she was an heiress of the Dury family, she hadn't experienced the same privileges as Natalie. Her thoughts often leaned towards naivety.



"Whenever things seem off, there's usually a reason.  Have someone keep an eye on Nina," Daniela instructed, her expression turning serious as she remembered seeing Elyse and Natalie whispering at the end of the corridor.



She reached for her phone to review the surveillance video from the corridor.



Just as she was about to find out what Elyse and Natalie were discussing, a shadow emerged over her computer screen.



Daniela looked up to find Nina standing there.



Though a hint of fear flickered in her eyes, she carried herself with a newfound confidence.



"Daniela,how is Cedric doing?"


Daniela responded coldly, "Didn't you see it yourself?"



Nina pursed her lips before saying, "I understand that I fall short in every way compared to you, but there's one thing where you can't compete. What I'm willing to do for Cedric is something you could never accomplish in a lifetime."



Daniela watched Nina silently. Her eyes were calm and unreadable.



Nina admired her composed manner, wishing she could mirror it, but deep down, she knew she couldn't.Standing in the shadows of Daniela and Natalie, she  often felt like a nobody.


Yet,she was prepared to sacrifice everything for Cedric!



In this matter,she was unmatched.


Nina faced Daniela and said, "I know you dislike me,and the feeling is mutual, but for Cedric's sake, I will make an effort to get along with you in the future."


With those words, she turned and left.


Daniela navigated the surveillance footage.


Moments later, Lillian exclaimed, "Oh my! Is Nina really Elyse's daughter? Has she lost her senses?"



Daniela's gaze intensified.


"Tsk! What a spectacle!" Lillian looked to Daniela, who appeared determined. "What's our next move?"


Daniela's eyes landed on Linden, who was nearby. A cold,sharp intent flashed in her eyes.


Linden checked a message from Elyse on his phone,his lips curling into a sinister smile as he typed, "See you there."



He glanced up and locked eyes with Daniela.


With a subtle smile, he approached. "Ms. Harper, do you need something?"



Daniela leaned back in her chair, her tone cold. "Any updates on the investigation? What kind of food has kept Cedric in a coma?"



Linden was surprisedby the turn of events.


Before, Daniela had always communicated with the attending doctor for any matter. He felt somewhat flattered. Could Daniela be attracted to his charm? It appeared that no women were immune to his charm.


Tonight, he intended to prove his skill in bed to Natalie, and on another day..


Linden's eyes greedily scanned Daniela's flawless face."Ms. Harper, rest assured, we are carefully working to identify the cause. I am certain that we will come to a satisfying resolution very soon. Ms. Harper, I hope you won't mind a bold request. May I?"


Daniela responded, "Go ahead."


Linden chuckled and said, "I've had the privilege of witnessing your authority up close and have always held you in high regard. I wonder if I could be considered to become your personal doctor in the future?"



The idea of a family doctor crossing professional lines with a female CEO was undeniably tempting. Lillian nearly vomited on the spot. She was prepared to beat the shameless man, but Daniela held her back with a simple gesture.



A look of delight appeared on Linden's face.


Daniela said coolly, "Opportunities may arise."


As Linden left, clearly pleased, Daniela turned to the attending doctor and said, "Check the pastries."



The doctor gathered his trusted team to conduct a secret investigation.


Meanwhile, Nina sat at her dresser, as Elyse carefully brushed her hair.



The emotional walls Nina had built recently came crashing down again.


During her visit to the hospital, she caught sight of Linden through the glass.


His demeanor was unpleasant. He had shifty eyes and a short, balding stature. He was precisely the type of person she found utterly unpleasant.


The bravery she had gathered in front of Daniela completely disappeared. She felt humbled and gloomy,overwhelmed with sadness and hesitation.



She could not bring herself to accept Linden, nor  could she bear the thought of Cedric possibly finding her disgusting after learning she had been with someone so unpleasant.


Elyse comforted her, "Nina, remember, nothing in this world is free. Every gain comes with its price. I know this is a steep price, but it will be worth it."


Nina's voice shook as she cried, "Mom, promise me Cedric will love me."


Elyse's gaze was firm. "I promise."


As the evening set in, Nina dressed in seductive lingerie and was escorted to a romantic hotel suite.


The lighting inside was soft and dim, with rose petals scattered across the bed, creating the perfect atmosphere for what was about to unfold.



Tears streamed down Nina's cheeks as Elyse wrapped a veil over her face. "I understand you are upset.Keep this on; don't remove it. Just close your eyes, and soon it will be over. When you open them, Cedric will be saved. Nina, you will get everything you want."


Through her tears, Nina nodded. She was determined to achieve her desires.Definitely!
###Chapter 401 Take Cedric's Life





Nina's mind wandered in silence, lost in its own maze of thoughts.


Without warning, the door, which had been shut tight, creaked open, startling her.


A chill ran through her, making her body shudder beneath the seductive lingerie she wore.



The dim glow of the room threw eerie shadows across the walls, and fear gripped Nina's eyes.



She watched Linden step in, his lecherous grin echoing in her ears, sending an uncomfortable shiver down her spine.


The belt fell to the floor with a gentle thud.His shirt was hastily pulled apart, revealing a round belly beneath. In the pale light, she saw Linden tilting his head,pushing back what little hair remained.


A wave of disgust washed over her, sharp and unmistakable.



As his chubby fingers brushed against the white sheets, Nina's body trembled more violently, regret creeping up from the depths of her stomach.


The musty scent of damp clothes, a smell she had come to associate with Linden, immediately hit her senses.



Her dread and regret surged together, but she realized too late that there was no turning back.


Linden's pants dropped to the floor in an instant,exposing his faded underwear, and with it, every part of his vile nature stood laid bare.



Fear and shock overtook Nina, her eyes growing wide. She sat up on the bed, instinctively preparing to flee.


Without warning, her hair was yanked back, tugged harshly by an unforgiving grip.


The pain shot through her scalp, sharp and burning.  A cruel sneer stretched across Linden's face. "Where do you think you're going? This is exactly what we agreed upon. The night is young, and I've got all the time in the world to enjoy you."


In the next instant, Linden's hands tore through Nina's top, the sound of fabric ripping making her body flinch in dread.


A scream ripped from her throat, shrill and desperate.


Thoughts of calling for her mother, for Natalie,flooded her mind.



Regret flooded her-she wished she could undo it all.


Escape was all she could think about.


Desperately, she darted towards the door, only to realize it was locked from the outside.



Trembling uncontrollably, she pressed her back against the door, her eyes locking with Linden's revolting smile as his gaze wandered over her form. His laughter echoed, the sight of his crooked,yellow teeth sickening her.


Nina clamped her hand over her mouth, fighting the urge to vomit.


The sight before him drove Linden into a blind rage.


He stormed forward, grabbing a fistful of Nina's hair again, forcing her mouth shut with a cruel pinch through the veil.


"Now you want to pretend you're some virtuous woman? Don't worry, I'll make sure you have a good time," he whispered the words in a cold, taunting breath,his lips brushing her ear.


Nina's legs buckled, her body betraying her as it went limp with fear.


Before she could gather herself, the sound of fabric tearing reached her ears again. Her eyes widened, a cold shiver crawling across her lower body.


With a brutal motion, Linden lifted her onto the bed,and as she recoiled, he pressed forward, his hands shamelessly reaching for her feet. He lowered his head greedily,placing kiss after kiss on her skin.


Nina's mind shattered in that instant, and a scream of pure terror erupted from her as she cried, "Mom!Mom,I regret it! Please save me!"


At that moment, the weight of her choices crashed down on her, and the regret was suffocating.


Her body fought, but Linden's lips-those repulsive,vile things-continued to press against her legs.


He spoke in a twisted, longing tone. "Do you even know how long l've obsessed over you? You've always been like a star in the sky, unreachable, and here l am, the ugliest thing in the gutter. Just thinking about you felt like a sin. But when you agreed, it made me so happy. You were the most beautiful girl on campus, everyone wanted you. You never knew about the years of yearning from someone like me,did you? Don't worry, I'll make sure you're comfortable."



Nina's body stilled, her struggles coming to an abrupt halt.


Mistaking her stillness for compliance, Linden's excitement flared as he pressed a gentle kiss to her skin.



Flat against the bed, Nina's mind emptied, consumed by a hollow void.



School?



Years of yearning?


The realization hit her like a heavy blow: the woman Linden desired wasn't her-it was Natalie.



Tears began to flow down Nina's cheeks, pooling beneath the veil that clung to her face.


Then, a laugh escaped her, sharp and bitter,trembling through her body as if to break free.


Elyse's insistence on the veil suddenly made sense.


Because Natalie had refused, Elyse had sent her in Natalie's place, to sleep with this man. Nina had always known she was unloved, but this-the betrayal-was something she had never imagined.


Natalie's purity was sacred, untouchable. But what about hers? Was her innocence so easily discarded,so unimportant?


Was she truly just something to be used, something so easily overlooked?


Tears of regret flowed freely down Nina's face.


But no amount of regret would change what was already done.


Resigned to her fate, Nina lay still on the bed, staring blankly at the white ceiling, feeling Linden's lips trailing up her legs.


The weight of it all crushed her spirit, and she whispered, "You can call me whoever you want, but just keep your promise."


After this nightmare, she hoped Linden would save Cedric. At least then, some of the pain would have purpose.


Linden's lips pressed against her skin as he murmured, "Don't worry. Once we're done, I'll head straight to the hospital and take Cedric's life."

###Chapter 402 Why Did You Help Me





Nina's eyes snapped open, her breathing quick and shallow as she bolted upright.


Her voice shook with a mixture of fear and disbelief."What did you just say?"


Linden wiped a smear of drool from his mouth, a crooked smile spreading across his face."Sweetheart, wasn't it your idea? Spend a night with me, and in exchange, I'll take Cedric out for you?Relax, once it's done-even if it costs me my life-I'll make sure Cedric's gone for good."


Nina stared at him, frozen in shock. Her voice came out barely above a whisper."Kill Cedric?"


Before she could process the horror of his words,Linden surged forward, forcing her onto the mattress beneath his weight.


Hot tears streamed down her cheeks, blurring her vision.


Kill Cedric.


The words echoed in her head like a relentless drumbeat.



Natalie and Elyse had used her innocence as a pawn,trading it for Linden's promise to eliminate Cedric.


How could they expect her to agree to such a vile scheme?


Desperation ignited within her, and she thrashed wildly against him, a single thought burning in her mind-she had to destroy everyone who had brought her to this moment.


But Nina's small frame was no match for Linden's brute strength.


He easily overpowered her, pressing her into the bed with a sadistic grin. He flipped her onto her stomach,forcing her into a humiliating position on her knees.



"Linden!" she screamed, her voice raw with terror and fury. "Let me go! Look at me-look who l am!"


Linden's lips pressed against Nina's back, his laughter dripping with cruel arrogance. "Of course, I know who you are-you're my precious Natalie."


Nina twisted against his grasp, her strength ebbing as despair consumed her.


His weight crushed her resolve, leaving her drained and motionless. She shut her eyes tightly, hot tears slipping down her cheeks, tracing paths of silent agony.


Her voice broke unexpectedly, raw and desperate."Daniela!"



She squeezed her eyes shut, bracing herself for the inevitable as Linden's movements became more deliberate.


Her heart sank into a void of betrayal, her spirit utterly shattered.


In that moment, she wished for nothing more than an escape, even if it meant death. A sudden, jarring sound shattered the suffocating tension in the room.


Linden's heavy body slumped against her, unmoving.


Nina froze beneath his dead weight, her breath caught in her throat.


She didn't dare to shift, her ears straining against the eerie silence that replaced the heated chaos.


Slowly, she cracked her eyes open and glimpsed Linden lying unconscious, sprawled across her.


It took her a moment to register what had happened.


"What's wrong? Can't get up? Or maybe you want to keep going?"


Nina blinked, confusion and disbelief swirling in her tear-filled eyes. Was she dead? How else could she be hearing Daniela's voice?


With great effort, she shoved Linden off her, her trembling hands barely steady. She sat upright and turned to the source of the voice. There, lounging on the opposite sofa, sat Daniela, her expression unreadable.



For the first time, her heart surged with something close to relief. She had never wanted to see Daniela -or hear her voice-as much as she did at this moment.



She was saved.


She had no love for Daniela, and she knew with absolute certainty that Daniela felt the same about her.



But right now, none of that mattered. With Daniela present, she was certain that nothing worse would happen.


She didn't like Daniela, yet, in this moment, she trusted Daniela completely.


Nina's eyes brimmed with tears.


For the first time, she dropped to her knees before Daniela, her voice trembling with sincerity as she called out, "Daniela!" Daniela's expression didn't waver as she regarded Nina on the floor. With a flick of her wrist, she tossed Nina a long trench coat, then motioned for someone waiting outside. The person entered and began hypnotizing Linden, planting the illusion that he had spent the night with Natalie.


Nina remained where she was, watching every calculated move Daniela made.


Still on her knees, she shifted back slightly, her anger etched across her face. Yet, despite the fury swirling inside her, a strange calm settled over her,taming her emotions.



Lowering her head deeply, she bowed towards Daniela. "Daniela, let me take care of this myself.Please."


Daniela's gaze rested on her, unreadable and cold.


Nina's voice was firm. "This is my revenge. I want to see it through on my own."


Daniela's indifferent eyes lingered on Nina, her tone

sharp and unyielding. "You could just walk away, you know. None of this has to involve you anymore. Leave the Dury family, and you'll have the freedom to live the life you choose."


Still kneeling, Nina straightened her back defiantly."No! I won't walk away! I will take my revenge myself!Every tear they've made me shed tonight-I'll make them pay for it tenfold!"


The events of the night would never fade from her memory.


Neither the trap laid for her nor the humiliation she'd endured.



The deepest wounds had been inflicted by those she should've been able to trust most. And, in a cruel twist of irony, her salvation had come from the one person she had despised.


She would never forget any of it.


Daniela gave Nina a brief glance, then rose to her feet and said, "Alright." Nina followed her without a word, her movements mechanical as though her body acted on instinct.


The car ride back to the hospital was shrouded in silence. Nina sat motionless, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window, her expression unreadable.


It was often said that growth happened in an instant.Nina had always dismissed that notion-until now.


The car pulled to a stop at the hospital.


Before getting out, Daniela instructed the driver to send Nina back home. As Daniela reached for the car door, ready to leave, Nina grabbed her sleeve.


There was something almost childlike in the way Nina clung to her-a tentative yet heartfelt plea for reassurance.


"Daniela, why did you help me?" Her voice was soft,quivering, the question heavy with unspoken emotion.


The faint glow of the streetlight cast Daniela in a half-shadow, obscuring part of her face. There was a time when this shadowed visage had terrified Nina,embodying all her fears. But now, she felt nothing but an unexpected warmth and safety.


Staring at Daniela, Nina was struck by the stark realization that the people she once trusted,the ones who had worn friendly faces but harbored dark intentions, were the true monsters in her life.


"Daniela, you could have turned your back on me.Why did you choose to save me in the end?"

###Chapter 403 Are You Still Shy




Daniela was the kind of person who could execute such ruthless plans without hesitation.


If Linden had succeeded in raping Nina, the aftermath would have been inevitable-Nina's descent into madness.



Desperation could turn even the weakest soul into a weapon, sharp and deadly.


Daniela could have waited patiently for the chaos to unfold, stepping in later as the untouchable savior.


But she hadn't.



She had even given Nina an opportunity to walk away.


Why?


Nina's mind swirled with unanswered questions, but she couldn't voice them all. Daniela's expression remained impassive as she said quietly, "Because it's too dirty."


Nina blinked, her brow furrowing in confusion."What?"


Daniela's tone didn't waver. "Using Cedric's name for something like that-it's revolting. I despise it, and l won't let it happen. Besides, I want anyone who genuinely loves Cedric to never have that love tainted. So no, I didn't save you for your sake. I did it for Cedric. Does that make sense to you?"


Nina froze, the weight of Daniela's words sinking in."That's it? Just for that reason?"


Daniela inclined her head slightly. "That's all there is to it."



A sudden wave of emotion overcame Nina. Tears pooled in her eyes, spilling down her cheeks-not out of heartbreak, but from an overwhelming sense of gratitude.


Because, at last, she had found someone who held love in its purest, untainted form-just as she did.


Nina had thought offering herself up for Cedric's sake was already a monumental sacrifice.


But Daniela's ability to cast aside her disdain, all in the name of true love, felt even more extraordinary.


After all, Nina had faltered halfway through her plan,while Daniela had gone through with saving her.


Meeting Daniela's gaze with newfound determination, Nina spoke with quiet resolve."Daniela, you've proven your strength. Whatever your plans are, I'm on your side now. I'll be the weapon you need to destroy every threat the Dury family poses!"


Before leaving, Nina told Daniela the reason why Cedric was in a coma was because of the pastries and how to treat him.


That night, Cedric finally stirred back to consciousness.



Meanwhile, after being hypnotized, Linden had spent the night aggressively wrestling with a pillow in the hotel room.


When morning came, he awoke feeling utterly spent,as though he'd run a marathon in his sleep.


Scanning the empty room, a smug grin spread across his face.



He truly believed Natalie had been there wth him the entire night.


The thought made him puff out his chest with pride.


And he hadn't bothered with any precautions. Maybe Natalie was already carrying their child.


He smiled shamelessly at the thought, his ego inflating as he got dressed.


Linden headed back to the hospital, his mind set on fulfilling his promise to finish Cedric off.


But as he approached the hospital's entrance, he froze, his gaze catching sight of several medical staff rolling their suitcases away. Confused, he quickened his steps and called out,"What's going on? Why are you all leaving?"


One nurse paused, glancing over her shoulder. "Ms.Harper ordered a complete replacement of the staff this morning. All of us have been dismissed."


For a brief moment, Linden's confidence faltered.Panic rippled through him, tightening his chest.


He hadn't even begun to make his move.


If he left now, there was no guarantee Natalie would ever speak to him again.



But even more pressing was the sudden image of Daniela's striking face flashing through his mind.


He hadn't gotten anywhere near close to her yet.How could he possibly leave now?


"Oh, but Linden, you're in luck," someone said casually. "Ms. Harper wants you to stay."


His brow furrowed as he stared at them in surprise."Wait,what? Really?" "It's true. Word is she specifically asked for you.Apparently, she's got a private medical center with some of the best perks around. If you make it in,don't forget about us."


Linden's heart nearly leaped out of his chest.


His mind raced back to when he'd offered to be Daniela's private doctor the day before. Did this mean she had agreed?



The idea was intoxicating, and he couldn't hold back the surge of excitement flooding through him.


Everything in his life seemed to be aligning perfectly lately.


He felt invincible, as if there wasn't a single obstacle he couldn't overcome-not when it came to winning over women.



Just as he reached the hospital entrance, a voice called his name from a distance.



Turning around, his grin broadened at the sight of Natalie approaching. "Natalie! What a surprise! What are you doing here?|thought you'd be taking it easy today and getting some well-deserved rest."



Natalie's expression twisted with revulsion as she took in Linden's face.



She silently thanked the heavens that it had been Nina who endured the night with him. If it had been her, she wasn't sure she'd be able to live with herself.


How utterly revolting.


Still, Natalie kept her tone steady, refusing to let him see her irritation. "They're replacing the hospital staff.What's your plan now?"


Linden's grin widened, exuding misplaced confidence. "Don't worry about me. I've got enough talent to hold on to my position."


Her brow furrowed slightly in surprise at his arrogance. But she had no interest in prolonging the conversation. "Fine. Just make sure you handle it today. Don't let anything go wrong." Linden nodded, his eyes shamelessly trailing over her. Without warning, he leaned closer, his hand reaching towards her waist.


Natalie immediately recoiled, her eyes flashing with warning as she stepped back. "What do you think you're doing?"


Thinking Natalie was just being shy, Linden chuckled."What's the matter? Can't handle a little affection from your boyfriend? We were wild last night, weren't we? After all, we've already made love. What's the harm in a hug? Still feeling shy?"
###Chapter 404 Unreasonable





Natalie had a hard time hiding her disgust.


The very thought repulsed her.


To her, the short and plump Linden seemed completely repulsive.


"Alright, let's leave it at that for now. Go finish what l asked you to do."


Natalie, unable to bear it any longer, turned to leave,but Linden grabbed her hand. He smirked. "Don't worry.I'll make sure you're satisfied."


He then walked into the hospital.


Natalie could barely stand it. Once home, she repeatedly sprayed disinfectant on her hands,scrubbing them ten times before finally stopping.


Nina stood a few steps behind, watching as every trace of disgust, irritation, and nausea flashed across Natalie's face.



"Natalie, just hold on a bit longer. Once Cedric is gone, things wil get easier."


Still seething, Natalie grabbed the disinfectant again and sprayed it on her hands. "Mom, I can't take this.Don't ever ask me to see Linden again. He's disgusting! Just the thought of him looking at me makes me want to scream. I can't stand that awful smell of his for even a second."


Elyse patted Natalie's back soothingly. "Sweetheart, I know this is hard on you, and it hurts me too. Once it's all over, I promise I'll make it up to you."


After washing her hands, Natalie turned to speak to Elyse, only to see Nina standing just a few steps away.


"What are you doing here?" Natalie asked coldly, her voice void of guilt.


Nina stepped forward, eyeing Elyse first, then Natalie. "So Linden wanted you all along. You lied to me."


Natalie dried her hands with a tissue, her faceblank,as if it were nothing out of the ordinary. "Yes, and so what? You're his woman now."


Nina gave a bitter laugh. She nodded, then turned to Elyse standing nearby. "Mom, so you knew from the start he was after Natalie? Why? I don't understand why you had to use me like this."


Elyse pressed her lips together and looked up, no longer feeling guilty. "Nina, you've never been the sharpest tool in the shed. Some might call it innocence, but others might say it's foolishness. In a wealthy family, you need cleverness and sense. You don't have either. You're not going to marry into wealth. Your sister, however, has been sharp since she was a child. When Daniela is gone, Natalie will take over her property. She can't afford any blemishes on her record. Nina, trust me-everything I've done has been planned out."


Nina stared at Elyse in stunned silence. After a moment, she let out a bitter chuckle. "So, you think l deserve to be sacrificed just because I'm not smart enough? You really believe I deserve someone like Linden? You're my mother. Is this how you decide to treat your daughters, based on their intelligence?"


Nina's heart sank in disappointment.


Elyse remained silent.


Natalie frowned and pulled Elyse behind her."Stop dragging this out. It's already done. Once we have Daniela's money, I'll give you something to compensate you. Why the fuss? It's just a physical thing, nothing more. Why make such a big deal out of it?"



Nina fixed Natalie with a cold, unblinking stare. "Just a physical thing? No big deal? You're my sister. You knew how much I loved Cedric and how much l wanted to give him the best of me. Not only do you want him gone, but now you're acting like it's just some small thing? Natalie, are you even human?"


Natalie furrowed her brows and turned to Elyse.

"Mom, you're hearing this, right? Everything l've done was for our family, with no selfish intentions!"


Elyse immediately took a step forward. "Nina,how can you talk to Natalie like that? She's your sister.What you said breaks her heart. Didn't she promise to make it up to you once she gets Daniela's inheritance? Why are you being so ungrateful and unreasonable?"


Nina let out a bitter laugh. The weight of it all hit her hard. Natalie blamed her, and Elyse remained so obviously on Natalie's side.


Her heart ached as she screamed, "Oh, sure! It's all my fault. You two didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one who was held down and taken advantage of by Linden. But you both act like you're the picture of innocence."



With those words, Nina stormed up the stairs.A few moments later, her sobs filled the entire house.


Elyse let out a deep sigh. "Why is Nina being so unreasonable?"
###Chapter 405 The Handsome Cedric





Elyse's words had already stripped Nina of all hope,and now, she felt it vanish entirely, slipping away like sand through her fingers.


As Linden went to find Daniela, Nina was walking the same path.


When Linden's eyes briefly caught Nina's profile, an overwhelming sense of familiarity tugged at him,though he couldn't place why.


Nina's stomach lurched the moment her gaze met Linden's. She hurriedly rushed to the restroom,desperate to escape the sensation.


By the time she stepped out, Linden had already positioned himself in front of Daniela.


Linden's gaze lingered on Daniela, filled with a hunger he could not mask. The sight of her only stirred the flames of his wvild thoughts. Today, Daniela wore a simple black top paired with a modest skirt, yet there was nothing plain about her.Even in understated tones, she glowed her presence like a precious stone in a dull world.


Every time Linden laid eyes on Daniela, he was reminded of the very first time he saw her. Her allure always left him breathless, too entranced to form a word.


"Ms. Harper, I heard you specifically asked for me to stay?"


Seated on a bench in the corridor outside Cedric's room, Daniela focused on the contract her secretary had handed her, not bothering to look up.


"I was impressed with how you handled things.That's why I decided to keep you on."


Excitement sparked in Linden's eyes. "Does this mean you're allowing me to become your private doctor?"


At that moment, Natalie and Elyse appeared farther down the hallway.


The moment they overheard Linden's question,panic flashed across their faces.


This was a development they couldn't afford.


Linden knew the reason to Cedric's coma and their order to end his life. He had the evidence they had tried to kill Cedric.


Their original plan had been to get rid of Linden once Cedric was dead.



But if Daniela intended to keep Linden by her side,their carefully laid plans might unravel.


Natalie felt a wave of unease settle in her chest.Linden thought she had spent the night with him.If he stayed around, she feared his relentless pursuit and the danger it would bring.


Linden's ugly face made Nina's stomach turn, a wave of nausea hitting her instantly.


"No way!" Elyse rushed forward, her anxiety barely concealed. "There's no chance Linden could ever become Daniela's personal doctor!"


A smirk danced on Daniela's lips as she raised an eyebrow. "Care to explain why?"


The urgency in Elyse's response only revealed her desperation to stop this from happening.


"I'm just saying..." Elyse faltered, her words failing her.



Natalie, tightening her fists, stepped forward with a decisive edge. "His medical abilities are subpar at best. He's not even close to being qualified to be your doctor."


At first, the sight of Natalie filled Linden with excitement, but her words left him momentarily dumbfounded. "What do you mean, Natalie?"


He had thought his presence by Daniela's side would work out perfectly for both him and Natalie. Why was she pushing back so hard? It didn't make sense.Unless... He glanced at Natalie's face for a moment before his eyes shifted to Daniela, glowing with her usual charm.The pieces finally clicked into place.


With a quick turn, he lowered his voice, speaking only to Natalie. "Sweetheart, are you afraid I'll fall for Daniela and leave you behind?"


A shiver ran down Natalie's spine as his words sank in.Her glare was sharp and unyielding.


But Linden only seemed more pleased with himself.In a low, almost teasing voice, he added, "Relax,baby. You'll always have a special place in my heart."


Not far off, Nina watched the disgust painted clearly on Natalie's face.



A sneer tugged at the corners of her lips.


So,her dear sister found Linden so repulsive.


Hadn't she dismissed it all so easily before, brushing it off as nothing more than a physical matter?


"I actually think he would be a great family doctor. He's thorough and professional. Natalie, you're not a doctor. How can you claim he's not good enough for Daniela? What's really going on here?"


Natalie's eyes shot daggers at Nina, fury igniting within her. Anger bubbled up, and for a moment, she considered lashing out at Nina with every curse she could muster. However, she forced herself to swallow the venom in front of Daniela. She took a slow breath before stretching her lips into a strained smile."What's my motive, you ask? Everything I'm saying is for Daniela's benefit. Cedric stilI needs Linden's care here. How could he just leave to be her personal doctor?"



"Is that so?" Nina mocked. Her smirk deepened as she locked eyes with Natalie. "A second ago, you were saying Linden didn't have the skills. Now,suddenly, he's good enough for Cedric? Do you get to pick when his abilities measure up?"


The tension between them was palpable, and Natalie's temper flared in response.


Elyse, her face contorted in disapproval, snapped, "Nina, stop talking nonsense. Are you trying to stir up trouble?"


Nina barely spared her a glance, rolling her eyes in disdain.


Elyse leaned towards Daniela. "Daniela, we would never harm you. We know how much Cedric means to you. He needs a doctor now. You must understand that."


Just then, the door to the hospital room swung open with a quiet creak.


A shaft of sunlight spilled in from the window, casting a long shadow across the polished floor.


Everyone instinctively turned to the sound.


And there, framed in the light, stood Cedric in a sharp suit. His presence was commanding,handsome, and every inch the picture of authority.
###Chapter 406 Honey




The crowd fell into stunned silence.


Among them all, Elyse was the most shattered.


She had sacrificing her daughter's purity, all to ensure Cedric's death.



But before Linden made a move, Cedric had appeared, alive and unscathed.



Nina's lost innocence held no meaning.


Moreover, she had irreparably damaged her relationship with Nina.


Turning to Nina, she was met with nothing but cold indifference, her daughter's eyes filled with distant disdain.



A sharp pang of grief struck Elyse's heart. It dawned on her-she might have lost Nina for good. "Cedric?" Linden's voice wavered in disbelief. "You woke up?"


However, Cedric didn't spare Linden a glance. His focus was entirely on Daniela as he walked to her.


To everyone's shock, he dropped to one knee before her. "Darling, you've endured so much."


In a tender show of devotion, he kissed the back of Daniela's hand.


Daniela smiled warmly and led him away, leaving the others in stunned silence, their minds reeling.


Once Daniela vanished from view, Natalie could no longer mask her frustration. She spun on Linden."Linden, what happened to your promise? You said you'd kill Cedric! Yet here he is, alive and well.What do you have to say for yourself?"


Linden shrugged nonchalantly, shaking off the shock. "Sweetheart, why so upset? I'm Daniela's doctor now. We've got all the time in the world.Plenty of ways to finish them both off." As Linden spoke, his hand reached to Natalie's waist,attempting to pull her closer.


She stepped back, her face twisted in disgust and anger.


Linden's hand hovered awkwardly in midair, frozen in place. "Sweetheart, what's the matter? Don't you remember the passion we shared? We're closer than anyone else in the world now."



Natalie's mouth parted, ready to lash out with every insult she could think of, but Elyse's words held her back.



Elyse leaned in, her voice low and controlled for Natalie's ears alone. "Hold your tongue. He's right, in a way. As Daniela's personal doctor, he'll have plenty of chances to strike. Don't waste this moment."



Frustration bubbled inside Natalie. "But he's always trying to take advantage of me!"


Elyse shared her revulsion. Linden wasn't exactly appealing, but she held back a sigh. "Endure it, just for now. In his mind, you two shared something real.Keep him close; we need him on our side."


Off to the side, Nina stood, watching the drama unfold with a detached indifference.



A mocking smile curled on her lips as she turned to Natalie. "Wasn't it you who said it was nothing more than a physical thing? Since you spent the night with Linden, why act all righteous and harsh now?"


Natalie's temper flared.


Nina turned and walked away with confidence.


Elyse quickly followed, her voice sharp with dissatisfaction. "Nina, what was that about? She's your sister! Don't be so shortsighted. Daniela's just a cousin. You're a Dury, remember? Stick with us, grab her wealth, and you'll live just fine."


Nina's eyes flickered down to Daniela and Cedric outside the building. She asked, "Do you honestly think I can still live comfortably?"


Elyse opened her mouth to respond with a quick "yes," but Nina's cold laugh stopped her. "You never cared about my happiness. Why start pretending now? I've always been your pawn. If it suited you,you'd discard me in a heartbeat. Natalie's the one you really want, not me."


With those biting words, Nina stepped into the elevator.


The doors slid shut, leaving Elyse standing there,her face twisted with cold dissatisfaction.



Linden stepped in front of Natalie, blocking her path.


He used "sweetheart" in a tone far too familiar.


Having tasted what he thought was intimacy, his hunger for more grew insistent.


Natalie's disgust twisted her stomach, but she forced the words out through gritted teeth, saying,"If you don't make Cedric pay for hislife, don't even think about laying a hand on me again. Ever!"


Linden's gaze traveled over Natalie, his eyes full of unspoken intentions. "Don't worry. I'll keep my word." Meanwhile, in the car, Cedric's fingers remained intertwined with Daniela's.



The landscape outside blurred into a streak of colors as the car sped onward.


Turning to face Daniela, Cedric let his fingers gently brush the back of her hand-a touch both gentle and full of meaning.


Daniela glanced at him."What?"



Cedric's smile was unguarded as if the ordeaI of his coma had never touched him.



In his gaze, Daniela could see nothing but warmth and unspoken affection.


"Nothing."


In that serene silence, a smile finally spread across Daniela's face. In Cedric's presence, she could lower her walls, feeling at peace in a way that no one else allowed.



"Honey," Cedric murmured, his voice gentle as a whisper.



The quiet hum of the car filled the space between them, and Daniela replied just as gently, "I'm here."


Up front, the driver couldn't help but feel like an outsider in their intimate moment.


The car surged forward, completing what should've been a twenty-minute journey in barely half the time.
###Chapter 407 Vanity





Cedric shrugged off his coat and pulled Daniela into his embrace. The memory of their argument before he had collapsed lingered in her mind.


Cedric noticed the unease flickering in Daniela's eyes. Normally calm and self-assured, he felt a rare moment of awkwardness and chuckled. "It was just a disagreement. That doesn't mean the love between us has vanished. You're my everything, and I can't risk staying upset with you. What if you decide you've had enough of me?"


Daniela tilted her head slightly, her gaze drifting to his arms wrapped so firmly around her. "I'd never leave you."


Cedric's smile deepened, knowing the depth of her love. "You should keep me on edge a bit. Spoil me too much, and I might start slacking."


Her tone grew firm, her eyes steady. "That will never happen."


Cedric gazed at her delicate features, his eyes lighting up before he broke into laughter.


The chill in the air brushed against himn, but Cedric felt nothing but warmth in his chest. Smiling, he leaned closer.



Daniela looked up at him, her eyes expectant.


Cedric's voice took on a playful charm. "I just feel like flirting with my gorgeous wife on such a fine day,Mrs.Harper."


Downstairs, Josie was rinsing vegetables when she glanced up to see Cedric whisking Daniela up the stairs.


Lillian, lounging nearby, spared them a brief glance before returning her focus to her game. "No need to make dinner for those two, Josie."


Cedric's look said it all. It seemed Daniela would be busy for the rest of the night, leaving little room for anything else. Josie chuckled, casting a knowing glance up the stairs. "It seems they're going to have a baby soon.I'll be happy to help with a little one when the time comes."



As soon as they stepped into the bedroom, Cedric gently placed Daniela onto the bed.


Cedric's warm kisses danced down her neck, making Daniela's breath catch as she asked, "Why call me Mrs.Harper, not Mrs. Phillips?"


As Cedric slowly unbuttoned her shirt, his voice softened to a low murmur, pulling Daniela closer. "|want to share your surname. That's how it feels right to me."



The night stretched on, seemingly without end.


At a spacious cosmetic surgery center, Joyce stood in front of Alexander. She gestured towards his jawline. "Doesn't something seem off? I remember Cedric's jawline-it was so perfectly smooth, like a work of art." The doctor smiled politely. "Artificial work can't quite replicate natural perfection, but this is already very close."



Without hesitation, Joyce tossed a check from her purse. "Is this enough? I want the face in this photo,nothing less!"


The doctor examined the check and let out a sycophantic laugh. "Yes, yes, that's more than enough. But the jawline is crucial for facial expressions. To change it, we'd need to redo the whole procedure."


Essentially, every feature they had previously reconstructed would need to be dismantled and redone, causing the patient to endure the excruciating pain once more.


Joyce remained unfazed. "All I care about is looking exactly like the person in the photo. Nothing else matters to me."



Joyce narrowed her eyes as she watched the medical staff push Alexander back into the operating room. This was his fifth major procedure, with thirty smaller ones still to come before anyone could assess the final results.



Inside the operating room, an assistant turned to the doctor. "This kind of extensive reconstruction increases the risk of facial collapse later. The effect will only last around six months. Shouldn't we warn the patient?"


The doctor picked up a scalpel, making an incision along Alexander's face. "Do you think anyone who comes here isn't prepared for the risks? They're willing to risk everything for what they want. Our job is to give them a fleeting perfection."


Once their faces collapsed, those patients would return to pay for repairs, feeding the industry's growth.


Cosmetic surgery was an endless journey.


Everyone knew this truth. But once people driven by greed and vanity began down this road, they couldn't turn back.
###Chapter 408 Don't CCross The Line





The following day, Daniela stayed home from work.


Nina was organizing the CEO's office, observing indifferently as Linden lingered around Natalie,constantly calling her "sweetheart."


A smirk tugged at Nina's lips as she watched the unfolding scene in silence.


All morning, Natalie shot desperate looks at Nina,silently begging for help. But Nina stayed indifferent.


By noon, Elyse showed up and tugged Nina aside.


Elyse reprimanded her. "Natalie's been looking at you all morning, pleading for help, and you act like you don't see it. Are you blind? Didn't you notice that jerk trying to take advantage of her?"


Nina continued wiping the table with calm indifference."Is that so?" Elyse's anger flared up. She placed her hands on her hips, her words laced with fury. "Really, Nina? What happened to you? That's your sister! Look at Linden all over her, and you don't even think about stepping in? What's wrong with you?"


Nina gave a bitter laugh, throwing Elyse a cold look as she tossed the cloth aside. "Oh, I'd love to know what's wrong with me, too. You had no issue sending me to Linden's bed, but now you can't stand him bothering my sister? Am I worth less than her?"


Upon hearing that, Elyse showed no sign of guilt.She quickly checked to ensure no one was around before retorting, "Why are you raising your voice like that?"


Nina had expected Elyse to feel some guilt for treating her virginity as a mere transaction. Instead,Elyse pressed on, "Are you out of your mind? If Linden finds out it wasn't Natalie that night, what happens then? Nina, can't you consider your sister for once? She's fought so hard to get to where she is now."


Nina's fury erupted, and she let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "Oh, sure, Natalie's had it hard. Meanwhile,I've got it easy. Everything's about her. Even handing me off to some guy just for her benefit!"


At that moment, Natalie finally broke free from Linden and walked over just in time to hear Nina's words. She gave Nina a look of contempt. "Seriously,Nina? You're still holding on to this? How many times are you going to bring up spending the night with Linden? What, didn't you enjoy it?"


Nina's eyes began to fill with tears. She let out a cold laugh and shot back, "Oh, really? Then why don't you go sleep with him yourself?"


Nina was haunted by nightmares from that night.Just thinking about nearly being violated by Linden made her stomach churn.



Nina hadn't slept properly in days, dark circles under her eyes, but Natalie just brushed it off as nothing.


Unable to keep her emotions in check, Nina lunged at Natalie, but Elyse quickly slapped her across the face. The slap left Nina in shock, her tears welling up and falling down her cheeks.


Through her blurred vision, Nina could only see the disdain on Elyse's face and the mockery in Natalie's eyes.


In their eyes, she was nothing but worthless.


"Quite the scene to start the day," Daniela remarked,standing in the doorway, observing Nina pressed against the wall.


Natalie quickly wiped the cruel expression from her face.



Elyse flashed a smile. "Daniela, I thought you weren't coming to the office today."


Daniela strolled over and sat down in the CEO's chair,her eyes flicking to Nina's swollen face. "What happened?"


Elyse quickly moved forward, dismissing it. "She's just being dramatic. I gave her a small lesson.Nothing to worry about." Natalie added, "Nina can be a bit clumsy. The guests at Elite Lux are important, and I'm worried she won't meet their standards. I was thinking my mother could take her back to Harper Group so you don't have to deal with her."



Elyse nodded eagerly.


They had to make sure Daniela never found out about the pastries being tampered with.



To them, Nina was too naive to remain around Daniela.



"Yes, yes." Elyse reached for Nina's hand, trying to pull her out.


"I'm not going to Harper Group!" Nina cried out,realizing their plan. They were scared thetruth would come out or Linden would find out the person with him that night wasn't Natalie.


Nina felt the sting of abandonment once more.



Linden's insatiable desires meant that if she didn't escape, sooner or later, she'd be back in his bed. "Daniela, I won't leave. I want to stay at Elite Lux!Please, let me stay here. I'll do whatever you need!"


Elyse gritted her teeth, starting to drag Nina by force towards the office door.


Nina gripped the doorframe, tears streaming down her face.



Seeing Nina holding on, Natalie raised her stiletto heel, clearly intending to bring it down hard on Nina's hand.


"People might think you're the CEO of Elite Lux,Auntie," Daniela remarked.


Everyone in the room froze and turned in disbelief,their eyes locking onto Daniela.


Daniela sat in her chair, her small smile slowly fading.Fixing Elyse with a steady gaze, she continued, "ls the personnel management at Elite Lux now your responsibility?"
###Chapter 409 Marrying An 88-year-old Man
Daniela's words hit with force, leaving Elyse momentarily speechless.


Seizing her chance, Nina hurried to her feet and rushed behind Daniela, seeking protection. "Daniela,help me!"



Elyse stood, her face briefly contorting with a murderous look, but it vanished under Daniela's icy stare.



She managed a forced smile, her voice strained."Daniela, Nina is a problem and doesn't belong at Elite Lux. Let me take her away, alright?"


Daniela remained calm,leaning back in her chair with her hands at ease. "She's an employee of Elite Lux now. It's my call whether she stays or not."


Elyse's jaw tightened so much it seemed ready to  snap, but she forced an icy smile. "She may work at Elite Lux, but she's still my daughter."


Daniela nodded. "Nina."


Nina, her hair a mess and her eyes wide with fear,quickly responded, "Yes?"


Daniela inquired, "How old are you now?"


Nina answered, "Twenty-two."


Daniela nodded, her gaze softening with a touch of amusement. She remained composed. "Aunt Elyse,she's not a child anymore, and she's past the age of obedience. As long as I want her to stay at Elite Lux,and she agrees, no one can force her out."


At those words, Ely/se's face darkened with fury.


Linden stood nearby, watching Daniela in her commanding position, a smile curling on his lips.Daniela was something else entirely. Her presence was far more compelling than mere beauty.He glanced at Natalie, and despite their similar appearances, the contrast between them was riking.


Daniela was truly captivating! Linden's admiration for her was evident in his gaze.



Elyse left reluctantly, but not before giving Daniela one last warning. "Daniela, I'm doing this for your own sake. Nina is foolish, and keeping her here will only harm you. I know you care, but it's unnecessary."


She gave Nina a hard look, her voice cold as she said, "Since Daniela is letting you stay, enjoy it while you can. But once you're finished, I'll come take you home.Watch your words and actions."


She gave Nina one last icy glare before walking out.


Natalie followed suit, and Linden left as well.


Once everyone had gone, Nina immediately dropped to her knees. "Daniela, thank you. I will repay you!"


Daniela showed no reaction to Nina's gratitude.



The night she saved Nina, it was for one reason-she didn't want Nina to be used by others as a pawn to get involved with Cedric in dishonorable ways.


Elyse was seething with rage! She slammed her foot down in frustration. "Unappreciative girl! What use do I have for her? If I'd known, I wouldn't have bothered bringing her into this world!"



Natalie folded her arms, her expression icy and aloof."Mom, Linden just asked me to meet him at the hotel tonight."


Elyse stared at Natalie, taken aback. "So soon?Wasn't it just...?"



Natalie scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain."Linden's never been with a woman before. Now that he's experienced it, of course, he's eager for more."


Elyse looked at Natalie with pity in her eyes. "What now? Natalie, you can't sleep with a man like Linden.He's not worth it! If there's no choice, let Nina go again.Practice makes perfect."



Elyse lingered at the entrance of Elite Lux, waiting for Nina to appear.


The moment she spotted Nina, Elyse grabbed her and pulled her into a secluded corner.



"Get ready tonight and head to Room 1508 at Oak Hotel."


Nina froze for a second, then the realization hit her. A wave of despair washed over her, but she still asked,"Mom, what exactly do you mean by that? Do you think I'm out here selling myself again and again?"


Natalie stood off to the side, tapping away on her phone as if this had nothing to do with her.


Elyse didn't lose her temper this time. Instead, she spoke more persuasively. "Nina, you'll marry one day.Before that, make the most of things. It's just one night, no big deal. Or should Natalie sleep with Linden?"



Nina shot back coldly, "That sounds like a fantastic idea!"



Elyse's face twisted with fury."How can you say that about Natalie? Are you out of your mind?"


"Yeah! I am crazy!" Nina's head throbbed in agony."And I think not only Natalie should do it, but you,Mom, still have that allure. You could do it too! Linden won't even see your face! We're your daughters, just like you. You must have experience, so naturally,you could do it too."



A sharp slap landed, forcing Nina's head to snap to the side.



But Nina barely flinched, casually wiping the blood from her face. She laughed bitterly. "What, you don't think Linden's good enough either? So, you've already given up on me, haven't you?"


Elyse was beyond frustrated. "Don't talk to me like that. Fine, you refuse to go with Linden, huh? Then get married! Marry Noel Isaac!"


Nina stared at Elyse coldly, a bitter smile curling her lips. "Mom,is that it? Am I only worthy of marrying an old man like Noel Isaac?" Nina was just twenty-two, and Noel Elyse was already eighty-eight.


Marrying Noel would only make her a widow soon enough.
###Chapter 410 Daniela,I Need Your Help
"I'll pick my own partner!" With those words, Nina turned and walked off.


Elyse spent a small fortune hiring a skilled hypnotist to hypnotize Linden that night.


Nina made her way back to the Harper family villa.


At that moment, Daniela was lounging and watching a TV show when Nina came up to her.



"Daniela,I need your help."


Daniela responded, "Go ahead."


"I want to get married, but I want the ceremony to take place here. Would that be okay?"



Daniela gave Nina a thoughtful look.


Nina went on, "If the ceremony takes place in my mom's, my mom will take everything herself. I'll get nothing."


Daniela hesitated before asking, "Why would | agree to that?"


Nina lowered her voice. "I have a secret. Help me,and I'll tell you what I know."


Daniela flashed a smile.



Nina's voice turned grave. "It's about your mother's death. You've always suspected my mother had something to do with it and she's not alone in this."



Otherwise, with Daniela's influence, Elyse wouldn't have been able to get this far.


"I can tell you who's supporting her. But first, I need your help with my favor."


Daniela chuckled lightly. "Is this how you plan to repay me?"


Nina pressed her lips together before sinking to her knees. "I'm the one who's neglected at home. You've  gone through something similar at the Harper family.Please, just help me one more time."


Daniela sat cross-legged on the sofa, letting the TV show hum on in the background.


The rain softly tapped against the windows outside.


Surrounded by the rain and the sound of her own pounding heartbeat, Nina heard Daniela finally say,"Alright."


Nina's heart leapt in her chest. This was the best outcome she could have hoped for.


She lowered her head in gratitude. "'Thank you. I'll never forget your kindness."


Lillian presented Nina with several potential husbands-decent, stable candidates.


But Nina selected a man with a rather average appearance, who also had a physical disability.


Lillian gave Nina a quick glance before turning to Daniela. "You have a unique outlook, Nina. Sammy Wesker may have physical challenges, but he's made over a hundred million. Looks like you know what's more important."


The words were cutting. But Nina didn't take offense.


Lillian was saying Nina was only after the money.


When Lillian departed, Daniela said calmly, "Marriage is a significant decision. Once you're in, you can't undo it. If none of these men feel right, take your time. The Harper family villa has plenty of rooms for you to stay."



Nina's eyes filled with tears. "Don't you think I'm just being money-hungry by choosing Sammy?"


Daniela remained emotionless. "How you choose is your choice. When you decide to rely on someone for a lifetime, you need to choose carefully to gain a stable and long-lasting relationship."



Nina smiled faintly. "You're always so wise." She gave a bitter laugh. "I know I don't have your abilities.l can't rely on my own skills to protect myself, so l look for support. If my mother thinks I could settle for someone like Linden, surely she won't mind a son-in-law with a limp. Besides, Sammy's social standing and abilities outshine Elyse's. If I marry him, Elyse won't dare send me to Linden. I know you'll protect me, but it's time for me to take control of my future.I need to grow up."


It was only when Nina went to try on wedding dresses that Elyse heard the news-Nina was getting married.



Elyse hurried to Daniela's side. "Daniela,what is this?Nina's getting married, and I'm the last to know? This isn't right!"


Elyse had already secured a marriage for Nina with an 88-year-old man.


She had sold Nina for a hefty price. But now, the man was demanding a refund.


"Yes," Daniela replied, glancing at the paperwork."I'm curious too. Why are you the last to know about Nina's marriage? Aren't you her mother?" Elyse seethed with anger as she made her way over.


But when she saw Daniela, her fury quickly subdued.


Her chest rising and falling with anger, she demanded coldly, "And how is it that I hear Nina's wedding is being held at the Harper family?"


Sammy had a respectable social standing, so the dowry would surely be substantial. If Elyse secured it, Natalie's future would leave everyone envious.


But if Nina married outside the Harper family, those benefits wouldn't go to her.


Natalie, standing off to the side, fidgeted. "Mom, we can't let Nina marry Sammy! What will I do if Linden needs a woman later?"



She was always fixated on her own concerns.


Elyse found Nina and snapped, "You can't be this selfish. Go tell Daniela you're not marrying him."


With that, she pulled Nina towards Daniela.
###Chapter 411 Accident Before Marriage

Elyse's anger finally broke free, her voice sharp and confrontational. "Daniela, isn't this unfair? Nina is my daughter! Even if Brylee were still alive, she wouldn't dare to arrange her wedding. What right do you have?"


Elyse's voice boomed as she clutched Nina's hair,yanking he along with force.


Nina winced, a sharp gasp escaping her lips.


Daniela stayed composed. "Aunt Elyse, I thought you'd forgotten all about my mother. Do you remember how she passed?" She leaned in slightly, a subtle smile tugging at her lips.


Elyse's anger stiffened, freezing on her face.


Seizing the opportunity of Elyse's distraction, Nina broke free from her grip and quickly hid behind Daniela.



Elyse snapped, "I'm talking about Nina's situation.Why bring up Brylee?"


Daniela let out a soft chuckle, her smile distant and icy. "I've arranged for Nina to marry Sammy.The Harper family is her aunt's residence, so it's not out of place for her to marry from here. Plus, she works at Elite Lux, and as her boss, it's my privilege to send her off."



Her words were impeccable, leaving Elyse momentarily at a loss for words.


After a while, she countered, "But she has her own family. She shouldn't be marrying from somewhere else."



Daniela chuckled again, her eyes sharp. "Is that so?So, you think Nina should marry from the Dury family?"


Elyse nodded in agreement, but Nina shook her head firmly,whispering, "Daniela, I don't want to." Daniela responded casually, "Alright then."


Elyse began to smile, but before it could widen,Daniela continued, "I wonder what kind of wedding gift you're planning to give Nina. The Wesker family might not care about the sum, but surely you wouldn't let Nina marry without proper dignity,right?"


Elyse's smile completely faltered.


"I'm sure that's true. You have shares in Harper Group. I'll have a lawyer draw up a gift contract,transferring those shares to Nina as her dowry. It's a sign of your family's responsibility and your deep love for your daughter."


Elyse quickly rejected, "No way! Absolutely not!Those are meant for Natalie's future."



Daniela's expression hardened. "Then you have a choice. Either Nina marries from the Harper family with the dowry I provide, or she marries from the Dury family with the dowry you provide. The decision is yours." Elyse furrowed her brows.


Daniela's smile disappeared. "Or maybe you don't want to make a choice, refusing to show me this courtesy, and would prefer to cut ties with me.Hmm?"



Daniela's commanding presence was suffocating.


Elyse was speechless. She hadn't yet secured Daniela's assets, so there was no way she could afford to sever ties with her.



Ultimately, Elyse reluctantly consented to Nina marrying from the Harper family.



Before leaving, Elyse cast a cold, detached glance at Nina. "Once you're married, you'll be part of another family. The choice is yours. But if things go wrong,don't come back to me for help."



Nina's heart clenched at the coldness of her words.



Elyse departed in silence.


Nina's voice trembled as she whispered, "Thank you Daniela."


Daniela responded, "When we were children, my mother favored you. By protecting you now, I'm honoring the affection she had for you."


The day before the wedding, Daniela had to go on a business trip, and Nina left the Harper family villa.


Josie rushed after her. "Nina, Daniela mentioned that tomorrow is your big day. She asked me to watch over you. It's chaotic outside, and anything could disrupt the wedding."


Nina had been staying at the villa for the past few days.


Daniela was always generous. Every detail of Nina's wedding was tailor-made by Elite Lux.


The wedding dress was a unique, one-of-a-kind creation, making Nina appear like the most stunning princess in existence.


Nina felt as though she had truly moved beyond the Dury family, embracing her new independenco. "Josie, it's fine. I'm about to get married. My mother won't do anything extreme. She's my mother, and she wouldn't jeopardize an already arranged marriage. It wouldn't serve her. Besides, when my father was alive, he gave me a gold bracelet. It represents wealth and family legacy, and I've kept it safely in the Dury family vault. It's a precious gift from him, and I want it with me on my wedding day."


Since Nina mentioned her late father, Josie found herself unable to stop her.


"Wait a second. I'll call Lillian to arrange bodyguards for your return trip."


Nina smiled brightly in the sunlight. "It's fine. l've lived with the Dury family long enough. I'll be back soon. Josie, can you prepare dinner for me? I painted a picture for Daniela. She's coming back tonight,right?"


Nina grinned as she got into the car. That night, she intended to tell Daniela the full truth about Brylee's death, to finally reveal everything.


Nina felt as though Daniela was her guiding light.Because of her, she had been able to live a life free from the constraints of living in Natalie's shadow.


She felt incredibly fortunate, knowing she would be forever grateful to Daniela.
###Chapter 412 Are You Threatening Me





Nina departed from the Harper family villa.


As they drove, the driver glanced back and said "The car behind seems to be tailing us intentionally."


"Hmm?" Nina responded, observing that the car,which had been following them so closely, suddenly turned at the intersection.



The driver became quiet.


Upon returning to the Dury family home, Nina found both Elyse and Natalie waiting.


The moment Natalie laid eyes on Nina, she spotted the jade bracelet on her wrist.


She heard the bracelet was a gift from the Wesker family to their daughter-in-law-an heirloom worth millions.



Natalie's eyes narrowed, a flash of envy crossing her In her eyes, Nina was a fool who ended up with things she herself didn't desire.


How could Nina possess something so valuable now?


A spiteful glint sparkled in Natalie's eyes as she raised her hand to block Nina's path. "Aren't you scared?"



Nina glanced at Natalie. "Scared of what?"


Natalie smirked. "Aren't you worried the Wesker family will discover you slept with Linden?"


Nina furrowed her brows. "Are you threatening me?"


Natalie chuckled. "If you think so, then I suppose it is. I don't care who you marry, but if Linden wants to sleep with me, you'll have to go."


Nina knew Daniela had a plan in place, so she held back from revealing it. "I can't. I'm going to marry Sammy.I can't do such things. You're so capable.Why don't you go? After all, it was you Linden wanted from the start."


Natalie's eyes gleamed with malicious coldness."If you don't agree, I'll make your affair with Linden public. The Wesker family cares about their reputation. Once that video of you and Linden spending the night together gets out, do you think they'll still want you? By then, even Daniela won't be able to protect you."


Nina mirrored Daniela's confident demeanor,standing firm in defense of her happiness. "Is that so? I'm part of the Dury family. My disgrace is yours as well. The world will know how the Dury family failed to raise me, and I'll expose all your secrets. I'll show them how the picture-perfect, glamorous Natalie is nothing but a manipulative schemer. If no one will marry me because of it, then no one will dare marry you either."



Natalie was furious at Nina's calm response."How dare you!"


Nina sneered. "If you're out to ruin me, why should I hold back?" Ignoring Natalie's contorted face, she made her way upstairs to her room.


Her room had turned into little more than a storage space.


Nina didn't care anymore. She had given up on this family entirely.


She placed both the gold bracelet from her father and the jade one from the Wesker family onto one wrist.



With the gold bracelet in her hand, she whispered,"Dad, can you see this? I'm getting married soon.l'll be happy."


Nina collected her things and walked downstairs, not bothering to look back.


Natalie had left.



Elyse remained seated on the sofa. "Nina, are you sure you won't listen to me and Natalie?"


A cold shiver ran through Nina. She turned to Elyse and asked quietly, "Mom, I'm getting married tomorrow. Don't you have anything to say? Not even a blessing?"


Elyse stared at the coffee table and replied coldly, "If you defy me, I'll disown you! I don't even want to speak at your wedding, let alone bless it."


Nina nodded, realizing she had no tears left for such a heartless Elyse. Maybe she had been disappointed enough.


Nina walked out of the villa.


Just as she was about to get in the car, Elyse suddenly called out, "Nina, I'm asking you one last time. Will you listen to me?"


Nina hesitated with her hand on the car door before getting in.


Inside the car, Nina's eyes were rimmed with red. She looked down at the bracelet on her wrist, about to smile when her expression suddenly froze.


She looked up in shock, realizing the car wasn't headed towards the Harper family's villa.


"Hey, where are you taking me?" Nina demanded,her voice trembling.


The car sped up, rushing down the road.


Her grip tightened around the door handle as her heart raced.


"Stop the car! I told you, stop the car!" she yelled,panic rising in her chest.


But the car surged forward, merging onto the highway, then veering onto a lonely side road.


Fear swept over Nina, and she cursed herself for not listening to Daniela and for not bringing a bodyguard along.


Frantically, she grabbed her phone, aiming to dial Daniela, but the driver swerved sharply, jerking Nina to the side.



Her phone flew from her grasp, the screen flashing with Daniela's name. Nina reached for it, but it slipped further away.As she gripped the seat with all her strength, the sound of her jade and gold bracelets clashing rang through the car.



Her eyes burned as she stared at Daniela's name,realizing this was her last chance to get away.


As her fingers hovered over the screen, the car suddenly halted. Stunned, Nina had no time to react befoe she was forcefully dragged out of the vehicle.


Tears blurred her vision as she watched Daniela's name fade from the screen.


With a sob, she closed her eyes, the tears flowing freely down her face.
###Chapter 413 The Wesker Family Won't Want Her Anymore
Daniela stepped back through the door, finally home from her business trip.


Before she could even place her luggage down, Josie darted toward her, her face etched with panic."Daniela, Nina's gone missing!"


Daniela's voice was steady, though her mind raced."How long has she been gone?"


Josie's words tumbled out in a rush. "She left after lunch, saying she'd be back for dinner. It's nine now,and she hasn't come back. I've called her over and over, but there's no answer."


A line of concern deepened on Daniela's forehead.


Just then, a knock echoed through the room.


It was a member of the Wesker family. Given Nina's  complicated ties with the Dury family, they worried she'd be overlooked at the wedding and so had brought a lavish set of gold jewelry as a gift.


Lillian greeted them with a serene smile, walking to the door. "The bride is occupied with last-minute preparations. She's out getting a beauty treatment and won't be coming down to thank you personally."


At that moment, the guest's expression changed as they read something on their phone. They glanced at the screen, their demeanor turning grave, before showing it to Lillian.



The message was blunt and direct, Nina, the bride,had been missing for eight hours leading up to the wedding.


Daniela moved closer and skimmed the name of the sender.



It was Jarrett Morphew, a reporter from the gossip outlet, Bubble Entertainment.

 
Without uttering a sound, Daniela spun on her heel and headed inside to call Ryan. "Buy Bubble Entertainment in the next ten minutes. Have a reporter named Jarrett Morphew call me," she ordered.



Lillian gave a polite smile to the confused guest."We've received your gift. She'll be at the wedding by eight tomorrow morning, for sure. Goodbye."


Without another word, she closed the door with finality.


"Daniela,what's happening?"


At that moment, Daniela's phone buzzed-Sammy was calling.


"Ms. Harper, is Nina really missing?" Sammy's voice crackled with concern, though he kept his tone respectful.


Daniela didn't hesitate. "Yes."



A brief silence lingered before Sammy spoke again."May I ask why?"  Daniela's response was cool and measured. "It's a family matter, and I'm not going into details. If your wedding is still holding tomorrow, you'll know."


With that, Daniela ended the call without hesitation,and almost immediately, Jarrett's call rang through.


"How did you get wind of Nina's disappearance?"she asked.



Jarrett was taken aback by how quickly Daniela had taken control of the company. It had been just ten minutes since the message went out, and already Bubble Entertainment had a new owner.


Claiming he wasn't afraid would have been an outright lie.


In a hesitant tone, Jarrett responded, "An unknown number rang me. I traced it back to the owner."


After a brief pause, he continued, "It's someone from the Dury family. Her name is Natalie."


Lillian couldn't hold back a burst of laughter.

"Daniela, what's the Dury family up to? Are they  trying to tarnish Nlina's name so she can't get married? Why would they do this? What's in it for them?"



Daniela's eyes narrowed with a sharp focus. She dialed Elyse's number.



Elyse's voice was tinged with surprise. "Daniela,what's going on? How do you have time to call me now? Is something wrong? I'm at the beauty salon,prepping for Nina's wedding tomorrow."



Daniela stared into the dark expanse outside. "Nina is missing."



"Oh? Is that so?" Elyse put on a facade of surprise."What should we do now? If the bride doesn't show up tomorrow, can the wedding still happen? But honestly, it's nothing. Daniela, youI're more than capable. I'm sure you'll find her and make sure everything goes smoothly, right?"


Daniela's voice chilled. "Aunt Elyse, are you absolutely sure you don't know where Nina is?" Elyse let out a forced laugh. "Me? How could I possibly know? Isn't she with you? I haven't seen her in forever."


Josie grew frantic. "That's impossible! Nina must've gone home. She said she was going to grab the gold bracelet her father gave her, and then she vanished."


Elyse scoffed dismissively. "Really? I haven't seen her. Besides, an adult isn't officially missing until 24hours have passed. You all are overreacting. Daniela,young women like Nina can be unpredictable. Sure,you've found her a good match, but maybe she's like your stepsister Joyce, off with some man somewhere. You're stressing over nothing."


Josie's fury bubbled up, her face darkening with anger. She had never encountered such an irresponsible mother in her life.


Daniela's expression stayed unmoved, her face a picture of calm. "It seems I care more about Nina than you, Aunt Elyse. Your daughter goes missing before her wedding, and you act like you're just hoping she wakes up in some man's bed. Aunt Elyse,  what goes around comes around. Bad deeds always find their way back, like a boomerang, striking when you least expect it. I'm not in a rush. Let's wait and see."



With that, Daniela ended the call.


Elyse slammed the phone down in anger and turned to Natalie. "Sweetheart, what do we do now?Daniela's back, and she's a force to be reckoned with. If she finds Nina before the wedding and Nina marries Sammy, we'll lose all control over her."


Natalie's lips curled into a smirk. She unlocked her phone and watched a video of Nina's desperate screams. With a chilling smile, she looked at Elyse and said, "The Wesker family won't want her anymore."
###Chapter 414 My Wedding Will Be Cancelled,Right
In that moment, Elyse's heart skipped a beat as she caught sight of the icy smirk on Natalie's face.


"Natalie, we had an agreement, didn't we? All we wanted was to disrupt Nina's wedding so she'd end up taking your place with Linden. You're not planning anything beyond that, are you?"


Natalie, draped in a soft lavender gown, took a slow sip of her coffee, her gaze drifting to Elyse. With a faint smile, she said, "Mom, as long as we achieve our goals, does it really matter what path we take?"


Elyse's unease deepened. "She's still your sister,Natalie. Getting her involved with Linden is already too much. You can't go further than that. Once this is over, she'll still need to secure a good marriage."


Natalie let out a soft laugh, patting Elyse's hand reassuringly. "Mom, why do you always fixate on marriage? Money is the real power in this world.With it, anything is possible. I promise you, whatever Nina endures today, I'll repay her a hundredfold someday Right now, we need to focus on taking down Daniela,gaining Elite Lux, and securing her fortune. Isn't that what truly matters?"


Elyse nodded, her doubts melting away like they'd never existed. "Yes, we have to get rid of Daniela!"


Natalie gazed at the moonlit expanse outside, her laughter ringing with triumph. "Daniela, weren't you supposed to be so capable? Then why haven't you found Nina yet?"


Natalie reached for the coffee pot, bracing for a long night ahead, when her phone buzzed with an incoming call.


The roar of wind filled the line as a man's urgent voice broke through. "Miss Dury, I'm sorry, but the other side is too powerful. We can't hold our ground."


Before he could continue, Daniela's voice cut in, calm and sharp. "Ah, so it's Natalie. Elyse must be there with you. Be sure to send her my regards."


The line went dead with a soft beep, leaving Natalie frozen in shock.



Slowly, the smirk faded from her face, replaced by a flicker of panic. "Mom, do you think Daniela will call the police?"


Elyse chuckled dismissively. "Of course not. Besides,didn't you say you only had someone invite Nina out for coffee? Why would she involve the police?"



Elyse's forced smile vanished instantly as her eyes locked onto Natalie's panicked expression.Realization dawning, she asked, "What did you do to Nina?"



When Daniela discovered Nina, she was barely clinging to consciousness.


Blood streaked across her body, her tattered clothes clinging by threads, and a sickening odor wafted from her battered frame. Bound and helpless, Nina was left in a crumbling warehouse, surrounded by slithering snakes and the rotting corpses of rats.


In utter terror, Nina had succumbed to breakdowns again and again, her body overrun by ants and cockroaches, every breath a trembling challenge.


When Daniela stepped in, the vacant haze in Nina's eyes began to sharpen, inch by inch.


Daniela, drawing on her psychology background,recognized the signs of extreme trauma-whether caused by a man or an animal-that could plunge a victim into a bottomless fear of intimacy and men.


This wasn't a mere warning-it was a calculated,merciless act meant to shatter a person entirely.


Daniela swept the snakes aside with her foot, flung the decaying rats off Nina's frail body, and carefully poured alcohol over her skin to rid her of the ants and cockroaches.



Nina's bloodshot, fear-stricken eyes lifted to meet Daniela's, brimming with anguish. In a trembling voice, she whispered, "Daniela, my wedding will be cancelled,right?"
###Chapter 415 | Know Something About Your Mother's Death
When Nina was kidnapped, she caught snippets of her captors calling the press. By now, her absence had stretched on so long, it was bound to have sparked whispers everywhere. If she stepped outside in her torn and ragged clothes, it wouldn't take anyone long to piece together what she'd been through.



Marriage was no longer an option for her.


"We'll sort this out later. Let's just get you home first." Daniela carefully untied the ropes from Nina's wrists and ankles, threw a coat over her shoulders,and guided her out of the grimy warehouse that stank of death.



Nina sat in the car, shaking so hard it seemed she might fall apart, She stared blankly out of the window as she spoke on the phone with Sammy.


"Can I talkto him myself?" Nina asked.


Daniela hesitated before handing her the phone. Nina said, "Sammy, I'm sorry. Maybe you should cancel the wedding tomorrow. I know I'm to blame for this,and I can't tell you how sorry I am. None of this is on my cousin; it's all on me. I'm really sorry."


Daniela's eyes flicked to Nina.


Nina hadn't stopped shaking. The proud, spoiled girl who once walked with her head held high was utterly gone.


Nina returned the jade bracelet to the Wesker family.


She stopped in front of Daniela and gave her a faint,broken smile. Gently, she removed the gold bracelet from her wrist and placed it on Daniela's.


"This might not mean much to you, but it holds my father's blessing to me-and now, it's my blessing to you. Daniela, you're the kindest person | know.
Happiness will find you, I'm sure of it."


Saying nothing more, Nina turned and made her way upstairs.


Daniela glanced at the bracelet now circling her wrist. Nina's blood had smeared across the gold.


Her expression darkened as she turned to Lillian."Watch her closely."


That night, Nina tried to end her life.


In the ambulance, Lillian was beside herself. "stepped out for just a second, and you did this?"


News of the canceled wedding quickly spread.


At the hospital, Nina made another attempt on her life.



The bathroom floor was stained with blood.


Panicked, Lillian ran out to find the doctor.


Even after being rescued, Nina made yet another attempt that same night. .Lillian was utterly exhausted and resorted to restraining Nina to the hospital bed.



When Daniela showed up, Nina sat gazing out of the window, her eyes vacant and lifeless.


Daniela took one look at Nina, who appeared to have given up entirely, and ordered her restraints to be removed.



Lillian reminded her, "If you untie her,she'll try to end her life again."


Daniela walked over and settled into the chair by Nina's bedside.



"Daniela..." Nina's voice was a weak whisper. "I don't want to live anymore."


Tears streamed down her face as she spoke.


Daniela's face stayed calm as she carefully peeled an orange. "If you want to die, I'm not going to stop you."


Nina's eyes shifted to Daniela. I don't have time to waste, and neither does anyone else around me. If you're set on dying, then go ahead." Daniela didn't rush and continued peeling the orange with practiced ease. "The gold bracelet you went through so much to get clearly meant a lot to you.Your father cherished you so much. If he saw you throwing your life away now, do you think he'd regret scraping together his savings to prepare your dowry? When my mom died suddenly, she left me with nothing. After that, my stepmother came and took everything of hers. On my wedding day, I was accused of arson and murder, divorced the same day, and turned into the city's biggest joke. Do you think your situation is worse than mine? If you really want to die, do it quickly and stop wasting everyone's time. If not, go home. Your room's still waiting for you."



Daniela slipped the gold bracelet off her wrist and handed it to Nina. "Think of your father's wishes and the blessings he left for you. Whether or not you honor them is entirely up to you."


She gave Nina one last look before walking out of the  hospital room.


Before she left, she set the peeled orange on the table.


Its fresh scent slowly filled the room, blending wwith the sharp smell of dlisinfectant.


Nina stared at the orange in silence for a long time,her thoughts far away. Slowly, she gathered herself,ate the fruit, and slipped the gold bracelet onto her pocket.


Daniela had been right.


If she wasn't afraid to die, why should she fear living?


Natalie figured Nina would be out of it for a while.


The news had made it seem that way, didn't it?


Nina had tried to end her life three times, and it seemed like death was closing in on her.


Elyse was taken aback. "You promised you wouldn't harm Nina. So why am I hearing about rats and snakes?I also heard she's been diagnosed with  schizophrenia."


Natalie had heard the rumors as well. In fact, she hadn't just heard it. She had someone dig up Nina's records from the psychiatric hospital to verify the diagnosis.


"She's your sister. How could you let this happen?"


Natalie brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear."Mom, how many times do l have to say this? I'l make it right with Nina. Do you stilI want Daniela's assets or not?"



Elyse went quiet.


Then, without a second look, Natalie grabbed her bag and headed out for work.


At the Harper family villa, Daniela was preparing for work when Nina came down. "Daniela, I've made up my mind. I won't involve the police. I'll handle my own revenge."


Daniela opened the door and stepped out. "It's your choice."Later that day, Nina arrived at work.


When Natalie saw her, a sneer curled on her lips."So, the whole city is buzzing about how you spent your wedding night with another man, and now your marriage is off. They're calling you a slut. And yet,you still have the nerve to show your face here?"


Nina smiled faintly. She leaned in close to Natalie's ear. "Natalie, what are you so proud of? Guess what?If | tell Daniela that you were the one behind her mother's death, what do you think she'll do?"


Natalie's face hardened in an instant. "You wouldn't dare!"



"Why wouldn't I dare?" Nina's gaze was sharp. "If I'm not afraid of dying, what else could possibly scare me?"



"What do you want?" Natalie glared at Nina, wishing she'd taken care of her once and for all.


"What do I want? You'll find out soon enough," Nina  replied, her smile dark and full of meaning. The unsettling look made Natalie squint.


Nina then walked straight to Daniela's office."Daniela, I know something about your mother's death."
###Chapter 416 The Truth





Daniela sat at her desk, her hands resting motionless before her. Her eyes, sharp and distant, fixed on Nina. "Go on."



"Years ago, Aunt Brylee managed to secure a national agency for a major brand. She became the wealthiest person in the country. My mother,acting on someone's orders, reached out to Katrina,who was then working as a maid in your home. She promised that after the celebration banquet, a hypnotist would be brought in to make Aunt Brylee jump off a building."



Daniela's fingers curled around the edge of the desk,tightening with unspoken fury. "Who gave the orders to Elyse? How long has this been in the making?"



Nina bit her lip, her gaze falling to the floor before slowly lifting to meet Daniela's. A trace of pity flickered in her eyes. "My mother always spoke with that person in private. Neither Natalie nor I have ever met him, but I overheard my mother call him Mr.Perry... It felt like an organization, not just a man. As for how long this plan has been brewing..."


Nina hesitated, her eyes flickering up to gauge Daniela's reaction.



For reasons she couldn't place, Daniela's cold calmness at that moment felt like the stillness before an inevitable storm.



"The scheme to eliminate your mother began the moment Caiden got close to your mother."



At the mention of his name, Daniela's grip on the table tightened instantly. "Are you saying Caiden was a pawn? That he was sent to seduce my mother?"


Nina gave a small nod. "I overheard my mother talking about how, as Aunt Brylee's business grew,those people sent many to get close to her. But none succeeded until your father appeared. That's when Aunt Brylee fell for him." Daniela's hand began to tremble, her control slipping as the weight of Nina's words sank in. The room, so large and spacious, suddenly felt stifling. She had long resigned herself to the idea of Caiden's betrayal, but hearing it spoken aloud twisted a fresh pang of pain through her chest.


"Aunt Brylee truly gave her heart to Caiden. They say there's no deeper pain than betrayal from someone you love. On the day she passed, my mother showed her a video. Aunt Brylee had drunk heavily at the banquet, and in that state, she was easy prey for the hypnotist."



Daniela absorbed each word in silence, her expression unreadable.


A woman betrayed by both her husband and sister. In the face of such treachery, Brylee was manipulated,walking blindly towards her demise.


What had Brylee thought as she left this world? Was she aware of the manipulations behind her fate?


And what of Caiden? Had he ever felt remorse for what he'd done, even once, during all the years that passed?


Later,Daniela returned to the Harper family home.


In the yard, Caiden basked in the warmth of the sun,looking completely at ease. When he spotted Daniela, his face lit up with exaggerated enthusiasm."Ah, my dear daughter. I hear you've been making waves, starting new companies left and right.Everyone's talking about you. I'm so proud! Now that you're rolling in wealth, how about raising my monthly allowance?"


Before Daniela could respond to Caiden, Cedric arrived, breathless from his hurried rush. His sharp eyes immediately spotted the fruit knife Daniela had tucked into her coat pocket.



"Ah, Cedric's here too, I heard you married Daniela?Well, now I'm your father-in-law, so don't forget to support me, too," Caiden said with a grin, completely oblivious to the tension building in the air.


Cedric, still uneasy, moved closer to Daniela, his gaze filled with concern.


Some individuals, no matter how turbulent their emotions, possessed a calmness that seemed untouched by the storm inside.


Daniela was such a person. The more furious she felt, the more composed she appeared.


Without a flicker of emotion, Cedric exclaimed,"Shut up!"


Caiden was insignificant to Cedric, but he was deeply concerned about Daniela.



Daniela's past struggles with depression lingered in Cedric's mind. If Caiden's words pushed her too far,Cedric would not wait for her to act. He would take matters into his own hands and end Caiden himself.


Deciding to help her rest, Cedric escorted Daniela upstairs for a nap.


When Cedric finally awoke, the night had fallen. His hand reached for the space beside him, but it was cold. The absence of Daniela's warmth sent a ripple of unease through him.


His heart pounded as panic set in. With urgency,he threw off the covers and rushed downstairs.


The first floor, typically aglow with light, was now shrouded in unsettling darkness.


As Cedric descended, the moonlight outside illuminated a tense scene: Daniela sat rigidly on the sofa, staring at Caiden, who was bound to a chair.


Just as Cedric prepared to move forward, Lillian and Ryan stepped in his path and raised their hands to halt him.



"Daniela has her own way of handling things. You promised her that, didn't you?"
###Chapter 417 You Didn't Cherish Her





The spacious villa was hauntingly silent.


The silence was broken only by Caiden's frantic shout. "Daniela, I'm your father! Have you completely lost your mind?"


He fought against the ropes, but they only tightened with every movement he made.


Daniela was dressed entirely in black. She sat across from him on the sofa, her face cold and emotionless.


"Daniela, I haven't done anything lately. Why are you doing this? You know murder is a crime. You're the CEO of Elite Lux now, with power and influence. It's not worth risking jail over me."


Daniela stayed quiet, gripping a butcher's knife, her eyes burning with a deadly intent.


"Cedric!" Caiden's heart raced with panic  He gasped and shouted in a trembling voice. "Cedric!I'm your father-in-law. My life matters to you too. Get down here, quick!"


Cedric tried to head downstairs, but Ryan and Lillian blocked his path.


In the dark, Daniela smirked. The room was shrouded in darkness, with only the cool moonlight casting a ghostly, silvery glow on the floor, radiating an unsettling chill.


"I'll ask the questions, and you'll answer," Daniela said coldly, standing up with the knife in hand, her piercing gaze bearing down on Caiden. "I only want the truth. If you lie, don't blame me for being merciless."


The moon was hidden by clouds, leaving Daniela in complete darkness. Her voice was cold and emotionless, like a ghost emerging from the shadows.


Caiden's heart pounded with fear. "What do you want to know? This has nothing to do with me! It was all Katrina's doing, not mine! If you want answers, go to Katrina and Joyce!"



Daniela chuckled, a defiant smile playing on her lips in the darkness. "Don't worry. I'll get to them. But right now, it's your turn."


Caiden's chest tightened at the ominous weight of her words.



"The first question is simple. When you went after my mother all those years ago, was it your idea, or were you following someone else's orders?"



Caiden's heart lurched, and he quickly responded,"Of course, it was my idea. Your mother was breathtakingly beautiful back then, admired by so many men. I fell for her at first sight, and then you came along. It's that sim..."



Before he could finish the word "simple," a cold gust of wind rushed past him.


In the blink of an eye, Daniela was right there,standing in front of him. Just as Caiden was about to react, a sharp pain stabbed through his chest.


He froze, staring down in a dazed confusion.


A knife was buried deep in his left thigh, blood spurting out likea fountain. Slowly, Caiden raised his head to glance at Daniela.


Moments later, he screamed in agony, "Ah!" The piercing scream echoed through the entire villa.


The front door of the villa swung open, and Nina stepped in, her eyes widening at the gruesome scene in the living room.


Daniela didn't flinch. Amidst Caiden's agonized cries,she yanked the knife from his thigh with brutal force.


Caiden screamed once again.


Daniela looked down at him, her voice calm and deliberate as she asked, "Do | really need to ask again? Was it a calculated move or real affection?"


Caiden's lips quivered uncontrollably from the excruciating pain, and cold sweat streamed down his forehead.



He turned his head, his eyes pleading as he glanced at Cedric standing at the top of the staircase."Cedric, help me. Daniela's lost her mind..."


Before he could finish his sentence, a second stab came down, plunging into his right thigh.


"Ah!" Caiden's forehead veins throbbed as his body teetered on the edge of collapse. He almost lost consciousness.


Daniela stood still, like a hunter torturing his prey,waiting patiently for Caiden's screams to subside and for him to endure the unbearable pain.


She then pressed the sharp tip of the knife against Caiden's chest. "If this knife goes any deeper,I doubt you'll hear me ask again."


"P'l talk. I'll teIl you everything." Sweat drenched Caiden's forehead, mingling with the blood, making him appear both fierce and pitiable. "I'll answer any question you ask. Before I met your mother, I was just a poor farmhand. We were worlds apart." His words rushed out, punctuated by sharp breaths from the pain. "Someone gave me an invitation to a banquet and a set of fine clothes, which let me attend that event."



Daniela shot him a cold glance. "And then, did my mother notice you?"


"No. Your mother was so stunning back then. How could she even notice someone like me? I saw her,and I heard people talk about how she wNas the wealthiest person in the country, with unimaginable riches.It was just like that. I never dared to dream of her, honestly. After the banquet, I went home. Then,someone started giving me information about where she would be, what she liked, and tips on how to get her attention. "Your mother was unbelievably beautiful, like a star I could never reach. Without those tips, I would never have had the nerve to dream of marrying her." Caiden's voice shook, but there was honesty in his words, his eyes lost in the memory of those days filled with beauty. The moon broke free from the clouds, spilling a silver glow across the floor.


Daniela stood, half bathed in light, half swallowed by darkness.



The knife gleamed in her hand, with blood dripping onto the cold floor.


In a low voice, she asked, "If that was the case, why did you win her over and then fail to cherish her?"
###Chapter 418 A Strong Urge To End His Own Life

Daniela's voice was low, like it came from the hell.


Caiden recoiled and spoke in a quiet, shaky voice."When you care about something too much, you throw yourself into it completely at the beginning,but eventually, it becomes tiring. Your mother was incredible. Everyone said I was the luckiest man, and at first, I believed it. She never demanded anything from me except my presence. In the beginning, l cherished those simple, carefree days. But as time passed, I began to notice the whispers from others.My pride was wounded, and I couldn't find peace.Then I met Katrina. She made me feel a sense of worth I'd never experienced before. I found comfort in that and got caught up in it."


Daniela's hand tightened around the cold blade, her grip silent but unyielding. Caiden's voice quivered as blood dripped from the chair, staining the floor beneath him. "I found a sense of fulfillment with Katrina, something I never experienced with your mother. Katrina respected me,put me first, and let me indulge in my every desire without holding back."



At his words, Daniela let out a bitter laugh. Her voice was cold and sharp as it echoed through the empty halls of the villa.



She looked down, her gaze dark and intense, before asking, "When you were caught up in your affair, did you ever stop to think about the fact that the self-worth you showed Katrina was built on the honor and status my mother gave you? Without her wealth, do you honestly think Katrina would have even looked at you?"



Caiden quickly looked up, his voice desperate as he tried to explain, "No, no, that's not true. Katrina always told me she valued me for who l am, not my money. Even if I had nothing, she would still marry me." Daniela's lips curled into a mocking smile, as if she'd heard the funniest joke. "Is that so? If it were really like that, then why didn't you come clean to my mother? If you truly loved each other, she wouldn't have kept holding on. So,tell me, why did she end up jumping off a building?"


Caiden tried to speak several times, but no words came out.



He desperately wished he could prove he had once been deeply loved, but no matter how hard he tried,his mind came up empty.


Finally, it clicked for him, and he looked up at Daniela,speaking desperately, like someone drowning and trying to grab anything to survive. "Back then,Katrina really loved me. She was always careful about contraception because she didn't want to hurt you emotionally. Even when she left, she regretted not having another child with me."


Daniela stared at him with an unreadable expression.


Human nature is the easiest thing to break apart. In that moment, Daniela felt likeshe was holding a sharp blade, slowly cutting through the illusion that Caiden had worked so hard to keep up.



"Really? She cared so much about my feelings that she never had a child with you all these years?"


Caiden nodded, his desperation palpable. "Yes."


"Ah,well, that's certainly love."


Just as Caiden began to smile, Daniela's voice,full of confusion, cut through the moment. "Then why did she treat me so badly? You knew how she treated me, didn't you?"


In the bitter cold, Daniela was left without proper clothes.



In the burning heat of summer, she was sent to pull weeds in the garden.



Every lesson a young girl should have learned about her body, Daniela had to face on her own, anxious and overwhelmed.That wasn't love-not even close.



The smile on Caiden's face faltered, his expression stiffening as Daniela's words sank in.


"Do you knowv why Katrina never had a child with you?" Daniela picked up a piece of paper from the table behind her. "Look at this. After Joyce was born,Katrina suffered abuse from her ex-husband and had her uterus removed years ago."



The revelation hit Caiden like a blow to the head,leaving him utterly stunned.


Caiden tried to laugh, but the sound wouldn't come.He stared at her with wide, confused eyes for a long time before managing to say, "You're lying to me."


Daniela didn't need to say more. She knew the truth had already taken root in Caiden's mind.


Even if he didn't believe her, it made no difference.Her mother didn't need Caiden's hollow remorse.His regret held no weight for either of them.


"Enough of this. Next question. When you met my mother, someone kept feeding you information. What did they want from you? What deal did you make?"


Caiden slowly raised his head from the fog of confusion, his chest tightening with every breath.After a long silence, he finally choked out, "No. I didn't do anything. They didn't ask for anything...Ah!"


The blade sank deep into his thigh again.


But this time, Daniela didn't pull the knife away right away. Instead, she leaned in closer, her gaze fixed on him.


As Caiden cried out in agony, she began to twist the blade slowly, turning it deeper into his wound.


Caiden gasped, his body wracked with pain, but Daniela's expression remained unchanged, a cold smile on her lips.


"Relax. I'm trained in anatomy. I'll make sure every cut is exact and won't kill you. You'll survive."


Veins popped from Caiden's forehead and neck as  his body trembled uncontrollably. He struggled to breathe, gasping for air with each desperate inhale.


Never before had he felt such a strong urge to end his own life.
###Chapter 419 They Planned A Grand Scheme Of Murder
Daniela seemed completely unaware of the tension.


A smile crept across her face as she turned to Caiden. "You always say that you're my father and that I share your blood. The more I think about it,the more it makes sense. So, here's an idea. What if l drain every drop of blood from your body? That way,the blood coursing through me won't be so tainted.What do you think?"


Caiden instinctively leaned back, shocked by her words.


He stared at Daniela in disbelief, thinking she must have lost her mind.


Once, she had been a bright little girl, clinging to his leg and begging for his affection.


But now, standing before him, was something unrecognizable, a ghostly figure-cold, detached,and utterly different.


Though Daniela was keenly aware of the storm of thoughts raging in Caiden's mind, she remained indifferent.



She asked, "Have you figured out how to answer my question?"


Caiden bit his lower lip hard, trying to control his reaction.


Daniela laughed, her smile as charming as ever. The moon peeked through the clouds, lighting up her already glowing face, and giving her a fairy-like appearance.


However, her actions were swift and unhesitating.With a subtle movement, she pressed, and Caiden's agonized scream echoed through the silence.


Daniela said casually, "It seems like the knife went right through your thigh."


"Ugh!" Nina, unable to bear the sight any longer and overcome by the metallic scent of blood,bolted from the villa without warning, vomiting uncontrollably in the yard.


The scene was beyond horrific.


She bent over and vomited.


It was unlike anything she'd ever seen-a brutal,bloody revenge that seemed to stretch the limits of human cruelty. Fear clutched at her heart, but something darker, something inexplicably thriling,stirred deep within.


Wiping her mouth with firm resolve, Nina grasped the door handle and stepped back into the chaos.


Caiden had already passed out.


Daniela brought a bucket of water, and Caiden stirred as though he had narrowly escaped death.


Daniela watched him, smiling. "Hi. We meet again."


Caiden considered pretending to be unconscious.


Before he could, Daniela's laugh broke the silence. "Don't bother. I've got a box of adrenaline right here.Like | said, I won't let you die."


With that, she yanked the knife from Caiden's thigh and drove it back in.



Over and over, she repeated the action, her face as serene and playful as a child with a new toy.


The only interruption to her rhythm was Caiden's agonizing screams, each one more pitiful than the last.


Daniela stayed unmoved, going through the motions until Caiden shouted weakly, "Stopo it!"


It was only then that Daniela asked with a hint of satisfaction in her voice, "Ready to talk now?"


Caiden nodded weakly.


With a smile, Daniela straightened up. "You know, if you'd spoken up sooner, maybe all this pain could have been avoided. Don't you think?"


As the words left her lips, the knife sank into his already mangled thigh.


His screams filled the air, but Daniela didn't flinch.She took a seat on the nearby sofa, her posture relaxed. "Come on, then. Tell me. What were the conditions for this intermediary to spill my mother's secrets and whereabouts?"


It took what felt like an eternity for Caiden to gather himself,his voice now barely a whisper.


Still, the silence in the villa made every word painfully distinct.



"At first, they didn't contact me directly. Just sent me clues about your mother. Then, your mother reached out to me. I was ecstatic. But I was just a poor guy,clueless about how to win her over. When it came to dating, the clues from the intermediary suddenly stopped. I had no choice but to give it my all, even though I felt like a clumsy fool. After a few dates,your mother lost interest in me, and I could feel her pulling away. I panicked. I couldn't bear seeing her in circles | couldn't get into. Desperate, I tried everything to reach the intermediary. They never showed up. Just when I thought there was no hope left, they called me out of the blue."


Caiden hesitated and stole a wary glance at Daniela.


She peeled an orange, her face calm and almost blank, as if she were hearing a story from a stranger.


Caiden let out a sigh of relief, pressed his lips together, and said honestly, "The person on the phone told me if I followed their instructions, I could win your mother's favor and become her partner.The word 'partner' was too tempting. It meant more than just a title-it promised power, status, and a life of wealth. I was swayed and agreed without really thinking."



The sweet scent of oranges blended with the sharp tang of blood. Daniela popped a slice into her mouth."What did they tell you to do?"


Caiden replied, "They want me to bring Katrina into your mother's villa."


At that, Daniela stopped, her hand tightening around the orange.


Her dark eyes slowly lifted, a hidden threat lurking in her gaze as she asked, "So, you and Katrina go way back. And the whole thing was a scheme from the beginning."


Together with Elyse, the hypnotist who reached out to her, and that intermediary, they had carefully laid out a deadly plot.


The victim was Brylee, Daniela's mother.
###Chapter 420 You Can't Do This To Me

As Caiden's positive answer rang out, a thick silence fell over the room.



To those people, it was a murder.


To Brylee, it was a cocktail of emotions-bitter anger,a sorrow that cut deep, and the painful realization that everything had been one cruel joke.



The trust she'd given, so genuine and pure, had been shattered by nothing more than a self-interested liar with noremorse.



Though Cedric hadn't made a move before, now, he stepped forward, his body heavy with emotion.



Lillian lifted her hand, her voice firm but calm. "This isn't the end, Cedric. You need to put your faith in Daniela." Ryan, too, silently raised his hand, stopping Cedric in his tracks.



Cedric's heart ached for Daniela as he looked at her,his face etched with worry.


Daniela, almost detached, kept eating her orange as if nothing had happened, lifting her chin and asking Caiden,"Any leads on that intermediary?"


Caiden shook his head. "No, but I did overhear someone on the other end refer to him as Mr. Perry during a call."



Mr.Perry again.


"Daniela, I've told you everything," Caiden begged,his voice shaky. "Please, take me to the hospital. No matter what I did, I'm still your father. You can't just let me die, right? I regret it all. I wish I'd been honest with your mother from the start. She was capable, so much better at handling this than | was. I was foolish,too scared to think straight."


Daniela slowly stood and moved towards Caiden,  starting to loosen the ropes that bound him.


As her fingers worked on the knots, she asked, "Did you ever love my mother?"


Caiden nodded quickly. "I did. Of course, I loved her.Your mother was the only real love of my life."


Caiden's face twisted with sincerity, his emotions spilling over as if he were a servant pleading for forgiveness.


"Really? Well, I don't think my mother would've cared," Daniela retorted.



Caiden's face went slack, his gaze locking on Daniela with a mixture of confusion and shock.



"She lived her life with so much pride, carving out a name for herself in the business world. She never let anyone down, not even you. She treated you with nothing but honesty and loyalty. My mother was a gem in this world, and you didn't deserve her."


Caiden's heart skipped a beat, his gut telling him that Daniela wasn't finished just yet. "When you die,I won't bury you next to my mother.I'll put your ashes with Katrina's instead. I hope you two stay tangled together, whether in life or death."


Daniela finished loosening all the ropes and noticed the fear spreading across Caiden's face.


She smiled, the same way Brylee had when they first met Caiden. For a brief moment, Caiden couldn't tell whether it was Daniela or Brylee standing there.



"Don't worry. I'm not going to let you die that easily.Death's too quick for you. Someone like you deserves a lifetime of lonely suffering."


Caiden's eyes went wide with shock. He stared at Daniela with a blend of disbelief and fear. "You can't do this to me. I'm your father!"


Daniela waved her hand dismissively, and the emergency medical team walked in, nodding at her before carefully placing Caiden on a stretcher.


"Don't cure him fully. Once the swelling is down,send him to the remote psychiatric facility. The wounds will keep getting worse in this heat. Just make sure he doesn't die," Daniela instructed calmly."I want him to live a long life."


At last, the shock took its toll, and Caiden passed out completely.


That all happened at Elite Lux's private hospital. As the medical team made their exit, they quietly cleaned up the bloodstains left behind on the floor.


The strong smell of disinfectant hung in the air.


Daniela didn't bother turning on the lights. Instead,she just sat on the sofa, peeling and eating an orange.



Just as she was about to peel another slice, Cedric hurried down from upstairs and stopped right in front of her.
###Chapter 421 Humiliation


Daniela held an unpeeled orange in her hand.

She could feel the turmoil within her, a restless energy clamoring to burst out and tear everything apart.

The faint scent of blood lingered in the air,which oddly excited her.

Suddenly,a shadow fell before her.

Before she could look up, a large hand took the orange from her grasp.

Then, Daniela caught a whiff of a subtle, masculine scent of pine, mingled with the sweet aroma of the orange.

A peeled segment of the fruit was presented to her, and without thinking, she accepted it. As she bit down,a burst of sweetness filled her mouth.

Looking up, Daniela found Cedric under the moonlight.

The scent of orange seemed to weave its way from her tongue to her heart.

"Cedric," Daniela called out in the silence of the villa, her eyes locking with his.

Cedric tilted his head slightly, responding with a soft, "Hmm?"

"Were you frightened?" she asked.

A complex look crossed Cedric's eyes. He held his silence for a moment before drawing Daniela close. "It breaks my heart to see you like this."

Daniela then drifted into a deep sleep.

Concerned for Daniela's well-being, Nina asked Lilian,11|sDaniela going to be alright?"

While watching television, Lillian responded, "She's fine." Despite Lillian's reassurance, Nina remained doubtful. The trauma Daniela had endured was Immense,a burden challenging for anyone to bear. "Should I check on her to make sure she's really okay?°

Lilian, without turning, replied, "She's fine. A good night's sleep will help her."

Nina appeared worried, but Liflian continued, "She's the most mentally tough person in our organization.Plus, she knew what she was getting into. She's used to dealing with shocks like this."

"But understanding something intellectually and living through it are completely different," Nina said. "It's one thing to know my family doesn't care about me, but it feels entirely different when they actually hurt me.And what do you mean by 'organization'? Isn't Elite Lux a company? Why cal it an organization? And why say she's used to it?"

Lillian, still focused on the TV, answered in a flat tone, "Just misspoke. She'll recover with some rest, and Cedric is there to look after her."

Despite Lillian's reassurances, Nina remained skeptical.

So,when she saw Daniela descending the stairs, still groggy, she was shocked.

"Daniela?"

"Hmm?"

"Are you feeling alright?"

"I'm fir<7e111Daniela responded, her hair flowing down her shoulders. She grinned at Josie in the kitchen and said, "Josie, could I get two fried eggs for breakfast?"

Nina watched her, full of admiration.

How could someone heal so quickly from emotional wounds?

Meanwhile, Joyce had returned to the aesthetic clinic.

Doug,having seen Daniela at a recent gathering, said anxiously, "I need to win Daniela over, no matter what it takes," Recently,while making love to Joyce, Doug would call out Daniela's name.

"How much longer until we see results?" Joyce asked the plastic surgeon, clearly frustrated.

Every time she was intimate with Doug and he mentioned Daniela's name, she felt the humiliation.

She was eager to leave that situation behind as quickly as possible.
###Chapter 422 A Brand New Cedric


"How's the progress coming along?" Joyce asked the plastic surgeon with growing impatience.

The surgeon let out a concerned sigh. "Well, people's bone structures do vary, so..."

Without a word, Joyce pulled out a check from her bag and slid it across the table towards the surgeon.

The surgeon eyed the figure on the check with greedy interest, then clapped his hands and smiled.

Through the thick glass, she saw someone being led out.

Joyce froze for a moment, staring at the person inside in disbelief.

The figure in the room was being helped by medical staff, his posture and stance being adjusted.

Joyce remained silent for what felt like forever.

Was that really Alexander?

The surgeon smiled reassuringly at Joyce. "Trust me, we're professionals."

Joyce's gaze flicked from the person inside to the photo of Cedric pinned on the wall, a hidden longing surfacing within her. "Isn't there still something not quite right?"

The surgeon looked at her and nodded. "Yes. Like I said, the skin can be made to match, but there will always be small differences in bone structure. They're barely noticeable unless you look closely,though."

"That's not good enough," Joyce replied, watching as Alexander, still shaky on his feet, was led back into the ward. "It has to be flawless."

"Understood. As I mentioned, we're professionals. But just so you're aware, to make the bone struIcture a perfect match, we'll need to break the original bones and reshape them. It's a long, painful process-far worse than before."

Joyce waved her hand dismissively.told you, money's not the problem. Just make sure he looks exactly like the guy in the photo. No flaws."

The surgeon took the check with a grin. "Also, just so you know, this comes with some serious risks and possible side effects. We'll need the patient's signature to proceed.

Behind the glass, Joyce called out to Alexander, who sat rigidly in a sterile chamber, still not fully recovered.

Without beating around the bush, she simply asked, "Are you really happy with this?"

Tears of pain welled up in Alexander's eyes, and the medical staff by his side quickly wiped them away.

Joyce held his gaze and spoke in a calm tone. "Don't you want to take back what was yours? Can you bear the thought of Daniela and Cedric making love? Can you handle that?"

Alexander, heavily bandaged, could barely manage to hold a pen.

At her words, he didn't hesitate for a second. He signed the agreement without even looking at the surgical notice, which clearly warned: "If the surgery succeeds, the effects will fade in less than a year, and eventually, the face will collapse, becoming hollowed-out."

This time, Joyce didn't rush off right away.

She contacted a top-tier media company nearby and arranged for someone to follow Cedric, filming his every move. They would break down each frame with experts to give Alexander professional training after the surgery.

Her goal was clear-she planned to turn Alexander into a perfect replica of Cedric.

Lately,Cedric couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He constantly felt like someone was watching him.

Whether at public events, press conferences, banquets, or even just dining out, he always felt a pair of eyes trained on him.

After a few days, he realized the person wasn't doing anything other than filming his habits-no attempts to interact, just observing. Daniela noticed it as well.

When she and Cedric went to dine at the new revolving restaurant by Phillips Group, Daniela sensed something wasn't quite right, even before the first dish was served.

At first, she thought someone was just admiring her, so she offered a faint smile in return.

But moments later, she quickly realized that the attention was actually on Cedric.

The smile on her face slowly faded.
###Chapter 423 Shadowpeak Madhouse


Daniela stood up, flashing a smile at Cedric. "I'll be right back, just going to the restroom," she said casually.

As she walked past the tables, her hand shot out to grab a man, bundled up tightly in his coat, and without a second thought, she effortlessly yanked him along with her.

Cedric turned around, only to see the usual diners eating and chatting.

Daniela pulledthe man into the restroom and, before stepping in, hung up a "Under Maintenance" sign on the door.

The man was caught off guard at first, but once he saw Daniela standing in front of him, he seemed to calm down a little.

Despite her immense power and influence, Daniela was alone at that moment. No matter what went down, it wouldn't be anything too serious. The pay for this gig was huge. Even if he lost the job, it wouldn't matter.

"Who sent you?" Daniela asked.

"I came alone," the man said proudly, impressed by Daniela's beauty.

"So,why are you here?"

"I already told you," he said, clearly amused. "I came on my own. Cedric's so famous, I just wanted to see if l could dig up any gossip or scandals."

Daniela's eyes narrowed, her gaze sharp and calculating. She asked coldly, "Really?"

The man nodded, a confident grin spreading across his face. "Of course. Why else would I follow Cedric?I'm not a woman, so I wouldn't be after him like that."

Daniela, clearly uninterested in wasting time, gave a faint smile. "It seems like you're not going to cooperate." The man froze, feeling an unsettling chill crawl up his spine as he caught sight of the smile on Daniela's lips.

Just as the man began to grow more anxious, he heard Daniela say, "Fine, don't say anything then."

He was shocked by her sudden concession, unsure of what to make of her calm attitude.

As he hesitantly tried to step towards the door, Daniela didn't stop him. Instead, she leaned back against the doorframe, with arms crossed and a sneer of disdain curling on her lips.

The man flinched once more, clearly startled.

Just as he was about to leave, Daniela let out a chuckle and said slowly, "Have you ever heard that saying?"

The man turned his head in surprise.

Daniela's red lips curled slightly as she spoke. "You can make a fortune, but if you're dead, none of that money will matter."

The man's heart skipped a beat at her words.

"Go on," Daniela said, her smile growing as she straightened up and began to walk away.

Panicked,the man shouted, "Hey, what do you mean by that?"

"Exactly what it sounds lik⟨e111Daniela replied with a smile that seemed to deepen.

But the man's smile faded instantly, and his arrogance evaporated.

Fear overtook him, and he stared at Daniela with wide eyes. "What do you mean? You have to explain yourself!"

Standing in the restaurant hallway, Daniela smiled as a breeze swept in through the open window.

Her expression stayed calm and collected, her voice as casual as if she were commenting on the weather."Have you ever heard of Shadowpeak Madhouse?"

The moment the words left her mouth, the man felt a chill crawl up his spine, goose bumps rising on his arm. "A few days ago, I sent Caiden there. I'm visiting him tomorrow. The hospital says he's lonely and needs a roommate. I think you'll fit in perfectly."

The man's legs gave out, and he dropped to his knees with a heavy thud.

Shadowpeak Madhouse was infamous for housing the most violent and vengeful patients. It was rumored that those who entered alive were never seen the same again.

"I was wrong! I swear, I was just after money, I meant no harm. I was only filming Cedric's daily habits,that's all," the man said in a shaky voice.

He extended his phone towards her with trembling hands.

Daniela opened the photo album, and her eyes scanned the screen. It was indeed just videos of Cedric's everyday life."Why film this? Who's pulling the strings here?"

The man wiped the sweat from his brow and quickly said, "I don't know. They contacted me online. Every time I sent a video, they paid me. I've never met the person. When I asked about their intentions, they got cautious and told me to stop askingor they'd stop working with me."

Daniela went through the chat history on the phone and saw the man was telling the truth. She snapped,"Leave!"

The man glanced at the phone in her hand."What about my phone?"

With a knowing look, Daniela raised the phone slightly."You want it?"

The man quickly closed his mouth and began to walk away, looking embarrassed.

Daniela gave a quick nod to Lillian, who was standing at the end of the hallway, and then said, "Give him ten thousand."

As Daniela slipped the phone into her pocket, she walked back to her table.

When she sat back down, Cedric served her some food and asked, "What took you so long?"

Keeping calm, Daniela answered, "The restroom was out of order, so I went upstairs."Cedric nodded but then hesitated. He realized the gaze that had been following him was now gone.

He stopped mid-bite, fork in hand, and looked at Daniela's face. Something about her calmness made him suspect that she might have something to do with it.

After dinner, they went back home.

While Daniela was in the shower, Cedric asked for the restaurant's restroom surveillance footage.

The footage showed an "Under Maintenance" sign outside the restroom.

Moments later, Daniela appeared on the screen, walking up the stairs.

Cedric frowned, wondering if he was just imagining things.

Meanwhile, Daniela sat on a small stool in the bathroom, watching the edited footage with a faint smile.
###Chapter 424 Let's Have A Baby


Daniela plugged the phone she had taken from the man at the restaurant into her laptop.

She scrolled through the photos and videos again, confirming they were just clips of Cedric's daily routíne.

What could these recordings be for?

She clicked on the first contact and opened the chat with the ID labeled"b."

Mimicking the man's previous tone, she typed, "Hello. I have today's video ready. Should I send it now?"

There was no reply right away.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a new message.

It was from Hurst Craig at the mental hospital."Ms. Harper, Caiden wants to meet with you."

As Daniela typed a response, the phone connected to the laptop buzzed."b"had replied with a simple,"Yes."

First, Daniela sent a voice message to Hurst, saying,"Okay."

Then,she sent the blurry video of Cedric.

The person on the other end quickly transferred $15 thousand to her account.

Daniela accepted the payment, but then saw an angry emoji followed by,"Are you scamming me? Look at the video you sent today. It's barely watchable!"

Danielå typed back, "Today's video is a bit blurry, but | did my best. Cedric is very cautious, so I can't get too close. I'll make sure tomorrow's is better."

Another angry.emoji came through, along with a message. "If tomorrow's quality is the same, I'll find someone else." Daniela, copying the man's tone, replied with a feigned sense of worry, "Okay, okay. But why do you need so many of Cedric's daily videos? You're not planning anything illegal, are you?"

The other side went quiet. Daniela leaned back in her chair, waiting for a response.

Five minutes later, a reply came. "Don't ask so many questions if you want to make money!"

As Daniela read the message on the phone screen, she couldn't shake the feeling that it seemed familiar.

She typed again, "When I was filming Cedric today, Daniela happened to be there. Both she and Cedric are very powerful. I only want to make money, but it feels like I'm risking my life."

Once she sent the message, the other side stayed quiet for a while.

Ten minutes later, a reply appeared. "It's not anything illegal."

Daniela thought for a moment.

Then,she quickly typed some commands on her computer, and within seconds, she had gained access to the other person's account.

She found that the only contact they had was the man, with no other personal details that could be useful.

A smirk played on Daniela's lips.

They were certainly cautious.

She glanced at the sparse conversation history, and once again, that sense of familiarity returned.

Just as she was about to check her phone for any connections, a knock came from outside the bathroom door.

"Honey, are you finished?"

Daniela glanced up at the door and responded,"Nearly."

"Come on, hurry up! I've got a new massage technique I learned today.It's really good."

Daniela smiled, closed the laptop, took a quick shower, and stepped out of the bathroom. Even after all this time, Cedric still loved spending every moment with Daniela.

When she came out of the bathroom, Cedric was already there, his cheerful smile a stark contrast to the serious CEO he was at work.

"Why did it take you so long today?" he asked.

"I stayed in the bath a little longer."

Cedric pulled Daniela close, his arms around her, resting his head against her neck. His voice was low and husky as he whispered, "Honey, let's have a baby. What do you think?"

Daniela was startled, and her body shook in surprise. "What?"

Her reaction made Cedric pull back, sensing something was off."Why? Don't you want to have a child with me?"

Since their last argument,Cedric had learned something important about Daniela.

He knew he couldn't be more ruthless than her, but he also knew that if he was gentle with her, she'd find it hard to say no.

Recently,he had come across a saying that struck a chord with him. "To keep a womarl by your side for life,having a child is essential."

He wholeheartedly agreed with it and was now set on making it a reality.

He longed to have a baby with Daniela, believing that would ensure the best person in the world-Daniela-would always be by his side.

Later that night, Daniela felt completely drained. She was usually in great shape, but even she felt overwhelmed by the intensity of their intimacy.

Just before she lost consciousness, she looked at Cedric through the soft glow of the bedside lamp.

His abs were slick with sweat, his V-line and toned waist standing out in the dim light.

His intense gaze was locked onto hers as his lips met hers, and in that moment, Daniela couldn't help but wonder if Cedric was really focused on having a baby with her, or if his goal was just to wear her out completely.
###Chapter 425 When Is Daniela Coming


Daniela had spent the whole day sleeping.

Upon waking, she instinctively checked her phone.

Hurst had tried calling her multiple times, but eventually, he seemed to give up and sent a few messages.

"Weren't you supposed to visit Shadowpeak Madhouse today? Where are you? I've been waiting for you all morning."

"I heard from Lillian that you're stil resting."

"Cedric is also taking a break."

"Ah, youth is such a gift. Take your time with the baby-making. I'm not in a rush."

Daniela shut her eyes for a brief second.

As she set her phone aside, a smiling face appeared beside her.

"How are you feeling?" People often said Cedric had a distant air, but now, his eyes were full of warmth as he gazed at Daniela.

Daniela's thoughts were a bit clouded, her voice raspy. "Hmm? What do you mean by that?"

Cedric placed his hand on Daniela's flat stomach. "Do you think there's a baby in there yet?"

Daniela let out a quiet sigh.

Love had the power to make people mature, yet also keep them young at heart.

Daniela found it amusing. She waved her finger, and Cedric leaned in, following her gesture. "Hmm?"

Daniela parted her lips and whispered in Cedric's ear, "I'm not sure if there's a baby growing inside me, but l can be your baby forever." "You and Cedric have been together fot so long. Why are you two still so lovey-dovey?" Lillian said from the dining table, looking at Cedric.

Daniela glanced at Cedric and smiled. "You haven't gotten married, so you wouldn't understand the pleasures of being married."

Lilian nodded and laughed, "Marriage can be pretty scary," she remarked, then paused, noticing something."Did you see that? His ears are all red!"

Daniela tapped Lillian's plate with her fork. "Stop teasing my hubby."

Lillian's fork dropped to the floor with a clang. "Did you just call him 'hubby'?"

Cedric,who had been enjoying the moment just moments ago, suddenly snapped back to reality. Before Daniela could answer, he remarked, "What? Do you have an issue with that? We're married, so it's only natural for her to call me her hubby."

In fact, he found it incredibly sweet when Daniela called him that.

Lillian let out an exaggerated sigh, tired of their constant public displays of affection.

After dinner, Daniela had planned to visit Shadowpeak Madhouse, but Cedric was being overly clingy.

He sprawled comfortably across her lap, watching TV with a satisfiedgrin.

Daniela smiled and sent a text to Hurst. "Not coming tonight."

Hurst's response came almost immediately. "Huh?Why not?"

Daniela looked at Cedric and said, "My hubby is being a little clingy."

Hurst was left speechless.

Lillian clicked her tongue, shaking her head. "No wonder they say beauty can be so distracting. Cedric's definitely like a seductive temptress."

Daniela was more than happy to indulge him, and no one could object. Meanwhile, at the Shadowpeak Madhouse, Caiden was slowly losing his grip on reality.

This was one of the top mental institutions in the country, but he felt like he had reached his breaking point.

"When is Daniela coming?" he shouted over and over, his frustration growing.

The place was nothing like any other mental hospital-there were no indivídual rooms. Everyone was packed together in one big space.

The guards didn't care about keeping order.

If someone got hurt or even killed, it was just bad luck for them.

After all, people in mental hospitals weren't held responsible for their actions.

That was the grim warning Hurst had given Caiden when he first arrived.

Caiden had been stuck in this place for three days, and each day, he was beaten relentlessly. Surrounded by madmen, he honestly felt like he was losing his sanity.

"When is Daniela coming?" Caiden screamed in anger.

"How dare you speak her name?"

Before Hurst could reply, Caiden turned and saw a group of men glaring at him, their eyes cold and menacing.

That night, he almost came close to losing his life in that hellhole.
###Chapter 426 She Wants Harper family To Break Up Completely


The following morning, as Daniela began her workday, her phone rang with a call from Hurst.

Natalie was by the doorway, appearing to keep busy, yet her focus was entirely on Daniela as she listened in with keen interest.

Daniela was aware but remained unfazed, keeping her composure.

She answered the call with,a simple, "Hello?"

"Daniela, will you be coming by today?" Hurst asked.

"What's the matter?"

"Caiden says he'll take his own life if you don't show up."

At these words, Natalie's actions halted, her expression showing more concern than Daniela's.

"Just ignore him," Daniela replied casually.

Caiden then became franticon the line. "Daniela! I am your father. How can you just let me die?"

Daniela, uninterested, ended the call abruptly.

Observing Daniela's composed demeanor, Natalie silently judged her as cold-hearted, especially towards her own father.

Natalie's face took on a thoughtful expression as she pondered what Daniela's vulnerability might be.

"Danieļa, what was that about just now?" Natalie asked, feigning ignorance.

With a chuckle, Daniela leaned back and flashed a knowing half-smile. "Didn't you hear it all?"

Natalie offered. a sheepish smile in return. She had encountered many sly individuals, but Daniela's blunt honesty was unfamiliar to her. "Have you confined Caiden?" Daniela's smile broadened. "He's sick."

"What kind of illness?"

Daniela slowly raised her eyes, her relaxed demeanor masking an underlying threat, reminiscent of a lion ready to pounce. "I'm visiting him after work. Will you join me?"

Natalie was visibly surprised. "May I come along?"

She was baffled by Daniela's frankness. How could she discuss such matters so openly?

"Of course, or perhaps you'd like to bring your mother along?"

Natalie had been anxious about how to involve Elyse, but Daniela had effortlessly opened the door for her.

Just days earlier, news of Caiden's illness had taken them by surprise. Unable to glean details from Nina,they wondered if Daniela had placed Caiden under house arrest.

If so, what could Daniela's motives possibly be?

Did Daniela find out that Brylee's death was a murder?

That seemed illogical.

Following Katrina's death, that ###Chapter should have closed.

Daniela appeared to have no grounds for suspecting Caiden.

With these thoughts, both Elyse and Natalie felt somewhat disturbed.

Now, Daniela's invitation to visit Caiden seemed like an ideal chance to clear their doubts.

Leaving the office with a bright smile, Natalie bumped into Nina. "Daniela is taking me and Mom to see Caiden today.Are you coming,too?"

Nina answered coldly, "What? Are you trying to show this off in front of me?"

Natalie felt a surge of satisfaction. She was convinced that Daniela had no suspicions, or else why would she allow them to see Caiden? People often grew overconfident when they felt secure.

"You're staying with the Harper family, right? So, Daniela is going to see Caiden today and didn't invite you?It looks like you're not that close after all."

Nina remembered the day Daniela had been exceptionally harsh with Caiden, and she still shivered at the thought.

Despite Daniela's outward genteness, her inner fierceness was something few men could match.

What repercussions might Natalie and Elyse encounter after their visit to Caiden?

She was quite eager to witness their reactions upon meeting Caiden.

"You're right. I'm not that close with Daniela. Enjoy your visit to Caiden, then."

Natalie's smile stiffened momentarily.

Nina had been at odds with her since the failed wedding.Why was she suddenly being so accommodating?

Disturbed by this, Natalie spoke to Elyse about it.

With a laugh, Elyse responded, "Natalie, you worry too much.How could Daniela possibly connect us to Brylee's death? Unless Katrina comes back to life, your fears are unfounded. Daniela is just a young woman.What secrets could she possibly uncover? If she had discovered anything, could she have remained so cordial with us all this time?"

Natalie's unease lingered, and she asked, "But what if she has found out something?"

Elyse's look turned even more scornful. "So what? Brylee has been dead for so long. What could Daniela do to us now? Caiden is involved as well. Now that he's sick, she still has to ensure he receives medical care.Would ®Daniela really alienate us over something that happened to Brylee? If she cuts ties, she'll end up isolated. Plus, does she have any proof linking us to Brylee's death?"

Elyse shook her head, smiling confidently at Natalie. "Dear, you give Daniela too much credit. She might be a competent CEO, but she's just a woman. She's not capable of causing us any serious trouble." These words somewhat calmed Natalie.

In any case, if it came down to Brylee's death,Caiden was mainly at fault.

Caiden was Daniela's father. Even if she was upset, would she really take extreme measures against him for someone who had passed away so long ago?

Unless she wanted the Harper family to break up completely.
###Chapter 427 Family With Caiden


As the workday drew to a close, Elyse arrived at Elite Lux.

Before she went upstairs to see Daniela, she turned to Natalie with a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. Daniela may be tough, but she's not tougher than Brylee was. Remember, Brylee was once the wealthiest woman in the country, and yet, she still met her end."

Right after Elyse spoke, the elevator doors slid open in front of her.

Daniela was inside.

The smile instantly vanished from Elyse's face, and her thoughts scrambled.

Had Daniela overheard her?

The assurance Elyse felt just seconds before drained away. She asked tentatively,"Daniela, what brings you down here?"

Daniela responded simply, "We're going to see Caiden."

Elyse trailed behind her and entered the car.

She took a seat in the back with Daniela, while Natalie sat up front.

Throughout the drive, Elyse stole glances at Daniela, searching her expression for any sign of emotion.

However, Daniela's face was so composed that Elyse couldn't determine if she had caught any of their earlier conversation by the elevator.

Natalie, noticing Elyse's nervous movements in the rearview mirror, looked over at Daniela.

After a moment's hesitation, she smiled and said, "Daniela, how is Caiden doing? Mom and I are quite concerned about him. Even though your mother is gone, Mom and I still feel like we're family with Caiden."

Daniela turned her gaze to the window. The orange streetlights outside bathed her face in a cold, detached light.

After Natalie finished her statement, she shared a quick look with Elyse, then continued with a smile,"Daniela, you know, just before we got on the elevator, Mom and I were discussing the mother of a classmate of mine. She was a lot like Aunt Brylee,such a capable woman."

Natalie aimed to redirect their earlier conversation, implying they had been speaking about someone else,not actually Brylee.

Daniela, however, did not respond.

Natalie caught a glimpse of the back of Daniela's head, felt a sinking feeling, and looked away.

The car continued its journey, ascending the winding mountain road.

They left the bustling streets of the city and ventured into a more isolated road.

As they approacheda particularly dark stretch without streetlights, Natalie's unease grew. "Daniela, we are going to see Caiden, right?"

Daniela remained silent.

As Elyse peered into the dark night outside, her anxiety intensified. "Daniela, where are we heading?"

Daniela placed her hands on her knees and replied, "We're on our way to see Caiden."

The night deepened, and the surrounding scenery grew increasingly barren and sinister.

Elyse scrutinized Daniela, catching glimpses of her face in the sporadic moonlight, revealing a chilling,almost dangerous sharpness.

"But this doesn't seem like the route to any hospital," Elyse said, her voice filled with alarm as she gripped the seat in front of her.

In the enveloping darkness, Daniela chuckled lightly.

The sound was haunting, filled with a clear threat. Natalie's heart raced, her voice quivering as she asked, "Daniela, wheré éxactly are you taking us?"

In the faint light streaming in, Daniela turned to face them.

Their expressions were etched with real terror, as though they had just grasped the full meaning of fear.

Daniela seemed entertained by this. "Aunt Elyse, why are you frightened? If your conscience is clear, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. You're a righteous person, aren't you? What could possibly scare you?"

Elyse was caught off guard. She wasn't sure whether Daniela's comments were pointed or merely offhand,but they unsettled her.

"I'm not scared," Elyse said, clenching herjaw."What reason do I have to be frightened? I haven't done anything shameful. And surely, your mother is looking out for me from heaven. After all, I was her sister."

Just then, the car came to a stop.

Daniela opened the door and announced to those inside, "We've arrived."

Elyse instantly turned her head, her heart racing with anxiety.

What was this place?

An eerie, flickering light cast unsettling shadows around them. The entrance sign was askew, its letters hard to decipher.

With reluctance, Elyse got out of the car, clutching Natalie's hand firmly. She nudged the entrance sign with her foot.

Clang! The abrupt sound made them both startle.

Elyse quickly took out her phone, using the flashlight to illuminate the ground.

The sign read "Shadowpeak Madhouse."

The last letter·was barely visible due to weathering, while the other letters were painted in a disturbing shade of what looked like red paint or perhaps dried blood, adding to the ominous atmosphere. "Daniela, what on earth is this place?" Elyse asked, her voice shaking.

Daniela regarded their frightened faces with contempt. "Didn't you say you wanted to see Caiden? He's inside. Let's go."
###Chapter 428 Daniela Is More Ruthless Than Brylee


Elyse's eyes widened in disbelief. "You're telling me Caiden is here? In a mental hospital? Why would your father be in such a place?"

Daniela had already entered before Elyse could complete her thought.

A gust of wind at the entrance made the light above sway ominously. Elyse realized they were isolated in the desolate surroundings.

She clenched her hand tighter and hastened inside with Nina's support.②

The chilling wind screamed into the darkness.

"This place is unsettling. I'm covered in goosebumps," Elyse murmured to Nina, feeling uneasy.

Their conversation was interrupted by a distant scream, accelerating their steps to catch up with Daniela.

Elyse called out, "Daniela, what caused your father's sudden illness? Were the medical checks comprehensive?"

Without a word, Daniela ascended the stairs, her silence thickening the air around them.

The dim lights threw unsettling shadows across the room. Each step was accompanied by the sound of labored breathing, heavy and ominous.

It was as if a wild beast lurked in the darkness, silently watching their every move.

The click of Nina's high heels echoed ominously off the sterile floors, amplifying the tension.

"Daniela, have we arrived?" Elyse asked.

In the enveloping darkness, Daniela halted and turned to them with a chilling smile

The sight drained the color from Elyse's face. For a fleeting second, she thought she saw Brylee.

Daniela's voice then cut through the heavy silence.

"Aunt,what scares you so?"

Elyse was about to dismiss her fears, but Daniela continued down the corridor before she could respond.

Leading them to the end of the hallway, Daniela stopped at a room divided by a glass partition, reminiscent of a prison visitation area.

They positioned themselves on one side of the glass partition as Caiden was escorted into view from the opposite side.

The moment Caiden came into sight, Elyse and Nina were struck motionless.

Could this really be Caiden?

"Daniela!" Caiden's voice was filled with desperation as he pounded on the glass, his actions reminiscent of a trapped beast. "Release me!"

Daniela observed silently, her expression one of chilling detachment, as Caiden, his head shaved and body marred by injuries, continued to yell. "Daniela! Let me go! I'm not mad! I'mn your father; you cannot do this to me! Let me out!"

The quiet of the night was shattered by Caiden's pained cries.

The guards forcibly restrained him, commencing a brutal beating with a baton right before Elyse and Nina.

The grim sound of the baton connecting with flesh was distinct and unsettling.

They ceased only when Caiden collapsed to the floor, a mere shadow of himself, gasping for air like a discarded puppet.

Elyse and Nina, immobilized by shock, witnessed the scene in utter disbelief while Daniela looked on,unaffected.

"Daniela," Elyse said tremulously, indicating the fallen Caiden. "Did you not hear? He claims he is sound of mind."

Daniela's laugh, cold and resonating oddly in the stark room, filled the air.

"Aunt, it's common for those afflicted with mental disorders to believe they are well," Daniela responded,locking eyes with Elyse. "Were you aware? My father is indeed insane. He even alleges that my mother's death was actually a homicide."

At those words, Elyse became completely numb. Her thoughts ceased. She could no longer remember how to even muster a smile.

A nervous chuckle was all that Elyse could muster. "How is that possible? But the police said it was suicide."

The corners of Daniela's mouth turned up slightly, seemingly enjoying the gravity of the revelation. "That's precisely why I'm convinced he's lost his mind. He needs professional care. Don't you agree, Aunt?"

Elyse felt a pang in her chest. "Indeéd, you're right. Caiden must be suffering from a severe mental disorder!"

Daniela's smile radiated a chilling beauty. "Did I ever mention? I had cut off all ties with my father years ago.Yet,upon realizing his condition, I reconsidered. I've since renewed our bond. It turns out, that only a direct relative can commit someone here. Isn't that the hallmark of a devoted daughter?"

A cold shiver ran through Elyse.

Daniela turned slightly to look at Caiden, who was still prone on the floor.

She told her father, "This way, we remain bonded as father and daughter, just as you always wished, right?"

Caiden, drained of all resistance, his eyes brimming with despair, was helplessly dragged away

Daniela turned her gaze to Elyse and Natalie, observing their ashen faces.

During the silent drive back to the city, Elyse and Natalie shuddered in their fine garments, overwhelmed by their thoughts.

It became starkly clear to them that Daniela bore no resemblance to Brylee. ndeed, Daniela was infinitely more cold-hearted and calculating than Brylee ever was.
###Chapter 429 Who Killed My Mother


The car stopped in front of a grand villa.

Elyse managed a tight smile, speaking to Daniela with hesitation."Wllwe should be going now."

She reached for the door handle, but the car door wouldn't budge.

Surprised, she glanced back at Daniela.

As Daniela's face was hidden in the shadows, Elyse's heart skipped a beat. After a long, tense pause, she finally asked, "Daniela, why won't the car door open?"

The only response was silence-an unnerving, heavy silence that filled the car.

Elyse's shock deepened as her hands, resting on her knees, began to tremble."Daniela?"

The streetlights outside flickered to life with a sudden snap, revealing Daniela's cold, striking face.

Elyse's heart tightened once again.

In that moment, she felt as though Daniela knew everything.

She desperately wished it was just her imagination running wild.

Just as Elyse was about to speak, unable to endure the silence any longer, Daniela's soft voice cut through."Aunt, this villa you're living in now was bought by my mother, wasn't it?"

One by one, the lights outside flickered on, illuminating the night.

"Yes, your mother gave it to me as a gift. She knew how tough things were with my in-laws and offered this villa as a form of future support."

Daniela nodded, her gaze drifting towards the grand villa at the heart of the residential area. "I recall you managed to divorce your ex-husband without much hassle and secured custody of both children, all thanks to this villa, am I right?" Elyse, unsure of why Daniela had raised this topic, felt a mix of anxiety and fear. "Yes, I'm very grateful to your mother."

The soft light touched Danielá's face, and Elyse hoticed a sarcástic smnile appear on her lips.

Her heart raced as she watched Daniela. She asked,something wrong?"

Daniela answered quietly, "No, just thinking about my mother. She had a tragic end."

Elyse paused for a moment, then let out a strained sigh."Ah,yes..." she replied, her throat tightening.

"Aunt, do you still remember what my mother looked like?"

Elyse replied, "Of course."

Daniela smiled faintly. "But I can hardly remember. I was so young back then. Despite my efforts, her image slips away a little more each day."

Elyse was speechless, unsure of how to reply.

Just as she opened her mouth, Daniela went on, "I really envy Natalie. She still has her mother with.her.Even without a partner all these years, you've done a great job raising two kids."

Elyse couldn't quite tell if Daniela was offering praise or criticizing her. She could only look at Danielprofile,lost in thought.

Unexpectedly, the car door clicked open.

Elyse placed her hand on the door handle. "We'll be going now. Natalii1let's go."

Normally, with Elyse's emotional awareness, she would have said something comforting, but the events of the night had left her too shaken. She needed to escape the heavy atmosphere as quickly as possible.

The car door swung open, allowing the cold wind to rush in.

Elyse pulled her coat tighter around her and prepared to step out.

"Aunt, do you think Caiden was right? Was my mother really murdered?" Daniela's voice was soft but piercing.

in that instant, Elyse froze completely.

Her head snapped around in shock, staring at Daniela, unable to believe what she had just heard.

Daniela, who had been staring out the window, now faced her, her cold gaze locking onto hers.

Her red lips parted slightly as she asked, "Aunt, if it was murder, who do you think killed my mother?"
###Chapter 430 If There Is No Opportunity,Then Create One


Elyse stood frozen,completely paralyzed by fear.

Natalie quickly stepped out of the car, rushing to support Elyse, who looked like she was about to collapse.

"Daniela, you're overthinking this. There's no way it was murder. So many people saw your mother jump from the building that day. You saw it too, didn't you? And your father is insane. How could anyone take the words of a madman seriously?"

Daniela's sharp gaze moved from Elyse to Natalie. "Natalie."

Natalie straightened."Yes?"

"Over the years, while you were abroad; your mother always said how hard you worked. I've been busy, and honestly, I've felt guilty about that. My mother really liked you. She once told me she wanted to cover all your school expenses. So, was it difficult for you? Did you struggle to afford your studies?"

For the briefest second, something flickered in Natalie's eyes. "It was fine."

Daniela's lips curled into a cold smile. Without another word, she straightened and turned to the driver."Marco,take me home."

The car slipped into the darkness, disappearing down the road.

As Elyse watched it drive away, she fell to the ground.

Later, frantically stuffing valuables into a bag, Elyse murmured,"Daniela knows something. I'm sure of it! We have to leave-right now. If we disappear, she'll never be able to find anything."

Standing off to the side, Natalie retorted, "She has no proof. Even if she's onto something, she can't do anything without evidence. And think about it-if she really knew the truth, would she still be this calm? At most, she's just suspicious."

Elyse's panic only grew. "Just suspicious? How can you be so sure? Think about what she did today-taking us to see Caiden,testing us with all those questions, and then making that veiled threat. She's using Caiden as a warning-she's telling us to surrender!"

Natalie scoffed. "I don't care what Daniela thinks. Mom, you were able to kill Brylee, take control of Harper Group, and fund my studies and luxurious life abroad. Now, I have the ambition and confidence to get rid of Daniela, seize control of Elite Lux, and rise to the top. I'll make sure the Dury family enjoys wealth for generations."

Elyse studied Natalie's resolute expression and sighed. "This time, it won't be so simple."

Daniela got home late that night and found Cedric already waiting for her. "Where were you? You took so long." He knelt down and change her shoes.

Nina walked downstairs and froze in shock. Her eyes widened in disbelief.

As strong as Cedric was, he was always so humble around Daniela.

But Daniela wasn't surprised-she was already used to it.

The moment he straightened up, Daniela threw herself into his arms.

Cedric chuckled, and she leaned in, aiming for a kiss.

But he playfully dodged, making her stretch onto her tiptoes. He laughed and turned his head away just in time.

Refusing to give up, Daniela chased after him, but this time, Cedric suddenly leaned down and gave her a deep,silent kiss.

Standing at the staircase, Nina saw everything.

After their playful moment, Cedric wrapped his arms around Daniela's waist and asked with a smile,you tired now?"

Daniela gave a small nod. "Yeah."

Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms and carried her upstairs. As they passed Nina, he didn't
spare her a glance-it was as if Daniela was the only persor in his world.

The door clicked shut, and only then did Nina shift her gaze away.

The following morning, when Daniela arrived at the office, Natalie was already there. She saw Daniela and called out, "Daniela."

Daniela raised her head, her voice steady and clear. "This is the office. You should address me as Ms.Harper."

Natalie, clearly reluctant, pursed her lips and complied. "Ms. Harper."

Daniela didn't say a word or even glance at Natalie.

Natalie, full of pride, was furious and spent the entire morning fuming with anger.

Linden walked up to Natalie, his voice affectionate as he called her"honey" and reached out for her hand.

Despite the wave of disgust she felt, Natalie allowed him to hold her hand for the first time. With a cold,piercing gaze aimed at Daniela's office, Natalie turned to Linden and asked bluntly,"When can you get rid of Daniela?"

Linden's eyes lingered on Natalie's neck with desire. "How about giving me more?"

Natalie quickly brushed off his hand, glaring at him with clear disgust. "That's enough. I've already slept with you twice,but what have you done for me? Daniela is still safe and sound!"

Linden rushed to comfort her, trying to close the gap.

Natalie pulled her hand away coldly. "If you're not willing to do anything for me, then we should end this.We're nothing but strangers."

Linden's face fell, his voice desperate. "Give me one more chance. I swear I'll make a move!"

Fuming,Natalie snapped, "Enough! Don't waste my time. If you can truly handle Daniela, then maybe I'll be with you more, but if you're just fooling me, I'll be disgusted by even being near you!"

Feeling a bit frustrated, Linden said, "I want to make a move, but Daniela's never asked for my help as her family doctor, not even once."

Natalie's gaze deepened as she heard his words. "If there's no opportunity, then create one."

Staring at Natalie's breast, Linden nodded eagerly. "Alright."
###Chapter 431 Manipulate Everyone Around Her


Even though Natalie had made many attempts to harm Daniela, Lillian had been on high alert.

Natalie had never succeeded once.

"Nina, could you please deliver this cup of coffeeto Daniela? I'm feeling unwell." Holding her stomach,Nataliemade her request.

Nina gave Natalie a look and asked, "Do youhonestly believe we're that close?"

Just as Natalie was about to reply, Nina interrupted her, "Stop calling yourself my sister; it's disgusting. No true sister would send her own sibling to a man's bed or ruin her marriage."

Natalie was frustrated by Nina's resistance. But she needed Nina's assistance. She needed Nina to deliver this coffee to Daniela.

Without Daniela in the way, she could take over Elite Lux.

And without Nina, the Dury family's wealth could be hers.

She could accomplish two goals with a single action.

"Nina, I admit I was wrong. Please, help your sister out and take this coffee to Daniela. I really don't feel well."

Nina stared at the coffee, hesitated for a moment, then offered a smile. "Alright. But first, you owe me an apology."

Natalie frowned."What?"

Nina requested, "Just say, 'I'm sorry, Nina. I made a mistake. I should not have teamed up with Elyse to trick you into believing that it was Cedric at the hotel that night when it was actually Linden. It was wrong of me to set up my sister like that. I acknowledge my fault.!" Natalie scoffed, "What do you mean? Areyou still upset about something that happened so long ago?Do you even belong to the Dury family?"

With a sarcastic smile, Nina answered, "Do you still see me as part of the Dury family? You certainly didn't hesitate to set me up. Are you going to apologize or not? If not, I'm leaving." With those words, she turned to leave.

"Wait, stop! Okay, I'll say it."

Nina gave a small smile and turned her back to Elyse, quietly pressing the record button on her phone.

Lillian walked past from a distance, observing the scene, yet she remained silent as she walked into Daniela's office.

In the corridor, Natalie mimicked Nina's earlier words with a dismissive and condescending tone. "I'm sorry,Nina. I made a mistake. I should not have teamed up with Elyse to trick you into believing that it was Cedric at the hotel that night when it was actually Linden. It was wrong of me to set up my sister like that.I acknowledge my fault."

Natalie's voice carried a sneering and arrogant tone.

She looked at Nina with disrespect, a deep sense of superiority rising within her.

She noticed Nina recording but remained calm.

What harm could a recording do?

What could Nina really accomplish?

Not even Daniela had control over her. Nina was destined to remain her tool forever.

As long as Nina managed to get this cup of coffee to Daniela, the control of Elite Lux and Harper Group would be in her hands.

After capturing the confession on her phone, Nina carried the coffee into Daniela's office.

Daniela was there, seated. Nina set the cup on the coffee table and passed some papers to Daniela. "Cousin,these documents require your signature today."

Lillian, seated next to the table, picked up the coffee cup. Nina, observing from a distance, was alarmed."Hey! Don't drink that!"

She tossed the coffee into a nearby trash can.

Lillian turned to Nina, who quickly explained, "Natalie asked me to take this to Daniela. I'm sure it's poisoned. She planned to make Daniela ill, hoping Linden would step in somehow."

Natalie was cunning. She preferred not to involve herself in such schemes.

Nina felt uneasy, but upon turning her gaze back, she noticed Lillian seemed completely undisturbed.

Meanwhile, Daniela was signing the documents, her lips curled into a subtle smile.

Nina was confused."Daniela?"

Without raising her eyes, Daniela replied, "Lillian was merely testing you."

"What?" Nina exclaimed.

Daniela then instructed Nina, "Take the empty cup out and inform Natalie that I've drunk the coffee you brought."

Nina remained confused. Yet, she nodded obediently, picked up the empty coffee cup, and left.

Natalie stood by the door, her face showing a mix of nervousness and anticipation. "How did it go?" she asked.

Still feeling confused and a bit shocked, Nina replied, "What?"

Natalie's impatience grew. "The coffee!"

Nina answered, "She drank it. Didn't you ask me to bring it to her? Or am I mistaken?"

Natalie's face broke into a gratified smile. "Yes, yes! Nina, you finally did something right." With those words, Natalie rushed downstairs. Nina guessed she was heading to inform Linden to prepare to come up.

Natalie was utterly merciless. She was manipulating everyone around her while keeping up appearances of innocence.
###Chapter 432 Revenge


Daniela had just mentioned feeling a touch under the weather in her office when Linden walked in.

"Ms. Harper, are you feeling a bit off-color?" he inquired.

Daniela, leaning her elbow on the desk, pressed her fingertips to her temples."|′V suddenly come over a bit dizzy."

Linden's eyes lit up at her words. He exchanged a quick, knowing glance with Natalie, who stood nearby."It's likely nothing serious. Let me have a look. Perhaps you've caught a bit of a cold."

Lillian stood nearby, arms crossed, radiating an icy disapproval with silence.

Linden felt a surge of triumph. Usually, it was like navigating a minefield trying to get close to Daniela,but now, with.her feeling unwell, everyone would have to defer to him, the doctor.

"Ms. Harper, let's check your blood pressure," Linden offered, his gaze lingering on Daniela with a hint of affection.

Daniela possessed a more refined, almost regal air compared to Natalie. Though they shared a striking resemblance, the pride and aloofness that shimmered in Daniela's eyes were qualities Natalie could only dream of.

Linden, completely mesmerized by Daniela, seemed to have forgotten the presence of others.

Narrowing her eyes, Natalie asked, "Howis Daniela?"

Linden, still lost in the labyrinth of Daniela's beauty, felt his heart do a little tap dance.

If he could be with Daniela, he'd gladly pay any price, even his own life.

Natalie, standing aside, gritted her teeth. How could Linden be acting like a lovesick puppy at a time like this? Could he get dumber?

She marched over and gave Linden a hearty slap on the back, nearly sending him sprawling.

Linden, visibly annoyed, turned to meet Natalie's warning stare.

"Oh, it's just a minor thing, a slight cold. A little medicine will do the trick."

Linden retrieved the prepared medicine from his kit and, with a flourish, presented it to Daniela with both hands.

"Nina," Daniela called out. "Please prepare this medicine for me."

Nina nodded, a flicker of worry crossing her face, suspecting Linden might have tampered with it. But since Daniela had spoken, she trusted her judgment and complied.

After preparing the concoction, Nina handed the cup to Daniela and stepped back.

Natalie, standing nearby, watched Daniela intently as she raised the cup to her lips.

"Aren't you two leaving?" Daniela inquired, pausing mid-sip.there something else?"

Natalie's eyes darted towards the cup near Daniela's lips, a mix of excitement and nervousness swirling within her.

"We're on our way. Go ahead and finish your medicine, and then we can all breathe easy," Natalie replied,her smile a tad too bright.

Daniela returned the smile. Then, right before Natalie's very eyes, she downed the medicine in one smooth gulp.

Natalie's heart, which had been doing the cha-cha, finally relaxed at the sight of the empty cup.

A triumphant smile spread across her face, her whole demeanor radiating a sense of smug satisfaction.

She and Linden exited the office, and as they left, she glanced back at Daniela, noticing that her complexion seemed to have taken a turn for the worse. Once Natalie and Linden were gone, the office door clicking shut behind them, Nina let out a long sigh of relief.

She putled the medicine Linden had given her from her pocket. "Daniela,you had me scared stiff."

Daniela gave a faint smile. "What was there to be afraid of?"

Nina replied, "I was terrified of getting caught."

Daniela explained, "In this office, the person Natalie trusts implicitly is you. By having you prepare the medicine, Natalie was already convinced she'd achieved her goal."

Natalie always underestimáted Nina. She was certain Nina wouldn't dare cross her. Having Nina prepare the medicine was the perfect touch, maximizing the illuson of credibility.

Nina gave Daniela a thumbs-up."aniela, you're absolutely brilliant. What's the-next move?"

Daniela chuckled and whispered her plan.

Nina gasped in admiration. "You're incredible, Daniela! This way, I can finally have my sweet revenge."
###Chapter 433 | Won't Take It Lightly


Natalie, having exited Daniela's office, loitered near the door, waiting for news of Daniela's sudden demise.

Ten minutes ticked by.

An hour crawled past.

Two hours drifted into the night, yet all remained eerily quiet within.

Natalie's brow furrowed, she shot daggers at Linden with her eyes, and, her patience finally snapping like a twig, she barged back into the CEO's office.

Daniela, seemingly unfazed, sat reviewing new project proposals, not even looking up.

"What's the matter?" Daniela's voice was cool, detached.

Natalie scrutinized Daniela's face, still radiating health."Daniela,how are you feeling now?"

"Quite well, actually. After taking the medicine, I feel much better!" Daniela picked up a document beside her, signing it as she spoke. "Inform Enzo in the project department that this multi-million-dollar project can proceed."

With a frustrated "Hmm," Natalie stormed out of the office. Once outside, she fixed Linden with a withering glare. "Have you been playing me for a fool all this time? What exactly did you give Daniela? Huh?"

Linden's eyes darted around nervously. "Medicine,"

Natalie's lips curled into a sneer. "You can't rely on men for anything!"

With that, she turned on her heel to leave.

Linden reached out and grabbed her hand, his voice suddenly turning syrupy sweet. "Come on. Don't be like that. You guessed it, didn't you? | didn't give Daniela a full dose. I did it for our future, for you. If I'd been caught and sent to jail, you'd be left high and dry." 
Natalie snatched her hand away as if it had been burned. "I think you've fallen for that bitch Daniela,haven't you?"

Linden chuckled, a sleazy sound that grated on Natalie's ears. "You're cousins. Do you really need to be so mean?"

Natalie's sneer deepened. "So, what are you getting at?"

"Don't be angry, sweetheart. You're theone I truly care about. Trust me. I just want to play with Daniela for a while. Once I'm bored, I'll definitely take care of her for you. I reduced the dosage to make her dependent on me. This drug will cloud her judgment, soften her resolve. Isn't it Elite Lux you want? By then, you can have her transfer it to you."

Natalie looked at Linden, searching his eyes for a hint of truth. "Really?"

Linden smiled. "Of course."

Natalie's eyes narrowed, her mind replaying the image of Daniela she had just seen in the office. She hadn't seemed like someone whose mind was clouded.

"How will you prove Daniela is under your thumb?" she asked.

Linden was brimming with self-assurance. "When Daniela leaves work and heads to the parking lot, I'll give you a demonstration. With the current dosage, I can control her consciousness for about a minute."

Linden grinned, his grip on Natalie's hand tightening possessively. "Honey, don't be jealous. You know you're the only one in my heart. It's just that all men will stray a little. You'll forgive me, won't you?"

Natalie looked at Linden's face, a face that only a mother could love as a wave of nausea washed over her.

She let out a brittle laugh, pulled her hand free from his grasp, and strutted back towards the office.

That day, Daniela left for home at 9 PM as usual.

By the time she reached the underground parking lot, Natalie and Linden were already lurking outside.

Daniela detected a strange, cloying fragrance in the air. Wth a flourish, Linden snapped his fingers near her ear.

The next second, he commanded, "Daniela, stand still andbe quiet for a minute."

Daniela froze in her tracks.

Linden turned to Natalie, a smug grin plastered across his face. "See? The drug's working, isn't it?"

Natalie tilted her head, waved a hand in front of Daniela's face, and then peered intently into her eyes,calling,"Daniela?"

Only silence answered her.

The underground parking lot was as quiet as a tomb.

Linden's smugness intensified, and he reached for Natalie's hand. "See? | told you.1-"

Before he could finish his sentence, they both watched as Daniela blinked.

Danielalooked at them blankly, her gaze lingering on their clasped hands. "Are you dating?"

Natalie, already battling a rising tide of disgust, had been struggling to contain her revulsion. She hadn't expected Daniela to snap out of it so suddenly.

"No. We... It's just..." Natalie was desperate to distance herself from Linden. "My hands were cold, and he was just being a gentleman, warming them for me."

Daniela seemed unconcerned.

Linden, however, turned to Natalie.

Daniela began to walk away, then paused and turned back to Natalie. "Linden is a good man. There's no rule against colleagues dating in the company. If you truly admire each other, I support you being together."

Linden's face was about to split into a triumphant grin when Natalie quickly interjected, "No. Really. There's nothing between us. I have someone I like, and it's not Linden."

Daniela nodded knowingly, glanced at Linden with a hint of pity, and then shook her head regretfully. As Daniela's car pulled away, Linden rounded on Natalie. "Natalie, what was that all about? Why didn't you acknowledge our relationship just now? Are you saying you don't plan to be with me?"

That could explain her strange behavior.

Natalie's patience had worn thin, stretched to its absolute limit. She almost rolled her eyes at him.

She wanted to tell Linden to take a long, hard look at himself in the mirror.

He was daydreaming.

"No, I'm just focusing on my career right now. I don't want my personal life to interfere with my professional development."

Linden's face was a mask of disbelief. "Natalie, if I find out you're deceiving me, I won't take it lightly."
###Chapter 434 | Thrive On The Challenge


A sudden wave of unease washed over Natalie. "How could I possibly fool you?"

Upon Daniela's return home, Nina was concerned and asked, "Are you okay, Daniela?"

No sooner had she spoken than Cedric entered from outside, asking, "What's happening? Is everything okay?"

Nina quickly stepped aside.

Daniela gave a soft smile. "It's nothing; just a bit of work talk."

Nina understood that Daniela did not want Cedric to know about her struggles.

Before bedtime, Cedric held Daniela close."Promise me nothing bad will happen to you."

Daniela comforted him by patting his hand. "I'll be fine."

Days later,Natalie observed Daniela confidently managing a ten-hour international meeting.

She frowned, turning to Linden. "Linden, how long until your plan takes effect? Daniela appeared to be growing more energetic with each passing moment."

Linden felt a sense of unease. "This is unexpected. She should be growing weak and drowsy from the dose."

He had intended to take advantage of her vulnerability in the lounge. Yet, Daniela appeared livelier than ever.

Natalie stared coldly at Linden, slapped him sharply."Fool!"

Natalie quickly walked away, not even bothering to glance at Linden again.

Linden,feeling agitated, made his way to the men's room. As he stepped out, he accidentally bumped into Nina, who was just coming out of the ladies' room across the corridor. He was about to walk away when Nina stopped him. "Linden, have you considered your future?"

Linden frowned and faced her. "What do you mean by that?"

"I'm bringing this up because I can't keep quiet any longer. You've sacrificed so much for Natalie, yet she hasn't always been faithful to you. There's a wealth young man from the research and development department, Tobin Kelly, and she's been seen with him quite a bit. Not many people are aware of your relationship with my sister. This is not fair to you, given you're handling these risky schemes for her. If things head in the wrong direction, do you think she'll support you? She will take credit for all the successes and live a life of luxury with Tobin. Is that something you're okay with?"

Linden's expression darkened with her words.

Over the next few days, Linden stalked Natalie.

He observed her enjoy a candlelit dinner with Tobin, followed by a trip to the movies. On the Ferris wheel,Tobin held Natalie's hand. She didn't pull away; instead, she blushed.

Linden felt his rage surge.

He whipped out his phone, dialed a number, and after a long pause, a voice answered, "Hello?"

Linden glared up at the Ferris wheel as it rose high above him. In a cold tone, he demanded, "Natalie, where are you right now?"

Annoyed, Natalie snapped, "What do you want? I'm currently busy."

Linden continued, "I miss you. Where are you? I'll come to you."

Losing patience, Natalie said, "Finish your work first, or don't bother calling me."

"Who are you talking to? Who's calling you so late?" Tobin asked.

"Just a telemarketer," replied Natalie before ending the call.

Linden remained under the Ferris wheel, observing Natalie and Tobin as they shared whispers and laughter.

He squinted, a dark glow beginning to form in his eyes. The following morning, as Nina stepped out of her bedroom, she heard the TV news anchor delivering the day's headlines.

"Today, our city was the scene of a brutal murder. The killer tied the victim to a Ferris wheel, which continued to turn throughout the night. By morning, when the amusement park staff found him, the victim had already been dead for several hours. The police are investigating the case, and the amusement park has been shut down."

Nina almost let her water glass slip from her hand upon hearing the news.

The news showed the face of Tobin, who had been dating Natalie, putting him in the spotlight.

When Daniela came down the stairs, Nina looked visibly shaken.

From the other end of the staircase, she locked eyes with Daniela. "Daniela, Linden has made a move.Tobin is dead."

Daniela took a quick look at the television screen before replying casually, "Hmm."

"Daniela, it's too dangerous. Stop using yourself as bait. People like Linden are crazy, and the ones behind them are even worse."

Daniela took a drink of water, eyes still fixed on the television, and said calmly,11|sthat right? Perfect! I thrive on the challenge of taking down villains."
###Chapter 435 Sit Back And Watch The Fireworks


Daniela had just arrived at the office wwhen a leave request from Natalie landed on her desk.

Cedric, working at Elite Lux today, noticed Daniela placing a call to Natalie.

"It's urgent. You might need to come over."

After Daniela hung up, Cedric glanced at her, a puzzled expression on his face.

He had been under the impression that the investigation on Brylee's death had ended and the threats against Daniela neutralized.

He looked at Daniela, puzzled, with a subconscious feeling that she was planning something big.

He turned to Lillian for clarification, but she merely smiled enigmatically and gestured towards Daniela."Daniela specifically instructed me not to involve you in these troublesome matters, so please don't put me in a difficult position, alright? You should ask her yourself."

Cedric, of course, didn't press the issue. He knew Daniela wouldn't confide in him.

The last time he had tried to meddle in her affairs, it had resulted in a major clash, with him ultimately backing down.

"Is there any danger?" Cedric asked, his voice laced with concern.

"Don't you trust Daniela?" Lillian chuckled. "She's meticulous in everything she does, and with you here,she's even more vigilant about her safety."

Cedric nodded in response.

By lunchtime, he had his secretary move all the files from his office to Elite Lux.

Daniela didn't say much, only instructing the secretarial department to replace Cedric's furniture with a ridiculously expensive set. It was such a blatant display of power that anyone entering her office would instinctively glance towards Cedric's now opulent seat.

Natalie arrived at the company at noon, looking as pale as a ghost. "Ms. Harper, here is all the information on this project. If there's nothing else, I'd like to take the afternoon off."

Natalie's eyes were hollow, betraying a deep-seated unease.

Daniela offered a faint smile. "Can you hold on? The negotiating party will be here this afternoon."

Natalie nodded reluctantly.

Throughout the afternoon, she was visibly distracted, her mind clearly elsewhere. Duing dinner,the partners even subtly hinted to Daniela that Natalie's performance as an assistant was slipping.

Natalie overheard their comments and blushed, her inability to focus only worsening.

The previous night, after she and Tobin had just stepped off the Ferris wheel, they had run into Linden, who had greeted them with a bone-chilling smile.

He hadn't said a word, just looked at her with that icy grin.

Tobin had subsequently died in a freak accident.

A coincidence? Natalie didn't think so!

After the banquet, Daniela noticed Natalie's downcast expression. "Natalie, if you're feeling overwhelmed lately, why not return to Harper Group for the time being?"

Startled, Natalie's head snapped up. "I'm fine, Daniela."

Daniela studied Natalie's dazed expression and smiled knowingly. "I heard someone saw you with Tobin last night. He died yesterday, did you know?"

Before Natalie could even begin to panic and offer an explanation, Daniela continued, "I also heard you've been quite close to Linden lately.Is that right?"

Natalie's heart nearly stopped beating. She didn't understand why Daniela had suddenly brought up these two names,wondering if it was a veiled threat or á simple observation.

Either way, it wasn't a good sign.

She desperately wanted to speak, to offer some kind of defense, but Daniela simply waved her hand dismissively. "I'm going home."

The words Natalie so desperately wanted to say remained trapped in her throat. She was left floundering,watching Daniela's figure recede into the distance.

Nina lingered behind. "Natalie, I think she suspects something. Why not just make your relationship with Linden public?"

As Nina spoke, her hands were clasped behind her back, her phone discreetly displaying an active call.

Natalie, her nerves frayed to the breaking point, glared coldly at Nina. "Nina, don't get too big for your boots! Otherwise, I'll tell the world you've slept with Linden."

Nina smirked. "Natalie, Linden is completely devoted to you, but you've been playing him for a fool.Don't you think he'll feel betrayed? Have you ever considered actually being with him?"

Hearing these words, Natalie let out a harsh, mirthless laugh.

"With Linden? Does he even deserve me? Why should I care if he's hurt? To me, he's beneath contempt, a grotesque creature with a face only a mother could love and a stature that barely reaches my shoulder. Just looking at him makes me sick to my stomach. How could he ever compare to me? What a joke!" Natalie's venom dripped with every word.

Nina's smile widened slightly. "But Natalie, Linden is so good to you, even willing to risk his neck and kill Daniela for you. Aren't you even a little bit touched?"

Natalie,shot Nina a contemptuous look. "Touched? What's that worth? Linden is only fit to sleep with you!He's delusional if he thinks he has a chance with me!"

With that, Natalie, no longer able to stomach Nina's presence, hailed a taxi and left.

Nina, still holding the active phone call, inquired calmly, "Did you hear everything?" Back at Daniela's residence, Nina gave Daniela a resounding thumbs-up.

"You're absolutely brilliant, Daniela! Now all we have to do is sit back and watch the fireworks. Linden is sure to take care of Natalie."

Nina had never felt so gleeful, so exhilarated, in her entire life.
###Chapter 436 He Succeeded


The next day, Linden strode into Daniela's office and announced, "Ms. Harper, I'm dating Natalie now."

Daniela, seated at her desk, offered a composed smile. "That's wonderful news. Natalie is my cousin,and I truly hope this relationship works out for her. The company isn't too busy right now, so take advantage of the downtime-spend more time together. Linden, you have my permission to move your desk next to Natalie's."

When Natalie heard about it, she went pale, her shock evident. She stormed over to Linden, her usual haughty demeanor intact. "Have you completely lost your mind? What possessed you to tell Daniela we're dating?"

Linden met her glare with icy indifference. "You've already slept with me, yet you refuse to admit you're my girlfriend. What, are you just going to let me use you and walk away?"

As he spoke, he wrapped an arm around her waist.

Natalie's breath hitched, and she immediately tried to shove him off.

But this time, Linden wasn't letting go. He pinned her against the window, his grip firm,and kissed her.

Natalie fought back, twisting in his hold, but Linden refused to stop.

His lips moved from hers to her neck, his touch leaving her breathless.

Panic set in-she was on the verge of losing it.

She shoved at his chest with all her strength, but compared to Linden, her resistance was useless.

Just then, Nina happened to walk by.

Humiliated, Natalie's eyes darted towards her, seeking for help. But Nina only smirked, her expression dripping with mockery. She pulled out her phone, snapped a picture of the scene,and sent it straight into the company's group chat. Natalie's heart plummeted. Tears welled in her eyes, spilling down her face as her composure shattered.

Linden watched Natalie, his puIse quickening at the sight of her tear-streaked face.

His hands roamed over her, pressing her against the glass.

If they weren't standing in the company's corridor, he might have gone even further.

It took half an hour before he finally let her go. Natalie gasped for breath, her chest rising and falling erratically.

Her entire body trembled.

She couldn't comprehend why Linden had suddenly turned so aggressive-all she knew was that the way he had just treated her had left her shaken to the core.

Fear,shame, and revulsion twisted inside her.

Linden saw it all written on her face. His expression darkened. "What's with that look? You didn't want me to kiss you?"

Natalie furiously wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. "You're insane. Why the hell did you tell Daniela we were dating? For the record, I never agreedto be with you."

A dangerous glint flashed through Linden's eyes.

His low chuckle sent an eerie chill down Natalie's spine.

The way he smirked at her made her stomach turn.

"Natalie, let me spell it out for you. If you don't get in my bed and admit you belong to me, then don't expect me to lift a finger to help you."

Natalie scoffed, smoothing down her disheveled hair with a flick of her wrist. "I already slept with you. If you break your promise, then don't expect to touch me again."

Linden's sneer deepened, dripping with mockery. "Was it really you I slept with back then? Natalie, if you dare lie to me, you'll regret it." Natalie's breath caught in her throat, her eyes widening in shock.

Linden's gaze hardened. "Natalie, I know you think you're better than me. That's fine. But mark my words-one day, you'll be the one begging."

With that, he spun on his heel and strode away.

Natalie narrowed her eyes, watching his retreating figure, then scoffed.

He wanted her to beg him?

He was delusional.

She stepped aside just as the elevator doors slid open, revealing Elyse,who burst out in a panic.

The moment she saw Natalie's red-rimmed eyes, her expression darkened. "Sweetheart, what happened?
Where is that bastard Linden? How dare he do this to you? I swear, I'll make him pay!"

Elyse's hands clenched at her sides, her rage barely contained.

To her, Natalie was untouchable, her future resting on a man like Cedric-a man of power and prestige.There was no way she'd let someone like Linden taint her.

Natalie's brows furrowed. "Mom, how did you even find out?"

Elyse's face twisted with indignation. "You don't know? Nina took a picture of Linden pinning you against the window and posted it in the company's group chat. Now, the whole office thinks you're with him!"

Elyse's fury reached a boiling point."And your own sister-Nina-stood there and let it happen! Just wait until I deal with her!"

Natalie's expression turned cold as she yanked out her phone.

The company's group chat was in chaos.

"Linden and Natalie? Seriously?"

"They have to be a couple! Did you see how intense that was?" "Oh my God, he actually managed to land someone way out of his league!"

"I always thought Natalie was untouchable--she only ever smiled at Cedric and ignored the rest of us. How did Linden manage to reel her in?"

"Hah! What a fake! Acting all high and mighty, but just look at that picture-Linden's got his hands all over her, kissing her neck. She's obviously into it."

"So the belle of the company is just another flirt? Unbelievable."

"Hey, don't say that. Daniela is still the real top beauty around here."

"I second that."

"Agreed."

"Same here."

The chat exploded as nearly everyone chimed in.

Furious, Natalie flung her phone onto the desk. "I swear,I'll strangle these gossiping idiots!"

Her whole body trembled with rage. "Cedric is working in Elite Lux these days. If he sees this garbage,what's he going to think of me? Am I going to lose my chance?" 
###Chapter 437 You Can Only Choose One


At this moment, the elevator doors slid open, and Cedric stepped out.

The soft glow from outside illuminated his sharp features, stirring an unexpected flutter in Natalie's heart.

She realized that no matter how much time had passed, her feelings for Cedric had never wavered. If anything,they had onlygrown stronger.

"Cedric,"she called out.

Cedric was discussing Elite Lux's security upgrades with Ryan when he heard her.

When he spotted Natalie, he stopped mid-conversation and asked, "Ms. Dury, do you need something?"

Natalie couldn't help but feel a sting at how distant and formal Cedric addressed her.

"Cedric, we used to go to the same school. There's no need to be so formal. Just call me Natalie."

Elyse observed the exchange from a distance, anticipation gleaming in her eyes.

In her mind, Cedric was the ideal candidate for a son-in-law.

Cedric's patience was wearing thin. "What is it?"

"I need to tellyou something." Natalie hesitated, glancing at Ryan beside her.

Ryan crossed his arms, making it clear he had no plans to leave.

Natalie bit her bottom lip. "I just wanted to clear up a misunderstanding. The things said in that group chat about Linden and I-"

"What group chat?" Cedric cut her off, turning to Ryan.′′|smy wife in it?"

Natalie's face darkened, and she was on the verge of tears. Was Daniela the only person Cedric truly cared about?

Ryan nodded. "Yeah, she is. Do you want me to add you?"

"No!" Natalie blurted out, panic creeping into her voice. "That's not what I meant. It's just a silly group chat.If you're not in it, don't worry about it.."

"I'm in," Cedric interrupted. "So, what's being discussed?"

Immediately Cedric entered the chat, he could sense the hostility.

Ryan skimmed through the messages before reading one aloud. "That slut, pretending to be aloof, still has the nerve to seduce Ms. Hárper's man. She should take a good look in the mirror. She's only fit for Linden. In my opinion, Ms. Harper shouldn't tolerate having her around."

As he passed by Natalie, Cedric asked Ryan indifferently, "Who's supposed to be seducing me?"

Ryan quickly caught up to Cedric. "They're saying Ms. Harper's man. So, are you her man?"

Cedric nodded without hesitation. "Of course. I'm her only man."

Ryan nodded in agreement. "That's true."

Natalie stood there, watching as Cedric walked away.

When Ryan confirmed Cedric's words, Cedric let out a chuckle. He was completely uninterested in anything that didn't involve Daniela.

Natalie clenched her fists, her eyes reddening as a wave of frustration washed over her.

She could have let it go like she always did in the past. However, she bit her lip and rushed after him today.

"Cedric, just give me five minutes. Let me explain."

Cedric stopped and turned to Natalie, his gaze cold. "Explain? To me? About what?"

His three questions showed his confusion, but his expression remained equally indifferent.

"The chat... People are just making things up. I'm not like that. Cedric finally comprehended. "Oh, you are the person they're talking about in the group chat."

Natalie nodded, her eyes teary. "But it's all a misunderstanding."

Before she could say more, Ryan pulled up the photos Nina had posted earlier in the chat. "How is this a misunderstanding? I heard you two held that pose for half an hour."

Natalie's eyes welled with tears as she stared at the photo, showing Linden's hand creeping up her shirt,settling on her chest.

Tears rolled down Natalie's face.

Cedric pushed the office door open and stepped inside, Ryan trailing after him.

Natalie stood frozen, the humiliation settling deep in her bones.

Natalie turned on her heels and went straight to find Nina.

The sharp crack echoed as a hot slap landed across Nina's face.

Nina laughed loudly, her laughter so intense that it made her whole body tremble.

Elyse's expression darkened, her voice shaking with fury. "Nina! Do you even still call yourself part of the Dury family? Your own sister was humiliated, and you stood there snapping photos? Have you completely lost your humanity? You heartless fool!"

Elyse's voice trembled with rage as she spoke, her anger unmistakably genuine.

Nina looked at Natalie's tear-streaked face and Elyse's furious outburst, suddenly realizing a harsh truth.

Unless the pain was felt firsthand, it was nearly impossible to understand.

"Mom, when you sent me to sleep with Linden on Natalie's behalf,did you ever show me any concern?"

Elyse's slap obliterated Nina's final shred of hope.

Nina tasted the blood on her lip and curled her lip into a sneer." "Now Natalie can comprehend what the pain l've endured feels like."

Elyse couldn't shake the feeling that Nina had completely lost her mind.

She burst into Daniela's office, her voice sharp. "Daniela, if you still consider me your aunt, you'll fire Nina from Elite Lux. If not, I'll take Natalie with me. You can only choose one."
###Chapter 438 Was The Woman Really Her Daughter


Cedric, ensconced in the office chair Daniela had provided, felt a disquieting sense of something amiss.

Why was Daniela getting dragged into the Dury sisters' drama?

Natalie, standing behind Elyse, struck him as a particularly thorny character.

Cedric could tell Natalie was someone who knew how to manipulate people.

Natalie felt Cedric's gaze úpon her.

Without looking up, she feigned wiping away invisible tears.

She figured all men were the same, always falling for the delicate, innocent type.

Compared to that dimwit Nina, she thought, any sane man would choose her.

Natalie subtly squared her shoulders, turning to give Cedric what she thought was a dazzling, irresistible smile. But the smile froze on her lips the very next second.

Why did Cedric's supposedly sympathetic gaze seem so harsh?

Taken aback, Natalie quickly averted her eyes.

Just then, she head Elyse speaking to Daniela. "Daniela, I don't want to make things difficult for you, but Nina is simply beyond the pale. How could she just stand by while her sister was being harassed? Elite Lux can't harbor someone like that."

Daniela responded with a smile,′′|sthat so?"

Elyse nodded vigorously. "Absolutely. Nina is utterly ruthless. Forget Elite Lux, even if she wants to join Harper Group, she should apologize to Natalie first."

Daniela sat in her chair and rested her elbows on the table, while Elyse appeared overbearing, determined to get Nina fired. Cedric, frowning, stepped forward to stand protectively behind Daniela.

Elyse,noticing Cedric's imposing presence, swalowed nervously, her bravado faltered.

"You must make a choice today," Elyse demanded.

Daniela smiled faintly, her demeanor cool and detached. "Aunt Elyse, I always thought this was a family matter."

Elyse's furious expression wavered, her momentum clearly waning.

"Natalie is a top-tier graduate, returning from overseas with experience at prestigious companies. Is she incapable of distinguishing between personal and professional conduct? If evensuch trifling matters require my personal intervention, then I fail to see the purpose of having her as a secretary." Daniela's tone dripped with criticism.

Elyse was flustered. "No, that's not what I meant at all. Natalie is perfectly capable."

Daniela ignored the interruption, her sharp gaze fixed on Natalie, a subtle smile playing on her lips. "Or perhaps, are you relying on our family connection to act so brazenly?"

Natalie, alarmed, opened her mouth to offer an explanation, but Daniela raised a hand to stop her. "If that's the case, then I don't want either Nina or Natalie. Otherwise, the company's operations will suffer, and I simply don't have the energy for that."

Natalie's eyes widened in shock. "I didn't mean to imply that."

Daniela looked at Natalie. "Since that wasn't your intention, I trust you'll handle your personal affairs with the appropriate discretion, huh?"

Natalie gritted her teeth, realizing she had been outmaneuvered. Daniela was incredibly skilled, handling the situation with a few well-chosen words, leaving her utterly speechless and defeated.

She managed a grudging "Yes," the word practically forced through her clenched jaw.

Daniela, maintaining her authoritative stance, continued to stare at Natalie. "Furthermore, your relationship with Linden has caused quite a stir within the company, creating a negative impression. While I offer you both my blessings, I sincerely hope that today's public display of affection in the hallway won't be repeated."

The phrase "public display of affection" was like a slap in the face for Natalie, mortifying her.

As Elyse dragged her out of the CEO's office, Natalie cast a lingering, complex glance at Cedric, her emotions a tangled mess of resentment, affection,and regret.

Outside Daniela's office, Elyse couldn't help but marvel. "Daniela is truly something else."

Natalie, concerned about her image in Cedric's eyes, was seething with anger.

"Mom, why did you involvé me in this if you weren't sure Daniela would fire Nina? Didn't you see how much Cedric despises me because of this? You've completely ruined everything for me!"

Elyse was taken aback by Natalie's outburst. "What are you talking about? I was standing up fo you,and now you're blaming me?"

Natalie retorted, "Who else should I blame? If you hadn't caused Aunt Brylee's death, would I have to fight tooth and nail for my inheritance like this? Aunt Brylee promised me the most lavish dowry when I grew up,but your greed for her assets led to her demise. Now, everything is in Daniela's hands, and she's so incredibly capable that I get nothing, while being humiliated by someone like Linden. You've completely ruined my life!"

Elyse stared at Natalie, her mouth agape in disbelief. "Natalie, you can't talk like this. Who was it that wanted to be the lady of a prominent family, free from others' charity? How can you say this now?"

Elyse was heartbroken, the pain of her daughter's words cutting deep. "You were the one who helped me plan everything back then. Now you're making it sound like I orchestrated everything alone."

Natalie dismissed her mother's words with a wave of her hand. "I was underage then, but you believed everything I said. Mom, don't you have any judgment of your own?"

Elyse looked at her daughter, feeling as if Natalie were a complete stranger.

Was this woman really her daughter?
###Chapter 439 I'm Not Greedy


Elyse emerged from Natalie's place and immediately noticed Nina.

Though she attempted to engage Nina, her efforts were met with indifference.

Left with no other option, Elyse redirected her focus towards Daniela.

Brylee had always been known for her gentleness. Elyse believed Daniela had inherited this trait, unlike Natalie.

She feared that Natalie might not prioritize her well-being in future events.

She had come to see her affluent niece, Daniela, as a more dependable ally.

Elyse purchased some pastries, removed the packaging, and entered Daniela's office with a cheerful demeanor.

"I made these pastries myself, Daniela. They're your favorite, and I stayed up all night baking them. Notice my dark circles? That shows how much you mean to me, doesn't it?"

Daniela looked at the pastries and offered a warm smile. "Thank you, Aunt Elyse."

As Elyse reached to give one to Daniela, Cedric stepped in to intercept.

"Daniela's reducing her sugar intake, so she'll have to pass on these." He doubted the street-bought pastries were suitable for Daniela.

With Elyse watching, Cedric discarded the pastries into the bin.

Elyse's,smile wavered, her composed exterior almost breaking.

Silenced by Daniela's lack of response, Elyse could only comment bitterly,"aniela, your husband really does assert himself. I'm your aunt, and he feels the need to screen what I bring?"

Daniela responded with a laugh, "You know, I actually enjoy this side of him." After pausing for a momnent, Elyse pulled up a chair and sat down opposite Daniela. "You remind me of your mother, always standing by your family. That's what I admire about you. There's something on my mind I've hesitated to mention. Should I bring it up, or keep it to myself?"

Daniela offered a gentle smile. "Aunt Elyse, if you're unsure, perhaps it's best left unsaid."

Elyse was stunned. Daniela's reaction wasn't what she had anticipated. How was she to request favors if she remained silent?

Considering her future, she realized she might need to prepare for her own retirement, particularly if she couldn't depend on Natalie or Nina.

"Alright, then, I'll just say it." Elyse showed no shame. "Here's the deal-before your mother passed,she agreed to cover my retirement. Now that she's gone..."

She paused, giving Daniela a meaningful look.

Daniela smiled and responded, "Are you suggesting I should take over the support for your retirement?"

Elyse forced a smile. "I hesitated to mention it, but your mother was adamant. Now that she's no longer here,I believe we should respect her wishes. Your business is thriving, and surely the support won't strain your finances. You're going to give it to me, aren't you? After all, you're such a devoted 'niece, and it's hardly a significant amount for you."

Daniela examined Elyse's calculating expression. "Did my mother actually promise that?"

"Absolutely!" Elyse replied, growing anxious. She rummaged through her purse, pulled out an old mobile phone, and shoved it across the table, eager to play a recording. "Listen, I recorded our conversation."

Daniela's smile was subdued. "You made a recording?"

The phone was ridiculously outdated.

Sitting back, Elyse beamed. "I recorded it just for fun, and now it serves a purpose. Without it, I'd have no evidence since your mother is gone. How else could I claim justice?"

Elyse spoke lightly of death, yet Daniela's expression darkened with each word. Unaware, Elyse was quite satisfied with her own foresight.

With a calm demeanor, Daniela asked, "How could you have anticipated needing such proof?"

The smile on Elyse's face stiffened suddenly. "I recorded it just for fun. Didn't I mention that? Who could have predicted your mother's untimely departure?"

A pang of anxiety struck Elyse; she realized her impulsiveness had cost her composure. Avoiding further discomfort,she divered her gaze downwards. "Do your mother's words still hold weight with you?"

Elyse tried attempting confidence, but she caught the piercing look in Daniela's eyes and found herself retreating. "Could you consider supporting me in my later years,please?"

Daniela studied Elyse's calculating expression and inquired evenly, "In what way do you expect my support?"

Seeing an opportunity, Elyse perked up and straightened her posture. "Daniela, your circumstances have changed, but believe me, I'm not asking for much. I really don't need a lot."
###Chapter 440 Do You Agree With My Terms


"I'm sure you're so soft-hearted that you wouldn't let me face hardship. Right, Daniela?" Elyse beamed, the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes softening. "I'm not asking for much, just three small requests."

Elyse raised three fingers, lowering one with each request she made.

"First,you will provide me with a monthly allowance of five hundred thousand."

Cedric, overhearing, frowned in disapproval.

Lillian's face tightened with displeasure.

Elyse hesitated but then glanced at Daniela, whose calm, unreadable expression filled her with confidence."Second,you know I can't just sit around and do nothing. You should build me a lavish retirement estate,inspired by the country's grandest one, so I can earn some income while relaxing in my later years."

Lillian narrowed her eyes. "Are you referring to the Sunset Retirement Home?"

It was undoubtedly the most opulent retirement facility worldwide.

Calling it a retirement home hardly did it justice; it was more like a palace.

Fresh vegetables were airlifted daily from specialized farms.

Seafood was brought in fresh from the deep sea.

Every resident was attended to by at least one top-tier caregiver and a private doctor.

Whether it was golf, horseback riding, archery, swimming, or even Go, there were expert companions available for every activity.

Was this even retirement?

Elyse was essentially requesting to live in unimaginable luxury. What she was asking for was, in essence, a palace built in her honor.

Daniela had lost her mother early on and suffered under Katrina's care. Yet, in all those years,Elyse had never shown up,not even at Daniela and Alexander's wedding.

It wasn't until Daniela's role as CEO of Elite Lux was revealed that Elyse appeared out of nowhere with her two daughters, eager to reap the benefits of Daniela's success.

Lillian was aware that Daniela had a plan, yet she was so infuriated by Elyse's audacity that she almost rolled her eyes.

How could anyone be this shameless?

It turned out Elyse was indeed capable of such behavior.

Daniela asked calmly, "And what's the third?"

Elyse realized Daniela had already agreed to the first two demands. "For the third, I'd like a share of Elite Lux's stock, just like your mother kindly gave me shares in Harper Group. Your mother was always generous,and I'm sure you wouldn't disappoint me. I'm not asking for much-just ten percent will suffice."

Lillian couldn't stay silent any longer. "Do you have any idea how much ten percent of Elite Lux is worth?"

Billions, at the very least! Elyse truly had the nerve to ask for such a thing!

"I don't know." Elyse feigned ignorance. "Money isn't everything to me. But since I was close to Brylee, I'm sure she'd be happy if I'm well-off. Daniela, giving me these things would also ease your mother's mind."

Cedric, standing off to the side, asked coldly, "Should we be thanking you now?"

Elyse smiled while adjusting her hair. "Cedric, I know you're quite impressive, but right now, I'm talking with my niece. I'm asking her for something, not you. Surely you don't have a say in this?"

Elyse was sharp-tongued, and despite her smile, her words were starting to grate on Daniela's nerves.

Elyse chuckled, oblivious to Daniela's growing annoyance. "Oops! My mistake, Daniela. Don't hold it against me. I'm only looking out for you. A woman should manage her own finances after marriage." Daniela smiled back. "Oh really? I thought you were handling my finances with all these plans. Cedric is precious to me, and I know how to tell the difference between those I'm close to and those I'm not."

As soon as Daniela finished speaking, Elyse's face stiffened.

Lillian finally exhaled, the breath she'd been holding escaping in relief after nearly being suffocated by anger.

Elyse, visibly irritated, realized Daniela truly knew how to drive her point home. "Fine, you're right.I was mistaken. So, will you agree to these three terms, Daniela?"

Elyse stared eagerly at Daniela, her eyes fixed on her red lips, unblinking.
###Chapter 441 Did Daniela Give You Elite Lux's Shares

Elyse breathed a sigh of relief as soon as Daniela gave her a favorable response.

Cedric stood off to the side, his brow knitted in a cold.penetrating stare at Elyse.

Daniela remained composed. "Since it's a promise made by my mother. I will honor it. But for the continued success of Elite Lux, I do have one condition I hope you'll accept."

Elyse was ecstatic, already counting her benefits in her mind. Daniela's directness made her regret not asking for even more.

"Alright. Go on," Elyse agreed quickly. She had set three demands, and Daniela only had one: it felt like a fair deal.

Daniela smiled lightly. "Elite Lux is a global corporation. A ten percent shift in shares could stir external turmoil, so l need you to keep this confidential. Only those in this office should be aware.If not, the gift will be revoked. Do we have an agreement?"

Elyse nodded eagerly. "Of course!" After a moment.she asked. "What about Nina and Natalie? Can I tell them?" Daniela shook her head. "No. If that's the case, the agreement is null. Everything I've promised will be rescinded, and you alone will bear the consequences."

Elyse hesitated. "But Nina and Natalie are my daughters. If you don't trust Nina, can I at least tell Natalie?"

Daniela let out a soft chuckle. Her smile was slight but sharp. "I don't quite get it. The recording from my mother spoke of ensuring your retirement care. Why bring others into this? Or should I be responsible for Nina and Natalie as well?"
/
Elyse was on the verge of agreeing when Daniela shook her head. "If that's the case, I don't have to honor my mother's promise. It was her commitment to you,and Elite Lux is mine. If you have future needs,you can access funds from Harper Group's accounts."

"That won't wvork." Elyse panicked. "Harper Group is in shambles,losing money."

Daniela fell silent.

Elyse understood that Daniela was waiting for her to make a choice.

The decision involved hundreds of billions in assets.

Elyse was greatly tempted, and after a moment, she nodded. "Alright."

Daniela gave a slight nod. "I'll draw up an agreement."it honor vour retirement nlans, but if vou disclose anu details to others, the agreement will be void."

Elyse quickly signed the contract.

Daniela's smile softened as she spoke to Elyse. "Have you heard the saying? Secrets always find their way out. If you share anything, I'll know. I trust you'll keep your word and enjoy your retirement."

Elyse nodded enthusiastically and asked, "When will the retirement home be ready?"

Daniela answered, "The land in the city is going up for bid soon, I'll place a bid, and that's where the retirement home will be constructed."

Elyse's face brightened. "It should bear my name.Daniela."

Daniela simply nodded. "No problem."

Elyse walked out, smiling broadly.

Natalie, from the secretarial department, noticed Elyse's wide grin and felt puzzled.

She asked Lillian, who sighed, her face creased with irritation,and walked off.

She then asked Cedric, whose face was clouded with concern.

Natalie was dying of curiosity. She longed to ask Daniela but knew she was always busy. While she was delivering documents to the office, she overheard Daniela telling Ryan, "Put these three documents the safe. They're vital for Elite Lux's future, and no one else should see them."

Ryan was distracted, playing a new game on his phone.the sharp sounds of gunfire blaring from the screen.He seemed lost in the game as he absentmindedly responded to Daniela,"Got it."

Daniela then exited the room.

Natalie observed that even after Daniela walked away.she kept turning back, glancing cautiously over her shoulder.

After Daniela left, the office felI silent and empty.

Only Ryan remained, lounging and absorbed in his game, while Natalie cautiously approached Daniola's desk.

She set the papers down and stretched her neck to peek at the documents on the desk across from her.

In one quick glance, she spotted Elyse's name listed as Party B. Daniela was listed as Party A.

Natalie's pulse quickened as her eyes landed on the bold title above their names. Equity Transfer Agreement

It hit her in an instant-Daniela had transferred Elite Lux's shares to her mother. Elite Lux was a leading name in the global luxury industry.

Daniela had transferred shares to her mother?

Natalie was exhilarated. She squinted and spotted two more agreements beneath,though they were covered,leaving their contents unclear. Yet Elyse's name stood out clearly.

What else had Daniela given her mother?

"Hey! What do you think you're doing?" As Natalie was about to tiptoe closer for a better look, Ryan suddenly approached, phone in one hand, unlocking the safe with the other, and placing the three agreements inside.

Natalie looked up at Ryan and asked, "Did Ms. Harper sign any agreements with my mother?"

Natalie noticed that Ryan's finger stilled on the screen after her question. "No," he replied.

That brief moment made Natalie suspicious-there was something going on for sure. There had to be something fishy going on.

Her curiosity was burning, and she couldn't wait to call Elyse right away.

"Mom! Did Daniela give you shares in Elite Lux?" she  asked, her voice trembling with excitement.

Natalie had assumed Elyse would confess right away.

But there was a long silence on the other end of the line.
###Chapter 442 Kept Secrets From Your Daughter
Natalie waited in silence, starting to wonder if the call had been disconnected.

She checked her phone, relieved to see it was still connected.

"Hello? Mom,why are you silent?" Elyse's silence was strange. But Natalie was too caught up in the thrill of what seemed like an unbelievable stroke of luck to notice. She laughed, her voice full of energy."Mom,tell me! Did you sign something with Daniela? Did she give you shares of Elite Lux? Speak up!"

The silence from the other end continued,stretching on.

After a lengthy pause, Elyse's slow response came."What? Of course not. Why would that happen?"

Natalie furrowed her brows. "No?"

If Elyse had been paying attention,she would have noticed the surprise and subtle disappointment in Natalie's tone.

"No. Of course not," Elyse affirmed. "Why would Daniela be so generous as to give me shares in Elite Lux? It's world-renowned and a leader in its field. Why would she give me anything? Natalie, you're thinking too much."

Natalie clenched her phone. her tone turning icy as she listened to Elyse. "Are you absolutely sure Daniela didn't give you shares in Elite Lux?"

Elyse answered firmly, "No,she didn't."

Natalie pressed further, "What about other things?"

Elyse chuckled. "Oh, my dear! How could that be?Does Daniela have so much money that she doesn't know what to do with it? Why woula she offer me anything?"

Natalie looked down, her gaze falling. "Did you sign anything with Daniela?"

Elyse responded, "My dear, what's got you so worked up? What could I have signed with Daniela? Well,I did bring a few Harper Group contracts for her to sign earlier, but that's all."

Natalie hung up the phone. She knew her mother well -whenever Elyse was lying, she would unconsciously say "my dear." She had said it twice duringtheir call.

That was sufficient to confirm that the agreement was genuine, and the Elite Lux shares were indeed transferred.

But why was Elyse keeping it from her?

Natalie was certain her mother understood the immense effort she had invested in those matters. She had endured harassment from Linden.

Elyse had seen everything unfold herself, yet chose to keep the acquisition of Elite Lux's shares hidden. What could be her reason?

Did Elyse take pleasure in her suffering?

Natalie couldn't stop herself from silently blaming her mother.

Rage boiled within her, threatening to unravel her composure.

A few days later, the city construction bidding meeting was scheduled.

Daniela attended the auction and told Natalie, "Tell Aunt Elyse to meet me at the bidding site."

Still upset from the past few days, Natalie frowned at the request. "Did you just say you want my mother to attend the bidding meeting as well?"

Daniela nodded. "Yes. Is there an issue?"

Natalie had a sinking feeling, suspecting it was related to those contracts. "My mother knows nothing about bidding, and tonight's auction is under Elite Lux's name.What's her involvement?"

Natalie glanced at Daniela, but she remained silent.

A growing sense of unease washed over Natalie. She went with Daniela to the bidding event. Before they got there, Natalie saw Elyse, impeccably dressed.waiting by the entrance.

As Daniela stepped out of the car.Elyse greeted her with surprising enthusiasm. "Daniela, you made it!"

Daniela, ever the woman of few words,simply nodded.

Elyse, unbothered and unusually sweet, remarked,"This land is massive, hundreds of acres. I heard it would cost over two hundred billion to acquire.Daniela, don't you think that's a bit excessive?"

Elyse's eyes gleamed with unmistakable greed.

Daniela chuckled. "As long as it pleases you, Aunt Elyse." Elyse's joy was unmistakable, her face glowing with excitement,practically bouncing in place.

Natalie stood off to the side, squinting her eyes.

It didn't seem like Daniela was there to bid for the land:it felt more like the land was already Elyse's.

The bidding was fierce.

The land, located in a prime city spot, attracted many property companies. Elyse sat  with the representatives, her eyes wide, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the event.

Her emotions were running wild.

This was the realm of the wealthy, where money was little more than a game. The bids climbed past one hundred and fifty billiordollars
Elyse glanced at Danieia, who had yet to place a bidand asked, "Daniela, in't it time to join in?
Daniela nodded, and to Eyse's surprise, she raised thebid, "Two hundred bilion," she announced
The moment the words left her mouth, all eyes turnedto Danieis
Elyse's face fushed bright red with excitement. Shoreveled in the attention, straightening her back, herexpression smug as she looked down on the crowd
in her mind, the land was already hers, without adoubt.
In the end, Daniela successfully secured the land fortwo hundred and thirty bilion.
As Daniela made the payment, Elyse beamed withdelight.
Once the payment was completed, Daniela left thescene.
Elyse lingered at the site, reluctant to leave. soaking inthe admiring glances from the crowd.
Natalie stood nearby, her eyes narrowed.
She pulled Elyse aside, asking sharply, "Mom, tell me the truth. Does the land Daniela bid on tonight have anything to do with you?"

Elyse shot NNatalie a disapproving look. "My dear, how could this land possibly have anything to do with me?What are you always thinking?"

Natalie pressed further, "Then why are you so excited?"

Elyse's annoyance grew. "Am I not allowed to be happy? Do you have a problem with me living well?Weren't you the one who blamed me for Brylee's death before? Let me tell you-without Brylee,I can still make my own way and build a successful future."

Natalie asked, "What do you mean?"

Elyse opened her mouth to respond, but then remembered the agreement with Daniela.

She waved her hand dismissively. "Nothing at all.You're reading too much into it. I'm just Daniela's aunt.What could she possibly give me? Could she give me the land she just acquired? My dear, what kind of fantasies are you having?"

Natalie narrowed her eyes.

Elyse had once again slipped into calling her "my dear"multiple times.

"Mom,have you really decided to keep secrets from me, your own daughter?" Natalie's tone suddenty turned cold as she stared at Elyse.
###Chapter 443 Calculating

Elyse let out a deep sigh after hearing those words.

"Natalie, I just don't get it. You've changed so much.You used to listen, but now you're always so emotional. I'm your mother, and I won't hold this against you, but you really need to reconsider. I'm your mother, after all. If my life is getting better,shouldn't you be happy for me? It would make things easier for you,wouldn't it?"

Natalie squinted at Elyse,her gaze sharp. "So, you're admitting Daniela has helped improve your life, aren't you?"

As soon as the question was asked, Elyse froze for a brief moment. Quickly regaining her composure, she put on a stern expression. "I have no idea what you're talking about," she said, hurrying after Daniela.

Sensing something was wrong, Natalie turned to Nina."Nina, I'm sure Mom's hiding something from us.Want to team up and find out?"

Nina scoffed, "Now you want to team up? It's too late for that!"

Before Natalie could respond, Nina turned and walked off.

Natalie stood still, calling out to Nina's disappearing form."Fine! If I find out Daniela gave Mom something.you won't get it."

Nina spun around,flipping Natalie the bird,making her seethe with anger. In her frustration, Natalie kicked a nearby tree,only to hurt herself.

Linden stood off in the distance, observing as Natalie climbed into a taxi alone.

As Daniela was about to enter her car, a familiar face caught her eye from the corner of her vision.

Daniela lifted her gaze and saw a face that was the spitting image of Cedric's.

Cedric had told her he had an international meeting that evening and might not be able to attend.

Daniela waved enthusiastically, calling out, "Cedric!"

The figure hesitated for a moment in the dim light before crouching and entering the car.

Daniela stood frozen, her mind swirling in confusion as she stared in the direction of the car for a long time.

"What's got your attention, Daniela?" Lillian poked her head out to ask.

Daniela kept her gaze on the car as it continued to distance itself.

"Nothing," she replied as she climbed into her own car,
"It must have been an illusion." Inside the car, Daniela couldn't shake the thoughts of what had just happened.

Elyse was practically glowing with excitement."Daniela, you're so generous! You just bought that massive piece of land like it was nothing.Are you seriously planning to build me a retirement home there?"

Elyse was sitting in the front, with Daniela in the back seat.

Elyse twisted her neck slightly to look back at Daniela,still beaming. When Daniela said, "I'm glad you're happy with it, Aunt Elyse,"her smile only widened,and she even hummed joyfully in the car.

Daniela stayed silent throughout the entire ride.

The car pulled up to Elyse's lavish mansion. Elyse exited the vehicle, bending slightly and flashing a smile at Daniela. "Take care on your way back, Daniela."Her voice oozed with exaggerated flattery.

Daniela studied Elyse's overly ingratiating expression under the streetlights and reminded her coolly, "I've kept my promise to provide for your retirement,Aunt Elyse. I hope you'll keep yours as well. If the Harper family comes asking for handouts every month.I won't be able to keep up."

At Daniela's words, Elyse waved her hand quickly. "Of course, Daniela. You're the best to me. I won't tell anyone about this."Daniela gave a subtle glance towards Natalie, who was eavesdropping from a distance, nodded slightly, and then told the driver, "Drive."

Even as the car disappeared into the distance, Elyse continued waving at the dissipating exhaust fumes.

She was so overcome with joy that she couldn't help but dance, but when she turned around, she was startled to find Natalie standing quietly behind her.

"When did you sneak up behind me, Natalie?"Elyse gasped,surprised.

Natalie narrowed her eyes, studying her closely."What's the matter? Do you have secrets you're hiding from me?"
Elyse toyed with her hair nervously. "You're imagining things, my dear. What could I possibly be hiding?I'm exhausted tonight, so I'm heading to bed. Good night."

Natalie trailed Elyse into the house, her eyes focused intently on her profile. "Mom, remember you once said you wanted to have Daniela killed? I've already reached out to Cealmaur. If we pay them enough.they'll take care of it immediately."

Cealmaur, the world's largest mercenary group,was infamous for its assassination services, charging the highest fees but also boasting an unblemished record of success.
 
Once they took on a mission, the target never lived more than 24 hours.

Elyse was momentarily lost in thought. "Really? How much would it cost?" she asked, sipping her water while mentally calculating the details.

If Daniela were to die, all her wealth would go to Cedric. She thought it would be wiser to have Daniela fulfill her promises first, ensuring her own future was secure.

Daniela had handed her such a massive plot of land without even blinking.

Relying on Natalie or Nina wasn't nearly as dependable as counting on Daniela.

Noticing the wheels turning in Elyse's mind, Natalie answered, "They quoted one hundred million."

Elyse almost choked on her water. "How much did you just say?"

Nothing had even unfolded, and they were already demanding such a steep price from her.
###Chapter 444 | Will Be Truly Upset
Natalie reiterated,"One hundred million dollars."

Elyse gulped. "Where am I supposed to come up with that kind of money?"

Natalie narrowed her eyes, catching the flicker of hesitation in Elyse's gaze. "Selling this villa would fetch exactly one hundred million."

Natalie pressed on, "You promised, didn't you? You said one villa was no big deal. Once Daniela and Cedric are gone, the Harper family's fortune will be yours. Then a villa-whether one, ten, or even a hundred-won't matter."

Elyse had, in fact,said those very words."But-"

"What's wrong, Mom? Having second thoughts? Have you changed your mind about killing Daniela? Did you strike some kind of deal with her? Do you not want her dead anymore?"

Natalie was perceptive.

Elyse retorted, "Wait, one hundred million is just for Daniela. What about Cedric? If he lives, we won't get a dime."

Natalie smirked. "Before the assassin takes out Daniela, have Cedric completey undler my spell and many me."

Elyse eyed Natalie skeptically: "You? Are you serious?You're pretty, but compored to Daniela-in looks.talent, brains, and strategy-you're lacking. Do you really think Cechic would pick you?

Natalie's jow dropped at her mother's blunt words."Mom,what did you just say?"

Elyse looked away. "Tm just stating the truth. Youve been at Elite Lux for quite a while, but Cedric barely pays you any attention. if anything, he ta's to Nina more than he talks to you. r'il think it over, r'm heading upstairs."

With that, Elyse rushed upstairs, leaving Natalie behind.watching her retreating figure with narrowed eyes.
Moments later, Natalie dialed a law firm. "Hello,r'd like to know how to sell a villa that's under my mother's name."

The lawyer responded. "Unless the owner consents.you have no authority to sell it."

After a brief pause, the lawyer continued, "However, it the owner passes away, as the heiress, you'd have the right to sell it."

Natalie ended the call, her mind churning.

In the car, Lillian glanced at Daniola, puzzled. "Daniela.are you seriously giving Elyse that land for a  retirement home?"

Daniela barely glanced up from her phone. "You really think that's happening?"

Lillian frowned."Then why buy it?"

Daniela smirked. "It's Cedric's birthday gift."

Lillian gasped. "That's beyond extravagant!" A birthday gift costing over a billion was unreal.

Lillian leaned in. "And Elyse? What's your move?"

Daniela's smile waned slightly. "Once desperation hits,they'll turn to their backer. Just wait a little more;the time is near."

As Daniela's car neared the villa, her phone buzzed.

She stepped out to take the call,while Lillian crossed her arms,waiting.

"Hello?"

A thrilled voice crackled through. "Daniela, there's a hundred-million-dollar hit on you."

Daniela's gaze flicked to the glowing villa. Through the vast windows, the interior was clearly visible.

Cedric,now in fresh lounge wear,lounged on the sofa,engaged in a phone call.

Just then, her other phone buzzed, yet she chose not to answer right away.Instead. Daniela addressed the caller, "Russell, did they send the money?" She suspected Natalie was behind it.

"Nope. They just mentioned selling a villa."

"Alright, our doors are open to all. If they bring business, accept it." Daniela said.

Russell chuckled."Who's feeling generous enough to spend that much on your head? So,Daniela,how would you like to go?"

Just before she could reply, the villa door swung open.revealing Cedric stepping into the light, approaching her.

"Enough with the jokes. Ensure they pay up quickly."

Russell snickered. "Imagine their reaction when they realize they're funding our boss's assassination."

Daniela responded coolly. "I have to go."

Cedric asked, "Who was that? What assassination?"

Daniela smiled. "No one. You must be mistaken."

That night,in bed, a bedside lamp cast a warm glow.

The gentle, amber light stretched across the floor and walls.

After a fervent moment, Cedric pulled Daniela close.
murmured against her ear. "I know there's a lot ve. keep from me, but Daniela, I'm your husband.Do you get that? I know I can't sway you, but let me be clear about this. Daniela, you don't have to share everything with me, but if you allow yourself to be hurt, it will break me."
###Chapter 445 Those Who Despised Her Would Bow...
Daniela's safety was something Cedric had always insisted on.

Daniela had assured him that she would not get hurt.

However, the following day brought an unexpected injury for her.

As Cedric entered, he found Lillian tending to Daniela's hand.

A grim expression clouded Cedric's face, signaling his brewing anger.

Catching his look, Lillian instinctively shrank.

Standing nearby, Natalie and Nina also couldn't help but tense up.

Cedric's brow was knotted with concern as he asked coldly, "What happened?"

Silence fell over the room; no one dared to speak.

Looking up with a gentle smile,Daniela reassured. "It's merely a minor accident from the elevator acting up."

Acknowledging her words with a nod, Cedric inspected her hand briefly before departing with a troubled frown. At the elevator, he asked Ryan, "Explain what happened."

With his usual honesty,Ryan answered,"There was a malfunction. The elevator stalled on the 25th floor.During the fix, it dropped. Daniela had to act fast to avoid worse harm and ended up injuring her hand."

Cedric wasted no time and made an urgent call."Summon our elevator safety team, the manufacturers, and the designers to Elite Lux immediately!"
Within minutes, the designers, manufacturers, repair crew, and safety team all gathered in the same place.

They carefully examined every part of the elevator.both inside and out, until a glinting silver screw was finally handed to Cedric.

His gaze intensified, and his presence became more daunting.

Stepping outside, he made another decisive call. "No matter the expense, I want to know who compromised my wife's company's safety."

Natalie approached,hoping to console Cedric.

Yet, she remained unnoticed, her presence overshadowed by his stern demeanor.

He seemed so fierce, that one might think he harbored violent intentions. Previously,Natalie suspected Cedric's affection was motivated by Daniela's wealth and prestige.

However,witnessing his profound concern today,she reconsidered; perhaps Elyse had been correct.

Cedric's love for Daniela was genuine.

Following the incident, the Elite Lux building saw a significant security overhaul.

Cedric set aside all his tasks. Monitoring the comings and goings at the building was his only omission.

Lillian expressed her concern. "Daniela, isn't Cedric taking this too far? You've dealt with far worse before."

Daniela, sharing her frustration, gently pulled Cedric to one side.

As she adjusted his tousled collar, she said, "Cedric,this might be nothing more than an accident. Please.can you try not to worry so much?"

Cedric's anger erupted suddenly. "You're not being truthful with me! Daniela, do you think I'm naive? You used yourself as bait,and you expect me not to notice?Do you really believe I'm that ignorant?"

Daniela sighed. "I assure you, I won't endanger myself again."

Cedric stood in disbelief, unable to accept the thought of watching Daniela suffer once more. It was too much for him to endure.

Daniela knew convincing Cedric during his stubborn moments was useless; it would only escalate to more disputes.

Left with no alternative,Daniela agreed.

As Daniela ascended the stairs, Natalie approached with a coffee in hand. "Daniela doesn't see how much you care. It's sad, really. She's ungrateful, and you deserve better. You..."

Natalie's sentence was cut short by Cedric's cold stare.
His voice low and filled with barely contained fury,he asked sharply, "Whom are you calling ungrateful?"

Natalie was taken aback by his response.

Cedric asked in a menacing tone, "Have you nothing better to do?"

Natalie had never witnessed such fury in Cedric;he seemed ready to unleash annihilation.

Elyse observed the scene unfold from afar. Her expression turned grim. Natalie's desire for Cedric to leave Daniela for her seemed delusional; he would never entertain such thoughts.

Natalie, heartbroken and defiant, murmured softly."Cealmaur, right? Besides Daniela, I want Cedric dead too. I have a villa, and I have myself. Even if I have to sell my body, I want them dead." She would become powerful and have everything she wanted over Daniela's and Cedric's dead bodies.

Those who despised her would bow down to her.
###Chapter 446 You Must Kill Daniela
 
The voice on the other end of the call let out a low chuckle.

Natalie frowned at the sound. "What's so funny?"

Russell's tone was light, almost amused. "Oh, nothing.But I should probably tell you-Cedric's price is significantly higher than Daniela's. A hundred billion,non-negotiable."

Natalie almost choked on air,her mind struggling to process the number. "Wait! What?"

Russell scratched his ear. "Relax with the shouting.will you? It's a hundred billion."

"Do you even realize that Daniela is the richest person on the planet? And she's only worth a billion. So tell me-why is Cedric priced at a hundred billion?"

By her estimation, based on Daniela's valuation,Cedric's worth shouldn't have been more than ten million.

Russell chuckled again, his tone teasing. "Oh? You really want to know why? Our boss is a woman, and Cedric? Well, he's ridiculously good-looking. To her,he's priceless." Natalie blinked at his answer, then clicked her tongue in mild disbelief.

Cedric had that much appeal?

Even Cealmaur's leader was after him?

She arched a brow. "Wait, you're telling me your boss is actually a woman?"

"Obviously. What,do you have a problem with women in power? Aren't you a woman yourself? Anyway, do you have the money or not? Quit wasting my time with loose change."

Natalie was momentarily speechless.

Loose change?

She had offered a billion. How was that considered nothing?

"Then forget Cedric. Just take care of Daniela instead."

Russell's enthusiasm from earlier vanished, replaced by an indifferent tone. "When will the money be ready?"

Natalie hesitated before answering, "A few days.I need to sell a villafirst,so you'll have to wait."

Russell let out a dry chuckle, the mockery in his voice nearly tangible. "You're actually struggling to put together a billion? Call me when you have it.Bye."

The line went dead, and all that remained was the  empty dial tone.

Natalie sat in stunned silence, processing what had just happened.

Were people really that rich nowadays?

For the first time, she genuinely wondered if she was just too poor.

Just as her call ended, Daniela's phone rang. "Daniela.Natalie has her sights on Cedric."

Daniela's expression darkened. Her voice turned ice-gold. "She's asking for death."

Russell let out a quiet chuckle. "Not that it matters.She couldn't afford the price, so she backed off."

Daniela wasn't convinced. "She'll find another way.Have Shadow protect Cedric."

After a brief pause, she added with finality, "Starting today."

Russell clicked his tongue. "Daniela, don't you think that's overkill? All this trouble just for Natalie? You really want to send our second-ranked assassin to guard him?"

The first,of course, was Daniela.

"It's necessary."

Russell didn't question it. "Got it!" He turned and called for Shadow without hesitation. Lillian stood beside Daniela,her gaze drifting to Cedric in the distance.He was clearly irritated, barking orders as he arranged security. She couldn't help but comment, "Daniela, are you sure this isn't overkill?Shadow hasn't been assigned to protection duty in years,and Natalie's hardly a real threat."

Daniela's eyes lingered on Cedric, her expression softening, her voice quieter. "You don't understand."

She had hurt him deeply once before. To her, he was beyond value.

As long as she was alive, she wouldn't let anything happen to him.

Lillian tilted her head. "Aren't you going to step in? At this rate, Cedric looks like he's about to set up his own little registration desk for visitors."

Daniela chuckled. "He really isadorable."

Lillian blinked, momentarily thrown off. Did love make people see the world this differently?

In the end, Cedric did exactly what Lillianhad predicted-he dragged a desk to the elevator and stationed himself there. Daniela, unfazed,pulled up a chair and joined him, soaking up the sun at his side.

Cedric was clearly unimpressed, but Daniela made an effort to smooth things over.

No matter how hard he tried to stay irritated,he rouldn't resist her tenderness. When she handed hin  an apple, his resolve wavered.

Daniela propped her chin on her hand, watching him with a quiet smile. Cedric bit into the apple with more force than necessary, muttering. "Don't think I'm letting you off the hook just because you're being nice. You let yourself get hurt. I could've protected you.Why won't you trust me?"

Daniela leaned in and pressed a light kiss to his lips.

Cedric went completely still, stunned into silence.

Lillian folded her arms, shaking her head with an éxaggerated sigh.

Cedric was completely under Daniela's spell.

Natalie stood off to the side, watching as Cedric's ears burned red from Daniela's playful teasing.

Her brows knit together before she scoffed and turned on her heel.

Her thoughts darkened. "Daniela, let's see how long you can keep that smile."

Natalie stormed into Elyse's room, her patience worn thin. "Mom, I'm starting a company, and I need to move some funds. I want to mortgage this villa."

Elyse,busy going over plans for her dream retirement home,barely looked up. Without a second thought,she passed the property deed to Natalie.

Natalie slid a document across the table, flipping to the last page. "Sign here."

Elyse signed without hesitation.

That evening, Natalie wasted no time-she put the villa up for sale.

Meanwhile, Daniela sat with a tablet in hand, her expression unreadable as she stared at the listing. The villa had once been a generous gift from her mother to Elyse.Now, it was being sold off like a meaningless asset. Her gaze turned cold.

Natalie hadn't expected interest in the villa to come so quickly. Just one night after listing, she received an inquiry.

The agent said it was an unknown wealthy buyer,ready to transfer the money the same day.

Natalie wanted to raise the price, but the buyer wouldn't budge. "One billion, not a penny more."

From the corner of her eye, Natalie caught a glimpse of Daniela and Cedric, their intimate exchange twisting something sharp in her gut. She clenched her teeth."Deal."

The transaction was completed before midnight.

As soon as the money hit her account, Natalie turned to the agent. "Who's the buyer?"

Plenty of people had wealth, but not many could pull together a billion in liquid cash overnight. The agent simply smiled. "A private buyer. Their identity is confidential."

Natalie didn't press further. She wired the full amount to Cealmaur's overseas account.

"I've given up everything. Now, do as I say-kill Daniela."
###Chapter 447 What's Making You So Restless
The answer was a simple."OK."

That night, Natalie fell asleep smiling.When she sold the villa,she told the buyer that she would vacate the villa in a week. By then,she assumed Daniela would be dead,and she could move into Daniela's house.

Her next move was clear:take over Harper Group and the local operations of Elite Lux. She pondered whether Cedric would be smart enough to accept her.If he remained oblivious,she would enlist Linden's help to handle him.

Natalie imagined a flawless execution of her plan.

Her sleep was peaceful, her face still wearing that smile.

As she made her way downstairs the following morning.Natalie hummed a melody, her dress cascading gracefully.Elyse watched her with a curious gaze. "What's got you in such high spirits today?"

Offering a forced smile,Natalie remained silent,her expression smug.
Mid-breakfast, Elyse turned to her. "I forgot to ask yesterday.What was that document you had me sign?" Wiping her mouth with a napkin, Natalie responded."Merely a power of attorney."

Unaware of any underlying motives, Elyse said, "What business are you launching on? You know,Brylee gave me this villa as a retirement haven, my safeguard.I must hold on to it."

Looking away, Natalie answered dispassionately."Understood."

Once she finished her breakfast, Natalie set off for work.

Nina had been observing Natalie intently and later slipped into Daniela's office, murmuring, "Something's unusual with Natalie today."

Daniela quirked an eyebrow, amusement flickering across her face. "Is that so?"

Nina explained, "She's unusually cheerful,wearing that lavish dress, and even changed her lipstick shade.Usually, she has a long face. Today,she seems different. Something's wrong."

Daniela simply nodded. "We'll let her keep her mysteries."

Still concerned, Nina kept her gaze sharply on Natalie.

Entering the office casually, Natalie asked, "What mysteries?"

Daniela laughed lightly and asked, "What mysteries? Surely,you know?"

Natalie's smile briefly wavered.

Was Daniela implying something about her?

Natalie remained frozen in a daze, while Daniela abruptly lifted her head, their eyes locking in an instant.

A sharp, unwavering clarity lit up Daniela's eyes.stopping Natalie in her tracks.

"Are you the one keeping mysteries?" Daniela pressed.

Natalie saw Daniela's smile vanish, her expression growing serious.

Her heart skipped a beat, and she stammered, "What do you mean, Daniela? I'm lost."

It was only when Daniela's smile returned that Natalie exhaled in relief.

"Why the worry? I was merely joking," Daniela said.

Natalie exited the office, her heart pounding randomly,a surge of fear washing over her.

At that moment,something in Daniela's look hinted at her deeper awareness.

Natalie took a hearty swig of water, seeking solace.

She let out a laugh, trying to convince herself. "Why should I be scared? Daniela won't be around much longer. What threat could she pose? Surely,she's no match for Cealmaur's mercenaries. Absurd!"

Time slowly ticked away.

Natalie greeted the first day with a broad smile.

Her nerves were steady on that initial day,trusting in Cealmaur.

The second day found Natalie still smiling.

She reassured herself,given it was only day two,that assassination could happen in an instant; patience was key.

Then came the third day.

And the fourth day drifted by.

Yet,all remained quiet.

By the fifth day, Natalie found herself obsessively watching Daniela's office door, anticipating the moment Daniela would meet her unexpected end.

Cealmaur was known for their stealthy executions:escaping their grasp seemed impossible for Daniela.

As the sixth day dawned, doubts began to cloud Natalie's mind. Why was Cealmaur delaying? Did they always operate so close to the wire? Such delays made her question whether the deed would ever be done.Natalie's nerves started to unravel under the weight of her thoughts. Sensing her unease. Nina walked over and asked, "What's making you so restless?

Natalie's voice cut sharp as she yelped.Leave me alone!"

The seventh day arrived.
###Chapter 448 Expulsion

Seconds passed,each one seemingly slower than the last.Yet,nothing happened.

Growing impatient, Natalie attempted to call Cealmaur,only to find the line engaged. With no other options, she sent a text, requesting a callback.

Natalie kept waiting, but instead of hearing from Russell, it was Elyse who called her.

Elyse's voice shook over the phone. "Natalie, it's urgent. Our house is occupied by outsiders. You and Nina need to come back right away."

Natalie had been so sure of herself, and the villa was sold so quickly, that she nearly forgot she'd even put it up for sale.

Upon their arriva1, Nina and Natalie were confronted by an elderly man clutching the property title, saying."Ladies, this property now belongs to my boss. Today marks the final day for you to clear out."

At that moment, Daniela and her friends were just dropping off Nina.

Hearing the old man, Daniela turned to Cedric and inquired, "What's your opinion on this villa?"

Admiring the surroundings, Cedric responded, "It's outstanding. Your mother has exquisite taste. This hillside villa is indeed a rare find, and I've heard its interiors are just as carefully designed."

Nearby, Lillian overheard Daniela say, "Let me know if it catches your fancy."

Cedric, gazing at the elderly man with the deed,felt a strange sense of recognition. As he pondered this familiarity, he absentmindedly said, "I do like it."

After Cedric admitted his fondness, a subtle smile played on Daniela's lips. "Then it's yours-a wedding gift from your mother-in-law."

Cedric snapped his head around. "Huh? What did you just say?"

Meanwhile, Elyse was in a state of panic. She approached Daniela, indifferent to the rain soaking her. Her hair, disheveled and wet, stuck to her face."Daniela,you're well-connected with many friends and lawyers. Can you help me resolve this? It's outright extortion! I never sold the villa. This villa was a valuable gift from your mother. I'd never part with it.not for anything!"

Under the protection of an umbrella held by Cedric,Daniela looked on with a cold gaze. "Is that so?" The gift was valuable, yet it seemed unappreciated.

"Absolutely," Elyse said with conviction. "Selling this villa is something I would never do."

Daniela's gaze fell on Elyse, taking in her disarrayed state, her emotions detached and  cold. "Maybe someone else in your family sold it"

Immediately. Elyse denied the possibility. "No. it couldn't be. Nina is hardly ever home,and Natalie is too well-behaved. She's the jewel ive nurtured: she wouldn't think of selling the villa without my permission."

Daniela nodded. then suggested, "Let's get the police involved."

With that,Daniela was about to pick up her phone.

Elyse stared at Daniela,her eyes pleading.

"Hold off on calling the police. I sold it."

Upon hearing that.Elyse froze, her body rigid with shock for a long moment before she slowly turned to face Natalie, meeting her indifferent stare.

"Mom,I would have inherited everything eventually. It doesn't matter if I claim it now or later. We should get going."

Elyse was utterly shaken. She hadn't foreseen her daughter's scheming, orchestrating such a betrayal.

Natalie continued, "Don't look so betrayed. You've kept your secrets; now we're even. I just took ownership a little sooner. The villa's already been sold.It's not a big deal. I'll make sure we come out ahead financially."

Elyse couldn't grasp that these words were coming from Natalie.

The old man gestured, prompting his people to start removing the items not listed in the sale contract.

It was then that Elyse noticed her beloved antiques and paintings from Brylee were left behind.

Shaking,she asked Natalie, "How much did you get for the villa?"

Natalie responded, "One hundred million."

At that figure,Elyse collapsed.

From a distance, Daniela observed as Elyse and Natalie,clutching their few belongings,exited the villa,a sight of utter defeat.

Amidst the downpour, Daniela's eyes lingered on the mist-enveloped villa, her laughter echoing coldly through the air.

"Mom,do you see? I have retrieved everything from the people who betrayed you."

Elyse was thrown out. With their luggage in tow,she and her daughter headed to the Harper family's villa.

Elyse said to Daniela, "You've let Nina stay; could you accommodate me and Natalie as well?"

A faint smile crossed Daniela's lips.

Misinterpreting this as an agreement, Elyse began to pull her suitcase inside, only to be stopped by Daniela, "I'm sorry, but we don't have any available rooms."

Elyse was skeptical.

Josie stood with a knife, blocking the unwelcome people.

Elyse, feeling a mix of desperation and hope, then turned to Nina. "Nina, there's plenty of space in your room. Could your sister and I join you? We're family after all. It wouldn't be too much to ask, right?"
###Chapter 449 We'll Handle Daniela Immediately
Natalie was reluctant to share a room with Nina.

Cedric's presence,however,changed the situation.

Determined to eliminate Daniela today,Natalie saw an opportunity to simplify matters by moving in immediately.

As Elyse and Ninna discussed arrangements, Natalie's gaze remained locked on Cedric.

Today, he had opted for a black sweater and suit pants, shedding his usual formal office demeanor.

At this moment, he seemed like a traveler at ease.which captivated Natalie completely.

His allure was undeniable.

Natalie resolved that she must make him hers.

But Nina's firm voice broke through her thoughts."I disagree. I'm not comfortable sharing my space with others."

Natalie rolled her eyes dismissively. "You might as well sleep on the couch, and we'll use your room," she said without any embarrassment.

Nina, overwhelmed by anger, quickly moved close       and struck Natalie sharply across the face.

The abruptness of the slap left both Elyse and Natalie dumbfounded.

"Out! Both of you, get out!" Nina yelled, her voice quivering with fury."You'rejustfreeloaders!Worthless!"

As Elyse attempted to fight back, Josie intervened.wielding her knife that caused Elyse to back down immediately.

"Daniela,would you really allow me and Natalie to be without a home? I'm your aunt. It would look terrible for you and Elite Lux if you turned us away," Elyse said.her tone sweet yet underlying it was a clear threat.

Cedric,ready to step in, paused as Daniela offered a tranquil smile. "It wouldn't be right to leave my aunt without a place to stay. Marco." Turning to the driver.she added, "Please take my aunt to the Grand Splendor Hotel and make sure she has everything she needs."

With Daniela's instructions clear, Elyse's eyes gleamed with anticipation.

Known as the city's most extravagant hotel, the Grand Splendor Hotel boasted only the most luxurious presidential suites.

Staying there even for a night cost fifty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars.

With a smile. Daniela inquired, "Aunt, does this  arrangement meet your approval?"

Elyse responded with multiple nods. expressing her satisfaction."Daniela,yourmanagementisimpeccable.

As they departed with Marco, Elyse cheerfully waved farewell to Daniela.

Once out of sight, Elyse asked in a dialect unfamiliar to the driver, "When will the assassin kill Daniela?"

The driver caught a glimpse of this exchange in the rearview mirror.

Elyse's face was marked by a chilling blend of coldness and malice,her features twisted in hatred.

Turning his attention back to the road, the driver remained silent.

At the hotel, the receptionist announced, "Welcome!Your reservation is for one month. We'll need a one million dollar deposit to proceed."

Shock flashed across Elyse's and Natalie's faces."Deposit? For what exactly?"

Maintaining her composure, the receptionist explained."It's required for your stay."

Elyse retorted, "But it was Daniela who sent us here!"

The receptionist's smile faltered as she replied,"Regardless of who made the reservation, the payment remais your responsibility." "Hold on," Natalie interjected. "Daniela directed us here,so why are we being asked to pay?"

The receptionist almost lost her professional demeanor. "The bill is yours to settle, not Ms. Harper's.
Shouldn't you be able to cover your own expenses?"

At a loss for words, Elyse stepped outside to call Daniela.

"Isn't the Grand Splendor Hotel owned by you, Daniela?Why are we being charged for our stay?" Elyse asked,her frustration evident after a taxing day.

"Actually, I pay for my stays too, so you're not an exception,Aunt."

Elyse exhaled slowly.

"Look, Aunt, you'll eventually move to the retirement home, so don't stress about the cost. You can afford this hotel, and it's important for women to indulge themselves,right?"

That settled the matter.

When Elyse reluctantly processed the million-dollar payment, she couldn't help but regret her decision.

Later, back in their room, Natalie called Russell, her voice tight with frustration. "When will Daniela be out of the picture?"

It sounded like Russell was in the middle of a card game. "She's still going to be around because you  haven't paid enough."

Natalie was exasperated. "What the hell are you talking? I transferred a hundred million to you!"

Russell responded distractedly, "Oh, I should mention.there are fees for interbank transfers, and the currency exchange rate complicates things. Let me check... Well, you still need to give us three million."

Natalie was incredulous. "Is this some kind of scam?”

Of course, it was. But Russell didn't say that.

He chuckled and reassured her, "Not at all, we run a legitimate business. Send over the three million,and we'll handle Daniela immediately."
###Chapter 450 Caught In The Act
Natalie quickly checked the balance inher account.

Even after adding Elyse's money, their total assets barely reached five million dollars.

Once she handed over three million,only two million was left-an amount that, in her world, wouldn't even cover the cost of a decent evening gown.

Feeling the financial strain, she turned to Elyse and asked, "Mom, it's time to use your savings."

She was referring to the shares Daniela had given Elyse.

Elite Lux was massive-its dividends alone were enough to support a lavish lifestyle for quite some time.

Elyse's expression turned to shock. "Every penny I have is right here. What savings? Natalie, I barely recognize you these days."

That night, their heated argument escalated like never before.

Unaware,they were being watched by a pair of cold,calculating eyes,silently taking in everything.

rhe next day. Lillian was playing a game on her phono.  while chatting with Daniela. "Natalie is desperate to get rid of you. She's selling designer bags at a flea market just to scrape together three million dollars."

Daniela arched an eyebrow, letting out a low chuckle "I suppose I should thank her for the effort."

A few days later, Natalie stared at her almost empty account and took a deep breath.

With resolve, she transferred the money to Russell and called him. "Hey, the three million's been sent.Check it."

Russell, busy with a game of cards,responded lazily,"Alright, let me see... Yep, three million dollars received."

Just as Natalie was about to press him to take action,Russell's indifferent voice came through. "So, when are you sending the remaining three million?"

Stunned, Natalie nearly shouted, "I just sent you three million!"

Russell's tone remained casual. "Yeah, but the rest of the payment is still missing. You think we don't charge interest?"

Natalie was floored. "Interest? Since when? And why should you make so much money for doing nothing?"

Russell nodded as he replied, "The terms in the contract are straightforward. Didn't you read it? If the principal isn't paid in full, interest is charged on the  whole amount. For a hundred million,three million in interest isn't that big of a deal."

Natalie froze, her eyes scanning the contract in disbelief. "Fine, I'll just find someone else! Give my money back!"

Russell was blunt, his tone cold. "Sure, I'll deduct a hefty processing fee of $50 million and send the rest back to you."

Natalie's heart sank. "You wouldn't dare!"

The sound of cards shuffling on the other end of the Hne abruptly stopped.

A bone-chilling silence followed, and then a deadly.low voice responded, "What did you say?"

A shiver ran down Natalie's spine."I mean once the three million is transferred, you'll kill Daniela,right?There won't be any more charges,huh?"

The sound of cards shuffling resumed on the other end, as if nothing had happened.

Russell's response was almost casual. "Of course.We're professionals."

Natalie ended the call quickly, her mind racing. To avoid more interest, she sold off both her and Elyse's cars.

Elyse, on the edge of tears, couldn't keep her distress in check."Mom,stop crying!" Natalie snapped, her patience thin "It's so annoying! Once Daniela is gone, we'll have everything."

Frustrated and desperate, she called Russell once again.

Russell's voice was laid-back as ever. "Alright, full payment's in. Just wait."

A huge sigh of relief escaped Natalie. "So, how soon will Daniela be gone?"
"As I said, we're professionals. Don't worry. It'll happen soon enough," he responded wvithout a hint of urgency

After hanging up, Natalie smiled with satisfaction.

Elyse, however, was troubled, her brow furrowed.Daniela had already assured her of everything she desired. Yet, after all this chaos, she had lost her favorite car and was still stewing over the villa that had been sold.

She looked at Natalie's profile, feeling more cautious.

It hit her then-Natalie wasn't as easily manipulated as she had thought.

Meanwhile, Daniela entered a charity auction,and as soon as she arrived, the lights dimmed. Someone quietly took a seat across from her.

Lillian nudged Daniela,her voice curious. "Daniela, why is Cedric here?"Daniela, eyes glued to her phone,responded without looking up, "He had a signing ceremony this afternoon He shouldn't be here in Olisvine right now."

Lillian leaned over the seat to get a better look."Huh?Isn't that Cedric?"

Daniela continued typing away on her phone.

As she looked up, the man in the front row stood and made his way towards the front.

From her angle, she could now clearly see the man resembled Cedric.

Lillian spun to Daniela, wide-eyed. "Isn't that him?Why is Cedric here? Why didn't he tell you he was coming? He knows we're here at the auction."

Lillian stood up and was ready to greet him but froze when she saw him walk past everyone and sit next to Joyce in the front row.

Her mouth fell open in surprise. She turned to Daniela,shocked. "When did Cedric get so close to Joyce?"

Whispers buzzed through the room as Lillian and Daniela looked up to see "Cedric" leaning in.whispering intimately to Joyce.

Both Daniela and Cedric were well-known figures in Olisvine.

Not too long ago, Daniela had made a public announcement about her marriage to Cedric, and  everyone knew how deeply he adored her.

So how could he suddenly be so close to Joyce of all people?

Furthermore,everyone in the room turned their gaze from "Cedric" to Daniela.

She was right there, and "Cedric" had been caught in the act,leaning intimately with Joyce.
###Chapter 451 I'll Stay By Daniela's Side For Life
For a brief moment, the drama took center stage, with gossip swirling around the room, completely overshadowing the auction.

"Isn't that Joyce? Daniela's stepsister?"

"Yeah, she's quite the piece of work. First, she took Alexander from Daniela, and now, Cedric. Seems like Joyce's plan is to steal men right from under Daniela's nose."

"It sure looks that way. But wasn't Cedric always indifferent to other women before? Why is he suddenly so close to Joyce, right in front of Daniela?"

"What a mess..."

The whispers grew louder, one voice cutting through."Look,Daniela's standing up."

Immediately, all eyes turned to the back row.

The auctioneer, visibly frustrated, watched as the drama unfolded. The crowd was too captivated to focus on the auction itself.

Right then, Daniela stood up, but Lillian quickly grabbed her arm.

Daniolo claneed ouor her face hetraving no emotion Lillian glanced around at the curious looks and whispered, "There are too many people here Confronting them now would be embarrassing. Why not wait and ask Cedric what's going on later?"

Daniela shook her head and made her way to the front row. "I need to see who that is."

Lillian followed,still confused. "Huh? Isn't that Cedric?Who else would it be? Daniela, there are too many eyes on us today. Maybe you should think about Cedric's dignity. This could just be a misunderstanding."

Daniela smiled at her	suggestion.	"No misunderstanding."

Just as Lillian was about to voice her surprise, Daniela continued, "No. It's not him."

Lillian gasped, but before she could say anything else.they saw "Cedric" suddenly stand up, fasten his suit,and walk off in a different direction.

Daniela froze for a moment and scrutinized the man once again.

Indeed, his face was undeniably identical to Cedric's.as was his demeanor, from the way he buttoned his suit to his confident stride as he walked away.

Before Daniela could inspect the man further,a sharp.taunting voice interrupted. "Look who it is, my high-and-mighty stepsister.What brings you here?"

Invce sat in the front row,legs crossed,swinging then with a smug smile on her face.

Lillian frowned,her voice growing sharp. "Who was that just now?"

Joyce couldn't help but feel pleased. With a sly smile she responded,"Why? Are you getting nervous?"

Joyce's voice rang out, loud enough to draw the attention of everyone in theroom,even pausing the auctioneer mid-sentence.

"Oh, the one who just walked out? That was Cedric Don't tell me you don't even recognize your own husband,Daniela."

Lillian couldn't hold back. "What nonsense are you spewing? That wasn't Cedric!"

"Are you really that sure?" Joyce patted her trousers as though wiping away invisible dust, wearing the same smug grin she'd had when she sabotaged Daniela's wedding with Alexander. "Sorry, Daniela, I didn't mean to. Blame Cedric for being too handsome."

Lillian rolled up her sleeves and stepped forward.delivering a sharp slap across Joyce's face.

Joyce's head snapped to the side, with blood trickling from her mouth.

In front of the stunned crowd, she began to sob."Daniela, you couldn't hold on to your man, so why blame me? Cedric and I are in love. Please, let us be together." Without waming,Joyce dramatically dropped to her knees before Daniela,her act in full swing.

Immediately,the crowd pulled out their phones.eager to capture the moment.

Before anyone could take a photo, Daniela grabbed Joyce by the arm and shoved her backstage.

The onlookers, craning their necks, could only catch a glimpse of Daniela's back as she disappeared behind the curtains.

As the audience dispersed. Joyce dropped her pretenses, a sneer curling on her lips. "What,Daniela?Are you scared I'll ruin your husband's reputation? But Cedric's already cheated on you. Why are you still defending him? Why not step aside and let me have him? Just like you did with Alexander, walking away without a second thought. Be as tough and quick as you were with him, making those men who hurt you regret it. Daniela, didn't you always act so bold and decisive?"

Joyce eyed Daniela, her phone hidden behind her back as she dialed a number.

Daniela noticed but didn't care in the slightest. "That wasn't Cedric."

Joyce paused for a beat, then burst into wild laughter."Daniela, I never imagined you'd end up like this. You can't even face the truth. What's wrong? Have you really fallen for Cedric and can't bring yourself to let  him go?"

"Yes," Daniela replied, standing firm under the harsh backstage lights. "I can't bear it, but that man wasn't Cedric."

Joyce crossed her arms, and a mocking smile played on her lips. "What makes you so sure? Everyone saw it; even your little lackey noticed."

Without hesitation, Lillian rushed over and slapped Joyce once more.

Joyce spat out a mix of blood and a tooth,glaring at Eillian with intense hatred. "Daniela, no matter how much you have people beat me, it won't change the fact that the man just now was Cedric."

Daniela responded, "You already know the truth.don't care what you're up to, but I suggest you stop.This tooth is your warning. Next time, it won't just be a tooth."

With that, Daniela gave Joyce a cold look and walked away.

As soon as she was out of sight,Joyce slammed her fist down onto the table in frustration.

The call was still connected. Joyce grabbed the phone and spoke into it. "Did you hear that, Alexander? Back then, Daniela had no problem moving on from you,but now with Cedric, she can't let go. Even though it's so obvious, she doesn't have the guts to admit it.If you were here, you'd see the look on Daniela's face She doesn't love you; she only loves Cedric. So, the only way you'll stay close to her is if you're Cedric."

On the other end of the line, Alexander's voice was icy. "I'll stay by Daniela's side for life, even if it means living as Cedric."
###Chapter 452 Shadow From Cealmaur
Alexander longed to be entangled with Daniela across countless lifetimes.

Joyce's lips formed a sinister sneer.

Over the phone, Alexander said, "The mercenary we've hired will handle Cedric tonight. From now on.there will only be one Cedric in this world."

And he would be the only Cedric that Daniela loved.

Joyce flashed a devilishly charming smile and said to Alexander, "Wait for me at home."

Joyce rushed back home, captivated by Alexander's current appearance. Her interest in him had been reignited.

She undressed Alexander and kissed him on the lips.

As she drove home with Daniela, Lillian frowned and said, "Daniela, that was Cedric just now. You denied it was him to save his face, didn't you?"

Daniela looked at Lillan with surprise."Why would you think that?"

Lillian looked even more surprised than Daniela "Daniela, it's just us here. Why won't you admit it was Cedric? You used to not hold back like this."  Daniela laughed."I already told you; that wasn't Cedric

"How could it not be? I saw it with my own eyes."

After Lillian spoke, she observed Daniela's smiling face and thought that Daniela must have been so shocked she was in denial, unable to confront the truth.

The driver added his voice to the conversation. "I saw it from a distance at the entrance. It looked exactly like Mr. Phillips."

Lillian nodded in agreement.

Daniela smiled but remained silent.

The car started up and made its way to Daniela's villa.

Cedric was already there waiting outside. As Lillian stepped out, she squinted and exclaimed, "Cedric.you're in trouble!"

Cedric had already come across the news online.

He was utterly stunned. As he clicked on the photos,a video appeared showing him. The way he was dressed, his movements, and even his small habits,were exactly like his.

If Cedric hadn't been completely sure he had stayed at the signing event the whole time, he might have wondered if he had somehow sleepwalked his way to the auction.

"Honey, it really wasn't me," Cedric confessed,feeling  a sense of guilt. "Really, listen to me. I was at the signing event all evening."

Daniela turned her gaze to him. "I trust you."

"I know it's hard to believe, but I was at the signing event. My colleagues can back me up. You might think they're just covering for me, but I can show you the surveillance footage.You know-What?" Cedric stopped. He looked at Daniela, who was still smiling at him. "You said... you trust me? You know that wasn't me?"

Daniela nodded. "Yes."

"Why?" Cedric was shocked by Daniela's certainty,especially since after the news broke, everyone at Phillips Group assumed he had fallen for Joyce.

Even his grandmother had called to scold him harshly.How could Daniela be so sure it wasn't him?

"First, I know you wouldn't do that."

What she meant was, that even if everyone else turned against her, she trusted that he would remain loyal.He would always be by her side.

"Second,remember when you rescued me from the fire at my wedding with Alexander? You got a burn on the inside of your wrist. Even though the scar has lightened from treatments, I noticed the man tonight didn't have that scar." It was because of that scar that Daniela realized that man was not Cedric.

Cedric gazed at Daniela, his eyes filled with tears, like a child who had been wronged but suddenly found peace in the comforting presence of a loved one."Today,it felt like everyone misunderstood me."

Under the glow of the street lamps, Daniela smiled.walked over to Cedric, embraced him,and whispered,"I'll make sure justice is served for the injustices you've faced."

Ryan stood by the entrance, tilting his head towards Lillian. "See? Daniela really is remarkable. Cedric will never leave her side in this lifetime."

Winning a man's heart held more power than any physical attraction ever could.

Lillian clicked her tongue and gave a thumbs up."Impressive."

Meanwhile,as Joyce and Alexander were caught up in their own drama, Joyce's phone rang.

Out of breath, Joyce answered, "So, is Cedric dead?"

The voice on the other end was cold. "What sort of trouble have you dragged me into? Are you doing this intentionally? You're not trying to buy Cedric's life:you're after mine, aren't you?"

Joyce regained her composure a bit. She pushed Alerander away and stood up. "What are vou talking about?"

"What am I talking about? Do you have any idea who Cedric has for protection?"

Confused,Joyce asked,"What?"

"Shadow from Cealmaur, an elite bodyguard known for his stealth and his ability to make kills without leaving a trace.Compared to Shadow, I'm just a rookie.You know what? Forget it. Find someone else! This is a disaster!"

The call ended.

A cold wind drifted in from outside.

Joyce looked serious.

Alexander stood up. "What's the matter?"

Joyce turned her head and stared into the night, lost in thought as she looked at his face that resembled Cedric's.

Was there more to Cedric than just being a businessman? Did he have another powerful background?
###Chapter 453 Teach Him A Lesson
Natalie ignored the rumors floating around online.

She was entirely focused on when Daniela would meet her end.

Yet, as another week went by, Daniela remained very much alive.

"Are you a scam artist?" Natalie shouted angrily at Russell.

"How could that be? You're thinking too much. We are professionals."

Natalie snapped back, "Then why is Daniela still breathing?"

"Oh, I forgot to tell you, the money you provided was just an initial payment.You need to send over another three million."

Natalie was furious when she heard this. "Another three million? Will your demands ever end?"

If she had known the cost would be so high, she might have considered handling Daniela's disposal herself.

"Three million is nothing. Daniela is the world's vealthiest woman worth billions. Surely vou aren't  short three million?" Russell asked her.

Natalie rolled her eyes. She was running low on funds.

She had been so sure that Cealmaur would kill Daniela soon that she had been spending freely, even after selling her villa.

Recently, she had sold her car, designer handbags, and jewelry, and now, she had nothing left to sell.

Elyse had always been under Brylee's wing, and as Elyse's daughter, Natalie had never experienced the struggle of having no money.

Her desperate situation was driving her to the edge,and Natalie found herself wishing more than ever for Daniela's swift end.

"Are you requesting a loan from me?" Daniela was amused by the idea when she heard it.

Natalie wanted her dead, was out of funds, and was now approaching her for a loan.

What a clever plan!

Natalie thought that once she was gone, she wouldn't need to repay the loan.

"Yes." Natalie kept up her proud demeanor even while asking for money. "I'm running a bit low on funds.Could you lend me five million, Daniela?"

Daniela laughed. She remembered Russell mentioning to Natalie that thev needed an additional three million. "What could you possibly need all that money for?she asked.

Natalie tightened her lips. "What I use the money for is my own business. I'l pay you back at some point.You have so much money, a few million here and there shouldn't bother you. In fact, giving it to me wouldn't make a difference,right?"

Daniela gave a slight smile. "That's not quite true."

Natalie paused for a moment. "What? Are you pretending to be poor?"

Daniela answered. "Not exactly. It's just that my family is very strict with money."

Natalie was surprised."What do you mean?"

Daniela wore a concerned look. "My husband doesn't allow unnecessary spending."

Natalie appeared irritated."What?"

She stared in disbelief at Cedric, who had just entered the room. "You're a grown man, and you dare to control my cousin's finances?"

Cedric looked over at Daniela, who quickly winked at him.He nodded."Yes, your cousin earns money well.but I need to manage it. With so many people competing for her attention, I need to ensure our security."

Natalie was caught off guard by Cedric's sharp insight Daniela always appeared so strong, yet here she was,seemingly controlled by her husband.

"So,Cedric,could you lend me five million?" Natalie's voice became gentler.

Cedric opened his laptop and responded with politeness, "Of course, we're family. A few million is nothing to us."

Natalie smiled broadly and nodded eagerly. "So when will you send the money?"

Natalie, eager to see Daniela out of the picture,continued, "Cedric, with your large company,you could transfer the funds immediately,couldn't you?"

Cedric nodded."Yes."

Natalie was thrilled. She was about to call the finance department when Cedric suddenly asked, "What do you plan to offer as collateral?"

Natalie's smile froze, and her grip on the phone tightened. She stared at Cedric, stunned. "What?You need collateral?"

Cedric looked at her calmly. "Of course,loans require collateral."

Natalie was taken aback. "But you just said we're family."

Cedric nodded once more. "Even among family,it's important to  keep things clear and manage them  properly. So, what can you provide as collateral?"

"The villa? Hmmm... It's sold. Your handbags? The one you're holding is second-hand, only worth a few thousand,not nearly enough. And jewelry...You don't have any left." Cedric looked up at Natalie. "So, what will you use for collateral?"

Natalie gasped. She felt Cedric wasn't truly planning to lend her the money; instead, he seemed to be using this as a chance to embarrass her.

"Daniela, won't you intervene?" Natalie walked over to Daniela. "We're cousins. I'm definitely on your side.Honestly, you shouldn't let Cedric manage all your finances. Didn't you see the news yesterday? Cedric was involved with Joyce. How can you still entrust him with so much money? You need to be more careful.Women shouldn't trust men with their money;keep it yourself. Or better yet, let me handle it. I've come across some excellentinvestment opportunities lately.Let me show them to you. What do you say?"

Natalie looked seriously at Daniela. "I mean it. Men can be dishonest. Don't trust them too much. Trust me instead. Hand the money over to me,will you?"

Cedric stood up, left the room, and slammed the door behind him, the sound echoing throughout the office.

Natalie pointed at Cedric's vanishing figure and growled, "Daniela, did you see that? Money really changes people. Cedric has the nerve to disrespect you like that! You need to teach him a lesson!"
###Chapter 454 | Like Saving The Best For Last
Natalie stared at Daniela, her eyes brimming with anticipation.

Daniela cupped her chin with one hand,her expression indifferent. "Really? I actually like the bad boy type."

Natalie groaned,exasperated. "Daniela, you're not exactly the hopeless romantic type. Money matters,you know.How does Cedric have such a hold on you?"

Daniela shrugged. "I didn't realize it before, but I guess I am a romantic after all."

Natalie sighed, feeling utterly defeated as Daniela's proud expression lingered.

She departed Daniela's office, only to be stopped at the door. A hand extended a sleek black card towards her."Five million!"

Natalie turned, her eyes narrowing at the ugly face before her. "Spend a night with me, and it's all yours.Natalie."

Natalie scoffed, her chin lifting defiantly. "What a joke!Linden,do you think I'd sell my dignity for five million?Pathetic." Linden watched Natalie retreat with cold amusement She carried herself with pride.Yet, he found himself drawn to that pride.

He thought it would be fascinating to watch her submit someday.

A dark, twisted smile crept across Linden's face.

Natalie never thought she'd lose sleep over five million,let alone borrow from friends.

They all avoided the topic, leaving Natalie seething with frustration. In the end, none of them could be counted on.

"Natalie, we're strapped too. Our allowances barely cover us. But there's a way to make quick money.Are you interested?"

Natalie shot her friend a skeptical glance. "What way?"

"Attending those exclusive parties hosted by the wealthy, and staying for three days and nights.A hundred thousand dollars a night."

Natalie sneered. "So, basically, selling yourself.Those men are vile. They'll chew you up and spit yo out."

Natalie carried herself with a sense of superiority,believing virtue was priceless. Men like that could only dream of touching her. If they thought they could get anywhere near her, they'd better start dreaming.

"You highly regard yourself, but do you want the money?" her friend snapped. "If you're willing to go I'll make sure they offer you more money. Natalie,with your looks, you'd make double. It's a waste not to put it to use."

Natalie spat, her voice icy. "I'm not lowering my standards entertaining men."

Born into high society, she had seen it all.

She refused to stoop to those decadent gatherings where the rich reveled in their indulgence and depravity.

Natalie strode off, her face set in determination, while Ker friend watched her retreating form with a bitter,almost contemptuous sneer. "You'll be crawling back eventually,"she muttered.

Desperation led Natalie to see Cedric.

She stood before him, head bowed,biting her lip."Cedric, I'm in trouble. I need to borrow some money.Please."

She stationed herself at the entrance of the Elite Lux building, blocking Cedric's way. Dressed in a daring,low-cut evening gown with a thigh-high slit, she exuded an air of allure and seduction.

Natalie had made up her mind.

If she had to cross this line, it had to be someone as striking as Cedric, not some pot-bellied, balding man.

She convinced herself that sleeping with Cedric felt  like a huge win.

Cedric frowned, his face twisted with a look of repulsion.

"Cedric, I'm untouched. You could be my first.Teach and guide me in bed."

Natalie's face held a delicate, innocent allure that effortlessly drew attention. She knew exactly when she appeared at her most captivating.

Cedric's face remained stone-cold as he gestured to a security guard, who had been staring in shock,and signaled him over.

"Yes,Mr.Phillips."

"Throw this woman out. Make sure she never steps foot in Elite Lux again."

Natalie's face drained of color as shock washed over her."Cedric,I..."

Before she could finish, the security guard roughly seized Natalie and dragged her out.

The door of Elite Lux slammed shut behind her and Natalie couldn't believe her eyes.

It wasn't at all how she had imagined it.

In the darkness, Linden asked, "Now that Natalie's been thrown out of Elite Lux, are you really still not going to help me?" Elyse stared across the road at Natalie, her makeup smudged by tears. "Why would I trust you?"

Linden smiled, his expression calm. "Because I'm Daniela's family doctor and she trusts me."

Elyse's eyes narrowed, a shadow passing over her expression. Maybe Daniela suspected her connection to Brylee's death.Why else would she refuse to help Natalie with the money she required?

If Daniela knew the truth, Elyse knew she would have to have Daniela killed.

"One night," Linden said, his tongue flicking over his lips. "As long as Natalie willingly spends one night with me,I'll kill Daniela for you."

Elyse hesitated, then nodded. "Deal."

Linden smiled, glancing at Elyse. "Do you think Natalie will obey your request? Oh, let me clarify something.Don't pull any tricks with masks. I want to confirm it's really her this time."

Elyse's plan was exposed, and her fury simmered."What are you implying? Did I trick you before? Isn't Nina my daughter? Didn't she sleep with you? Linden,you've gone too far!"

Linden chuckled darkly. "Killing Daniela's too risky.I honestly miss the first time. How about you let me have both girls?" But Linden wasn't done. His grin widened,dripping with mockery as he stared at Elyse. "Or you could join us."

Seeing Elyse's calm demeanor. Linden let out a hearty laugh. "Alright then, how about this? I still prefer Natalie. If you don't trust me, how about you and Nina serve me for a night first? Once that's done, then let Natalie sleep with me. How does that sound?"

Linden grinned wickedly. "I like saving the best for last."

Elyse's stomach churned with utter disgust.
###Chapter 455 Why Are You Nervous
Elyse felt having Daniela killed couldn't be delayed any longer. There was no time to waste.

Elyse headed straight to Nina's place.

But Nina was not there.Instead,she found Daniela.

Elyse looked past Daniela, noticing that Lillian, who was usually by her side, was not there.

A thought crossed her mind.

Daniela was even more appealing to Linden than Nina.

She knew Linden had been coveting Daniela for quite some time.

Elyse approached with a smile that hid her true intentions. "Daniela, Nina isn't here, but perhaps I can speak with you instead."

Daniela looked surprised. "Oh? What brings you here.Aunt Elyse?"

As her smile slowly disappeared, Elyse let out a sigh."I've been going through a hard time lately, Daniela.Are you available tonight? I used to talk to your mother when I felt this way. Now that she's no longer here,maybe we could talk. Would that be alright?" Elyse was aware of Daniela's deep commitment to her family.

She knew bringing up anything else wouldn't help.

Daniela was typically distant, but mentioning Brylee might change her mind.

"Alright, Aunt Elyse," Daniela answered, much to Elyse's delight.
"Good girl, I'm so pleased. Come on, hop in the car."Elyse kindly swung open the car door for Daniela.

Without warning, the villa's door burst open and Cedric walked out.

Elyse's heart raced, and she quickly helped Daniela into the car.

Before Cedric could get to them, Elyse quickly told the driver,"Drive! Quickly!"

Cedric closed the gap in a few long strides.
He pulled at the door handle, finding it locked. His eyes narrowed, and just as he was about to command the driver to open it, Daniela's hand covered his.
From inside the car, Daniela looked up at him with a smile. "Aunt Elyse said she's been feeling down. I'll stay with her. Please wait for me at home, okay?"

How could Cedric be at ease? Naturally,he was unwilling to be with Elyse alone. Daniela tightened her hold on Cedric's hand. "Don't worry. I'll retumn soon." Then, she straightened up and instructed the driver, "Drive."

Elyse noticed the confusion on Cedric's face,a brief and snobbish smile passing across hers.

Had Cedric known that he was unknowingly sending Daniela into another man's bedroom,he might have regretted it deeply later.

The thought brought Elyse a rush of excitement.

"Aunt Elyse, where are we headed?" Daniela suddenly asked.

Elyse looked down, quickly sending texts to Linden and Natalie, letting them know Daniela would be at the hotel in thirty minutes.

Upon receiving the text, Linden hurriedly took another shower.

Natalie quickly reached out to all the media outlets in Olisvine.

The news of Elite Lux's CEO entangled in a disgraceful affair with a disgraceful man would severely damage the company's image.

She aimed for Daniela to lose everything by dawn,including Cedric's love.

Inside the car, Elyse grinned at Daniela. "Cedric is a high-powered CEO, yet he's quite clingy, don't you  think? Daniela, is it true that he handles all your finances? That's not ideal. We're family, so here's some sincere advice. You should control your own money. If you're too busy to manage your assets,could help. I managed your mother's finances, after all."

That was indeed true. Elyse had gained a considerable profit after Brylee's death.

Daniela looked out the window, her expression unreadable. "Really? Aunt Elyse, what do you think was going through my mother's mind before she jumped from that building? Did she leave any desires unfulfilled? Any resentments unresolved?"

Elyse was caught off guard by Daniela's sudden change of subject. Her face tensed up. "Well, your mother was quite ill before her death. Perhaps in a way,her passing was a form of freedom."

Elyse wanted to steer away from this discussion."Daniela, please consider my advice about your finances. It's odd, isn't it? You're a significant CEO, yet you need Cedric's permission to lend a few million to your cousin. Isn't that silly?"

Daniela gazed at the landscape zooming past, silent for a brief moment. Then, she suddenly asked, "Aunt Elyse, if my mother were still here, and knowing how much she hated misdeeds, she would make sure those who had terrible things to her faced horrible consequences,wouldn't she?" As she spoke, Daniela turned her head.

In the window's reflection, with the landscape slipping away, Elyse saw a face that bore a striking resemblance to Brylee's. Her heart involuntarily skipped a beat. "You..."

Daniela laughed lightly. "Aunt Elyse, why are you nervous? I'm only kidding."

The car pulled up at the entrance of a hotel.

Elyse said, "The coffee here is outstanding. You should try it."

Daniela walked in with her.

As they entered the hotel, Cedric made a call. Daniela glanced at the caller ID, sent a quick reply, and then silenced her phone.
###Chapter 456 You Weren't Hypnotized
Cedric was just about to step out of the house when Lillian caught his arm."Daniela knows what she's doing.Cedric,stay home."

But sitting still wasn't an option for him-he felt like he was losing his mind.

Elyse's expectant gaze had been full of scheming, and now that she was backed into a corner, there was no telling what she might do.

The thought alone made Cedric restless; he couldn't relax,not even for a moment. "Just tell me-what is Daniela up to?"

Lillian stepped in front of him, holding up a hand."Just wait for Daniela. She'll explain everything when she gets back."

Cedric let out a bitter laugh. "She never does." She always carried the weight of everything by herself.

In that instant,it hit him-Daniela had never truly seen him as her husband, or even as family. 

Meanwhile, in the hotel room, Linden's eyes lit up with excitement as he stared at Daniela lying unconscious in the bed. "Daniela! It's really her! How did you pull this off?" Elyse folded her arms and smirked. "Pull it off? Oh please. As her aunt, all it took was inviting her for a simple coffee. She walked right into it."

Linden's excitement was obvious, but he also looked a little disappointed. "Shame she's knocked out.It'd be much more entertaining if she were awake."

Elyse smirked mischievously. "Relax. She's being hypnotized. She'll wake up soon, completely convinced you're Cedric, and trust me, she'll be all over you."

That instantly lifted Linden's mood.

Impatience took over as he began stripping off his clothes. "Live fast, die young! Daniela, here I come!"

He shot a look at Elyse. "Hey, old lady, why are you still here?"

Elyse eyed his restless energy and let out a cold chuckle. "Don't worry. Once she wakes up,you'll have more than enough time to enjoy. The hypnosis lasts fifteen hours-plenty for your little game."

Linden let out a laugh.

Elyse added, "After tonight, you'd better keep your word and get rid of Daniela like I asked. If you don't.I'll make sure you regret it."

Linden dismissed her with a casual wave,signaling her to go. Just then, Daniela's phone buzzed, and Linden glanced at the caller ID-Cedric.

A smirk crossed his face as he snapped a picture of Daniela in the bed. With a wicked grin, he typed,"Your wife,my bed."

On her way out,Elyse peeked through the gap in the door, catching sight of Linden slipping off his pants.

A cold sneer formed on her lips.

Brylee? Daniela? What did it matter?

in the end, they all fell apart at her hands.

Elyse shut the door with a soft click and headed downstairs to meet Natalie.

By the time Daniela and Linden were finished,the lobby would be crawling with reporters.

The mere thought of it made a sinister smile creep across Elyse's lips.

Inside the room, Linden stood in nothing but his underwear.

He was just about to act when Daniela's eyes fluttered open.

Linden was still caught up in his excitement, thinking she was under hypnosis. He waved his hands eagerly,completely unaware of what was coming. But in the blink of an eye, everything turned pitch black-someone had thrown something over his head.

A second later, he found himself tied to a chair with a white bed sheet.

Linden had no idea what had just happened. He didn't even try to fight back. Instead, he stared at her,utterly mesmerized. "Daniela, playing rough,are we?"

Daniela cast him a brief glance and smiled faintly.

Linden was completely entranced.

After making sure he was firmly restrained, Daniela dragged a chair over and sat down in front of him.

Linden sat there,waiting,convinced she'd take the lead.

Silence stretched between them until Linden finally frowned, his eyes locking onto Daniela's calm,steady gaze.

"You weren't hypnotized? Who the hell are you?"

As a doctor, he quickly sensed that something was very,very wrong.

"No way! The guy Elyse hired is one of the best-there's no chance the hypnosis didn't work. Daniela,what kind of trick are you pulling?" Daniela tilted her head slightly, her fingers reaching for the fruit knife resting on the table. Linden flinched and instinctively shrank back. "What are you doing? Listen, Daniela, you know murder is a crime, right? You're the richest person in the world-there's no need to get your hands dirty over me."

Daniela leaned back, effortlessly spinning the fruit knife in her hand.
###Chapter 457 | Am Your Loyal Servant
Daniela's grin carried a hint of irony. It was cold,almost chilly.

Gulping,Linden stammered, "Daniela, no, Ms. Harper,I need to explain."

He had long viewed Daniela as merely a wealthy but delicate woman. Despite her assertive tactics,he thought it was her team that truly wielded the power.allowing her to achieve her goals.

Without her team, he believed Daniela would be powerless.

Linden had even entertained the thought that Daniela's disappearance would go unnoticed.

Yet, in this moment, he realized his misconception. A woman who had climbed to the CEO position of a top global firm must possess significant personal strength.

Her striking features had obscured the evident truths.

Though Linden was driven by desire, he valued his life above all.

Desperately. Linden explained, "Ms. Harper, I assure you, I had no part in this. I wanted Nina. I was clueless about why Elyse dragged you here instead. Elyse is  greedy.but I am not involved."

Daniela's expression did not waver. She idly played with a knife, her lips curving into a mysterious, subtle smile.

"Ms.Harper,wvhat are you implying? Please, I'm telling the truth. Check my phone. It was Elyse,that deceitful woman, who couldn't locate Nina and substituted you because you were available. This wasn't my plan."

Only in his underpants. Linden shivered as the cold air rushed in from the open window. Daniela had tied him to a chair.

"Ms.Harper.please can you say something?"

Daniela released a chilling laugh. She gazed at Linden and whispered,"Did you know? When wealthy people commit murder,someone always cleans up. It's like it never happened."

Linden's face paled, his eyes wide with fear.

"Elyse mentioned she couldn't find Nina,but found me instead. You were okay with that, weren't you?"she added.

Linden didn't know how to defend himself this time."1...”

"How would you like to meet your end? It's your choice," Daniela murmured with a smile that was both alluring and dangerous, like a beautiful yet deadly rose, leaving Linden frozen with fear.

"Do you prefer falling from the 48th floor or perhaps drowning in a bathtub suits you better? Or shall we arrange an accidental electrocution? That last one's quick-over in seconds. You wouldn't feel a thing.What do you think?"

Daniela's manner of listing the death options was as casual as one might discuss the day's weather.

Shaking uncontrollably, Linden pleaded, "Ms. Harper.please understand,I had no part in this.Elyse promised me time with Nina in exchange for a favor,but murder was never my intention,I promise you that!"

A slight smile played on Daniela's lips, her voice light "Really now?"

Linden gave a frantic nod. Without a word, Daniela pulled out her phone and began to play back recordings of every conversation Linden had shared with Elyse and Natalie.

Linden's eyes bulged with realization as he faced Daniela. "You've known everything all this time! Then why...?”

With a soft laugh, Daniela replied, "Why did I allow myself to be brought here today? I was curious to see whether you were behind the attempt on my life or if it was those two women."

A cold shiver ran through Linden. Stuttering,he insisted, "It wasn't me, I swear. I would never dare." Daniela eyed him, amusement in her gaze. "Really?"

Again. Linden nodded eagerly. "Absolutely! I am at your command. Whatever you need, I'll do it. It's them -they're the threat,not me. They wanted to kill you!Ms. Harper, let me assist you with your investigation.Just,please,spare my life."

Again,Daniela's chuckle was soft yet chilling.

Downstairs, Natalie was engrossed with her phone.
pulling up live feeds from the hotel's room camera.
Squinting,she murmured,"Where could they be?"
###Chapter 458 Could You Have Made A Mistake
Elyse tilted her head, a brief frown creasing her face before quickly composing herself.

"They're here," Elyse murmured,pointing to the mirror's faint reflection.

"Did Daniela tie up Linden? Who would've guessed she had such a wild side?" Elyse sneered,a mocking smile Curling on her lips.

The room was dimly lit, with shadowy figures appearing blurred and indistinct in the mirror.

Natalie strained to see more clearly, but the figures in the mirror flickered and faded,disappearing without a trace.

"Mom,do you think something might go wrong?"Natalie asked, her voice tinged with unease.

She had spent considerable time with Daniela recently and genuinely sensed that Daniela was far from an ordinary person.

Elyse waved off her concern with a dismissive shrug."What could go wrong?Daniela's been hypnotized.I saw her myself,sprawled across Linden's bed. When I left, he was already on top of her.How could that possibly be fake?" Natalie frowned. "And Daniela didn't react at all?"

Elyse chuckled and said, "What reaction could she possibly have? I had to sell everything I owned just to afford that expensive hypnotist, all to ensure our plan went smoothly."

Natalie glanced at the security feed, eyes narrowing at the empty room displayed on the screen.
"Stop obsessing over that. The camera angle is limited.They're probably tucked away in a corner somewhere."Elyse's laugh was sharp, edged with something brittle.

With a careless flick of her hand, she ordered an expensive bottle of wine she couldn't afford.

"Come on, Natalie. This might take a while. Why deny ourselves a little luxury? This bottle costs over eight hundred grand.I've been dyingto try it."

Elyse signaled the waiter to uncork the bottle,but Natalie reached out stopping him. She advised, "Mom.maybe we shouldn't rush to celebrate just yet. If something goes wrong, we won't even be able to pay for this wine."

They barely had eighty thousand left, let alone eight hundred thousand.

Russell had been breathing down their necks,demanding the rest of his payment.

The sting of an empty wallet had become all too tomiliar to Natalie
Elyse scoffed,prying Natalie's hand from the waiter's arm."Open it," she snapped, then ordered a round of overpriced steaks.

As she dug into her meal,Elyse spoke through bites."Life's too short so we should indulge in the finer things.Once Linden's done, I'll have him kill Daniela.After that,everything she owns will be ours."

Natalie's brow furrowed. "I'm just worried Linden might not have the guts to do it."

Elyse threw her head back, laughing. "Oh, he will. He knows the consequences if he doesn't."

Her gaze lingered on her daughter,noting the striking resemblance to Daniela. "And when Cedric's heart shatters over losing his beloved wifa, he'll marry you Before long. Daniela's and Cedric's fortunes will be yours.You'll have everything you ever dreamed ofl"

Elyse was brimming with dreams of what the future held.

Natalie's tension eased, a smile slowly spreading across her face.

Meanwhile, reporters invited to the hotel to take photos arrived early, their cameras slung over their shoulders.

Elyse welcomed them with lavish hospitality.pouring fine wine like it grew on trees.  courteously interviewed Elyse.

"Ms. Dury, can you confirm if your information is accurate? Is Daniela truly cheating on Cedric?"

Elyse nodded solemnly, feigning regret. "I couldn't believe it myself at first. A close friend, an executive here, saw it firsthand and told me. It's unfortunate for the family. But I suppose it's understandable. Daniela lost her mother at a young age, grew up without parental guidance, and endured long-term abuse from her stepmother, Katrina. It's no wonder her way of thinking is so different from most people."

Á bespectacled reporter leaned forward, eyeing Elyse intently."I've heard Daniela's affair is with her family doctor.Is that true?"

Elyse sighed dramatically. "Yes. I was the one who introduced the doctor to her. The guilt eats at me."

She put on her best sincere face. "I didn't invite you here to spread rumors. Cheating is wrong and I hope Daniela realizes her mistake and mends her ways.I know you're all reporters, but please, I ask that you don't write anything misleading."

The reporters exchanged knowing glances, nodding in agreement. "Of course."

But one reporter frowned. "When I was at Elite Lux for an interview, I saw Linden. He looked particularly unappealing.Why would Daniela be interested in him?Is there more to this than you're letting on?" Elyse's expression stiffened, but she quickly masked any sign of anger in front of the reporters.

With a smile, she responded, "There's no hidden story.They were constantly exchanging glances at the company. I couldn't even bear to watch them."

The reporter wasn't convinced. "Considering Daniela's taste in men, I doubt she'd fall for Linden. With her current status, finding a handsome man would be a breeze. So why him?" The reporter pulled out his phone,showing a picture of Linden. "Look, everyone,here's Linden. And this photo is clearly photoshopped.He looks uglier in person."

Many of the reporters hadn't given Linden much thought before. Now, seeing the photo, they were all taken aback, their expressions filled with shock. "Is this Linden?"

Everyone turned to Elyse, their eyes sharp with doubt."Ms. Dury, could you have made a mistake? Maybe they're just conducting business upstairs. Surely,Daniela wouldn't choose a man like that."
###Chapter 459 Time To Start Working
Fury burned in Elyse's eyes, her face contorted as she struggled to contain her anger.

With a deep sigh, she sought to calm her voice."Well.people have different tastes, don't they? Daniela might favor men who are strikingly handsome or quite the opposite. It's hard to say for sure."

Noticing the reporter gearing up to ask another question, Elyse quickly rose and offered a fleeting smile. "Could we perhaps discuss this privately?"

She discreetly slid the last ten thousand dollars she had into his pocket, prompting a compliant grin from the reporter.

Reporters, sharp as ever, quickly caught on to Elyse's intentions.

They shared knowing smiles and went on to order dish after dish without restraint.

By morning, when Natalie and her mother saw the bill,they almost gasped in shock.

The bill totaled a staggering five million dollars.

"This is outrageous!" Natalie scowled, poised to confront them. However,Elyse held her back. "Let it go. Once Daniela is out of the picture, this will be just a small expense for Elite Lux. These journalists have influence, and we'll need their support to shape our image after she's gone."
Exhaling sharply, Natalie rolled her eyes. "They act like parasites! I'll reclaim every dime once I take over."

Elyse brushed off the concern with a wave of her hand and said, "It's time. Let's make our move."

They used their card to unlock the hotel room door.

They walked in to find the room in complete chaos.

A sense of relief washed over Natalie while Elyse smirked in satisfaction.

The room's dim lighting barely revealed Daniela under the quilt.

Elyse scanned the room and flashed a suggestive grin at Linden. "Had a good time?"

Linden sprawled casually in an armchair near the curtains. "Not too shabby."

With a sly laugh, Elyse laid out the plan. "I'm about to storm in with the press. Strip down, grab Daniela,and ensure she's alone when she exits the hotel. Then, find an opportunity to end her life."
Elyse was plotting as ever. Her plan was to rise to power at Elite Lux after Daniela's demise would leave Cedric shattered by perceived betrayal. Claiming the role of Daniela's aunt had been a long-conceived strategy to enable her takeover.

With a confident grin,Elyse was ready to implement her master strategy.

"Wait!"

Turning with a puzzled expression,Elyse faced Linden."What's the matter?"

"There's something I don't understand. Did you have a hand in Brylee's death?" Linden asked, eyeing the figure in the bed.

The smile vanished from Elyse's face. "Why would you bring that up?"

Nonchalantly,Linden responded, "Out of curiosity.I'm on your payroll, after all. It's puzzling how you could target her daughter, given Brylee's past kindness to you.Could you shed some light on that?"

Elyse's face hardened, her tone cold. "What's there to clarify? I was after their wealth, and they were too affluent for their own good. I ended Brylee's life, and Daniela's end will be by my hands as well-her fate will mirror her mother's."

With that,Elyse exited without another word.

Natalie felt something was off with Linden today.She couldn't pinpoint what, but something was definitely wrong. After exiting the room,she lingered by the door,ear pressed against it, while keeping an eye on the room's surveillance feed on her phone.

Within the room, as Linden saw the coast was clear,he prepared to stand.

However, he caught Daniela slowly opening her eyes.

Her gaze sharp, she subtly mouthed the word "Surveillance."

Linden immediately sat back down.

Óutside, Natalie watched for a long time. Only the sound of water running eventually convinced her to move on.

Elyse, already at the elevator, chuckled, "You're too wary. Didn't the disarray convince you of last night's escapades? It was just like when Nina and Linden were together.What's there to worry about?"

Flashing a sly smile, Elyse continued, "Soon, I'll be leading Elite Lux. I've even had Daniela's authorization papers forged."

Elyse then gestured to the waiting reporters. "Let's move. It's time to get to work!"
###Chapter 460 My Niece Is Inside
As Elyse made her way to the hotel room, her excitement was unmistakable; she couldn't mask the thrill on her face.

Removing Daniela from the equation was key to her plan.

She envisioned finding someone to handle Linden in a way that would leave no trace, just as had happened with Brylee.

Elyse walked briskly, occasionally turning to address the reporters trailing her with a crafted smile. "I just can't rein Daniela in. She has this unsettling obsession with men,which really worries me. To my friends in the media, I know you're all very capable, but please exercise some discretion in your reporting. After all,she's my niece, and I hold her dear."

The reporters exchanged knowing glances, silently commending Elyse on her act.

Poor Daniela, they thought, to have such a manipulative aunt.

Elyse clutched the room key,waiting for the reporters to ready their cameras for the live broadcast. With a practiced smile, shethen swiped the key card and opened the hotel room door. Elyse's plan was set against the backdrop of scandalous news: Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux,allegedly caught in a compromising situation with her family doctor. The journalists were hungry for an exclusive story.

The moment the door swung open,the reporters surged forward like a flood.

Elyse,momentarily pushed aside by the rush, smiled in anticipation of the commotion she expected inside: Daniela's cries of panic and the reporters 'gasps of shock.

She shared a look of victory with Natalie.

One minute ticked by.

Then five.

But the anticipated screams of scandal never erupted.

An eerie silence filled the room.

Elyse,perplexed,made her way through the throng of reporters to see for herself.

The room, which she expected to be in chaos, was impeccably tidy.

Linden sat on the sofa, engrossed in his phone, his expression one of genuine surprise as he noticed the crowd.

"How did you all get in here?" he demanded. The reporters, stunned, turned collectively to Elyse.

She stared back at Linden,her confusion deepening into a frown as she asked, "Where is Daniela?"

Linden looked bewildered. "Daniela? You're in my room.Why would she be here?"

Elyse didn't bother to dialogue further with Linden.

Instead,she searched the room frantically,yanking back curtains, peering under the bed, and bursting into the bathroom.

Her anxiety mounting, Elyse found no trace of Daniela.She confronted Linden and seized his collar."Where did Daniela go?"

Linden responded with a smirk, "I'm not sure what you're implying. I'm her family doctor, not her husband.Why are you asking where she is at this hour? Are you suggesting something inappropriate between me and her?"

Facing the cameras that were broadcasting live,Linden said earnestly, "Daniela is a woman of integrity and grace, composed and dignified. She has a strong relationship with Cedric. I'm baffled as to why you would storm into my room with a crowd, shouting her name. What exactly are you trying to prove?"

Each of his statements was filled with implied accusations.

Elyco wac seething with anger "Impossiblel was definitely in this room. I clearly saw..."

She nearly spilled the details but was abruptly interrupted when Natalie sharply tugged at her sleeve

Linden laughed lightly and responded, "Clearly what?I'm confused. Isn't Daniela your niece? It seems you're quite eager for her to be involved in a scandal. What exactly are you up to?"

He continued provocatively, "What exactly are you plotting?"

Had there not been live cameras rolling, Elyse might Kave lashed out at Linden.

Natalie, standing beside her, watched Linden with a cold stare.

Then, her voice dropped to a more calming tone "Linden, we were informed that Daniela was seen in your room. Is someone forcing you to say otherwise?"

She glanced subtly at the cameras, signaling Linden to play along. "Don't be afraid, Linden. We are a society ruled by laws. Daniela has influence, but she cannot evade justice. Just speak the truth. With all these reporters here, you have support."

Her statement was sharp.

The reporters, quick to understand the hidden meaning, looked on with skepticism. "What do you mean?" Linden asked, finding Natalie's sudden change in demeanor amusing.

Before, Natalie couldn't stand to be in the same room as him, but now she was almost flirtatious.

How absurd!

He had once thought Natalie was distant and unapproachable, but he now saw she was no different from anyone else.

Linden's face twisted with disgust.
###Chapter 461 She Was Determined To Eliminate...
Linden sneered. "I'm at a loss. Natalie, you're Daniela's secretary. To throw such bait in front of a pack of reporters-what's your angle? What do you expect me to confess? Or perhaps, what tale would you have me spin for the press?"

Natalie's expression soured on the spot.

Linden pressed on, "You just waxed lyrical about the rule of law. Remember,peddling rumors could land you in hot water, so let's steer clear of weaving tall tales."

Elyse tensed, her hand raised to strike Linden,but Natalie intercepted her.

With a plastered smile still gracing her features.Natalie addressed the press. "Excuse us, could we pause the live feed for a moment?"

The reporters agreed,but their microphones remained live, ostensibly "overlooked."

Oblivious, Natalie went on, "Guys, my apologies for the hiccup. Might I ask you to wait outside for a short while?"

A murmur ran through the crowd. Natalie raised her hand, showing a number. "Rest assured, I'll make it worth your while once we've sorted things out here."

Seeing the promised sum signaled by her fingers, the reporters quickly dispersed with gleaming eyes.

With the room now silent, Natalie's facade crumbled instantly."Linden,what's the meaning of this charade?"

Elyse stormed over and delivered the slap she had restrained earlier.

Leaning nonchalantly against the couch, Linden offered only an indifferent grin in response.

Elyse demanded, "Where's Daniela? Why the sudden flip in your story? Do you realize the mess you've just made of my carefully laid plans?"

Linden touched his lip, savoring the taste of blood,yet remained unperturbed. He locked eyes with Natalie."Daniela's not here. I've stashed her elsewhere.Without me, you won't be able to find her."

Natalie,feeling his intense gaze, simmered with rage but kept her fury in check. "What do you want?"

With a cynical laugh, Linden replied, "What do I want?Surely you've known all along." His grin grew more sardonic.

Natalie's demeanor hardened. "Keep dreaming!"

Spreading his arms wide, Linden countered, "Then  don't expect Daniela to waltz back in here. I might be daring, but I'm no fool. Natalie, from day one you knew my intentions. You've played me like a fool. Now, the ball's in your court. Stay or go-it's your call." He gestured towards the door.

Natalie's expression darkened further.

Elyse attempted to mediate. "Once we're through with this, I'll honor our agreement. Didn't you just share a night with Daniela? Pace yourself,young man!"

The memory of Linden and Daniela's fervent night sent a thrill through Elyse, her featues contorting with delight. Yet the thought of Natalie in Daniela's place soured her mood instantly. The contempt on Natalie's face was palpable.

"It's your choice. Either Natalie sleeps with me,or you go explain the mix-up to the reporters. Remember,you've promised them silence money. If Daniela survives, can you cover that bet?"

Elyse's expression tightened. What Linden didn't know was that they had already spent over millions downstairs the previous night.
Elyse bit her lip, eyeing the sealed door, then made a desperate decision. "Natalie, perhaps you should..."

Natalie'slips tightened into a thin line, recognizing her lack of options. She faced Linden with frosty disdain "You have five minutes."

Linden's laugh was mocking. "Five minutes won't cut  it.It should last as long as you planned with Daniela-hours,not moments."

Natalie's eyes widened in horror. Such a loathsome prospect-for hours? She could as well meet her end.

"Then decide. The choice is yours." Linden eyed the still-charming Elyse with a smirk. "Elyse, perhaps you'd like to join?"

Elyse's rage nearly boiled over.

"Let's not dally," Linden said, sensing Natalie's facade."Don't push me to ask for ten days and nights. That might be more than you can withstand."

At his words, Natalie stormed off to the bathroom.Her fists clenched as she walked.

She resolved that Linden would pay with his life once this ordeal was over.
###Chapter 462 A Report Of Illegal Sexual Activity
Natalie stepped into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.

Elyse stepped out, her face etched with distress. The reporters outside exchanged puzzled glances.confused as to why she was the only one to appear.

"Where is Natalie? Can we go in now?" one of them ásked.

Elyse masked her irritation with a practiced smile."They just have a few matters to settle. It won't be long. Why don't we wait a bit?"

The seasoned journalists immediately caught the underlying message.

Only a few newcomers remained oblivious. "How long is this going to take? Is Natalie in there alone with Linden? That guy gives off sleazy vibes. Are you really okay leaving your daughter alone with him?"

The words hung in the air like an ill-timed joke, and an awkward silence followed.

A wave of embarrassment rippled through the air.

The younger reporters, initially confused, understood why Natalie had been left alone inside. On the surface, everyone appeared composed,but inside,they were reeling in shock.

Was Elyse really letting her daughter be taken advantage of by someone so unreliable?

The scandals of the wealthy never failed to be shocking.

Natalie stepped out of the shower, steam curling around her.

Linden was already sprawled across the bed, his shirt gone, his grin lazy and predatory as his gaze roamed over Natalie.

"Natalie, I fell for you from the moment I saw you in college. But you never even looked my way. To me,you were like a star, distant and untouchable."

Without warning, Linden pulled Natalie towards him with his stubby hands, yanked away her towel and ran his hands over her wildly.

Natalie gasped, becoming aroused. Linden let out a smug snort. "See? You act like you don't want this,but your body tells a different story."

Natalie's body quivered with embarrassment. Shame burned through her, yet she couldn't resist the expert way Linden touched her.

She shivered as Linden pressed her beneath himn,her breath hitching as he lowered his head. A helpless moan slipped from her lips, mortifying her to the core. If only the earth would open up and swallow her whole.

Linden was no stranger to the darkest corners of indulgence. Against his unyielding intensity, Natalie stood no chance.

Outside the room,Elyse stood stiffly by the door.

To keep an eye on Daniela, he had booked this particular suite, which was not soundproof.

But now, with Linden's crude words and Natalie's muffled sounds seeping through the walls, a surge of fury twisted in Elyse's chest.

Her daughter, Natalie, as delicate as a rose, was being handled by that beast,Linden?

A voice interrupted Elyse's spiraling thoughts."Excuse me." A group of uniformed officers approached, their expressions stern as they showed their badges."What's going on in here?" one of them asked.

Elyse stiffened."Well..."

The officers moved to push open the door but panic flared in Elyse's eyes as she quickly stepped in their way."You can't go in now!"

If they stormed in now, the press would have a field day. If they caught Natalie in such a compromising position with Linden in bed together, how would she ever recover from the humiliation let alone faco anyone?

The officers exchanged glances, unconvinced at Elyse's troubled expression. One knocked firmly on the door. A man's restrained voice called from inside."Come in."

Elyse stood frozen, utterly stunned.

The police officers shoved the door open, and to Elyse's shock, it wasn't even locked.

The officers stepped inside, badges raised. "Hello, sir.we've received a report of illegal sexual activity here.

The reporters swarmed in.

Cameras flashed, capturing the disheveled room, the charged atmosphere, and the two naked exposed figures frozen by the bed one in front of the other.

Linden's hand was still on Natalie's chest.

Everything was happening too fast.

Natalie hadn't fully registered what was happening before the shutter clicks became deafening.

The headlines practically wrote themselves. How had a girl once known for her innocence ended up here?

The images of Linden and Natalie spread like wildfire that day Natalie never imagined things would turn out this way By the time Natalie understood the gravity of it,it was already too late, the reporters capturing every damning moment in rapid succession.

She let out a strangled scream. yanking the sheet and using it to cover herself.

But there were too many reporters.

More and more pushed their way in.

Elyse realized something was wrong-she hadn't called for this many people.

Just as she was about to intervene, a familiar voice cut through the noise.

"Well,well,well. What do we have here?"

Elyse squinted,taken aback.

Natalie gripped the thin fabric tightly around herself,her gaze snapping towards the source of the voice.

The crowd instinctively parted, making way for the newcomer.
###Chapter 463 You Ruined Natalie
Daniela walked through the crowd with Lilian at her side. "What is going on? Natalie? You and Linden..."
Are you two involved in an intimate relationship?"

Natalie quickly denied it. "No! I'm not!"

Despite the chaos swvirling in her mind, she knew she couldn't confess. Admitting to a relationship with Kinden would bind her to him forever.

With such a disgusting man!

He was nowhere close to Cedric in any regard.

The thought of being tied to Linden was unbearable:she would rather face death.

"So,you're saying there's nothing between you? Yet here you are, caught in such a compromising situation in my hotel? Natalie, I had no idea you were so indiscreet. It's disappointing, really."

As the situation escalated, Elyse stepped in to defend Natalie and said, "It was all Linden's doing! He raped Natalie!"

"Really?" Daniela acted shocked as she grabbed the camera from a nearby journalist. "This pose, this look of pleasure on her face... You say he raped Natalie.  yet it seems she enjoyed it."

Natalie was trapped; she could neither confirm nor deny the accusation.

Meanwhile, Linden, who had wrapped a scarf around himself for modesty,remained cool under the scrutiny of the cameras, a stark contrast to Natalie's visible panic. "How could it be forced? Officer, everything was agreed upon. I often record such encounters,and the footage will show that Natalie was the initiator."

"What? Natalie initiated it?" one of the journalists blurted out,stunned.

Linden confirmed with a nod,saying,"Absolutely,why else would I be interested in a loose woman like her?"

Natalie was stunned.

Elyse stood speechless.

Linden continued, "I have my own standards and preferences. Being with someone like Natalie,that's practically an act of charity on my part."

His remarks were captured and repeatedly aired on the day's trending news broadcasts.

As a result, Natalie's image plummeted from that of a revered woman to someone pitied even by Linden.

The police collected statements and departed.

Journalists took photos and left with content smiles. Natalie remained on the bed,stunned,her mind utterly blank.

Elyse,seething,confronted Daniela."You orchestrated this! You planned all of this!"

"Yes," Daniela responded with a smile.

Linden,now fully dressed, said to Daniela respectfully."Ms. Harper,I will take my leave now."

Daniela smiled at Linden and asked, "Did you get what you wanted? Are you pleased?"

Linden shrugged and said, "Not particularly. It was intriguing to pursue her when she was admirable. Now that she's been reduced to nothing, she's lost all appeal. If she begged me in the future, I wouldn't give her a second glance. Ms. Harper, I'll be just outside.Should you need anything, just call. As always,I remain at your service."

With those words,Linden left.

Elyse wwas overwhelmed by the turn of events."Daniela,yor actions are merciless! You've destroyed Natalie, and I swear you'll regret this!"

Daniela remained calm and unthreatened. Seated elegantly on the sofa, silhouetted by the light, she played a recording from her phone.
Elyse's voice filled the room. "What's there to clarify?I was after their wealth, and they were too affluent for their own good. I ended Brylee's life, and Daniela  end will be by my hands as well-her fate will mirror her mother's."

Silence suddenly enveloped the once chaotic room.
###Chapter 464 | Want Them All

"Well... Uh... I..." Elyse stammered, her panic evident as she struggled to find her words. "That recording-it's not my voice. Linden must have manipulated it.I never said those things!"

With a sense of urgency, she continued, "I stand by my words. That's not my voice, Daniela. You can't hold me responsible for your mother's death just because it's difficult for you to come to terms with.Honestly, I'm being falsely accused here. Consider our relationship-we're family. What reason would I have to hurt your mother? She was practically a financial lifeline for me. Why would I harm someone who has given me so much?"

Daniela maintained a calm expression, her smile slight."Indeed,why would you,Aunt Elyse?"

Elyse's eyes pleaded for understanding as she looked at Daniela.

Daniela's smile softened as she continued, "After my mother died, I was baffled as to why someone so full of life would leap from a building. And when my father quickly remarried,I couldn't grasp how he could move on so soon from his beloved wife. Years passed with just me,without the warmth of family, and my confusion only grew. But eventually, I accepted that  some things in life, especially human nature, are beyond understanding."

Daniela concluded her thoughts, then stood up decisively. "Elyse, you will face consequences for your actions."

Her gaze then turned to Natalie.

With a light smile, she said, "I recall how much my mother adored you when we were children. Did you ever imagine you'd find yourself in such a predicament when you and your mother schemed against her?"

She chuckled lightly. "Just be patient. This is merely the start."

It wasn't until Daniela had disappeared from view that Elyse exchanged a look with Natalie.

Natalie, disheveled and scantily clad in a towel,was a picture of despair and shame.

Overwhelmed by emotions, Natalie burst into tears "Mom! Everything's fallen apart. Daniela has shattered my life. All because of her vendetta tied to her dead mother, she's resorted to every underhanded tactic to ruin me. Now, I'm a scandal in Olisvine. Daniela must be stopped.I need her gone!"

Just as she finished her outburst, a knock sounded at the door. The hotel manager entered, dressed in a suit.holding a hefty bill. "Madam, please settle your bill.The total comes to 8.8 million dollars." Upon hearing the enormous amount,Elyse collapsed.

Meanwhile. Daniela exited the hotel and drove straight to her house.

Her phone was silent, devoid of any new messages from Cedric for several hours.

She sensed his displeasure was profound.

Daniela stopped by a cupcake shop on her way.picking up a box of treats.

As they neared the villa, the building appeared mostly dark,save for a lone light in the living room.

Ryan greeted her at the door with a worried look "Daniela,he's extremely upset this time."

With a resigned sigh, Daniela entered.

She slipped off her shoes, donned her slippers, and while walking to the living room, she flashed a cheerful smile. "I grabbed your favorite cupcakes from the shop. Care for some?"

Cedric, though typically easygoing, had an imposing presence when angered. His features were set in a stem expression, his eyes cold,fixating on something below,in silence.

"Cedric..." Daniela set the box of cupcakes on the table. "I was just out managing a situation, nothing dangerous.I stayed within your boundaries." The dim lighting in the room cast dramatic shadows.slicing Cedric's face between light and darkness.

"Are you upset? I'm sorry, Cedric. You have the final say here, alright?" Daniela reached out to touch his hand,her fingertips lightly scratching to indicate her willingness to yield. "I really am sorry. Please, let's not fight,okay?"

Cedric's gaze slowly rose, his hand pulling away from Daniela's.

A knot formed in Daniela's stomach as she braced berself.

Before she could say more, Cedric said,"I saw the news coverage."

Daniela looked at Cedric.

"It was quite a spectacle. Elyse aimed for you and Linden, but instead, Natalie and Linden were caught.the police got involved, and it all ended in a public scandal for the Dury family. After the journalists left.you faced Elyse, didn't you? She must have been scared."

Cedric then turned his face away, shrouding it in shadow,his eyes gleaming with a stark,resentful cold."You emerged without a scratch. Quite remarkable."

Daniela bit her lip, sensing that her efforts to calm him were likely in vain. "l..." just can't take itanymore." Cedric murmured wearilyDaniela stared at him,her shock evident.

Why am I always the last to find out? What have you done to make Elyse believe there's something between you and Linden?"

Daniela opened her mouth to respond.

Cedric lifted his hand, signaling her to stop. "There's no need to explain." He knew that she always had her reasons. "It seems like you never really put me first."

Daniela's fists tightened.

Cedric continued without allowing her to interject."Daniela, I'm not invincible. I feel fear, and I overthink things. Each time you leave, I'm struck with worry about your safety. If anything were to happen to you.who would even tell me? It feels like I'm always an afterthought to you. You know me so well, yet you don't seem to grasp what I truly need. What I desire is all of you, Daniela. I crave the fiery passion we share in our private moments and the fierce determination you display against your adversaries. Whether you're calm.composed, detached, elegant, courteous, or employing any tactic necessary. I want every part of you."
###Chapter 465 Bring Food To Cedric
What is it that scares you so much? Why is it that you can share everything with the world, yet when it comes to me, you always ask me to wait?"Cedric pressed,his voice full of frustration

The smile on Daniela's face slowly faded. and eventually,her expression became blank.

Cedric stared at her and let out a mocking laugh."What are you planning now? Are you going to tell me to forget about it if I reach the point where i can't take it anymore?"

He fought back a smile, seeing Daniela's expression confirm his guess. A wave of sadness hit him. He nodded and said, "Alright then. Do it your way."

As Cedric stood up. Daniela's heart squeezed with emotion. and she reached out to grab his hand."Cedric,would you be able to give me just a bit more time?"

Cedric forced a bitter smile. "Daniela, you know l'd give you as much time as you need, even a lifetime.But I can't keep living with this constant feeling of being shut out. It's like...I mean nothing to you."

Daniela heard the echo of his footsteps on the floor as she turned her head and saw Cedric opening the  front door.

The light from outside poured in, bathing him in a golden glow. But just as quickly, it disappeared when the door began to close slowly.

Daniela sat in the still, cold silence,her hands and feet frozen with the chill.

She stayed on the sofa all night, waiting, but Cedric never came back.

The cupcakes she had bought the previous night had turned cold and hard, but she ate them for breakfast anyway.

Lillian, observing with a pity look, suggested, "Why not just tell him? It's just that trivial past, right? It's possible that Cedric could manage it."

Daniela shook her head. "No. No one is allowed to tell him!"

Ryan exhaled heavily. "This time, it might be difficult to calm him down. He's really upset. He even left home."

A migraine began to throb in Daniela's head. She headed upstairs to change her clothes, with plans to make breakfast and bring it to Cedric as a way of making peace.

Leaning against the door, Lillian scrolled through her tablet while talking to Daniela. "Natalie's reputation is completely destroyed, and Elyse, who sacrificed her  daughter's future for fame, is scomed throughout Olisvine. The hotel called to say they spent over eight million last night and can't cover the cost. They're asking what to do."

Daniela answered with determination. "Call the police and have them arrested."

Lillian nodded,then asked Daniela,"Caiden is crying and begging to see you.Will you go,Daniela?"

Daniela poured oatmeal into a thermos."No."

Lillian had expected as much. "The man who looked Hke Cedric at the last banquet is still under investigation. It's odd. After that brief appearance, he seemed to disappear, as if..." She paused, searching for the right words.

Daniela caught on quickly. "As if he deliberately stirred up trouble and then vanished to watch the chaos unfold."

Lillian touched her forehead,relieved. "Exactly! That's exactlyit."

Daniela grabbed the thermos. "Ignore it. Those who need to show up will eventually do so."
Lillian agreed, laughing at Daniela. "You're off to make peace with Cedric. I won't join you. Never thought I'd see the day, and Cedric is really holding his ground."

Daniela smiled wryly at the teasing tone in Lillian's voice. She had never thought she would one day be preparing breakfast to appease a man.

As Daniela reached the entrance of Phillips Group.the head of security approached her with evident enthusiasm. "Good morning, Ma'am."

Daniela had been buried with work and rarely visited Phillips Group, so the security guard hurried over as soon as he spotted her car.

This took Daniela by surprise. The head of security was someone she hadn't seen before.

Noticing her confused look, he smiled and said,"Here in Olisvine, everyone knows you as Mr. Phillips' wife It's not just me, even our newest employees recognize you. When Mr. Phillips was in a coma,you led the company,and though it was only for a short time.your leadership left a lasting impression on everyone at Phillips Group."

Daniela smiled warmly."Thank you."

She stepped out of the car with the thermos, just as Cedric's secretary hurried out of the elevator. "Ma'am.you're here."

Initially, the staff at Phillips Group were doubtful about Daniela, puzzled over why their CEO was so committed to her.

After all,Phillips Group was not lacking in any way. owever after seeing Daniela's decisive leadershi. they were all impressed,hoping their CEO would show even greater dedication.

When Cedric showed up at the office early in the morning, the employees were taken aback. "Why aren't you at your wife's company today? Coming here so early, are you planning a special dinner for her tonight and need us to help with the preparations?"

However,Cedric entered with a grim look on his face

The mood at Phillips Group turned tense, fearing that their CEO was facing a setback.

As the company prepared for a potential crisis.Daniela arrived.

Cedric's secretary happily declared that the crisis had been resolved and escorted Daniela upstairs. "It's been some time since your last visit. We've all missed you.Your leadership at Phillips Group left a strong impression on everyone. We hope you'll visit more often to offer your guidance."

Daniela, smiling, asked, "How is Cedric's mood today?

She aimed to assess the situation, following the strategy of understanding both herself and her opponent to ensure victory in any conflict.

The secretary replied, "He might not have slept well.but it's nothing to worry about." To them, Daniela was highly respected, and the idea of her needing to calm anyone down seemed impossible. Daniela found the secretary's dramatic manner amusing.

As she went upstairs, Cedric was engaged in a meeting.

She sat outside the conference room with the thermos, and the secretary offered. "Please wait here.I'll inform Mr.Phillips you're waiting."

Daniela responded, "It's okay. I'm not in a rush."

"You're a busy person, and it's rare for you to come by. Mr. Phillips is always tied up in meetings, and those attending could use a break."

With that, the secretary hurried into the conference room, anxious not to keep Daniela waiting.

As the door swung open, Cedric's expression grew even darker. It was clear he was in a foul mood, his face clouded with anger.

The secretary smiled brightly and said, "Mr. Phillips.your wife is here and waiting by the door."

Upon hearing this, Cedric instantly turned his  head.
###Chapter 466 Cedric Held Firm

The next second, Cedric quickly withdrew his gaze.

The secretary pushed open the door to the conference room and cast a glance at him.

Cedric's lips pressed into a thinline.

The moment the executives heard Daniela was here,their faces lit up with excitement, their reactions even more animated than Cedric's.

Cedric cast a quick glance towards the door before leaning back in his seat with composure. "Let's continue the meeting."

"What?" The secretary frowned. "Mr. Phillips, didn't you hear? Your wife is here."

The finance manager, now an ardent admirer of Daniela, nearly shot up from his seat to take a peek outside.

The marketing manager, eager to get Daniela's insights, was growing restless, counting down the minutes until the meeting ended.

The sales manager, noticing Cedric's indifference.quickly chimed in, "Mr. Phillips, if you're not heading out, perhaps I should greet her instead? I make excellent coffee and have been meaning for her to try it."

He had already started rising from his seat as he spoke

Cedric swept his gaze over the overly eager executives.

Normally, these executives carried themselves with such self-importance that they wouldn't even lift a finger to make coffee, not even if he asked. But for Daniela? They were more than happy to oblige.

"Sit down. We're continuing the meeting!"
/
The room filled with silent pouts, while the secretary mumbled under her breath, "Throwing a little tantrum for attention, huh? Just don't regret it later if she doesn't pamper you."

With that, she turned and walked out.

Cedric remained stiff, his gaze unconsciously wandering to the door.

The rest of the executives, mirroring him, were also sneaking glances outside.

The secretary stepped outside, greeting Daniela with a polite smile. "Mr. Phillips asked me to kindly request that you wait a moment. He'll be out as soon as this meeting is wrapped up."

Daniela nodded in acknowledgment. Since she was here to appease Cedric anyway, waiting a little longer  didn't bother her.

She rose to her feet and peered through the glass.

Cedric sat at the center, and the moment the executives inside noticed Daniela, they instantly greeted her with enthusiasm. Even the marketing manager got to his feet.

Cedric's gaze hardened as he watched the overly eager executives.

Yet, he didn't intervene-he simply continued with the meeting.

As his eyes drifted outside, they landed on the pink thermos in Daniela's hand.

His fingers twitched slightly.

The meeting dragged on.

Every minute or so, Cedric stole a glance at Daniela.carefully masking his interest behind anindifferent facade.

Suddenly, Kenny Shaw from the tech department spotted Daniela and greeted her, his eyes lighting up with excitement.

Daniela offered a warm smile, but before she could reply, Kenny quickly continued, "About that code model you mentioned last time-I still can't crack it.It's way too complex. Could you come downstairs and explain it to me again?" Daniela had come today with the sole purpose of appeasing Cedric. Yet the meeting was still dragging on.

As she hesitated, Kenny whined dramatically."Please!I've been struggling with this forever. Mr. Phillips keeps telling us to figure it out on our own, but 1swear,I could spend my whole life on this and still not get it. You're my only hope!"

Amused, Daniela completely forgot about handing the thermos to the secretary and followed Kenny downstairs.
/
One minute later, Cedric glanced over his shoulder.then looked awNay.

He froze.

Then,he turned back again.

Where was she?

Cedric shot up from his seat, his voice sharp as he barked towards the door, "Where is she?"

The secretary, exasperated, pushed open the conference room door, but before she could get a word out, the marketing manager groaned,"Mr.Phillips, we should've gone out earlier! Kenny got to her first. This is so unfair!"

Cedric shot a sharp glare at the secretary. "Where is it?"

The secretary blinked in confusion. "What?" Cedric clenched his jaw."The thermos! The pink one!"

The secretary pointed to the elevator. "She took it with her."

Cedric was speechless.

Fantastic.

They were all competing for his wife's attention.

Irritated, Cedric wrapped up the meeting in record time.

Instead of heading downstairs, he strode straight back to his office. This time, he was resolute. No matter what Daniela said, he would make her promise never to keep anything from him again.

He wanted to be part of every aspect of her life.

Cedric knew Kenny was utterly obsessed with computing techniques. The guy had been recruited with a hefty paycheck as an industry expert, but after one encounter with Daniela, he was completely hooked, always begging for a chance to visit her at Elite Lux.

Cedric had kept him at bay.

Now that he finally had his chance, Kenny wasted no time in picking her brain.

As Cedric waited for Daniela to wrap things up and return,he mulled over how to keep his pride intact. A man couldn't let a woman call all the shots Otherwise,where would that leave him in the family hierarchy down the line?

He wasn't one to fuss over family status, but Daniela constantly dangling herself as bait? That didn't sit well with him.

That kind of thing had to be put to an end-permanently.

His decision was final.

After knocking out two tasks, Cedric, growing impatient, snapped at his secretary, "Is Kenny's brain really worth the salary I pay him? How long does it take to ask one damn question?"

The secretary checked the clock-barely ten minutes had gone by. "Why not head down and check for yourself?"
Cedric crossed his arms, stubborn. "Not happening." If he caved now, she'd just pull another stunt next time and think she could smooth things over the same way.

He couldn't have that.

So he held firm, waiting for her to come to him instead.
###Chapter 467 How Much Longer Must I Wait


Thirty minutes had passed.

Cedric furrowed his brows, clearly annoyed. "How much longer must I wait? Why doesn't Kenny just have my wife move into his tech department?" Under her breath, the secretary whispered,"Kenny would appreciate that, but aren't you the one who would hate it?"

She kept her voice low.

She was well aware that Cedric was genuinely angry.

After forty minutes, Cedric's expression turned stormy.

His observant secretary exclaimed with a dramatic sigh."Oh dear."

Cedric's eyebrows knitted together even tighter.

Then, the secretary said, "Kenny is so careless. How could he leave the documents that needed signing up here? I need to take them down to him."

No sooner had she finished speaking than the documents disappeared from her hands.

She watched Cedric walk towards the elevator. With a smirk, the secretary followed him, saying."Mr Phillips, please excuse my honesty. As a man,you shouldn't be too proud. Your wife offered you a way out earlier, but you turned it down. Now, you're chasing after her yourself. Isn't that just asking for trouble?"

Cedric briefly closed his eyes.

The secretary struggled to hold back her laughter.

In negotiations, Cedric was always composed,yet now he couldn't remain seated for forty minutes.

Daniela was amazing!

She was not only a titan in the business world but also very skilled at managing her husband.

The secretary admired Daniela deeply once again.

Cedric exited the elevator quickly, adjusting his tie as he entered the tech department.

In the server room, Kenny was smiling at a screen filled with code.

Cedric looked around but didn't see Daniela anywhere

"Mr. Phillips, what brings you here?" Kenny asked.

Cedric's face showed clear annoyance. "Where is Daniela?"

Kenny gestured upstairs. "The finance manager  needed her. He was puzzled by a tax incentive policy and required her expertise for some financial framework design. So, he took her."

Cedric's expression grew darker.

He rushed upstairs, finding Daniela in the conference room, explaining the tax framework to the finance manager.

Before Cedric could get close, the finance manager hurried over, pleading, "Mr. Phillips, please! I don't need my bonus this month. Just let me work wvith your wife for a while,okay?"

Cedric narrowed his eyes. "I married my wife to cherish her, not to let her handle your ordinary tasks."

The finance manager looked shocked and disheartened. "Mr. Phillips, what are you saying?How can you refer to the work of the finance department as just ordinary tasks? Please, let her assist me. Do l need to get on my knees?"

Cedric took a deep breath before pulling up a chair and sitting down.

Fine.

He would wait.

He should have accepted Daniela's peace offering earlier. Now, he had to wait at the door like a bystander. How irritating!

Throughout the afternoon, every Phillips Group employee who walked past the finance department witnessed their CEO, dressed in a suit, sitting on a bench with his arms crossed,eyeing everyone with a cold gaze.

His secretary had to leave for a while to attend to some matters.

Two hours went by.

Cedric, unable to sit still any longer, stood up and peeked into the conference room.

Fantastic!

The entire finance department was there, focused on Daniela's presentation on her new financial model.

Cedric had never felt such regret in his life. Had he known,he would have never started a company.

While Cedric made a quick trip to the restroom, the people in the conference room changed.

The finance department had made way for the marketing department.

"Ma'am, could you go over your spiral market competition concept once more?"

The room was packed to its full capacity with the marketing department. When the secretary returned, he found Cedric squeezed at the doorway and thoughtfully offered him a chair, whispering, "Mr. Phillips, maybe we should head back to your office? It seems like this session isn't going to wrap up any time soon."

Cedric's face was unreadable. He scoffed, "Head back upstairs? If I do, the next group to come in will be the admin department."

As soon as he finished speaking, the admin manager arrived with a notebook followed by a team.

Cedric, visibly irritated, pointed to a spot behind him and told the smiling admin manager, "Line up over there!"

Despite the crowded room, Cedric didn't feel like leaving. Eventually, someone cleared a spot for him in a corner.

He sat there, his expression stern, observing Daniela as she stood at the center of the group.

Daniela was remarkably insightful. She simplified the company's complex issues and used short stories to make her points relatable.

With a gloomy expression, Cedric said to his secretary."Isn't Daniela just saying the same things as I said?"

The secretary was surprised. "Mr. Phillips, your explanations are highly professional. They're enlightening once we understand them, but what your  wife shares feels like a sudden revelation for everyone.

That was indeed the case.

Cedric was outstanding, like the luminous moon in the sky,shedding its light gradually.

Daniela's explanations, however, were like the soft rain of spring, subtly enlightening.

Naturally,everyone favored Daniela.

Someone in the crowd appropriately told Daniela,"lt would be wonderful if you worked at Phillips Group."

This suggestion was met with nods of agreement from everyone.

Cedric let out a cold laugh from his corner, his smile chilling.

As the workday drew to an end, the group was still hesitant to leave.

Cedric gave his secretary a look.

The secretary quickly understood. "Everyone! It's timne to close up for today."
###Chapter 468 I Thought Cedric Had A Cheerful...
The employees in the administration department looked utterly deflated.

They turned to Cedric with pleading eyes.

The marketing manager,holding up the afternoon's results with a wide grin, turned to Daniela. "Your insights are priceless. You've saved me years of hard work. Now it makes sense why you're the world's wealthiest person. You truly deserve it. Are you free this evening? My team and I would like to treat you to dinner."

Everyone looked at Daniela with anticipation.

The administration manager blinked in surprise before offering a smile. "Our department would also love to host you for dinner."

Their faces brightened with genuine enthusiasm.

Daniela placed her pen down, her fingers brushing against the thermos that had sat forgotten beside her all afternoon.

Her gaze swept over the crowd, pausing briefly on Cedric.

She flashed him a radiant smile. "Cedric, would you be  able to join us?"

Immediately, all eyes turned to Cedric.

He gave a subtle nod, and Daniela was promptly surrounded by the eager group, guided towards the restaurant across the street.

Cedric, hands casually tucked into his pockets.lingered at the back.

Inside the restaurant, he approached the reception desk and tapped it lightly. The receptionist stood up with practiced politeness. "Good evening,Mr.Phillips."

Cedric gestured to the private room where the group had entered. I'll cover their expenses tonight. If anyone inquires, just tell them my wife has already taken care of it."

Daniela was more than generous,especially when it came to the key players of Phillips Group.

She wouldn't let them be burdened wvith the cost.

Inside the private room, Daniela smiled."Tonight,everything's on me."

As she stepped out to give instructions to the front desk, ensuring no one else would pick up thetab,she overheard Cedric's considerate words.

Leaning on the railing, she looked down at Cedric below, her lips curving into a soft smile. ltenbi relaxed.

Cedric sat beside Daniela, sipping on the oatmeal while the others dug into their meals.

One of the employees, noticing this, asked,"Mr Phillips, why aren't you eating these delicious dishes?

Cedric shot them a sharp, pointed look.

The employee shifted uncomfortably, glancing at Cedric's secretary who sat nearby.

The secretary let out a small laugh. "You don't get it.do you? The oatmeal was made by his wife. It was brought in this morning but delayed by all of you.Even though it's cold now, it's still just as delicious."

Laughter rippled around the table at the comment.

Cedric,lowering his head,quietly resumed eating,the playful banter not quite reaching his focused demeanor.

When the meal came to a close, Daniela and Cedric were the last to leave.

Daniela could feel the weight of Cedric's unspoken words.

If they didn't resolve whatever it was today, he wouldn't go home.

They made their way to a cafe downstairs.

Cedric ordered himself a coffee, and Daniela, an orange juice.

"What do you want to say?" Cedric asked, his tone unusually self-assured.

Daniela sat up straight,her expression turning serious "I'm here to take you home."

Cedric glanced at her, his gaze lingering on her bright eyes which shimmered even in the dim light of the cafe.

He took a slow sip of his coffee,then,in rhythm with the soft background music, drawled, "Do you plan to Keep things from me until I'm upset, only to coax me into letting it go each time?"

Daniela's response was firm. "No."

Cedric's gaze sharpened. "So, you're planning to be honest with me?"

Daniela's answer was equally resolute. "No, not that either."

Frustration flickered in Cedric's eyes. "I don't understand why you're unwilling to tell me your ultimate goal. Daniela, you can't expect me to live in constant fear that someone I love might vanish."

His voice was strained, as if he were battling with something deeper. "Am I truly so untrustworthy in your eyes?"

"I have my reasons." Daniela paused, letting the weight of her words hang in the air before continuing "Can you wait a little longer?"

Cedric's lips twisted into a self-deprecating smile, a mix of sarcasm and resignation. "Do I dare say no? 1f I say no,will you just walk away again?"

Daniela fell silent.

A bitter laugh escaped Cedric,his frustration bubbling to the surface. "So why did you come to me today?To offer me oatmeal and think that's enough? Daniela.do you really think I'm some child who can be soothed by food?"

Daniela paused, the tension between them thickening

After a long silence, Cedric waited with bated breath.every second stretching between them. Finally.Daniela's voice broke the quiet. "Doesn't it work?"

Cedic exhaled sharply.

He opened his hand, revealing a palm slickwith sweat.

His words were harsh, but there was an unmistakable tremor in his voice, betraying his fear that Daniela might truly give up on them.

But Cedric knew he had no choice.

If he didn't stand firm now, Daniela would never lean on him,never trust him fully.

For now,though,he chose to let it go. His heart felt heavy, as though it couldn't take much more of this.

He finished his coffee in silence. "When you finally tell me what you're up to, I'll come home."

With that,Cedric rose to his feet.
Daniela watched as his figure slowly receded through the door,her heart tightening with each step he took.

She stayed in the cafe a moment longer, collecting herself before finally leaving.

Jackie Gray, Cedric's driver, honked lightly and greeted her cheerfully. "Mr. Phillips sent me to take you home."

Daniela climbed into the car, the familiar scent of leather and cedar surrounding her.

As they drove, she stared out the window, her thoughts swirling.

Jackie glanced at her quiet profile a few times before speaking up. "Why isn't Mr. Phillips coming home with you?"

"He had work to finish and went back to the office."

Jackie nodded thoughtfully. "He's loved you for years.Even before your divorce, he was always watching over you. I never thought he'd smile-until the day he found out about your divorce. That was the first time I saw him genuinely smile." At his words, Daniela looked away from the window "Really? I thought Cedric had a cheerful disposition."
###Chapter 469 This Liquor Is Strong
In Daniela's presence, Cedric always wore a smile.

"Our employees used to be quite intimidated by him At many gatherings, everyone seemed so reserved.Eventually,Mr.Phillips found out and chose not to attend. Today, for the first time, I've seen such a harmonious atmosphere. It's clear he really cherishes you,"Jackie added.

Daniela gave a soft smile. "Hmm."

The car pulled up in front of the Harper family's villa.and Daniela stepped out.

Lillian looked past Daniela, saw no one else, and laughed. "It seems he's really reached his limit this time, hasn't he? Daniela, you can't really fault him.I think Cedric has shown remarkable patience. Most people would have lost their cool by now."

Daniela exhaled deeply.

"But it should all be resolved soon. Elyse is running low on funds and becoming an outcast. She'll likely reach out to her backer soon. At most, this will drag on for another year," Lillian added.
Daniela nodded in response, then before she went upstairs, she turned to Ryan, who was absorbed in a  video game in the living room. "Don't mention anything about Cedric's family to him."

Ryan gave a nod of acknowledgment.

Daniela made her way upstairs.

In the kitchen, Josie was washing the vegetables.She furrowed her brow in confusion upon overhearing Daniela.

Cedric's family? He only had his grandmother left.
hadn't he?

What secret could there be about his family?

Josie didn't think about it further. The next day, as she was out, Cedric called to check on Daniela.

"She's eating well but seems a bit distracted. Last night, I noticed her room light was still on."

Cedric paused before simply responding, "Hmm."

"Oh, by the way, yesterday I overheard her talking about your family. I'm not sure what to make of it.You only have your grandmother left, haven't you?What's strange about your family?" Josie asked casually while grocery shopping.

Cedric seemed surprised. "Are you sure you heard that right? Was it really about my family?"

Josie laughed, adding a box of ribs to her cart."Are you joking with me? I have sharp eyes and ears.Remember Leven completed a marathon.How could I have misheard? Daniela was clearly talking about your family. Oh, and I overheard her instructing Ryan not to let you find out."

Cedric remained so quiet for a while that Josie began to wonder if he had disconnected.

"Mr.Phillips?"

"Hmm."

"What's the matter? Is there really something odd about your family?"

Cedric paused before saying, "Keep an eye on it. If they bring up this topic again, eavesdrop and let me know."

Josie gave a distracted nod and said, "Alright."

The call ended, and Josie went on with her shopping,dismissing the conversation as just casual talk.

Three days later,Cedric made another call.

Josie had nearly forgotten the topic until Cedric brought it up. She then replied, "They haven't brought it up again. Daniela isn't much of a talker, anyway."

Cedric responded, "I see."

After ending the call, he reached out to Ryan.

"Let's go for a drink."

Ryan, dressed entirely in black, from his  hoodie to his  casual pants, turned heads with his tall stature as he stepped through the door.

He approached with his head lowered and sat beside Cedric. "Hi, Cedric."

Cedric placed an order for a drink for Ryan.

The bartender slid the drink towards Ryan, smiling as he warned, "Handsome, this one's strong. Don't drink it all at once."

Cedric lifted his glass and clinked it against Ryan's."Let's really let loose tonight."
###Chapter 470 Daniela's Suspicion
Ryan was taken aback; Cedric typically didn't drink to escape his worries.

He had always maintained that drinking clouded his judgment.

Seeing through Ryan's thoughts, Cedric leaned back casually in the armchair,looking downward as a soft shadow played across his face.

He remained silent.

Ryan,on the other hand, had crafted an entire tragic narrative in his head.

"Cedric, I'm aware of the struggles you're facing with Daniela these days. Try not to take it too personally;she means well."

Cedric didn't respond but raised his glass to Ryan's.

Ryan observed him and emptied his glass.

Before Ryan could utter another word, Cedric grabbed the bottle and refilled Ryan's glass.

"Cedric..."

Bottoms up," Cedric said, lifting his glass to Ryan's once more. "Let's drown our sorrows." Ryan consumed another glass.

Cedric filled up Ryan's glass once again, urging him to drink before he could get a word out.

Ryan continued to drink glass after glass, his vision becoming blurry,when he heard Cedric let out a sigh.

"Ryan," Cedric said, rotating the glass in his hand. His voice was gentle, the opposite of the loud music in the bar. He appeared burdened by unrequited love,and Ryan felt a wave of empathy.

Ryan was about to respond when Cedric gestured for him to wait.

"Ryan, I know. You've always been like family to me after all these years."

Ryan felt a wave of unease at his words. But the alcohol clouded his thoughts, leaving him unable to think of a reply.

Cedric continued, "My wife keeps her distance,claiming it's for my own good. Wouldn't that upset you?"

Witnessing Cedric's disheartened appearance, Ryan felt a surge of sympathy.

Cedric caught Ryan's sincere look and blinked,exhaling deeply. "I'm at a loss what to do now. Ryan,just be honest with me. Am I that untrustworthy? You know me more than anyone else. No one else understands, but vou do, right? I've loved Daniela for over ten years. I've valued her so deeply,and now I'm at a loss. Ryan, what should I do?"

He then filled Ryan's glass once more.

Cedric emptied his drink, leaving Ryan no option but to do the same.

After placing his glass down, Ryan met Cedric's expectant,curious look.

Ryan shook his head, his thoughts clouded. "Cedric,truly, Daniela is doing this for the best. She cares for you. I've never seen her show such concern for anyone else as she does for you."

Cedric let out a profound sigh. "Is that so? But I've heard my family troubles her?"

At those words, Ryan's heart raced. Yet, the growing effects of the alcohol scrambled his thoughts. "You're aware of it? Didn't Daniela ask us not to tell you? She feared it would bourden you."

Cedric shook his head, appearing distressed.

"I can't say more; Daniela has forbidden it. But Cedric.believe me.She won't leave you,truly.She loves you,"Ryan reassured him.

Cedric watched as Ryan sank into the sofaand began messing with his phone, likely calling someone for a ride.Cedric lowered his gaze, taking another sip from his glass. As Ryan glanced his way, Cedric murmured, "1fear she wants to divorce me."

Ryan bolted upright at those words. "No way! What makes you think that, Cedric? Daniela loves you so much."

Cedric leaned back on the sofa, his face expressionless. "If we end up divorcing, I might as well die. I have no family; nobody really cares about me."

Ryan's eyes grew wide. "That's not true! Cedric, if your biological father could see how successful you are today,he would be incredibly proud. His other son has turned out to be a disappointment."

Cedric's expression hardened, his emotions in chaos.Yet,he kept his composure, appearing as if he had always known and it didn't affect him. "His other son a disappointment? Not necessarily," he said casually.though he tightened his grip on the glass.

"Not necessarily? Absolutely!" Ryan, visibly drunk.stumbled over his words. "Your older brother is really something else. If your family knew about you, they would try to exploit you. Your father and grandmother are as manipulative as Caiden. Daniela is scared of what could happen to you."

Ryan hiccupped. "But with her by your side, you won't face harm. She's mostly worried you'll feel wronged,and currently, she suspects your family is mixed up in that issue." Cedric quickly asked, "What issue?"

Ryan said,"It's..."

Suddenly,his face had hit the table.

Cedric frowned,pulling at Ryan.

Ryan was completely knocked out, and Cedric massaged his temples.

What could the issue be?

Without wasting any more time, Cedric instructed someone to take Ryan home. He then set off for his home.
###Chapter 471 The Family Emblem
Maureen Phillips was 80 years old, her face radiating a glow of kindness and warmth.

In her youth, she worked as a seamstress. After losing her husband, she adopted Cedric and treated him with nothing but kindness, as if hewere her own grandson.

Throughout the years, she handcrafted all of Cedric's andergarments with love and care.

Even though her vision had weakened over time,she continued the tradition of sewing these items.

When Cedric arrived, Maureen welcomed him wvith a warm smile and looked around him.

"Daniela didn't come with you? Why did you return alone today?" she asked with a gentle smile.

Cedric entered and took a seat across from her at the long table.

"Grandma, there's something I need to ask you."

The smile lingered on Maureen's lips. "Go ahead, ask,"she said in a soft, comforting voice, always speaking as though to a child.

"Grandma, when you adopted me, did I have anything with me?" Cedric asked. Maureen had always been open about discussing Cedric's adoption.

Upon hearing his question, she continued to smile gently. "Let me think. Ah, you had a piece of red cloth with what appeared to be a family emblem on it.It was charred by fire, with most of it gone, only the edges remained. After I adopted you, I inquired at the orphanage about it, but they told me it was lost. They showed me only a photo of the damaged emblem."

Despite the fading of her memory with age,Maureen's expertise as a seamstress helped her remember patterns vividly.

"And the emblem on that red cloth, though incomplete, was clearly from a distinguished and wealthy family. I did try to match it withvarious family crests, but the missing parts made identification impossible."

As she talked, Maureen began to draw slowly on a sheet of white paper beside her.

When she completed the sketch, she handed it to Cedric, her eyes twinkling.

"This emblem has a distinctive pattern.I still recall it vividly, even after all these years."

Cedric examined the sketch.
The emblem was indeed largely destroyed, with only about ten percent remaining. The visible part hinted  at a curved shape.

It resembled the wing of an angel.

After leaving Maureen's, Cedric headed to Phillips Group.

He hired the world's foremost private investigator and made a personal visit to the orphanage he came from years earlier.

Cedric's ongoing donations had significantly helped the orphanage.

Upon his arrival, the director personally welcomed him.

"Are you referring to the red cloth you had as a child?I remember that the material was quite extraordinary.I'd never encountered anything as soft before,similar to that of cashmere or silk. It had an emblem. Our previous director, when he admitted you, suggested your background must be extraordinary. Sadly, the orphanage suffered a fire later, and that piece of cloth was destroyed."

Cedric asked, "What about the records from that time?Are they still accessible?"

The director stood and said, "I need to search for them.We have a lot of materials, and it's somewhat disorganized. Recently, some children were playing with fire which nearly caused a major disaster in the archives. It's quite a mess there now. Cedric, perhaps you should return home and await our update. Once we locate anything, I'll ensure it is sent  to you."Cedric nodded in agreement and, before leaving.donated another million dollars to the orphanage.

The director offered his sincere gratitude.
After Cedric left, the director organized the entire orphanage staff to search the archives for the records.
###Chapter 472 Can You Reclaim What's Been Lost
Ryan was brought back home. and Lillian was waiting for him at the entrance.

"Who were you out drinking with to end up like this?"she asked.

Ryan,who had vomited twice during the ride home.was somewhat more clear-headed now."Cedric,"he managed to say

Lillian paused briefly in surprise. "Cedric?"

Ryan confirmed with a nod."Yes."

"Isn't Cedric known for not pressuring others to drink?How did you get so drunk?" Lillian asked, helping Ryan as they entered the house.

Ryan appeared unusually proud of himself,though Lillian couldn't understand why.

Ryan boasted,"Besides Daniela, I'm the most important person to Cedric. You jealous, Lillian?"

Even while drunk, he couldn't resist showing off.

Lillian chose not to argue with someone who was drunk.

As Lillian assisted Ryan inside, Daniela was drinL! some water.Noticing Ryan being supported,she asked.
"He was out drinking with Cedric?"

Lillian confirmed with a nod.

Daniela took another sip of water and looked over at Ryan's state. "Is he completely wasted?"

Ryan held up two fingers. "He threw up twice."

Daniela arched an eyebrow, pausing briefly. "And Cedric? Is he drunk as well?"

Upon hearing her question, Ryan squinted,leaning on Lillian's shoulder, thinking for a moment.

Eventually,he shut his eyes and responded to Daniela."No.Cedric can drink everyone under the table,never showing even a flush."

Daniela was aware that Cedric could handle his alcohol well

So,what was Cedric's motive for getting Ryan drunk?

Lillian set Ryan down on the couch and exchanged a look of understanding with Daniela.

A quiet moment passed between them.

Lillian exhaled deeply. "Ryan may be great at games,
but when it comes to strategy, Cedric is unmatched."

Daniela set her water glass down slowly.Lillian said, "Tomorrow, I'll tell Ryan to avoid drinking  sessions with Cedric."

She hesitated before adding, "I'm just not sure what all he ended up revealing."

When Ryan woke up, he struggled to sit up, only to nearly jump back in fear. "Daniela? Lillian? What's going on?"

In her hand,Daniela held a fruit knife.

Lillian was holding a hammer.

"What did you tell Cedric when you were out drinking last night?"

Ryan looked confused and instead asked, "How did I end up home?

He had no memory of the return.

Daniela exhaled, set the fruit knife aside, and headed upstairs.

The following day, as Daniela approached the company.Linden was already at the entrance of the Elite Lux building,waiting.

When Linden saw Daniela, he mirrored Lillian's usual greeting and called out, "Good morning,Daniela."

Daniela gave him a brief look and walked into the building.

"Elyse and Natalie are waiting in your office. I think they're here because they've run out of money anc  are likely to ask you for some."

As soon as Daniela heard this, she looked at Linden and quickly understood what he was suggesting.

Her lips curved into a smirk. "Why? You interested?"

Linden laughed, bowing his head and responding humbly, "It's straightforward talking to someone as sharp as you. You miss nothing. I've been interestedin Natalie for many years. Even though her status has fallen, I still find her quite appealing."

Unlike those women who exchanged their morality for personal gain and became impure. Natalie was raised in wealth,wwhich made her naturally more attractive.

Daniela offered a slight smile but remained silent.

In the elevator,Linden knelt down. "Consider me as your slave, ready to undertake any task you need.I pledge my loyalty to you going forward."

Daniela smiled. As the elevator doors opened.she stepped out.

Linden could tell that Daniela had agreed.

As Daniela walked into her office, Elyse stood up from her chair.

"Daniela, there's beena massive misunderstanding!You've really misunderstood me, your dear aunt.Everything I said in the hotel was just to mislead  Linden.You know I'm the most compassionate person in the world. And because of this, I often get taken advantage of. Your mother always showed me particular kindness for this reason.Daniela,if your mom could see from heaven how you're treating me,she'd be devastated."

Elyse was deeply in debt and saw no escape.

Natalie had hired someone to assassinate Daniela,but nothing came of it. The person she paid kept insisting that the payment was insufficient, fooling her in the process.

The last time. Elyse exploded in anger only for the other party tosay."I was merely playing you.You're just now figuring that out."

The villathe designer handbags. and all other luxury items had vanished.

Elyse was devastated, nearly driven to madness.

"Daniela, I've been misled by a scammer. They've taken myvilla and all my valuables. You have to stand up for me."

Daniela sat at her desk, her gaze fixed with cold intensity on Elyse's dishonest face.

She burst out laughing.

Elyse let out a nervous laugh, while Natalie, standing next to her, kept a cold, composed expression. Daniela rested her chin on her hand. "Really? So you were scammed? Does that mean you didn't plan my mother's assassination?"

Elyse quickly shook her head.

Daniela continued,"Was that time not part of your plan, for me to end up in Linden's bed?"

Elyse was filled with regret. "It was all justa huge misunderstanding. Everything got completely misunderstood

Elyse's expression appeared sincere. To anyone watching,her distress would likely seem real

"But what can we do?" Daniela smiled faintly,her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Natalie, you ended up sleeping with Linden,didn't you?"

Natalie was already deeply embarrassed by the situation. She clenched her teeth and glared at Daniela.

Daniela merely laughed and glanced at Elyse's stiff smile. "It was all a misunderstanding, but what can we do now? Can you reclaim what's been lost?"
###Chapter 473 A Married Status Would Bind Natali...
Daniela's words lingered in the silence.

Natalie was fuming with rage, on the brink of losing control

She stood rooted, nearly at the point of attacking Daniela.

Daniela was without a mother. How could she be so arrogant?

"That's none of your business," Elyse snapped.her anger matching her rage not to provoke Daniela further. "Natalie chose to be with Linden on her own:it's none of your concern,Daniela."

Daniela laughed. "Is that so? If I remember correctly.Natalie previously scoffed at Linden. So, she acts as if she hates him yet secretly loves him? Natalie,you have feelings for Linden, don't you?"

Right after she spoke, Linden, who was just entering the room, gave a scheming grin.

Natalie took a deep breath, preparing herself to confront Daniela.

"Yes! Natalie is somewhat shy, but she indeed has feelings for Linden," Elyse confirmed. Daniela looked directly at Natalie. "Really? Natalie,do you really have feelings for Linden? Should I set you up with him? What do you think?"

Natalie clenched her teeth. "There's no need for you to intervene,Daniela."

Following her response, the smile slowly disappeared from Daniela's face. "Is that so? Then perhaps I'm overstepping. If that's the case, I won't intervene in your issues either,Aunt Elyse."

"Please!" Elyse instantly became desperate. "Daniela,we're family,the closest there is. I'm your aunt, and I'm facing troubles; how can you turn me away? Daniela.I have no one else but you to depend on."
With that,Elyse approached Linden with a smile and placed his hand on Natalie's. "I support this marriage."

Daniela grinned."An ideal pair."

After leaving Daniela's office, Natalie was fuming, and on the verge of exploding. "What's the meaning of this, Mom?"Is your daughter really just a pawn in your game? You're selling me off to this jerk for your own sake."

Natalie spoke harshly, completely ignoring Linden's presence.

"What other choice did I have? Do you really think l wanted this? If we hadn't agreed, Daniela wouldn't have given us the money. So. who would have paid off the huge debt from the hotel?"

Natalie clenched her teeth.

Linden,leaning against the wall, observed the two women as they plotted and strategized, only to realize their helplessness.

They never understood that they were outmatched by Daniela.

Fed up with the scene.Linden walked over and pulled Natalie away.

Natalie exclaimed in surprise, "What exactly are you doing?"

Linden smirked, a hint of mischief on his lips. "What does it look like I'm doing?"

He stepped closer to Natalie, breathing warm air onto her face. As she flinched. Linden leaned in and whispered,"Fuck you."

Natalie fought back with all her strength,urging Elyse to step in and offer her help.

Suddenly, the CEO's office door swung open,and Daniela appeared at the far end of the corridor.watching the scene.

As she felt Daniela's gaze on her, Elyse's grip on Natalie's hand loosened.

A wave of fear washed over Natalie. She tightened htdrhiete bond Daniela looked on in silence, a subtle smile curving her lips.

Natalie shook her head at Elyse, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Mom, please don't let him take me. You know what he'll do. I can't go with Linden. Please help me!"

Natalie's voice was thick with despair as she cried.

Elyse's eyes welled with tears. However, she quickly pulled her hand away from Natalie's.

Linden laughed as he pulled Natalie towards the elevator,making their movement obvious to everyone in the secretarial department.

Just as the elevator doors began io close, he lifted Natalie's shirt.

As Natalie screamed in terror. Linden kissed her forcefully,fully aware of the eyes watching them.

Elyse watched everything, shutting her eyes in surrender.

As the elevator doors slowly closed, Linden's hand moved lower, and Natalie, overwhelmed by the situation,closed her eyes in defeat.

The bystanders gasped, their disdain for Elyse and Natalie intensifying.
Elyse had the power to rescue her daughter. Had she intervened,Daniela would have commanded Linden to  stop.

Was there no escape for Natalie?

Actually,there was.
If she had dialed the police right there. Linden would have given up without a fight, but Natalie chose not to.

Her act of closing her eyes signified surrendering to her fate, overwhelmed by financial burdens.

Daniela watched everything, her lips curling into a faint smile.

It was far from enough.

Nowhere near enough.

Only the complete ruin of those involved could ever make up for the loss of her mother.

Her mother had been taken too soon, and those responsible would not be easily let off.

Elyse wiped at the tears near her lips, turning to Daniela with a wide grin. "Daniela, you see? They're a perfect match. Daniela, all those previous issues were just misunderstandings. Now, about the retirement home you promised,when will I get it?"

She was sacrificing Natalie's future for wealth.

Daniela was mildly entertained. "What I promised, I'll certainly fulfill. Aunt Elyse, since Natalie and Linden seem so taken with each other, when are they planning to get married?"

Elyse's face shifted to one of disbelief.

Getting married?

A fling was something that held no real importance.

When Natalie rose to power, who would still recall her past mistakes?

But marriage was a different matter entirely.

A married status would bind Natalie to Linden forever.
###Chapter 474 Linden Or Doug
Elyse's eyes blazed with anger. "Well..."

"What?" Nina appeared out of nowhere,her lips curled in a mocking grin. "Are you suggesting that Natalie's relationship with Linden isn't genuine? That they have no plans to marry? Mom, I'm quite confused. What's the purpose behind all this?"

No sooner had she finished speaking than Elyse fixed Nina with an intense glare,her teeth clenched as she hissed a warning. "Ninal Have you lost your senses?Utter another word,and you'll regret it."

Nina remained composed. "I've long been dead."

Her emotional death came the day Elyse forced her into Linden's bed and the public disgrace she endured on her wedding day, kidnapped and displayed throughout the city.

Natalie stumbled out of the hotel after Linden had his way of her. Her eyes were full of shame,telling a story that words couldn't.

There was nothing more humiliating than being forced to sleep with someone she found very disgusting.

As Natalie stepped out, she caught sight of Elyse "When is Daniela going to pay you? What else does  she want?"

Elyse appeared distressed. "Daniela mentioned you need to marry Linden."

Natalie's eyes grew wide in shock. "What? Is she insane? Marrying Linden would destroy my life."

She had indeed been intimate with Linden,but what of it?

She could have her hymen repaired and pretend to be a virgin.

But to marry? To someone like Linden, who would so easily agree to a divorce?

How would she climb the social ranks once again?

Natalie clenched her teeth. "I absolutely refuse!"

Linden, who was picking his teeth, stepped out of the hotel and overheard Natalie's words. He let out a quiet laugh.

He pulled Natalie close and kissed her forcefully."Still as stubborn as ever, aren't you? Soon, you'll come crawling back to me, just like last night."

As Linden walked away, his words still lingering in the air,a look of success spread across his face.

Natalie turned sharply to Elyse, her tone full of blame."Mom,you don't understand how horrible Linden is! He tortured me all night long! He's even more rotten than Doug." As she spoke, Natalie rolled up her sleeve to show many marks.

Even Elyse, experienced as she was, couldn't suppress a gasp.

Elyse examined the marks on Natalie's arm, then stared off into the distance, falling silent for a long while.

Eventually, she spoke. "Natalie, darling,there are only two ways out of this mess."

Natalie looked at her eagerly. "What are they? Mom,I can't endure another day without money."

Linden had even made her pay for the motel,leaving her penniless.

He had brought her to a run-down motel, its walls heavy with the smell of musty cigarette smoke,almost suffocating her with the foul smell.

At that moment, Natalie truly grasped the full extent of the terror that came with poverty.

Natalie longed with all her heart to regain the life she had once known, wishing she would never again find herself caught up with a bastard like Linden, praying for the nightmare to finally end.

"Natalie," Elyse whispered, gazing at her daughter's face. "One option is to marry Linden. Let Daniela offer you a generous dowry, purchase our old villa,and transfer it to vou This would provido.some
security,and we could strategize further from there."

Without hesitation, Natalie declared, "I'll take the second option."

She couldn't bear the thought of seeing Linden again.

The image of his disgusting face lingered in her mind.a haunting mark she desperately wished to erase.

Elyse continued, "The second option is Doug. Winning his favor could solve your financial worries, but it would cost you your reputation."

Doug had a reputation for openly boasting about his affairs, often going as far as recording them to show off to his acquaintances.

If Natalie ever became involved with Doug,it only meant there would be no hiding it.

It would forever tarnish Natalie's reputation.

"The advantage is immediate wealth. Doug is lavish with his girlfriends. He offers a hundred million the first night and continues to provide support. This is what happened to Joyce when she was desperate.At least now, she no longer struggles financially.If you attract Doug's attention, the money will never stop.Natalie, these are the only options I see. Make your choice."

Not only was Natalie desperate to avoid poverty, but Elyse was too. She even regretted getting rid of Brylee. Brylee might have valued their sisterly relationship, unlike Daniela, the relentless woman determined on their downfall.

"I wonder what drives Daniela's madness. Sure, Brylee was her mother but left when she was just five. Does Daniela really need to seek revenge against us? After all, we're some of the few family members she has left."

Elyse was not ready to give up. "Perhaps I should appeal to Daniela once more?"

Natalie stood firm, gazing into the distance, holding Elyse back. "Mom, don't go. Daniela is heartless and will show no mercy.I've made my decision."

Elyse looked at Natalie in disbelief. "Linden or Doug?
###Chapter 475 The Nail In Natalie's Coffin
Elyse clung to a sliver of hope when it came to Daniela.

"What about Linden? He's never been married.And no matter what, Daniela is still family. If you marry him.she won't just leave you with nothing."

Natalie narrowed her eyes. "So I'm supposed to bet my future on her goodwill? Depend on her charity and tiptoe around her moods? Why shouldI?"

Elyse let out a weary sigh. "If you go for Doug,you better brace yourself. Joyce won't just step aside.She's not the type to let things slide. Last time,a woman flirted with Doug, and Joyce handled it by carving 'bitch' into her face. Think you can deal with that?"

Natalie scoffed. "Joyce? She's not even worth a second thought. Daniela's tricky,sure,but Joyce?Please." A smirk played on her lips.

"So..." Elyse hesitated, pressing her lips together."Is your mind made up?"

Natalie nodded firmly. "I'm done being someone's pawn.Daniela already knows what happened to Brylee.If we don't find a powerful ally, we'll be dead sooner or later-or worse,locked away like Caiden. We need to act before it's too late."

Elyse chewed on her lower lip. "Natalie, maybe we should just let this go," she murmured, the fear of losing her daughter gnawing at her. "I'll confess everything to Daniela. I'll get on my knees if I have to -beg her to forgive us."

Natalie let out a sharp laugh. "Her mother's dead-your apology means nothing. And from where I'm standing, Daniela's already decided to wipe us out."

Elyse fell into silence, her gaze dark and calculating."If I tell Daniela who's really behind it all, do you think she'd let us go?"

Natalie shook her head. "They're too powerful. Not even Daniela can take them on. If we cross both sides,we're finished."

Elyse lowered her gaze,releasing a heavy sigh.

Meanwhile, in the office, the surveillance system broadcasted every word of Elyse and Natalie's conversation.

Linden clenched his jaw, rage twisting his face.

That shameless woman! She was already his,yet she had the audacity to consider another man.

She'd rather be someone's mistress than be his wife?

Did she have no regard for his pride at all?

Furious beyond words, Linden turned to Daniela. "We  at most can't let Natalie seduce Doug."

Daniela, unfazed, was casually testing out a beta game.

Without looking up, she said calmly, "Linden, if you want to keep a woman, you need skills. I gave you the chance. She's already slept with you, yet she still doesn't want you. That's on you, not me."

Panic surged through Linden. He had always assumed Daniela would have his back-he never expected her to abandon him so easily.

"Doesn't this concern you too? If Natalie secures a stronger ally, she'll be even harder to handle."

Daniela let out a slow, mocking chuckle. "Linden,don't waste your breath. Elyse and Natalie? They're nothing but clowns to me. Even if they latched onto ten men like Doug, I still wouldn't care."

Linden knew she meant every word. He just refused to accept it. He had counted on using Daniela's power to bring Natalie to heel.

"Yes, you're incredibly powerful." Linden dropped to his knees, keeping his sharp gaze lowered. "That's why I'm begging for your help."

Daniela didn't even glance at him, her focus still on her game.

The sharp crack of gunfire from her game filled the office. "Linden, if you want something, go earn it yourself."  Linden's whole body tensed.

Then came Daniela's cold laugh. "All bark, no bite. 1don't keep dogs that won't bite."

Linden's head snapped up at her words.

Her expression was frozen,unreadable.

In that moment, it hit him-he wasn't Ryan or Lillian.Daniela protected her own fiercely, but he wasn't part of that inne circle.

Right now, he didn't even come close.

Linden backed out of her office, his gaze dark with murderous intent as he stared into the distance.

If he wanted to be part of Daniela's world, he needed to prove himself-with an act she couldn't ignore.

And Natalie and Elyse? They would be his offering.

Nina brushed past Linden,catching the chilling rage in his eyes. Her stomach twisted with unease, and she quickly knocked on Daniela's door.

"Daniela, my sister's asking to borrow money. Should I lend it to her?"

Daniela, still engrossed in her game, replied casually,"Up to you." She never meddled in other people's affairs.

"I heard from my mom and Natalie-they're going to  the charity auction tonight and need a custom dress worth half a million."

Daniela smnirked. "So Natalie's playing the elegant temptress,hoping to reel Doug in."

Lillian, eyes still on her game, let out a light laugh."Obviously. She needs a plan to snatch Doug away and shove Joyce out of the picture."

Daniela scoffed.

Nina,standing nearby, had no clue what they were scheming.
/
But that didn't matter. Whatever Daniela decided was right-no questions needed. Instead, she simply asked."Daniela, should I lend them the money?"

Daniela nodded. "Yes, lend it. I'll send you the five hundred grand-hand it over to them."

Lillian's grin widened. "Natalie's diving straight into the fire-seducing Doug means stepping on Joyce's lifeline,and Joyce won't just stand by. Meanwhile.Linden's losing his mind because she'd rather chase a thrice-married man than pick him. Three people, one battleground-this is going to be fun."

Daniela let out a soft,amused laugh.

The pieces clicked into place for Nina, and she gave Daniela an approving thumbs-up. "Genius. You're just sitting back and enjoying the fireworks!" Daniela's smile deepened as she turned to Lillian."Come with me tonight. We'll watch the show firsthand."

Nina straightened. "Daniela, I'm coming too. AndI'll personally fund Natalie's five hundred grand."

Daniela arched a brow.

Nina's fists tightened. "I want that money to be the nail in Natalie's coffin."

Her face twisted with pure hatred, a darkness so stark that Daniela took a second look.
###Chapter 476 Is This Really A Good Idea
Daniela had checked with Cedric's secretary, and Cedric would attend tonight's charity auction.

So, the moment Daniela wrapped up work, she went straight to Phillips Group.

Cedric's secretary met her downstairs and escorted her up. As they reached his office, she caught his voice mid-conversation."You still can't find it?"

The reply was too faint to hear, but Cedric's face tightened,disappointment flickering in his eyes.

"Alright, thanks. Let me know if anything else comes up," Cedric said,ending the call.

Then,he turned around and noticed Daniela standing at the door, unsure of when she had arrived.

Daniela stepped inside. "What are you searching for?"

Cedric knew she hadn't heard much. He tightened his grip on his phone and shook his head. "Nothing important."

Daniela's lips curved. "You're going to the auction,right? I came to get you."

Cedric's fingers pressed into his phone. He was direct-sometimes,being tough was necessary to make things clear.

He knew that well.

But when he met Daniela's steady gaze, the words caught in his throat.

His voice dropped in frustration. "Daniela..."

Daniela only smiled at him.

Cedric exhaled."We're still fighting."

Daniela nodded, unbothered. "I know. Forgiving me too fast feels too easy. doesn't it? You're still not satisfied, That's fine-I can keep pacifying you."

Cedric felt his resolve slipping. Daniela was flawless.except for one thing-she was just as stubborn as he was.

"I don't need you to pacify me, Daniela.I just want to know-who are you really after? Don't tell me it's just Natalie and Elyse."

To Daniela, Natalie and Elyse were nothing.

If she was being this careful, there had to be a reason.

And the way she had rejected him before-cold and absolute-told him there was something bigger lurking beneath. Cedric was sharp. Lying to him was pointless. She wasn't going to lie, but she wasn't ready to tell the whole truth either. Instead, she repeated what she'd told him a dozen times before. "Just wait a little longer.I'll tell you everything."

Cedric sighed, that familiar frustration washing over him.

He had run out of options.

Once Daniela made a decision, nothing could change it.

Not even him.

Cedric knew he wasn't her exception and that realization cut deeper than he expected.

"Then I won't be attending the charity auction with you tonight."

Cedric's anger simmered beneath the surface.

He could never understand why Daniela had to be so stubborn.

In that moment, he was sure-he didn't matter to her at all.

Daniela bit her lip, hesitated, then stood up with a light chuckle. "Well... alright. I'll leave. Don't be upset."

Her words struck a nerve, igniting what little patience he had left.Cedric let out a sharp laugh, his eyes dark with frustration. "Do you even care if I'm upset? Acting like you're doing me a favor-it doesn't make me happy at all."

For the first time, Cedric truly lost his temper with Daniela.

Daniela froze. She wanted to comfort him,but she didn't know how.

She had lost her mother at five, and from that moment,she never learned how to comfort anyone.

She didn't know how to make Cedric happy or how to ask him to wait just a little longer.

So she said nothing.

With Alexander, money had been enough to buy peace.But with Cedric,it wouldn't work.

He'd see it as an insult.

But she didn't know any other way.

So she pressed her lips together, forcing back a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Then..." She blinked, her vision burning. "I'm sorry."

She had nothing else to offer.

Other than an apology, she had nothing to give Cedric.

She stepped back, unable to even pretend to smile She turned and left,leaving Cedric's secretary in shock.

"Mr. Phillips, what are you doing? You were anxiously waiting for her to come, and now that she's here,why are you pushing her away with such harsh words?"

No one had ever seen Daniela look so lost. One of the wealthiest people in the world, yet she had no idea how to comfort the man she loved.

The secretary frowned. "Mr. Phillips, that was cruel."

Cedric lowered his eyes, his jaw tightening. He had already taken the first step-hesitating now would only make him look weak. So, he braced himself and took the second.

He tightened his grip on his phone, frustration twisting in his chest. When he looked up, his expression was cold, unreadable. "Tonight, have Lydia Vargas accompany me to the charity auction."

The secretary's eyes widened in disbelief. "Have you lost your mind?"

Lydia Vargas was a fresh-faced starlet under Phillips Group's entertainment division.

She was bold in her actions, even bolder in her wardrobe. Rumors swirled that she had only signed with Phillips Group to get closer to Cedric.

She had even declared in interviews that her only I was towin him over. In the entertainment industry, moral standards were often flimsy, and so-called principles were easily cast aside.
It didn't matter if someone was married, as long as they got what they wanted-power,wealth, a name.

"Mr. Phillips, why don't you just talk to your wife? Is provoking her like this really a good idea?"

Concern etched across the secretary's face.
###Chapter 477 | Am Lydia Vargas
It was still early when Daniela left Phillips Group. So she made her way back to Elite Lux.

Lillian arched a brow and glanced behind her. "What's wrong this time? Did you hit another snag?"

Daniela's shoulders slumped. "He's really angry this time."

Lillian leaned back in her chair, pausing her video game. "Why don't you just tell Cedric the truth? It's just his family, right? No need to back down."

Daniela's expression clouded at the mention of Cedric.Knowing his complicated family dynamics made her wary-a feeling she couldn't shake.

Sensing the shift in mood, Lillian set her controller down and focused entirely on Daniela. The distant echoes of virtual gunfire filled the vast office space.

After a thoughtful pause, Lillian suggested, "Maybe it's time to let this go. Cedric's involvement only complicates matters. If he starts resenting you,then why bother? Why not make life easier? If it all falls apart, maybe it's best to divorce Cedric. That way,neither of you has to deal with any mess. Sounds better,right?" Daniela's hand trembled slightly at Lillian's words.

She tried to ignore the quiver, giving her palm a gentle squeeze to soothe the growing ache.
Lillian offered, "It's better to end things soon than to let the agony linger. If you can't face him, I'll handle it."

Daniela's gaze drifted, her expression clouded by distant thoughts. "Lillian, you just don't understand."

Lillian's gaze fixed on Daniela, confusion etched across her face. "What's there to misunderstand? You managed perfectly well before Cedric came along.Even if he backs off now, who's to say the future won't bring more heartache? Your relationship is bound to dwindle. Wouldn't it be wiser to part on good terms now while some fondness remains?"

The memory of Cedric's determined face earlier that day flashed in Daniela's mind, reigniting the trembling in her hand. This time, the pain was sharper.

Lillian caught the subtle change instantly, her voice faltering. "You..."

She paused, her features etched with shock.

Daniela's battle with depression had been a closed ###Chapter, one that hadn't resurfaced in years. Yet,now..

"Is it because of Cedric?"

Lillian had never anticipated Cedric's influence on Daniela would be so profound. It had never been about curing depression-it was about keeping it in check, knowing it would always come and go. The moment emotions spiraled,the symptoms found their way back. It all showed in the symptoms-proof that emotions weren't just in the mind.

"Don't worry about it. Just a minor thing," Daniela insisted.

Lillian's brow furrowed with concern. "Did something happen at Phillips Group today? Did Cedric say something to upset you?"

Daniela's fingers caressed her numb palm as she reached for her phone, her expression veiled and unreadable. "No. What could he possibly say to me?"

For a moment, Lillian considered it, but she knew Cedric wasn't the type to do that.

Yet, as they arrived at the charity event that evening and glimpsed the figure in the red dress standing beside Cedric,both Daniela and Lillian froze.

Fury ignited within Lillian, propelling her forward with fiery resolve.

Meanwhile, Daniela was rooted to the spot, her reaction stifled by shock.

Her world narrowed to the sight of Cedric, standing beside him Lydia-the undeniable center of attention.

dia was radiant her allure magnified hv the vivid red dress clinging to her curves. She leaned towards Cedric, her head tilted in a gesture of intimate familiarity, her every word dripping with an effortless.seductive charm.

Cedric stood regally, his silhouette sharply tailored in a custom-made suit, cradling a glass of wine. A faint smile played at the corners of his mouth.

Daniela, clutching her purse as if it were a lifeline,felt the room suddenly tighten around her. Her breath became shallow; the whispers and stares of the gathered elite felt suffocating.

Every gaze seemed magnetically drawn to her and Cedric-this was the kind of drama the high society thrived on.

They all remembered Cedric's protective aura around her,and now, here he stood, barely a year into their marriage,with another woman by his side.

For the elite, ravenous for the latest tale of intrigue.this was a feast.

But Daniela's world narrowed to Cedric alone.

She studied his subtly curved lips, her grip on her purse tightening involuntarily, her heart drumming a frantic rhythm before she forced her fingers to relax.

Lillian, with a flare of protective fury, broke through the crowd and yanked Lydia from Cedric's side."Cedric, this is too much! After your argument with Daniela, did she try to make amends? Quarrel all you want, but why involve a third party? Do you know she 一

"Lillian," Daniela interjected as she approached and pulled Lillian back. Her right hand trembled slightly as she gripped her purse, the movement so subtle that only a keen eye would catch it.

"Enough, Lillian," Daniela whispered. "There are reporters all around."

Reporters didn't matter to Daniela. The only thing on her mind was Cedric and his Phillips Group.

Beside Cedric, Lydia appraised the woman known as the richest in the world with keen interest.

Daniela's beauty was effortless, her complexion radiant even without a hint of makeup. Her eyes,particularly striking, shone with a clarity that was both rare and enviable.

"Hello, Ms. Harper. I'm Lydia Vargas." Lydia greeted her with a calculated casualness, extending her hand.

Lillian tensed, her gaze sharpening, as if she were about to intervene.

However, Daniela stopped her with a gentle touch,accepting Lydia's handshake with a warm, disarming smile. "It's a pleasure to meet you. That's a stunning dress you're wearing tonight."

Lydia returned the smile. "Thank you. Mr. Phillips chose it for me; he believes red is my color." Daniela nodded, her response dripping with grace. "It certainly is. If you'll excuse me, I must be going. Enjoy your evening."

Lydia watched her go, a flicker of surprise crossing her features.

She hadn't thought it would go this way. Daniela stayed composed, unruffled, and completely unfazed by the provocation.

She assumed a few sharp words would break Daniela's composure, provoking Daniela to snap at her so that Cedric would feel bad for her.

This caught her completely off guard.
###Chapter 478 The Third Marriage
The event organizers had originally placed Daniela's seat next to Cedric.

Lydia approached Daniela and asked, "Ms. Harper,apologies, but you're in my spot. Could you find another seat,please?"

The sound of cameras clicking filled the air as reporters rushed to capture the moment.

All eyes then turned to Daniela.

The crowd was eager to see if Daniela would confront the daring woman.

Yet,Daniela remained perfectly calm.

She glanced over at Cedric, their eyes locked briefly,and she offered a subtle smile before saying, "Alright."

With that,Daniela headed to the back of the room and settled into the last open seat.

The event staff scrambled in disarray, while Cedric maintained a grim look throughout.

Lydia,watching with a flirty smile, teased Cedric, "Mr.Phillips, if you invited me to stir jealousy, that look won't help. We should appear closer, more
ffetn The mysterious, fleeting expression on Daniela's face earlier in the light lingered in Cedric's mind,refusing to let him go.

He believed Daniela had no feelings for him.

Not at all!

She seemed indifferent to him bringing another woman to the event.

What did he truly mean to her?

Just a casual fling, without any real meaning?

Anger brewed inside Cedric, his focus far from Lydia's subtle flirtations.

Meanwhile, Lillian, seated at the back, was fuming."Daniela! I've said it before-Cedric isn't worth your time!"

Daniela's hand, hanging by her side, shook uncontrollably.

The dim lighting at the auction masked her expression.Despite taking several deep breaths, her anxiety persisted.

At last, Daniela exhaled deeply. She retrieved a pill from her purse.

Observing this, Lillian turned and held Daniela's hand down. "Don't take it now. If you do,you'll have to begin all over." In the front row. Lydia rested her head on Cedric's shoulder, then shifted closer, their faces nearly touching.
Daniela managed a weak smile and said to Lillian, "If I don't take this, I won't make it through the night here."

Lillian slowly loosened her hold.

Daniela swallowed the pill with calm indifference.letting the wine wash it down.

From the shadows, a pair of ominous eyes observed every move.

Midway through the event, Daniela's chest tightened.She impulsively placed a bid on an item and whispered to Lillian, "I don't feel well. Let's go."

Lillian agreed, and with Daniela, they both stood up to leave.
Before leaving, Daniela turned and stole a glance at Cedric in the front row, subtly lowering her eyelashes.

As she raised her eyes, Cedric coincidentally looked back, and their gazes locked.

Daniela's face lit up with a sincere, effortless smile.

With a soft smile, she mouthed to Cedric, "I'm leaving.

She quickly walked over to the heavy wooden door and disappeared behind it. Cedric stood up abruptly

Puzzled, Lydia asked, "What's wrong?"

Cedric shook off Lydia's hand, a wave of panic washing over him as he darted outside.

However,when he reached the door, it was empty;no one was in sight.

All that remained was the stream of passing cars.Standing at the hotel entrance,he gave himself a hard slap.

"Mr. Phillips," called out the secretary, rushing after him. "What are you doing out here? They're waiting for your speech inside. Come on, we need to get back."

Feeling hollow,Cedric lingered at the doorway,his pause prolonged by the distant voices filtering out from the venue. "Next, please welcome Mr. Phillips to present the most significant auction item of the night."

"Mr.Phillips? Mr.Phillips?"

The secretary, grabbing Cedric's arm,hurried him back inside. As they reentered, Cedric glanced back one last time.

Outside,the night lay dark and still.

Daniela didn't head home; she went back to Elite Lux instead.

"Are you alright?" Lillian asked. Daniela shook her head. "Just a bit down. It's normal -just side effects from the medication. I'm okay."

Lillian was visibly upset. "Divorce Cedric! What a jerk!Is it just because you didn't tell him everything? Does it really need to be this way?"

Daniela slumped back on the couch, drained. "Let's see.If...”"

She struggled to finish what she was trying to say.

The memories of their closeness haunted her. How could she just let go?

After some time, Daniela seemed to be reasoning wvith herself or perhaps reassuring Lillian. "It shouldn't have been made public. That way, he'd have more options going forward. Back then, I acted without thinking.I assumed..."

Daniela left her thoughts hanging. She walked over to the refrigerator, grabbed a beer, and gulped it down in one swift motion.

Lillian, fuming with anger, pressed her. "What were you thinking?"

Daniela reached for another beer. "I thought he'd have no regrets. I didn't ponder it too deeply. Honestly, I always knew he was stubborn. He wouldn't being willing to remain in the dark forever. That's why i kept my marriage to Cedric to myself for so long."  upset Cedric, nor did she want him to go unrecognized and unacknowledged.

Yet,he still ended up getting hurt.

Lillian couldn't believe it. "Who do you think is really suffering in all this? Don't you ever think about yourself? If you get divorced and remarried, it would be your third marriage. Doesn't that embarrass you?"

Daniela laughed it off. "Is it really?"

It shouldn't happen again.

If things don't work out this time, she's determined not to marry again.

Daniela didn't say any of these thoughts aloud.Instead.she kept drinking with Lilian.

Lillian could usually handle her drink well,but even she couldn't keep up with Daniela.

As dawn was about to break, Lillian slumped over,having drunkenly passed out.

Daniela, still feeling uneasy, took a bottle and made her way to the rooftop.
Chapter 479 | Am Yours

Competing was never really Daniela's thing.

If Cedric indeed harbored other intentions..

Daniela's grip on the wine bottle grew unsteady,her hand shaking increasingly.

She decided to place it down.

Atop the rooftop, the wind howled fiercely as it rushed past her.

Daniela shut her eyes, focusing on the sounds and sensations around her.

As the wind pushed the rooftop door open with a squeak, Daniela spun around to see a silhouette outlined against the faint light.

She stood up, her eyes gleaming like luminous pearls in the darkness.

The figure slowly approached, getting closer.

The darkest moments come right before the break of dawn.

Clouded by medication and alcohol, Daniela's thoughts were foggy.

Yet she smiled,observing the familiar figure advancing towards her,step by step.

"Cedric."

The figure stood outlined in the light, creating a dark silhouette.

In a deep, echoing voice, he answered, "Yes, it's me."

Suddenly,the man lifted his hands.

The smile on Daniela's face froze,losing its warmth.

Confused and disoriented, she asked, "Is that you.
Cedric?"

She was about to raise her hand when a pair of large hands covered her eyes.

"Yes, I am." The voice was deep and identical to Cedric's.

Almost immediately,Daniela sensed his breath drawing nearer.

She stood still for a moment, before quickly taking two steps back.

However, her vision was still covered by those large hands.

The man asked, "What's wrong?"

Daniela felt his intense gaze fixed on her lips. In her confusion,he moved closer still. "I am Cedric. Will youpush me away?"

As his breath tickled her lips, Daniela's expression turned into a frown and she stepped back once more.

This time, Daniela brushed away the hands covering her eyes.

She was met with a face that mirrored Cedric's.

"What's the matter? Don't want me to kiss you?" the man asked, his eyes locked on her. His tone, carrying a trace of a smile, was just as familiar.

"Who are you?" Daniela asked, her voice steady and firm.

"Cedric." The man opposite her hesitated, then straightened up. "I am Cedric. Are you actually upset with me?"

This time, her retreat was much quicker.

She watched the man in front of her with careful attention.

Once more, she reminded herself that he looked strikingly similar to Cedric.

"You were with Joyce at the last banquet. Who are you,really?"
The man's smile turned sinister in the shadows. "I am Cedric, the man of your desires. Aren't you exhausted of the old Cedric? You believe he doesn't get you. You feel he forces you to say things you don't wish to.You see him as cold and indifferent. Daniela, I am the new Cedric. I will always submit to you and loyally remain at your side. I will become whoever you need me to be. Isn't that better?"

Daniela shook her head firmly. "No."

The man suddenly froze in place.

"I said, No," Daniela repeated. "I love Cedric, no matter his flaws. I don't care if he loves someone else.Whatever he chooses. I support him. His happiness matters more to me than my own."

In the darkness, the man's brows furrowed deeply."What about me? Don't you want me? Daniela, if you wish,I am yours!"

His voice held the seductive whisper of a lover.enchanting its spell in Daniela's ear.

Daniela shook her head and shut her eyes.

When she opened her eyes again, she saw that the rooftop was empty.

Only the lingering chill of the wind remained.

Daniela stood still,puzzled.

Suddenly, the rooftop door swung open, and Lillian stepped through, rubbing her eyes. "Daniela, why are you out here? Isn't it cold?"

Daniela asked, "Did you see anyone on your way un just now?"
Chapter 480 An Unexpected Twist
Lillian shook her head. "No. Who do you think made it up here?"

Daniela's gaze intensified against the biting wind as she responded, "The person who looks a lot like Cedric."

Lillian hesitated and then questioned, "Could you have been mistaken? There's only one way up to the rooftop. I didn't see anyone coming down."

Daniela gave no reply. Her eyes swept across the empty rooftop.

"Let's head back inside," Lillian suggested, noticing the biting cold. "It's too cold up here; we shouldn't risk catching a cold."

Daniela acknowledged with a slight nod.

They made their way to the elevator and descended back to the office.

Concerned, Lillian immediately called a doctor to examine Daniela.

When the doctor arrived, he was spotted by Linden.

With a furrowed brow, Linden confronted Lilian.annovance evident in his voice. "Why wasn't informed that Daniela is ill? I'm also a doctor, freshly certified at that. Don't you think I'm capable?"

Lillian presented the doctor's credentials, halting Lindenfor a moment.

Lillian nudged Linden aside. "Please,stay out of the way."

Frozen in place, Linden was awe-struck. The doctor treating Daniela was none other than Lee Hoffman,his long-admired idol.

Linden tried to follow, but Lillian halted him with a raised hand at the door.

His voice betrayed his hurt feelings. "Was everything you said about me being Daniela's family doctor just a lie?"

Lillian stood with her arms crossed, her face giving nothing away. Her expression was somber.

Linden looked at her, a mix of fear and confusion in his eyes. "Mustn't it be incredibly expensive to have Lee treat her?"

Lillian's response was emotionless. "There's no charge.Daniela and Lee are close friends."

Linden's eyes widened with astonishment. "She's truly remarkable!" His admiration was more heartfelt than ever before. He hesitated briefly before asking, "What exactly is troubling Daniela? What's the problem?"

He always thought of Daniela as strong.

She was active, running and exercising daily.seemingly the picture of health.

Linden posed his question with a casual smile.

However, Lillian was glaring at him with a look that could kill.

Scared, Linden asked. "What's the issue?"

Lillian averted her eyes. "Just a reminder-there are things you're meant to know and will learn in time.But prying into forbidden knowledge could prove catastrophic for you."

Linden let out a nervous chuckle. "Catastrophic? What are you suggesting, that you might kill me?"

His laughter became more forced as he spoke.

Moments later, the hallway fell into an unsettling silence.

Linden was confronted with Lillian's cold,menacing stare.

"Interested in testing your limits?" she asked.

Linden felt his heart miss a beat. He faltered before responding, "Test what exactly?"

'Facing death. That's what you seem to be inviting." Lillian said sharply, her usual hint of a smile completely absent.Fear clutched at Linden's chest.

At that instant, Linden realized Daniela and her group were not the easy marks like Elyse or Natalie, who could be easily manipulated. These were not individuals to trifle with.

Swiftly touching his nose, Linden made a quick exit from the corridor.

Meanwhile, inside the treatment room, Lee was attending to Daniela. "You've been well for so long.What went wrong today?"

With a rueful smile, Daniela replied, "Just an unexpected twist,nothing more."

Lee's brow furrowed. "You've been off your meds for a while now; such occurrences are unusual.Remember,medication has its side effects; it's detrimental over time. You musttake better care of yourself."

Daniela acknowledged with a nod. "I understand."

Lee continued, "You only took a little medication this time, but next time, don't let your emotions spiral.Otherwise, you might need continuous treatment,which would severely impact your health. You're aware of the risks, aren't you?"

Daniela nodded once more.

Outside the room, Lillian listened intently to  Lee's  advice, her expression darkening, shadowed like the night.
###Chapter 481 She Seems Unwell


The charity auction had just wrapped up, and Cedric escorted Lydia towards Elite Lux.

Lydia's red gown shimmered under the lights,drawing lingering gazes from passersby.

She glanced at Cedric, then arched a brow.

People often described this rebellious CEO as cold,ruthless, and an unapproachable man exuding a sharp, commanding presence. And he never showed interest in women.

Lydia had joined Phillips Group because of him.

At first, she thought getting close to Cedric would be impossible. She'd been strategizing ways to approach him when, out of nowhere, she received an invitation to the charity auction.

She had dressed to impress. But the entire night,Cedric had never once spared her a glance.  However, when Daniela appeared, a flicker of emotion had crossed Cedric's usually cold expression.

Now, Cedric's expression was unreadable. Was it worry or frustration? Maybe even irritation?

Lydia let out a soft chuckle. "Mr. Phillips, am I just a convenient distraction tonight?"

Cedric had grown up in an orphanage, hardened by a life that left little room for conscience.

Guilt was a foreign feeling except when it came to Daniela. To him, everyone else was insignificant.

He leaned back, exuding effortless arrogance, his tone as indifferent as ever. "If I recall,your contract states that when an opportunity for exposure arises,you're supposed to cooperate with the company's arrangements. So, there's no question of diversions.It's mutual benefit, nothing more."

Lydia was momentarily taken aback before a slow smile curved her lips. "You're brutally honest, Mr.Phillips," she murmured, shifting slightly, her silhouette illuminated by the car lights, a deliberate flirtation.

"Stop the car." Cedric's expression darkened.

Lydia froze for a moment.

The driver obeyed instantly, pulling over.

"Get out!" Cedric demanded.

Lydia stared at him. "We're on an overpass!"

Cedric's gaze was unyielding, his tone merciless. "I said,get ouut."

Without hesitation, the driver stepped out, opened the door, and said with the same cold detachment,"Miss Vargas, please step out."

Seething, Lydia stepped out. The moment her heels touched the pavement, the driver shut the door, slid back into the car, and stepped on the gas.

The sleek vehicle disappeared into the night.

Lydia clenched her teeth, frustrated. Stepping out in her high heels, she barely caught her balance as the wind tugged at her gown.
She spat at the retreating taillights. "Jerk!"

Inside the car, Cedric remained silent, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery while the diver concentrated on the road.

But his mind was elsewhere. He kept seeing Daniela's expression from earlier when she saw him and Lydia at the auction.

He was losing his damn mind.

How had he come up with such a stupid idea?

In the front passenger seat, his secretary, who had been holding back his frustration, finally snapped."Mr. Phillips, you crossed the line tonight. Forget how the press will spin this. Do you have any idea what this must've hurt your wife? She's always distant with outsiders, but with us at Phillips Group, kind and approachable. Do you know why? Because of you.She's been doing her best to comfort you, and this is how you repay her. Did you even see her face when she looked at you tonight? You've spoiled her so much and still did this to her? She left early tonight.She must have been devastated. If you keep this up,don't be surprised if she walks away from you for good."

The last sentence landed like a slap and Cedric's whole body tensed. "I wasn't thinking then."

The charity auction had been another tiresome and boring social event. CEOs often brought secretaries or companions. They didn't often bring their wives.

He just wanted to show his displeasure. He hadn't meant to use Lydia to provoke Daniela.

The secretary scoffed. "Typical. When men get what they want, they stop valuing it. You spent years fighting for her. Now look at you. You've turned into a complete asshole."

The secretary sided with Daniela.

The driver, silently gripping the wheel, hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Phillips, your wife didn't seem well tonight." Cedric's head snapped up, his sharp gaze locking onto the driver. "What did you just say?" His voice held an edge of urgency.

The driver swallowed. "I mean it. When you were inside, I stepped out for a smoke. When I came back,I saw your wife and Lillian leaving. Lillian bent down to ask if she was okay. Your wife stood by the door for a long time as if struggling to catch her breath.I ran to grab a bottle of water, but by the time I got back, they were already gone. Ryan was driving. He sped off."

Cedric's hand, resting on his knee, trembled.

-A suffocating silence filled the car.

His mind went blank.

His secretary looked at him and sighed, rubbing his temple. "You should talk to her. You know she's not unreasonable. It was just a charity auction. Explain yourself before this gets worse."

The secretary comforted him. The car slowed as they neared the Elite Lux.

The driver suddenly spoke. "Mr. Phillips, it's Lillian! It looks like she is seeing someone off."

Cedric shoved the door open. Across the street, a black car was pulling away. Lillian stood beside it,watching. At first, she smiled but as her eyes met Cedric's, the warmth drained from her expression.Her gaze turned cold.

The secretary and driver exchanged nervous glances.

This was bad!
###Chapter 482 Cedric Was Dangerous


Events unfolded just as the secretary and the driver had predicted.

When Cedric approached, Lillian locked the door to Elite Lux. She also posted a notice on the door.

Printed boldly on the paper that said, "Cedric Phillips is prohibited from entering!" Accompanying the text was a high-resolution image of Cedric, recently printed by Ryan.

Both the secretary and the driver were speechless.

Cedric was in a panic. "Lillian, is Daniela ill?"

Lillian crossed her arms, her gaze cold and firm."Cedric, stop avoiding the issue. Get ready for the divorce agreement."

Cedric was taken aback, feeling as if the earth had shifted under his feet. His secretary and driver were just as shocked.

"Hold on a moment. Isn't this going a bit far? A divorce? Really?"

This was absolutely ridiculouIS.

The word "divorce" made Cedric's entire body stiffen. He looked at Lillian intently, took a deep breath, and asked, "Is this divorce your idea, or Daniela's?"

Lillian's expression remained unreadable. "It doesn't matter who brought it up. The divorce is happening.Tomorrow, when the lawyers are back, you'll receive the divorce agreement. At the same time, we will cut all business relations with Phillips Group." She then turned to the security chief, whose confusion was clear. "Starting now, no one from Phillips Group is allowed to enter. We are cutting all ties with them."

Hearing this, Cedric's secretary became visibly distressed.

"No! This has all been a big misunderstanding!" The secretary was taken aback by the intense reactions
from those at Elite Lux.
It was all because Cedric had brought a celebrity to a minor charity event. How could it lead to the point of ending both business relations and a marriage?

"This is going too far!" the secretary exclaimed.

Meanwhile, Cedric appeared unconcerned about the business consequences. His focus remained entirely on Lillian as he continued to ask, "Is Daniela sick?"

Lillian stood firm, her expression unreadable. "Her condition does not concern you. We will handle it ourselves."

Cedric then looked towards Ryan.

Ryan's face was just as stern, and he remained silent for the time being.

"If there's more to discuss, wve can address it later.Right now, I need to know if Daniela is okay. Please,let me in. I admit, I was not thinking straight tonight.If you want to punish me, I accept that. But I'm really concerned about her. Just let me see her for a  moment. If she's alright,I'll leave right away. Can we agree on that?"

Cedric, who typically kept a composed and detached air, was visibly agitated. Tonight, however, he displayed an unusual humility.

Ryan glanced at Lillian, her expression as hard and unmovable as stone.

With a sigh, Ryan said, "You should leave. We'll take care of any issues. Daniela is already resting,and your presence would only disturb her."

Cedric's eyes widened in surprise. "Is she really unwell?"o

Those words triggered a strong wave of guilt in Cedric, clenching his heart tightly. In a soft voice,he pleaded with Ryan, "Please, let me in. I'll be quiet, I promise.Just a quick look. I won't leave until I'm sure she's okay."

Ryan realized that even if Cedric saw Daniela, he wouldn't be able to leave reassured. He glanced briefly at Lillian.

Without hesitation, Lillian grabbed a chair and shoved it against the door. "Fine. If you're determined to get in, you'll have to go over my dead body!"

Ryan understood then that Lillian was truly enraged.

Typically carefree, Lillian rarely took matters to heart,except when they crossed a critical line. And that line was Daniela's well-being.

From Lillian's perspective, Daniela's depression had been kept under control up until now. Despite Alexander's previous actions, Daniela had managed to stay calm.

However, Cedric had a unique impact on Daniela's emotional well-being.

This made Lillian realize Cedric was dangerous.

She was determined to remove his influence as soon as possible.
###Chapter 483 Losing Him Hurts More


Cedric was completely overwhelmed. He didn't dare to call Daniela, worried he might disturb her rest,leaving him confused and uncertain about his next steps.

"Ryan, I can stay here. Just tell me, what's wrong with her? I have the top doctors ready to help,"Cedric pleaded, his voice filled with urgency.

Before Ryan could answer, Lillian interjected,"There's no need for that. We've got a doctor already."

Cedric frowned. "You mean Linden? I don't trust him.I have the country's best doctors at my disposal.If you won't let me see her, at least allow my doctors to wait outside. Should Daniela feel ill again, couldn't they at least examine her?"

Linden, overhearing this from the side, felt a sting of insult. He was about to respond when Ryan gave him a stern look.

The look delivered a clear message. "We can judge our own, but outsiders shouldn't," his glare said.

Suppressing his response, Linden stepped back, his frustration clear.

Cedric had already contacted his medical team.When the doctors arrived, they positioned themselves at the entrance, but Lillian forbade them from entering.

The strange scene quickly drew the attention of bystanders and, before long, the press. By evening,a crowd had gathered outside Elite Lux.

Lillian fixed Cedric with a frosty gaze. "Aren't you content with the spectacle you've caused already?Cedric, continuing this way will only lead to disaster."

Seeing the swarm of eager reporters, Cedric sighed and retreated to his car.

But he didn't drive away. Instead, he instructed his driver to circle the block until the crowd thinned out.When the area was clear, he returned and parked near the now peaceful entrance.

Only the security guards remained.

Approaching one of the guards, Cedric's secretary said anxiously,"Dude, we mean no harm. Mr. Phillips is really concerned. We're not here to cause trouble.Can you tell us how Daniela is? Is she alright?"

The guard looked at Cedric, then back at the secretary, and nodded. "She was a bit unwell earlier,but it didn't look serious. The doctor checked her and Lillian seemed relieved when he left. So, I think it's nothing to worry about."

Cedric nodded in relief and stepped back.

He looked up, his eyes fixed on the dark windows of Daniela's room.

Pulling out an envelope with cash inside, he offered it to the security chief. "Look, no hard feelings. If anything changes tonight, please let me know. My doctors are ready to help." The security chief declined the envelope with a wave of his hand. "Mr. Phillips, I won't accept your gift. But rest assured, if anything happens, I'll let you know.You've always been good to our boss."

Cedric nodded and left the envelope there anyway.

The chief eyed the thick wad of cash inside the envelope with surprise.

Back in his car, Cedric was restless. His secretary and driver had left to get some food, leaving him alone.

He stared intensely towards Daniela's room.

Inside, he cursed himself over and over.

Daniela had always been fragile since childhood,and it had taken years to stabilize her health. If the stress of today made her condition worsen, he would never be able to forgive himself.

Cedric spent the entire night awake, restlessly sitting in his car, worried about missing any updates from the security guards. Meanwhile, Daniela experienced a deep, undisturbed sleep.

When she awoke, the room was bathed in daylight,sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting warm pools of light across the floor.

"Morning, Daniela," Lillian greeted her, entering with a glass of milk. "Feeling any better?"

Daniela nodded. "I'm feeling fine."

After heading for a shower, she returned to find her phone buzzing with notifications.

She unlocked it, only to be bombarded by a series of headlines.

"Cedric Phillips is spotted spending the night outside his wife's building."

"Cedric Phillips issues an apology."

"Daniela Harper seems to have everything."

"Is a distraught Cedric Phillips' marriage to Daniela Harper on the brink of collapse?"

And the list went on. Daniela blinked, unsure if she was seeing correctly.

"Marriage on the brink of collapse?"

She chuckled to herself, shaking her head. Turning around, she saw Lillian's stern, unamused face.

"Cedric's still downstairs?" Daniela asked.

Lillian nodded. "Yes."

Daniela exhaled. "Bring him up, please."

Lillian objected, "Daniela, you can't keephim in your life. He's just trouble. You haven't had a depressive episode in years, but last night you did. What if something even worse happens next time? What about us? What about Elite Lux?"

Daniela massaged her tense neck, offering a weak smile. "It's not as bad as you think."

"Not as bad?" Lillian's frustration grew. "How can you be so sure that if something like last night happens again, you'll be able to handle it?"

Daniela remained silent.

"I used to think Cedric was different from other men,rational and steady. But I was wrong. Love makes everyone lose their composure, you and him alike.Daniela, can you assure me that what happened last night with Cedric won't happen again? Humans are impulsive, emotional beings. We can't always keep our feelings in check. Bringing a celebrity to a gala might be normal in your circles, but it triggers you off. What can we learn from that? That shows how deeply you've fallen for Cedric. You might have thought of this relationship as a trial, easy to end if it didn't work out. But now, you have expectations.You're fooling yourself if you think otherwise.Lee mentioned yesterday that you need to keep your emotions in check. Another episode could be disastrous. You should distance yourself from Cedric."

Daniela stayed quiet for a while. Eventually, she murmured, "But what if losing him hurts more than the episodes?"
###Chapter 484 Cedric Suddenly Fled


Lillian remained quiet, and a heavy silence filled the room.

"Daniela..." Lillian eventually broke the silence, her voice low. "Do you really think Cedric would be happy living like this?"

Daniela looked up sharply.

Lillian's face remained unreadable, but inside, a storm of conflict raged, pushing her to speak her mind.	()

The evening before, as Lee was leaving,he had warned her, "You have to ask Daniela to divorce Cedric, or things will escalate. This is only the start."
The notion that a man's love could eternally remain strong was a fantasy; lasting love was just a fairytale.

This episode with Cedric had clearly demonstrated this. Lillian searched for a retort but came up empty.Under Lee's mysterious gaze, she reluctantly nodded in agreement.
Lillian saw Daniela's hands begin to tremble. She felt a pang of sorrow, yet her determination hardened.

"Daniela, you're a perfectionist, and so is Cedric.He's always hoped for complete honesty from you,but your resistance is only pushing him away.Why prolong the suffering? If you end things now, at least some fondness can remain."

Lillian observed the hurt flickering in Daniela's eyes.
Finding it too difficult to continue, Lillian took out the divorce agreement she had prepared beforehand.

"Daniela, consider my words carefully. Cedric has been waiting downstairs all evening, and people are starting to whisper. I'll go bring him up."

With those words, Lillian exited, the door closing with a click.

Daniela's eyes settled on the divorce agreement, the  words stabbing at her heart.

Her heart felt squeezed, leaving her gasping for air.

Lillian's words echoed in her mind.

"Have you considered what Cedric truly desires? Are you able to provide the life he seeks?"

Daniela remained seated, enveloped in silence, for a long time.

Cedric burst through the door, finding Daniela at her desk in the CEO's office.

The sky outside was turning a foreboding gray, with dense clouds hanging low, signaling an imminent storm.

As Cedric's eyes settled on Daniela, the room's vast windows cast long shadows that seemed to surround her.

A chill of apprehension washed over Cedric.
A sudden, unexplainable fear clawed at him, rooting him in place and making him hesitate before stepping deeper into the room.

It was as if he stood on the edge of a revelation he wasn't ready to face.

Despite his reluctance, he advanced into the room,his footsteps quick and his anxiety mounting.

"Are you alright, dear?"

Typically, Daniela would be lounging on the sofa,easily within reach for a warm embrace as soon as he entered.

Today, however, Daniela was positioned formally behind her desk, her demeanor cool and detached.

Her hands were neatly clasped on the surface,partially concealing a document underneath.

Her hands partially covered the paper, but Cedric could still make out a single word "Agreement."

"Are you feeling ill?" Cedric asked, his concern laced with urgency. Dark circles under his eyes showed his fatigue. "I have brought a team of doctors." With a mild laugh, Daniela motioned to the chair opposite her. "Please,sit."

Her request, though simple, heightened Cedric's anxiety.

He complied, sitting down and fixing his gaze on Daniela.

"What's bothering you?" he asked again.

Daniela gave a slight shake of her head, her tone gentle. "It's just a minor cold. I took some medicine last night; it's really nothing to worry about."

Yet Cedric was not convinced. "You had a doctor's visit yesterday evening. Was it because of your de...?"

"Actually, no," Daniela said quickly, a bit dismissively."Lillian was being overly cautious. She assumed I was having a depressive episode, which wasn't the case.A good night's rest was all I needed. See? I'm perfectly fine now, aren'tl?"

Cedric observed Daniela carefully, his doubts lingering.

Daniela then asked, "You seemed rushed to meet me. What's on your mind?"

Cedric gave a quick nod, but his words stalled as he opened his mouth to speak.

Daniela's demneanor was cool, her eyes unengaging.

The warmth he intended to convey seemed to evaporate in the chill of her presence.

Daniela offered a slight smile. "My schedule is packed today. I have a meeting shortly and a client to host for lunch. Unless it's urgent, I should get ready.Feel free to stay or return to Phillips Group."

Cedric remained motionless. After a tense silence, he shifted his gaze from Daniela's controlled expression to the document beneath her fingers.

Daniela caught on to where his gaze had settled. She flàshed another smile, her fingers shifting ever so slightly.

Before she could speak, Cedric stood abruptly."| need to get back to work. Look after yourself."

Daniela gave no reply. She kept her composed posture, lifting her eyes to meet Cedric's. Their gazes locked for a fleeting moment.

Then, suddenly, Cedric suddenly fled.

Daniela watched him leave, still without moving.Only when he had vanished down the hallway and the elevator doors had shut did she allow herself to sink into her chair, visibly exhausted.

In the car, Cedric's secretary looked over at him,perplexed.

"Mr. Phillips, weren't you supposed to clarify things?Why did you leave without saying anything? What if Daniela takes it the wrong way? If this misunderstanding escalates because you left so abruptly, what will you do?"
###Chapter 485 Breaking News


Cedric didn't respond to the question.

He stared out the window at the scenery rushing past, his mind looping back to the document placed under Daniela's hand.

It was a divorce agreement.

In the Elite Lux office, Lillian couldn't wrap her head around it. "Daniela, why didn't you bring up the divorce?"

Daniela clenched her fist. "I didn't have to say it out loud.He already knew what I meant."

Lillian still didn't understand.

Daniela turned to the vast skyline beyond the floor-to-ceiling window. "One day, when you truly love someone,you'll get it."

The bond that once felt unbreakable could become the sharpest blade, cutting deeper than any wound.

A single conversation could tear two people apart.

Daniela fell silent, lost in thought.

Maybe Lillian was right. Cedric had so many paths ahead of him. Maybe walking away from her would lead him to something better-something happier.

And her own heartbreak? That didn't matter as much.

Daniela carried on with her days-work,meals, sleep.She slowly distanced herself from Cedric, her warmth fading into a surface-level politeness.

She could feel Cedric's unease.

She could feel him pulling away.

But she, unwavering and relentless, kept pushing forward, leaving him with nowhere left to retreat.

Cedric was truly afraid.
 
He chose the farthest business trip he could find and put as much distance between them as possible.

Lillian had seen firsthand just how ruthless Daniela could be, and it unsettled her.

"Daniela, Natalie approached Doug at that auction the other day, but Joyce is keeping a close watch.Natalie hasn't gotten a chance to make a move yet."

Daniela's expression remained unreadable, her presence as cold and unyielding as ice. "If there's no opportunity, then make one. Host a gala under Elite Lux's name and ensure Doug is on the guest list."

Elite Lux's galas were the crown jewel of Olisvine's social scene.
C)
Lavish venues.

Exquisite champagne.

Relentless media attention.

Natalie wasted no time turning to Daniela for help.Daniela smirked and flicked the invitation card in her hand onto the floor without a second thought.
Natalie immediately bent down to retrieve it. Linden stood nearby, his glare sharp with disgust as he spat, "Bitch."

Natalie remained unfazed.

If latching onto Doug meant enduring scorn, so be it.

She was willing to do whatever it took.

After all, who was Linden to her? Just one of Daniela's lackeys.

Natalie left Elite Lux, invitation in hand, and ran into Nina.

Natalie said, "Daniela seems off lately. Any idea why?Did she and Cedric actually fall out?"

Natalie was plotting something. If Daniela and Cedric were truly over, then between Cedric and Doug,she'd much rather choose Cedric.

Nina leaned against the elevator wall, her expression unreadable. "Daniela and Cedric are fine. Stop overanalyzing."

Natalie let out a sharp laugh. "Fine? You're awfully protective of their marriage. Funny, considering you used to be so in love with Cedric yourself."

She casually adjusted her hair,her tone dripping with confidence. "Nina, no matter what, you're a Dury.Daniela's your cousin, and I'm your sister. No matter what happens, you're obligated to help me. Got it?The Dury family's future depends on me winning this."

Nina flicked her gaze towards Natalie, unimpressed.

Natalie pulled an invitation card from her pocket and dangled it between her fingers. "Don't say I never do anything for you. Here, I got you an invite from Daniela. It's your chance to rub elbows with some wealthy heirs."

Nina eyed the card suspiciously. "Since when are you this generous?"

Natalie's lips curled into a sly smirk. "Oh, I'll be needing a favor in return. Doug will be at the gala tonight. I just need you to keep Joyce busy for half an hour. That's all the time I need to make him fall for me." Nina shot her a look of pure disdain. "Didn't you always claim you'd save yourself for the one you truly love? And wasn't that Cedric? Now, suddenly, you're interested in Doug? That short,fat man?"

Natalie scoffed, "What would you know? Cedric's an idiot-he only has eyes for Daniela. So why should I waste my/ time? I deserve better. What, you think l should settle for Linden? That useless, hideous nobody? Just make sure Joyce stays out of my way tonight."

Natalie started to walk away, but after a few steps,she stopped and turned back. Her gaze locked onto Nina's. "Don't breathe a word of this to Daniela.She and Joyce are on the same side, but you and l? We're family. Don't forget that."

With that, she stepped into her car. Just before the door shut, she threw out one last promise."When I pull this off, I'll make sure you get your cut of the rewards."

Then the car roared to life and sped away.
Nina narrowed her eyes and let out a sharp, icy laugh.

She slipped the invitation into her pocket, not even considering telling Daniela.

This whole thing was too disgraceful to bother mentioning.

If Natalie wanted to go head-to-head with Joyce, let her.

The timing couldn't be better. Nina had been itching for some real entertainment.

Standing at the grand entrance of Elite Lux, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through her contacts yntil she found the number she wanted.Then, with a smirk, she pressed call.

"Hey, I've got something juicy for you tonight.Interested?"

"What's it about?"

Nina's lips curled as she lowered her voice to a near whisper. "A scandal you won't want to miss."
###Chapter 486 Are You Attracted To Him
Daniela attended Elite Lux's gala, dressed simply in a white T-shirt and jeans, yet she captured everyone's attention.

"Wow, Daniela's figure is just flawless."

"Those jeans really accentuate her shape. She's absolutely divine!"

"Right? Are those jeans Elite Lux's newest release?|need a pair!"

"Keep dreaming! That outfit was tailored specifically for Daniela by Elite Lux. Do you really think you can match that? Even if you managed to get one,could you wear it like she does? Those clothes could only be truly brought to life by Daniela."

"With her figure, Daniela would look incredible even in a burlap bag." The crowd murmured in agreement.

Amidst the waves of admiration, Daniela approached the stage to give her speech.

Her eyes scanned the audience, briefly stopping when she saw Doug with Joyce at his side. A few steps behind them was Natalie. A subtle smile played on Daniela's lips.

"Enough talk! Enjoy the evening, everyone!" With those words, Daniela stepped down from the stage.

As she moved away, the smile slowly left her face.

She sat down, radiating an air that unmistakably warned off any strangers. A few corporate executives who had planned to approach her with a toast quickly thought better of it and backed off,intimidated by her commanding presence.

One of them pulled Lillian aside and asked, "Has Ms.Harper seemed upset recently?"

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"Definitely! At the auction last night, Ms. Harper  bought everything. Lillian, what's going on with her?"

Lillian offered a slight smile. "Nothing major. She's just been busy."

Daniela wasn't interested in socializing. Instead, she sipped her drink, her gaze subtly following Natalie,who was doing everything she could to get closer to Doug.

Meanwhile, Joyce kept a close watch, making sure Natalie had no opportunity to get any closer.

Nina attempted several times to distract Joyce, but Joyce consistently declined.

Eventually, Nina, running out of strategies, gave
Daniela a desperate look from across the room.

Daniela picked up her glass, poured herself another drink, and headed straight over.

Joyce, unaware of Daniela behind her, sensed a strong gaze on her.

Turning around, she saw Daniela approaching with a wine glass in hand. Instinctively, Joyce stepped back, but Daniela continued moving forward, step by step.

Doug sensed the tension and asked Joyce, "What's going on?"

Before Joyce could reply, Daniela poured her wine over Joyce's head.

"Daniela, have you lost your mind?" Joyce gasped.

The entire room went quiet.

Nina's mouth fell open, and she silently cheered,"That was epic!"

Natalie blinked, a cunning smile curling the edges of her mouth.

Doug remained frozen, his eyes locked on the captivating woman as Daniela effortlessly walked past him.

He inhaled deeply, his eyes shone with admiration as he watched Daniela.

"Daniela, what's the reason for this? I haven't done anything to upset you tonight." Joyce, now splattered with red wine, looked at her ruined white gown.

"Oops! My bad. It was an accident."

"Accident? What accident ends up pouring wine all over someone's head?" Joyce didn't buy it.

"Nina, could you please escort our guest to get changed?" Daniela asked.

Joyce was about to make more comments about the cost of her dress when Daniela added, "Let's offer her Elite Lux's latest masterpiece, 'Rose Rendezvous."

Her suggestion caused a stir among the attendees.

The "Rose Rendezvous" gown was legendary, valued at over fifty million dollars. Even global A-list celebrities have been denied requests to wear it for their appearances.

And now, Daniela was offering it to Joyce.

"Ms. Harper, could you please tell me what I need to do to get you to 'accidentally' spill wine on me? I'd love to wear an Elite Lux dress too."

The crowd was green with envy.

All eyes were on Joyce, a mix of admiration and jealousy in their gazes.

As she was escorted upstairs to change, Joyce felt a surge of pride welling up inside her.

Doug, wine glass in hand, gave Daniela a warm smile.His round face and closely set features made Daniela question how Natalie could possibly be interested in him.

The idea seemed so ridiculous it was almost painful to consider.

Doug eagerly lifted his glass to propose a toast to Daniela, who offered only a slight smile before turning to leave.

Doug paused, momentarily stunned.

He had assumed Daniela had intentionally sent Joyce away to speak privately with him. Perhaps she was interested in him?

But why did she simply walk away?
Doug's gaze lingered on Daniela as she walked away,his eyes reflecting a sense of unmet expectation. HHe scolded Joyce in his mnind for handling the situation so poorly.When would Alexander finally intervene?

Doug was eager to have a night with Daniela.

As he was lost in his thoughts, a strong scent of perfume suddenly surrounded him.

Doug frowned, ready to scold whoever was disturbing his thoughts. But as he turned, he froze,surprised to see Natalie, who somehow looked like Daniela, approaching.
###Chapter 487 Get Lost


Doug's eyes roamed over Natalie, his look turning unpleasantly suggestive.

Natalie introduced herself with a smile. "Good evening, Mr. Fairburne. I serve as the chief secretary at Elite Lux. My name is Natalie Dury."

A smirk crept onto Doug's face as he licked his lips."Really?" Interest sparkled in his eyes. "You're with Elite Lux? Impressive, especially for someone as young as you to be in such a senior role."

Natalie's smile remained, cool yet distant.

Doug's fascination grew.

"Mr. Fairburne, perhaps we could have a discussion in private?" Natalie decided to be straightforward in her approach.

Doug's laughter was tinged with cunning."Absolutely! I couldn't possibly decline an offer from such a lovely lady."

Dressed in a light, flowing gown, Natalie moved elegantly, throwing a tempting look over her shoulder.

Doug was thoroughly charmed.

They made their way to a secluded pavilion.

No sooner had they arrived than Doug tried to draw her close, wrapping his arm around her waist and leaning in for a kiss. Natalie deftly blocked him with her handbag.

"Mr. Fairburne, I was hoping for a genuine conversation. Why the rush to get physical?" she asked.

Seeing Natalie's playful defiance only fueled Doug's desire even more.

He drew closer, his breath on Natalie's neck.

"You smell wonderful. What did you want to discuss?We can talk just like this." In the dim garden light, Natalie moaned and held Doug's head, their gaze locked.

Upstairs, Daniela stood on the balcony with a wine glass in hand, her expression detached as she observed the scene below with a disdainful eye.

"Nina, Joyce has changed her outfit," Nina said.

"Very well, bring her down," Daniela instructed calmly.

Nina looked where Daniela was staring, noticing Doug's hand slipping inside Natalie's dress.

"Daniela, don't you think it's a bit early to send Joyce down?" Nina asked, hesitating. "Should we delay Joyce until they're finished?"

Daniela shook her head. "People always want what they can't have. Since Natalie is maintaining her distant demeanor, let's use that. Doug can look but not touch, heightening the tension for what comes next."

Nina understood and nodded. Then, Daniela added, "Have your media friend take pictures, but hold off on releasing them."

Nina turned to look at Daniela with a start. She had not revealed to Daniela her plans to involve the media to tarnish Natalie's image.

"Daniela, while it's wise not to show mercy to our enemies, we must also prevent them from striking back. Natalie isn't out of moves yet. Why rush?"Daniela warned.

Nina remained quiet for a moment. "Do you mean Linden?" she finally asked. Linden had long harbored feelings for Natalie. If Natalie chose to get rid of Linden after securing Doug, Linden might well turn violent.

If that were to happen, they wouldn't need to lift a finger. Others would be eager to remove Natalie from the equation.

Whether through Linden or Joyce, their strategy would be merciless and calculated.

Nina came to the harsh realization that her approach had been far too naive.

She found herself drawn to Daniela's sharp intellect and undeniable cunning.

Nina led Joyce, dressed in Elite Lux's finest, from the room.

Noticing Doug was missing, Joyce narrowed her eyes and demanded, "Where is my husband?"

Nina gestured towards the dimly lit pavilion.

The muffled sounds of Doug and Natalie breathing heavily echoed from the secluded spot.

With a stern expression, Joyce approached.

She found Natalie and Doug intimately entwined,sharing a kiss.

"Natalie! You brazen woman! How dare you seduce my husband!" Joyce exploded, startling Natalie into stumbling out of Doug's arms.

Doug, annoyed by the interruption, stood and straightened his attire. As he helped Natalie to herfeet, he told Joyce, "What are you upset about?We've both had our affairs for some time. I've never meddled in your fling with Alexander!"

Joyce clenched her jaw tightly. Doug had many women outside their marriage, but she was never bothered, knowing none of those women held a candle to her.

But Natalie wasn't like the others. She carried ambition with her, setting her sights on becoming Doug's wife.

Both women could easily discern the other's motives.

Casual flings were tolerable, but a direct threat to her status as Doug's wife was not, only over her dead body.

A look of fierce resolve swept over Joyce's features.

She approached Doug and kissed him in Natalie's presence.

Despite the scene, Doug's passion remained undiminished. He embraced Joyce, his breath ragged.

In a hushed tone, Joyce murmured into Doug's ear,"Ask Natalie to leave! She's related to Daniela.Daniela won't approve, and it could complicate your relations with her."

Doug momentarily froze, his actions halting. His gaze, still lustful, met Joyce's eyes.

Joyce added, "Hold off. Alexander is working on something bigger. Why settle for less when the genuine article is within reach? Natalie can't compare to Daniela,can she?"

After a brief pause, Doug resumed holding Joyce tightly, their kiss resuming with renewed enthusiasm in the pavilion.

Natalie's cheeks burned with both shame and fury,feeling completely degraded.

Joyce glanced over, her smile smug as she caught Natalie's eye. Breathlessly, she mocked, "Still here? Planning to watch us all evening?"

With a teasing smirk, Joyce turned back to Doug.He shot a glare at Natalie before snapping sharply, "Get lost!"
###Chapter 488 Are You Close To This Man Named Alexander
Linden lurked in a shadowy corner, silently observing the unfolding scene.

His expression grew stormy, his brows knitting together in a scowl.

Daniela, having watched the spectacle, descended the stairs with a sense of boredom. As the event's host,she was bound to stay till the end.

She wandered to a secluded part of the courtyard and settled on a bench in an empty arcade.

Casually sipping her drink, she barely noticed a pair of shoes stop in front of her.

Without raising her eyes, Daniela spoke with a chill in her voice. "I'm otherwise engaged this evening.Please,enjoy the wine inside."

Her words hung in the air, but the shoes remained Daniela, uninterested, stood up to leave.

"Seem a bit gloomy?" A deep, familiar voice cut through the quiet, causing Daniela to snap her head up in surprise.

"Oh, it's you." Daniela narrowed her eyes at the figure.

Alexander couldn't understand.

He had undergone surgery to become Cedric's mirror image. Everyone who laid eyes on himn insisted he was Cedric, and even Joyce often struggled to tell the difference.

And yet, no matter how perfect the resemblance,Daniela always saw through him in an instant.

Despite his confusion, Alexander offered a smile."Yes, it's me. You seem troubled?" He adopted Cedric's characteristic tone, easing down beside her on the bench. "How about a conversation? We could be like two strangers sharing their burdens.Your  secrets are safe with me."

His features mirrored Cedric's so closely, it was almost uncanny.

Even his smallest habits, the cadence of his speech,and the way he smiled were an exact match.

His eyes gleamed intensely, looking at her, causing Daniela a moment of confusion.

For a fleeting moment, Alexander felt a profound sense of fulfillment.

This feeling reassured him that his suffering had not been in vain.

He dreamed of capturing Daniela's unguarded smiles once more, just as in the days before they divorced.

Such glimpses bolstered his hope that his struggles would one day be rewarded.

Tears gathered in Alexander's eyes as emotion surged within him.

He yearned to rewind time, to when Daniela's love was still his.

At any cost, he was prepared to reclaim those lost moments.

He anticipated a future where he could earnestly express his regrets to Daniela, telling her, "I'm sorry Daniela."

He also longed to say, "I have waited for your return all this while."

He imagined that, eventually, Daniela would respond with an affectionate embrace and a passionate kiss.

"Can we talk about anything?" Daniela asked, her tone neutral.

Surprised, Alexander responded with enthusiasm,"Absolutely! We can talk about anything you wish."

Daniela's expression remained cool as she scrutinized the man posing as "Cedric" before her."Then explain how you became like this, Alexander."

Alexander's face registered shock. "That's not true!You're mistaken." He had borne many hardships to adopt this persona,hoping it would endear him to Daniela. But just as he was about to claim his reward, Daniela had already seen through his act.

Still, a part of him was thrilled.

It excited him that Daniela alone, in a world where no one else noticed, could penetrate his disguise and glimpse his true essence.

Could this mean there was still a place for him in Daniela's heart?

With sincere hope, Alexander looked at Daniela, his feelings a whirlwind.

It had been ages since someone had addressed him by his real name.

Joyce now referred to him as Cedric.

To the entire world, he was Cedric, enduring the agony of living behind an elaborate facade, morphing into someone else.

In his mind, Alexander rehearsed a sorrowful  narrative.

Observing the subtle shifts in his expressions,Daniela's lips twisted into a sardonic smile.

"Are you not Alexander?" Daniela asked, her tone detached. "Perhaps I am wrong. Why do you seem so unsettled? You said we could discuss anything,didn't you? What's troubling you? Are you scared?"

Alexander felt a knot in his stomach. "Scared? Why would I be scared? I've just naturally looked this way,though some comment that I bear a resemblance to Cedric Phillips. Alexander, you say? Do I truly resemble him?"

-Alexander's eyes remained fixed on Daniela. With caution, he asked, "Did you know someone named Alexander well?"

Daniela's laughter rang out, clear and uncomplicated.She regarded him curiously, her head tilted. "You're quite funny."

Alexander, though inwardly pleased, kept his composure, mimicking Cedric's typical demeanor. At that moment, even he sensed a dissonance within himself.

The guise had become so ingrained that he struggled to remember who he was originally.

"Is that so?" Alexander responded, watching the side of Daniela's face glow, feeling a warmth spread through his chest.

Internally, a voice urged him to draw nearer to Daniela, to bridge the gap between them desperately.

He held his breath, striving to quell the turmoil within,as he subtly moved closer to Daniela, inch by inch.
###Chapter 489 Replacing Cedric


Daniela managed a strained smile.

As Alexander moved closer, she abruptly stood,leaving him reaching out to empty space. His expression turned to confusion.

"I'm leaving," Daniela declared.

In a panic, Alexander stood and grasped her hand.

She pulled away, prompting Alexander to ask her anxiously, "Daniela, when will I see you again? Have you considered my previous proposal? It still stands."

Afraid she might have forgotten about it, Alexander quickly added, "Remember, if you ever grow weary of Cedric, you can turn to me. You're drawn to his appearance, aren't you? Come to me instead. I'm his mirror image, and I ask for nothing more than to be with you. I can become whoever you desire, Daniela.In my world, you are the only one, and that will never change." Daniela looked at his face, so similar to Cedric's,yet felt only detachment. "Is that so? I'll give it some thought."

Alexander's face brightened immediately. "How long will you need to consider it?" His eagerness to reclaim her affection was noticeable.

He resolved not to repeat past mistakes.

The moment she consented, he planned to win her over completely.

He was determined to end Cedric's life for good.

Then, he would be the sole Cedric in existence.

As Daniela left, Alexander's gaze hardened with resolve. He silently vowed to win her back,regardless of the sacrifices required.

That evening, after satisfying Doug in bed, Joyce headed straight to Alexander's.

"What's the matter?" Joyce noticed how absent-minded Alexander was. "You met Daniela, didn't you?Getting obsessed with her? Remember your commitment to me, Alexander. I invested heavily to turn you into Cedric. Remember, Daniela will be Doug's."

Alexander flung back the covers and left the bed. He moved to the floor-to-ceiling window and lit a cigarette.

Joyce eyed Alexander's well-defined back,impressed yet again by the surgeons' craftsmanship.Every glance at his face stirred something within her.

She moved closer, pressing against him once more,craving more.

But Alexander quickly brushed her hand off his chest with a chill detachment.

Joyce's expression darkened with irritation. "What's this about, Alexander? Don't think a brief chat with Daniela means you can take Cedric's place in her heart!"

"Joyce, are you content to live forever overshadowed by Daniela?" Alexander asked, his gaze cold and his tone devoid of emotion. Taken aback, Joyce paused. She straightened,eyeing Alexander with a calculating gaze as her initial desire weakened. "What are you implying?"

"Are you truly content with living in her shadow forever?" "Do you really want to depend on Doug for your status your entire life? Natalie wants Doug, or more accurately, his wealth and the title of his wife.How long do you think he will remain faithful to you?"

Joyce scoffed dismissively, "Natalie? She's naive!She doesn't know Doug is difficult to handle at all!"

Alexander remained silent, his demeanor cold and detached, his eyes as piercing as Cedric's.

Joyce narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "What's your angle in saying all this?"

Alexander responded calmly, "You are Doug's wife now. Should anything happen to him, you'd inherit everything. That's when you'll truly be independent."

Joyce stared at Alexander, stunned. "You want me to kill Doug?" "There's no need for you to get involved. I'll take care of it," Alexander assured, his plan forming the moment he observed Natalie with Doug earlier.Doug's sex addiction was his weakness. If he died while having sex with Natalie, nobody would doubt it.

"Are you going to do it?" Joyce knew Alexander's self-centered, cold nature well after years together.He was offering to eliminate Doug for her?

"What's your price?" Joyce asked sharply.

"I want Daniela."

Silence enveloped the room after Alexander's declaration.

Joyce then erupted into uncontrolled laughter, so intense that she doubled over in pain, eventually collapsing to the floor as she clutched her stomach.

Alexander observed her, remaining composed.

Finally, winded from her fit of laughter, Joyce settled cross-legged on the floor, her voice oozing sarcasm."Alexander, you're quite the comedian. Remember how Daniela chased you, and you pushed her away?Now you're ready to commit murder for her after she's been with Cedric this long? Isn't that just ridiculous? Tell me, Alexander, since when did you become so obsessive? Knowing Daniela and Cedric have been intimate, how does that not eat at you?"

Joyce's words visibly unsettled Alexander, his facade beginning to crumble, his expression contorting.

"You don't get it! This is about love! Love makes you overlook the past," Alexander said, anger rising in his voice.

Joyce saw through his facade. "Alright, you eliminate Doug for me, and .I'll manage Daniela and Cedric on your behalf. You aim to be the sole Cedric, correct?I'll help you, but there's something you need to know first..."

Joyce paused, running a finger along Alexander's changed face. "Cedric must live. I want him."

Tired of the counterfeit, she wanted the real deal. "In my basement, I'll chain Cedric up," Joyce
declared, her eyes flashing with a wild passion. "I'm eager for that day."

Joyce grabbed her bag and stopped at the door."Alexander, don't get too ahead of yourself. Winning Daniela's heart won't be simple."

Alexander's gaze hardened. "That's not your concern. Just make sure Cedric is taken care of, and I'll make sure I'm the only Cedric to Daniela."
###Chapter 490 Divorce Agreement


Lately, Daniela hadn't been sleeping well, and her distress was evident on her face.

Nina leaned in to whisper to Lillian, "Do you know when Cedric is due back? Daniela can't go on like this."

Watching Daniela, who was absorbed in her phone,Lillian responded, "Old habits die hard."

Nina was left puzzled by her remark.

On the day Cedric was due back from his trip,Daniela went to the airport to meet him.

The separation had been too much for her to bear.

As she waited at the terminal, the sight of Cedric filled her eyes with tears.

Silence filled the car on the drive back.
"I have to swing by the office first." Cedric finally broke the silence.

Confused, his secretary glanced at Cedric. "Mr.Phillips, there's no rush at the office today. It's been a while since you've been home. Wouldn't it be better to start there and deal with work tomorrow?"

Clenching his knees, Cedric replied tersely, "There's an urgent meeting I must attend."

The secretary opened his mouth to object but the tense air in the car stopped him.

Just then, Daniela's phone vibrated.

It was a text from Russell. "Daniela, there's a big new assignment."

Disinterested, Daniela was about to ignore it when another alert popped up.

"Someone's willing to pay big to have Cedric kidnapped. And this time, it's no small sum-a staggering five hundred million."

Daniela's fingers flew across her phone keyboard."Who's the client?" The mission was to abduct Cedric and take him to a specified location.

Russell responded, "Anonymous. It wasn't routed through HQ but a subsidiary. Alita wants to know if we should accept."

"Proceed," Daniela responded.

"Easy two hundred million for us. And Cedric's drawing a huge bounty, five hundred million just to snatch him, no murder. Seems someone's really fixated on him."

Russell found humor in the situation, but Daniela was far from amused.

The thought of Cedric with someone else was unimaginable to her.

Noticing Daniela's frequent messaging, the secretary gave Cedric a look, silently asking whether she would accompany them to the office or head home.

Cedric pressed his lips together, showing a rare sight of timidity the secretary had never seen before. Cedric didn't particularly wish to avoid going home;his greater fear was that Daniela might confront him with a divorce agreement, a scenario he felt unprepared to face.

At the airport, his first impulse was to flee upon seeing Daniela, yet he couldn't stand the thought of leaving.

When Daniela glanced his way, Cedric tentatively suggested, "Maybe we should head home first?"

Putting away her phone, Daniela replied, "Weren't you supposed to return to your office? I'mn free now;I could join you."

Cedric's face betrayed a tumult of emotions.

Daniela asked, "Is there a problem? Shouldn't I come along?"

"Yes, of course, you should come," Cedric quickly responded, his voice eager. "I'd be glad for your company."

Silence fell as Daniela returned her attention to her phone.

Upon their arrival at Phillips Group, Daniela stepped out briskly, with Cedric a few paces behind. To an onlooker, Daniela might have appeared to be the CEO.

She paused, waiting for Cedric, who seemed reluctant to close the distance, making it feel as if she were leading a tour of the workplace.

Once they entered his office, Cedric promptly locked the door.

Outside, his secretary rubbed his sore nose, the slight bump still lingering, and let out a quiet chuckle.

It looked like the tension between them had finally eased, and they were back on better terms.

The recent days had drained him; Cedric had been overworking himself, and the secretary had not slept in 48 hours.

Inside the office, Cedric brewed a cup of coffee for Daniela before sitting down across from her. The skies outside mirrored the mood indoors, heavy and somber.

Cedric was grappling with feelings of injustice and the fear of losing Daniela.

"Wasn't there supposed to be a meeting?" Daniela asked.

" actually wanted to talk," Cedric replied. Evading the issue any longer was futile, especially since Daniela appeared prepared to address it, leaving no room for further avoidance.

Attempting to assume his typical negotiating posture, Cedric found himself unsettled by just one look at Daniela's expression.

"| need to be honest about that night at the charity gala. I did it on purpose. I apologize, Daniela," he said candidly.

Daniela acknowledged his admission with a nod,taking a sip of her coffee."Okay."

"It wasn't my intention to cause you embarrassment. I was just feeling overwhelmed and unfortunately chose the most destructive way to provoke a reaction from you. We were both unhappy. I assure you, no matter what the future holds, I won't repeat such an action," Cedric expressed earnestly, his voice full of regret. "I really missed you during my business trip, but I was too scared to reach out. Josie mentioned you've been having trouble sleeping.guess it was my absence."

"You're right, it was because you were gone," Daniela said straightforwardly.

Her confirmation comforted Cedric, yet he restrained any burgeoning hope.

He even pondered if Daniela valued him merely for the solace he provided.

Such solace was easily replaceable. Daniela,with her charm, could easily attract countless admirers far and wide.

He felt his offerings were light in comparison.

"The day I came to your office, I saw a document on your desk. What was it about?" Cedric paused for a few seconds before finally asking, "I caught the word 'agreement,' but I didn't see the rest. What was it?"

After a tense pause, Daniela responded, "It's a divorce agreement."
###Chapter 491 Let's Have A Baby


Daniela was coming on a little too direct.

A wave of unease tightened Cedric's chest, making it hard to breathe.

He fought to keep his composure, glancing away to avoid locking eyes with her. "You want to divorce me?"

Daniela gave a small nod.

Before she could utter a word, Cedric shot to his -feet,his emotions slipping out of control.

Daniela froze for a moment before hearing Cedric's firm declaration. "I don't agree!"

His face darkened, his eyes cooled, but beneath it all lingered a trace of hesitation.

Everything felt tangled and messy.
Cedric held her gaze, waiting-hoping-she would say something more.

Instead, all she offered was a short, "Got it."

Cedric remained still, waiting.
He braced himself, ready to counter any reason
Daniela threw at him for wanting a divorce.

If she insisted...

Cedric sat in silence, racking his brain for something -anything-he could use as leverage.

After all, merely being a source of comfort wasn't much of a bargaining chip.

He couldn't exactly say, "If you go through with this divorce, I won't let you sleep with me anymore,"could he?

And what if Daniela, cold as ever, agreed without a second thought? He'd just be humiliating himself.

Cedric realized his biggest disadvantage-he and Daniela had no child.

If they had, at least he'd say, "If you leave, I'll take the child with me!"

He regretted never making children a priority.

A thought struck him-was Daniela pregnant?

Daniela caught Cedric staring at her stomach,confusion flashing in her eyes.

What was that supposed to mean?

But she kept quiet.

Cedric waited a long time, but Daniela didn't speak again.

After a moment, he said, "Let's put this on hold and talk later, okay?"

Daniela nodded. "Okay."

The unexpected relief stunned Cedric. Had it really been that easy? Then what was the point of everything he endured abroad?

"Go to your meeting first. I'll head home. What do you want for dinner? Should I have Josie make something?" Daniela asked. Cedric answered sluggishly, "Anything is fine."

As Daniela turned to leave, Cedric reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, ornate box.

His secretary beamed. "Mr. Phillips picked this up at an auction overseas. A diamond-studded bracelet,engraved with both your initials. Gorgeous piece!Cost him over eight million dollars."

Cedric shot the secretary a look, part amused,part exasperated.

His secretary walked off with a knowing grin.

Cedric walked Daniela to the elevator. Once inside,she slipped the bracelet onto her wrist.

The bracelet shimmered under the light, catching Cedric's eye and pulling a small smile from him.
"You knew I wanted a divorce, yet you still bought me a gift?" Daniela asked, curiosity laced in her tone.

Cedric cleared his throat. "You're the one asking for a divorce. Not me." Daniela gave a slow nod. "You really know how to treat your wife well,"

As Daniela was about to step into the car, Cedric caught her hand. His voice dropped to a low murmur." swear, what happened at the charity gala won't happen again. Please don't be upset."

Daniela hummed softly in response.

"I didn't even look at that person. I just wanted you to care about me more, but I ended up making a mess of everything. Were you feeling unwell that day?"Cedric couldn't hold back any longer-he pulled Daniela into his arms. "Please, don't be upset. This is _all on me. I won't do anything that stupid again. I was an idiot! Don't leave me. From now on, whatever you say,I'll listen."

Cedric drew in an unsteady breath. "But there's a line, Daniela. You can't keep throwing yourself into danger.I can't take it."

Daniela let out a quiet sigh, her hand resting lightly on his back. "I'm sorry." The entire ride home, Cedric kept his fingers wrapped around Daniela's hand.

The driver glanced at them, thoroughly puzzled.

Wasn't he supposed to just send Daniela back?

Then why was Cedric in the car too?

Back home, Cedric headed upstairs for a shower.Lillian eyed Daniela. "Didn't you go to hand over the divorce agreement? How did you both end up coming back together?"

If anything, Cedric looked even more smitten with Daniela than before.

He looked like a man set on one thing-getting Daniela pregnant just to keep her byhis side.

This didn't look like a couple on the verge of divorce,did it?

Daniela shot a quick glance upstairs before slipping the divorce agreement into the drawer like it was no big deal. "What's this about?" Lillianfrowned, unused to seeing Daniela hesitate."So...no divorce?"

Daniela swapped her shoes and responded lightly,"Hmm. No divorce."

Lillian let out a knowing sigh. "I figured as much."

At that moment, Cedric, lurking at the top of the stairs, quietly exhaled in relief.

But was his plan to have a child with Daniela really that obvious?
###Chapter 492 Daniela Is A Devil


Cedric had just showered, smelled great, and was determined to have a baby with Daniela.

He wanted Daniela to know that someone in this world truly loved her and needed her just as badly.

This might make her take her life more seriously.

After his shower, Cedric came out, leaving a light scent in the air.

Daniela opened the door and stopped for a second.

His purpose was crystal clear.

Lillian, confused at the doorway, asked, "Daniela?Weren't you supposed to change? What's holding you back?"

Daniela gave a gentle smile, walked into the room,and shut the door, leaving Lillian outside, puzzled.

Inside, Cedric stood wearing only a towel around his waist, his chest exposed. Water droplets from his shower lingered on his skin, trailing down his chest and vanishing into the towel.

Daniela inhaled deeply, just as she was about to approach him, Lillian's voice reached through the door. "Daniela, are you ready? The car's downstairs.The mental hospital just called. Caiden tried to end his life. We need to hurry, or we might lose him."

Just as Lillian finished, Daniela noticed Cedric stiffen for a moment.

She gave a shy, apologetic smile. "Can we maybe do this some other time? There's a lot I need to take care of today."

Cedric paused for a moment, then asked hesitantly,"Do you mind if I come along?"

His question was a cautious dip into the unknown waters of Daniela's private life. Despite being her husband, Cedric always felt excluded.

He prepared himself for a possible rejection. Yet, it was all part of his strategy. He understood that the journey ahead would be a long one,recognizing that their struggles would be a marathon, not a sprint.

So when Daniela agreed with a simple"okay," Cedric was taken aback for a good while.

After changing, Daniela saw Cedric still rooted to the spot and asked, "Aren't you coming?"

Cedric snapped out of his daydream and quickly began to prepare himself.

In the car, Lillian kept sneaking glances at Cedric.

She texted Daniela, "Why is Cedric here?"

Daniela texted back, "Is there an issue?"

Lillian continued, "Didn't you say Cedric wasn't supposed to know about these things?"

Why the sudden change of heart?

Daniela glanced at Lillian's message and then at Cedric next to her, who was barely hiding his grin.She shook her head with a resigned smile. She had kept Cedric out of her world because it was filled with unspeakable things, and she wanted to preserve his innocence.

Still, he was eager to be a part of every aspect of her life.

She had once considered divorce, but she found herself unwilling to leave him.

Thus, she chose a new approach.

Her strategy was to bring Cedric to her world.

Her phone vibrated again with another text from Lillian. "Aren't you worried you might frighten him?"

Daniela paused, then whispered, "Let's see how it goes."

Cedric missed her murmur and asked, "What?"

Daniela shook her head. "It's nothing."

The drive to the mental institution was long, and the road narrowed along the way. Cedric sat quietly throughout. Daniela remained silent as well, her stillness weighed down by a sense of unease.

The sign at the entrance of the institution was crooked, hanging off-center.

The words "Shadowpeak Madhouse" were scrawled in a hurried manner, while weeds outside had grown taller than a person.

The old iron fence gave off a sinister air.

The last visit here had left Elyse and her daughter ill for days from the terror.

At the entrance, Daniela left Cedric with no other options. "Let's go."

She was eager to reveal her true world to him.

Cedric stepped forward immediately, with Lillian following.

The wind howled in a strange, haunting manner,carrying the stench of rotting flesh.

As they crossed the courtyard and entered the building, cries of despair echoed down the vacant halls the moment they crossed the doorway.

A bearded man greeted them with a smile. "You've come!"

"Where is he?" Daniela asked.

The man gestured towards the farthest ward. "He was desperate, found a glass shard, and nearly bled out after slicing an artery. He kept calling for you, sol figured I'd better inform you."

Daniela gave a nod. The man then turned to Cedric,offering a nod of recognition as if recalling an old acquaintance.

Daniela swung open the door to the ward. Inside,Caiden was lying on his back, his face pale, eyes fixed on the ceiling. "Daniela! You deserve to die!"

He sprang to his feet, ready to charge at Daniela.

Cedric's gaze hardened as he stepped in to protect her.

Caiden came to a sudden halt. "Cedric? Is that really you?"

Cedric remained firm, his face hardening with determination. "Yes, it's me."

"Daniela brought you here! Cedric, look at me. See how I suffer? | am Daniela's biological father, yet she despises me, and not just me but everyone. Do you know why she returned after her divorce from Alexander? She came for vengeance, for her mother's death. She's malevolent, the architect of all this cruelty! Behold, I'm just a shell of the man I once was. And the woman you think is a pure, innocent soul? She's heartless, a true villain! Daniela is a devil!" 

Caiden let out a crazy howl, his voice echoing off the decaying walls, a painful sound to the ears. "Look at the truth, Cedric! My life is just a glimpse of what's to come for you!" How can you love such a woman? It's foolish. You should leave her, escape this monster.Daniela, you're trying to kill your own father. You deserve a miserable, joyless fate, cursed for eternity."Caiden's wild outburst echoed throughout the crumbling building, with each shout hitting like a physical blow.
###Chapter 493 | Can Figure It Out


Daniela paid no mind to Caiden's words.

She turned her attention to the doctor beside her."How is he? Will he make it?"

The doctor, his refined demeanor betrayed by a sly smile, adjusted the IV drip. "Don't worry.If you want him to live to a hundred, consider it done."

Caiden's body started to shake as terror gripped him.Trapped in this bleak, godforsaken madhouse, he knew death would be a mercy compared to the torment of staying here.

"Daniela! If you have any real guts, just kill me already!" he bellowed.

"Kill you? That would be too merciful. I doubt my mother would want to see you so soon." Daniela turned to leave.

A furious voice rang out behind her. "Daniela Harper!"

Daniela turned to see Caiden pushing himself up on the bed, his voice quiet, his eyes cast downward."I'm sorry. It was all my fault."

Daniela arched a brow.

Caiden lifted his gaze to meet hers. "I loved you.l held you, cherished you. Are you really going to leave me here? Daniela, I'm begging you. Don't be so cruel.I was wrong-l admit it! Take me home, please! It's freezing here at night. The wind screams through the windows. I can't sleep. Just take me home. Think of me as a harmless pet, something you keep around,okay?"

Daniela's gaze was sharp, her smile sharper. "What are you thinking? A sinner like you doesn't deserve comfort. If you truly regret it, then repent properly in this place."

"Wait!" Caiden shouted as she turned to leave."know what you're looking for. Daniela, I know what you want to find out. Let me out, and I'll tell you everything!" Daniela froze mid-step. She slowly turned her head,her piercing gaze locking onto Caiden. "What did you just say?"

"I know you're digging into your mother's death. You think someone else was behind it. That's why you've kept Brylee and her daughter on edge. You know there are more people involved in your mother's death. You're searching for the real mastermind,aren't you?"

A frost settled in Daniela's gaze. Her stare dropped to him as if he were nothing more than discarded filth. "So, you knew all along. You knew someone else was behind my mother's death."

Under her piercing glare, Caiden's bravado wavered.But he also knew he wouldn't always get another chance. He couldn't keep faking suicide just to see her. This was his only shot-he had to take it.

"Yes, l've always known. Katrina was just a maid.How could she have pulled the strings on her own?There had to be someone else behind her."
 
Daniela's eyes stayed cold. "And how do you know Brylee and her daughter aren't acting alone?"

Caiden scoffed, "I just know. But I won't tell you now.Get me out of here! Take care of me in my old age. If you agree, I'll tell you everything."

Daniela's voice sliced through the air, sharp and cold."You knew someone else was behind my mother's death all this time, yet you did nothing. You lived off her legacy, stood over her grave, and indulged yourself without a shred of guilt."

Caiden flinched under Daniela's piercing words."had no choice. Brylee made her own enemies. What did that have to do with me? You know what I'm capable of. What could I have done? You were just a child. Did you expect me to fight those people and leave you orphaned?"

Daniela let out a cold laugh. "Haven't I been an orphan all along?"

Caiden swallowed, his voice growing desperate."At least to the world, you were still a wealthy heiress.You know I'm powerless. Who could I possibly take on? All I could do was protect myself. But listen-if you get me out of here, I'll tell you everything.I swear it!"

Daniela arched a brow, her tone mocking. "And if |don't?"

Caiden's expression darkened, his eyes glinting with ruthless resolve. "Leave me here, and this secret dies with me. You'll never know who killed your mother,Daniela. You'll be trapped in this nightmare forever."

Daniela let out a soft, amused chuckle.

Caiden stiffened. "Why are you laughing?"

Daniela tilted her head slightly. "Do I look scared?"

Caiden hesitated. "Haven't you always been desperate to know who did it?"

Daniela nodded. "Of course, I wantto know. But I'm patient. You're the one who's desperate, Caiden.After all, people only kill for love, power, or reputation. And now that I stand higher than my mother ever did, it's only a matter of time before they come for me, isn't it?" Caiden stiffened.

A satisfied smile curled at Daniela's lips-she had hit the mark.

She smirked, silently cursing Caiden for being such a fool.
###Chapter 494 You Won't Need To Worry About A Thing
Daniela rose to her feet, pity flickering in her eyes as she looked down at Caiden. "What a shame. You just wasted your final card."

Caiden's eyes stretched wide as he watched Daniela walk away. Panic clawed at his throat, forcing out a desperate yell. "Daniela, no! You're wrong! You got it all wrong! Come back! Please, come back!"

As Daniela disappeared through the door, Caiden realized with a sinking heart-it would be a long, long time before he saw her again.

The madhouse's heavy iron gate creaked open, then slowly groaned shut behind her.

Daniela slid into the car, her silence stretching across the entire ride.

Even the closest bonds could conceal a knife in the  dark.

Memories of Caiden's kindness towards Brylee surfaced, each one slicing deeper than the last. As twilight thickened outside, Daniela's eyes stung with unshed emotion.

Back home,Daniela climbed the stairs, shut her door and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

By the time she stirred awake, a new day had already dawned.

Sunlight trickled through the sheer white curtains,bathing the room in a soft,golden glow.

Daniela opened her eyes to see a handsome face before her.

"You're awake, Daniela?"

She pushed herself up and gave a small nod.

"You were out for quite a while," Cedric remarked,setting a bowl of cereal on the table. "You must be starving. Freshen up and eat something." Daniela studied Cedric's face-calm, unreadable as ever.

Without a word, she stepped into the bathroom,let the hot water wash over her, and emerged a few minutes later.

Cedric picked up the hairdryer without hesitation,gently pushing her down onto the bed before running his fingers through her damp hair, drying it with quiet precision.

The soft hum of the dryer filled the room,a steady,soothing rhythm.

Daniela rarely let her mind drift, but now, her stare remained locked on the floor, thoughts swirling like an unrelenting tide.
As the dryer clicked off, she looked up slightly, only to find a bowl of cereal already waiting in front of her.

She finished the food quietly.

"Do you want anything else? I can bring it up. Let's take the day off-skip the office for once."As Cedric turned to leave, Daniela instinctively lifted her hand, reaching for his, but then paused.

She let her hand drop and asked, "Do you want to talk?"

Cedric remained standing while Daniela sat before him.

His eyes settled on her from above. "Sure."

He lowered himself into the seat across from her.

Daniela sat in silence for a moment before reaching into her bag and pulling out the divorce agreement she had prepared in advance.

" have a considerable amount of wealth. If we divorce, legally, half of it is yours. Here-take a look at the agreement." Her voice was steady.

Cedric's expression remained just as composed.

A slow heaviness settled in Daniela's chest. "|haven't been the best partner, not as a wife or a lover. But I was happy with you."  Cedric didn't move, his expression unreadable.

Daniela pressed on. "The Harper family's villa has bad energy, so l won't include it. But I have other properties-new ones. They're all yours."

Cedric didn't respond, his silence stretching between them.

Daniela bit her lip, eyes lowering to the agreement.Then, in a quiet voice, she added, "If this isn't enough, there's another option."

Cedric's voice dropped. "What option?"

Daniela stated, "You understand that what I'm involved in comes with great risk. So, if you believe what I'm offering isn't enough, you can choose to stay with me. If anything happens to me, you will inherit every single thing I own. And I can promise you that no matter how dangerous my actions are,none of it will ever put you in harm's way. You will always be completely safe."

She let the words settle, silence stretching in their wake. Then, in a near whisper, she added, "Take your  time. Choose whichever path you want."

Cedric leaned forward, picked up the divorce agreement, skimmed through it briefly, then set it back down.

He looked up at her. "Which choice do you want me to make?"

Daniela's teeth pressed into her lip, uncertainty creeping in. When she had woken up earlier, she had almost asked Cedric if he was afraid of her.

Anyone else would be, wouldn't they?

Sleeping next to someone like her--a bloodstained lunatic-should've terrified him.

So, she held back. Instead, she put everything on the table,hoping-just hoping-he would choose to stay.

She had long stopped believing in people and in love.Yet,with Cedric, a flicker of hope still remained.

It was underhanded, maybe even selfish, to tie him down with material wealth but what other choice did she have? In the end, this was all she had left to offer.

Cedric remained eerily calm, an edge of cold detachment in his demeanor so unlike the man she knew.

Something about his stillness made Daniela uneasy.
She hesitated. "If the risk is too much,you can-"

"Give me a child," Cedric cut in, his tone resolute.

Daniela froze, her mind scrambling. "What did you just say?"

Cedric wasn't about to let this chance slip away."I know what you're about to do. I also realize there's no way to make you change your mind, but in this relationship, I've truly given my entire heart. If you insist on risking yourself and something happens, I'lI be left all alone, which would be unbearable. I'm asking you to give me a child, someone to be with me in the future. That's not too much to ask, is it?"

Daniela's lashes fluttered as she processed his words. "What's wrong? You don't agree?" Cedric pressed.

Daniela narrowed her eyes. "I can't just hand you a child right this second."

Cedric's reply was instant, unwavering. "You carry the child. I'll take care of everything else. You won't have to lift a finger."
###Chapter 495 Let Him Die In Natalie's Bed
Cedric spoke like a businessman closing a deal.

When it came to business, Daniela thrived effortlessly handling numbers.

But when it came to bluffing and negotiation, she wasn't Cedric's equal.

"To you, it's just one child. You're willing to give up your wealth, so why refuse to have a baby with me?"Cedric was cunning.

One child could lead to two, and two could lead to even more.

If he couldn't keep Daniela, their children surely would.

He was certain this plan would work.

When Daniela mentioned it to Lillian, she looked worried. "If I have a baby and something happens to me, can Cedric really raise the child alone?"

Lillian glanced at Daniela, who always lost her wits around Cedric, and sighed.

Once someone had a weakness, they could never go far.

Cedric was using a baby to tie Daniela to him.

But as Lillian glanced at Cedric, smiling in the kitchen, and Daniela, lost in thought, she reconsidered-it might not be so bad.

Elite Lux hadn't welcomed a newborn in ages.

Cedric suddenly became obsessed with health.

He exercised five times a week, cut out strong flavors, took supplements, and gave up alcohol. He never smoked, but now he banned it at Phillips Group.

Even at social events, he refused to let others smoke near him, sipping soup while they toasted with drinks. Everyone was stunned. His secretary finally explained, "Mr. Phillips is preparing for a baby.Phillips Group might soon have an heir!"

Everyone was in disbelief.

They stared at the secretary. "His wife is the one having a baby, not him. Why is he acting like he's the one getting pregnant?"

Soon, all of Olisvine knew Cedric and Daniela were trying for a baby.

At first, Daniela was confused. Why did everyone choose such bland meals during meetings? When she questioned them, her partners smiled and said,-"Before the meal, your husband specifically told us not to urge you to drink or eat strong-flavored food since you're preparing for a baby."

As Daniela sat speechless, the waiter arrived with warm milk. "Mr. Phillips said you should drink this bèfore your meal."

And so, the entire city knew-Cedric was obsessed with having a baby. Meanwhile, Doug's face contorted with rage. "Joyce,are you playing games with me? You swore Daniela and Cedric were divorcing! Now the whole city knows Daniela is expecting! Listen up, I have no interest in pregnant women!"

Joyce felt just as annoyed and bewildered.

Alexander had assured her Daniela liked him, so how...

Suddenly, Doug slapped her in the face.

Joyce froze in shock. The next moment, Doug's fingers wrapped around her throat, his chilling voice seeping into her ears. "Joyce, listen carefully. If you -trick me, you're dead! You have a week. Get Daniela into my bed, or you're done being my wife!"

With that, Doug hurled Joyce onto the floor like discarded trash.

Seething,Joyce stormed off to Alexander. She struck him hard across the face. "You swore you had Daniela under control! Now she's going to have Cedric's baby! Doug set a strict deadline. If I fail to get Daniela in his bed this week, I'm dead! What should | do?"

Red fingerprints seared Alexander's cheek. His stare chilled, a flicker of lethal intent flashing as he eyed Joyce. But it vanished quickly.

Joyce dropped into a chair, scowling. "Seems like Doug's days are numbered. Got any plans?"

Alexander straightened his glasses. "Hasn't Natalie always craved Doug? Drug him, let him die in her bed, and no one will suspect a thing."

Joyce's eyes gleamed at the idea.

Alexander watched Joyce rush off, his expression turning frigid.

He desired Doug's wealth.
He craved Daniela too.

Joyce had always been his greatest shame. Only her death could erase it forever.
###Chapter 496 Why Are You Laughing


Getting rid of Doug wasn't a tough challenge.

Doug was a man of strong sexual desire.

Simply upping the dose of his medication before he slept with a woman would be enough to get the job done.

The real problem was the grudge burning inside Joyce.

That snake Natalie! Daring to take her man,fantasizing about marrying Doug, stealing everything she built?

Joyce refused to let this slide; she'd never allow it!

She lounged stiffly on the sofa, as Doug pawed at her eagerly.

She fixed her gaze on the ceiling, eyes narrowing slightly."Darling," Joyce cooed, voice dripping with honey, "I have a friend's birthday tomorrow. Will you join me?"

Joyce was well aware Doug rarely denied bed-time requests.

Just as she predicted, Doug nodded, trapped between desire and her teasing charm.

The next morning, before heading out, Joyce looped her arms around Doug's neck and grinned. "Bring some of those pills."

Doug, who normally found such gatherings dull,suddenly showed interest.

Joyce smirked. "The spot today is super exclusive.I heard the elevator has mirrors everywhere. Baby,I wanna test it out."

At this, Doug quickly dug into the drawer, grabbing two packs and shoving them into his pocket.Watching him, Joyce let out a soft chuckle and nudged his hand back into the drawer.

This time, Doug pulled out five packs. Doug protested, "These work wonders, but too many can put serious strain on my heart!"

Joyce leaned in close, whispering, "Baby, I want to do something wild with you."

Doug,eyeing Joyce as she licked her lips, let out a laugh. "I love how bold you are!"

Doug took Joyce's hand and led her outside.

As they got into the car, Doug turned to Joyce. "Is Daniela coming today?"

Joyce shook her head. "Not sure. Probably not.Daniela never cares for these types of gatherings."

Doug's expression darkened at her response.

Between Joyce and Daniela, he'd much rather indulge in a wild elevator rendezvous with the latter.

The mere thought of sleeping with Daniela felt like an unattainable fantasy turned real.

Just before stepping out of the car, Doug's face hardened. "Don't forget what I told you. I'm dead serious. I poured a fortune into Alexander's surgery.If you fail to get Daniela into my bed, you can kiss your title as my wife goodbye. You've got two days."

Joyce bowed her head slightly, a flicker of cold malice flashing in her eyes. "Alright, I got it."

Joyce hadn't anticipated Daniela's arrival let alone with Cedric.

A wave of unease washed over Joyce; Daniela's presence could throw her entire plan off course.

Yet, Daniela remained seated, nibbling on the fruit Cedric offered, appearing as if she was merely there for the celebration.

"Joyce, you're related to Daniela. Do you have any idea why she decided to attend my birthday party?"The birthday girl beamed with excitement. "I barely know Daniela, but I took a chance and sent an invitation. I never thought she'd actually come, let alone bring Cedric! This is a story I'll be bragging about forever!"

Joyce, disinterested, cast a glance towards the entrance. "Maybe Daniela got bored of baby preparations," she muttered, sounding distracted.

The girl let out an excited giggle. "Guess what?Daniela's birthday gift to me is a custom Elite Lux brooch! It's worth over half a million dollars online!|can't wait to show it off-everyone's going to be so jealous!"

Joyce barely reacted,uninterested.

"Joyce, what's got your attention?" the grl inquired.

"No one special, just waiting on someone," Joyce answered smoothly.

Joyce's stiff expression didn't ease until a poised figure stepped inside, allowing a faint hint of relief to cross her face.

She turned away, satisfied, only to lock eyes with Daniela, who sat quietly in the corner, nibbling on a small cake with a faint, knowing smile.

Joyce's heart lurched in surprise. Steeling herself,she approached Daniela cautiously. "What's so funny?"

Daniela simply continued eating her cherry tomatoes,offering no response.

"Listen, Daniela, whatever happens today has nothing to do with you. Stay out of it!"

Daniela responded casually, "I'm just here to enjoy myself.Carry on."

At Daniela's words, Joyce's nerves eased.

She was certain Daniela wasn't the type to lie.Yet having Daniela see through her so easily was irritating.

Deciding it wasn't worth arguing, Joyce shifted her focus, her gaze landing on Natalie.

Natalie wore a dress that exuded both elegance and grace, its hem rippling like a glistening stream beneath the lights.

The moment Natalie stepped in, Joyce caught Doug's eyes locked onto her. Joyce scoffed, observing the scene with icy indifference.
###Chapter 497 You Will Know


Natalie, known for her refined taste, stood aside holding a glass of red wine, her eyes subtly wandered across the room.

Only when Doug came near did a slight smile touch her lips.

Natalie was sure that today she would capture Doug's heart.

She wore an expensive dress, convinced it would leave Doug captivated.

"Miss Dury, it's been ages." Doug, rather short,positioned perfectly for Natalie to view his bald head as she looked down. However, she seemed unfazed,even offering him a warm smile.

Linden watched from a shadowed corner, his gaze cold.

"Good evening, Mr. Fairburne," Natalie said, her smile widening when she noticed Doug's eyes linger on her neckline. "It's been a long time."

Her greeting carried a weight of uspoken meanings.

Doug gazed at Natalie's face, so similar to Daniela's,stirring deep emotions within him.

He clasped Natalie's hand, to which she responded with a timid smile, trying to withdraw her hand but without much force.

"Mr. Fairburne, I am not a woman to be taken lightly.If you harbor real feelings for me, you must ask for my hand in marriage."

-Overwhelmed by his feelings, Doug nodded eagerly.

Natalie fixed her eyes on Doug, continuing,"You must not deceive me. I uphold a flawless reputation.If I commit fully to you and if you trick me,the shame would be unbearable."

Doug shook his head at once. "How could I? I promise you, I'll divorce Joyce immediately ifyou choose me." A flicker of amusement passed through Natalie's eyes at his pledge, though she quickly masked it."But will Joyce consent to that?"

Doug gestured dismissively. "She'll have no choice.Don't worry. Joyce and I have signed an agreement that if we divorce, she would get nothing. She won't receive a dime unless I pass away. Joyce will be left with nothing but an eviction."

Upon hearing this, Natalie arched an eyebrow and her smile subtly grew.

Doug,though in his forties, was very conscious of his health. He wasn't likely to die anytime soon.

-Once she was his wife, Natalie looked forward to indulging in Elite Lux's luxuries as though they were mere necessities.

Natalie looked down, a bright smile spreading across her face as Doug guided her into the elevator.

Their interaction didn't go unnoticed. With Daniela,Cedric, Joyce, and Linden all watched from a distance. Each harbored their own secret agendas as they observed the unfolding drama.

Inside the elevator, the air was thick with an intimate tension.

Natalie leaned against the wall, breathing heavily, as Doug pulled a pack from his pocket and eagerly popped a pill intohis mouth.

Natalie rolled her eyes discreetly.

What a useless man!

"Mr. Fairburne, are you prepared?" She spun around,snatched the rest of the pills from Doug's pocket,and pressed them into his mouth with a charming smile. "Take more, love. It's my first time, and l expect something remarkable."

Doug, overwhelmed, swallowed all that Natalie offered.

The atmosphere became charged, the air thick with a sense of endless intimacy.

Natalie shut her eyes, envisioning her future riches, and a smile crawled across her face.

Suddenly, the man behind her collapsed with a thud,his body going limp after the intense episode.

The sound of his fall echoed loudly.

As the elevator doors creaked open, the relentless flashes of media cameras greeted them.

Natalie stood there, naked. She gazed at the reporters blankly, and as she heard their sharp breaths, she gradually lowered her head.

Doug lay beneath her, lying on the floor, his motionless body bleeding uncontrollably.

"Argh!" Natalie's eyes rolled back, and she collapsed to the floor, losing consciousness.

The onlookers were stunned, torn between capturing images of Natalie or Doug, ultimately choosing to photograph both together.

Joyce stood at a distance, waiting patiently for the shower of photos to calm down. Then, she moistened her eyes with water, burst into tears, and made her way through the crowd to throw herself next to Doug.

As the event organizer tried to move Doug, Joyce held onto him tightly, crying uncontrollably and refusing to let go.

Efforts were made to cover Natalie, but Joyce stopped them.

She insisted the scene be fully documented by everyone present.

When the police and medical personnel arrived and declared Doug dead, a faint smile briefly appeared on Joyce's lips.

Standing before the gathered crowd, she bowed deeply, her expression gloomy. Turning to the reporters, she said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am Joyce, Doug's wife. I deeply apologize for the tragic events of today that have interrupted your evening.I will ensure my husband receives a respectful burial and at the same time..." A single tear slipped from Joyce's eye as she continued, "I also ask everyone to stand against those who violate homes for their own selfish gain.Thank you all."

As Joyce walked away, she let two more tears drop for the cameras.

Natalie, who had just regained consciousness,fainted again after hearing Joyce's final words.

In the midst of the chaos, Cedric guided Daniela back to her home.

Before leaving, Daniela glanced back and noticed Linden's grim expression.

His cold gaze remained locked on Natalie.

Just as Daniela was about to shift her attention,something caught her eye.

In a quiet corner, a man dressed in all black stood hidden, his cap pulled low to cover his face.

Daniela immediately recognized him as the man who looked like Cedric. After observingeverything,he smirked and quietly left the scene.

Lillian, who was driving, asked, "Daniela, what are you looking at?"

Daniela pulled her gaze away. "I think I just saw Alexander."

Why would he be here?

What part did he play in this whole scenario?

Daniela's eyes narrowed in thought.

Her phone buzzed, and she checked it to find a message from an unknown number.

"Everything I do is for you, Daniela. You'll soon see that no one in this world loves you more than l do."

Cedric noticed Daniela's serious expression. "What's the matter?" he asked.
###Chapter 498 Be A Little Considerate


Daniela passed the phone over.

Cedric took a quick look before his brows knitted tightly.

Lillian leaned in for a peek. "It's an unrecognized number."

Daniela stated, "It's Alexander."

Everyone else in the car stiffened.

Daniela went on, "He underwent plastic surgery. His face is identical to Cedric's now."

Cedric grasped it at once. "That report from before!No wonder Richard said Alexander vanished. He was getting surgery."

Lillian, still confused, blurted, "Why would he make himself look like Cedric?"

Cedric skimmed the phone number, passed the device back to Daniela, and smirked, reclining lazily in his seat. "Obviously, because I'm irresistible."

Daniela studied Cedric's carefree attitude and smiled faintly.

He was even bolder than she thought.

Once home, Daniela headed for a shower. Cedric eyed the bathroom door, grabbed his phone, and stepped onto the rooftop to make a call.

"Mose, find out who owns this number. Track Alexander's mnovements. And assign a team to guard my wife."
C
The voice on the other end responded sharply,"Understood!"

Cedric ended the call.

Daniela's phone rang from the bathroom. Russell was calling.

"Daniela, Joyce didn't contract us to abduct Cedric.
She paid Lone Wolf, offering 800 million dollars." Daniela hesitated briefly. "Did Lone Wolf take the job?"

Russell confirmed, "Yes."

Daniela questioned, "Didn't you inform their leader that Cedric is one of us?"

Russell laughed, "Daniela, you forgot. Lone Wolf's leader changed five years ago and we don't know the current one. Now they're openly our rivals. Should we take action?"

Daniela showed little concern. "Just ensure Cedric's safety. Nothing else matters."

Russell agreed. "Right, 800 million is small change.But wasn't there talk of Lone Wolf disbanding? Why are they back in business? Feels odd."

Daniela ordered, "Investigate it."

After a brief pause, she added, "Investigate the new leader of Lone Wolf. Identify who they are."

After Russell ended the call, Daniela received a message from Lillian. "Come downstairs after your  shower."

Fresh from her shower, Daniela spotted Cedric waiting on the bed.

Cedric was eager for a child, but Daniela slippoed on a coat, smiling. "Lillian needs me for something.I'll be back in thirty minutes."

Cedric could only wait.

Daniela, slightly confused, approached Lillian."What's going on? I only have thirty minutes."

Lillian hesitated for a moment before saying, "Don't spoil Cedric too much. He'll become impossible to _handle. Once you have a child, he'll never let you out of his sight!"

Daniela chuckled, unfazed. "What is it?"

Lillian informed her, "A group of people have been staying around the villa."

Daniela looked at Lillian.

Lillian added, "I spotted someone familiar, Mose from Lone Wolf."

Daniela inquired, "Why are they here? Ah, I get it...They accepted the contract-eight hundred million to abduct Cedric."

Lillian's eyes widened. "Who's throwing around that kind of money?"

Kidnapping wasn't murder. This was about claiming Cedric.

Lillian gestured upstairs. "Does he know?"

Daniela didn't even glance up. "It's minor. No need to inform him."

Lillian smirked knowingly. "Someone spent eight hundred million just to snatch Cedric. That's some serious devotion. Looks like you have competition!"

Daniela remained indifferent. "Not many can afford that kind of money. I'll find out who."

A sum like that wouldn't go unnoticed in the banking system. Daniela reached for a laptop and started typing.

From the corner of her eye, she noticed someone descending the stairs.

Cedric stood on the staircase, gazing at her with feigned sadness. "Your thirty minutes are up."

Daniela sighed, handing the laptop to Ryan. "You take over the search."

Lillian folded her arms, mildly irritated at how Daniela indulged Cedric. She remarked pointedly, "Daniela's busy. Cedric, maybe be a little considerate?"

Cedric's chest swelled with pride as Daniela ascended the stairs."Why would I?"
###Chapter 499 This Troublesome Man


Daniela swung open her bedroom door and was instantly enveloped in a tight embrace. A soft chuckle escaped her.

Cedric clung to her, murmuring, "Daniela, you are my greatest love in this entire world."

He was truly jealous. Triggered by a cryptic text,he spent all night murmuring sweet words to her.

Upon rising the next day, Daniela felt her legs wobble.

Opening the door, she was shocked to see Ryan. and Lillian there, arms folded.

"Don't you two have anything better to do than eavesdrop outside my room?" she asked.

Ryan shook his head. "We've been deceived!"

Lillian's face was grave as she said, "It's true what they say, the deepest stabs come from the closest knives."

Ryan nodded vigorously.

Confusion clouded Daniela's face.

She stepped back into her room, Ryan and Lillian trailing behind.

"We've uncovered three things."

Daniela filled a glass with water, waiting for them to continue.

"Firstly, Joyce is the one who sent money to the Lone Wolf. She's after Cedric."C
Daniela's brow furrowed. "Eight hundred million to get Cedric? So soon after Doug died? Is she that obsessed with Cedric?"

Lillian agreed. "She couldn't have him before, and now with money, she's hell-bent on getting him."

Daniela laughed lightly. "And the second revelation?"
"l tracked Joyce's finances and discovered she funded Alexander's plastic surgery. There were multiple payments between them."

Daniela nodded as she listened. "Given what Alexander revealed yesterday, everything adds up.Joyce is desperate for Cedric, while Alexander..."

Lillian added eagerly, "He's interested in you!"

Daniela paused to take another sip of water. "So,what's the third thing?"

Lillian's expression turned serious, her brow furrowing. "The identity of the Lone Wolf's leader remains a mystery, but our findings suggest their frequent activities in Olisvine. Interestingly, although their forces surround our villa, they don't appear to be threatening."

Daniela raised an eyebrow."How so?"

Ryan explained, "Their actions don't suggest they want to harm you. It's almost as if they're here to protect you."

Lillian shared his confusion. Historically, Daniela's group and the Lone Wolf had been adversaries.

Their leadership changed abruptly five years ago and they seemed to dissolve, leading everyone to believe the Lone Wolf had disbanded.

Now, they resurfaced out of nowhere, accepted Joyce's eight hundred million, and yet they remain inactive.

It was strange.

Daniela gave Ryan an instruction. "Investigate further. Return to the office and dig up whatever you can about the Lone Wolf."

It was rare for Daniela to feel this curious about anyone.

Cedric walked in just as Daniela uttered "Lone Wolf."He paused briefly.

"What wolf?" Cedric asked, stepping into the room.

Ryan and Lillian exited. Daniela offered a warm smile. "For the time being,avoid returning to Phillips Group. I've instructed the secretary to transfer your belongings to Elite Lux.You'll be sharing an office with me from now on."

Cedric was clearly delighted with the arrangement.

Later at the office, Daniela powered up her computer to delve into the Lone Wolf's background.

Just as she logged in, a loud cry disrupted the silence.

Nina's voice came through, apologetic. "I'm sorry,but without an appointment, Ms. Harper is unavailable."

A sharp slap resonated.
Elyse's furious tone filled the air, "Nina! Have you lost your senses? Your sister is in deep trouble, and this is your attitude? It seems like you take pleasure in her suffering.I swear I will make you regret this!"

The sound of slapping echoed again.
Lillian rushed outside and helped Nina off the floor. Nina stepped aside with her face covered, shot a scornful look at Elyse.

"How can you resort to violence at Elite Lux? Elyse Dury, don't you respect Ms. Harper at all? This is unacceptable!" Lillian spat.
Elyse straightened her attire. "Where's Daniela? I'm not speaking to anyone else. I need to see Daniela!"

Lillian folded her arms. "She's occupied at the moment and cannot meet with anyone."

Elyse's anxiety spiked instantly.

Natalie had turned from a well-known socialite to someone universally scorned. Without Daniela's help,her life would be ruined.

Doug was a married man, and Joyce had been causing chaos online, further tarnishing Natalie's reputation.

Joyce's tearful face only fueled public disdain for Natalie.

The backlash was severe. People were so repulsed they pelted Natalie with eggs in public.

How could Natalie withstand this?

"I am Daniela's aunt! You have no right to block me!"Elyse exclaimed loudly, her desperation clear. She believed her and Natalie's suffering justified their demands on others' empathy.

Daniela, hearing the commotion, set her computer aside and instructed, "Let her in."

Elyse, adjusting her hair, stormed into Daniela's office, casting a threatening look at Nina."You'll regret this once I'm done here!"

Upon entering, Elyse noticed Cedric at another desk,deeply engrossed in his work.

She snorted through her nose.

Natalie wouldn't have lost her mind if it hadn't been for this troublesome man.

It all started because of Cedric!

With a fierce glare at Cedric, she made her way towards Daniela.
###Chapter 500 Who Would Dare Marry You
Facing others, Elyse was always bold and assertive.

But when it came to Daniela, she knew to mask her emotions with careful restraint.

She lowered her gaze, spread her hands slightly, and wore the perfect look of a helpless victim.

Daniela had seen this expression far too many times.

When they were younger, every time Elyse wanted something from Brylee, she would put on the same act.

And Brylee, out of sisterly love, always gave in.

"Daniela, you have to help me and Natalie this time!"Elyse pleaded, her voice dripping with urgency.

Daniela sat in her chair, her expression unreadable.Her tone remained calm. "What happened?" At that, Elyse's face twisted with frustration.

She was certain Daniela was playing dumb.

With rumors flying everywhere, how could Daniela possibly not know?

How could she pretend she hadn't heard what people were saying about Natalie?

Elyse cursed Daniela inwardly. If she could take Daniela down right now, she'd already be running Elite Lux. How dare Daniela act superior to her?
But on the surface, she remained composed, forcing a smile. "Daniela, we're family. If you refuse to help Natalie this time, Natalie and I have to take our lives!"

Tears welled in her eyes as she broke into heart-wrenching sobs.

Daniela, unfazed, played her role even better. "Aunt,don't be upset. Just tell me-what exactly happened to Natalie?"

Elyse swallowed her pride and forced herself to explain, "Joyce framed Natalie. Now the whole internet is tearing her apart!"

Daniela gave a small nod, picked up the tablet beside her, and met Elyse's eyes with a serious expression."Is that so? Don't worry. I won't just sit back and let Natalie be bullied. Let's see what people are actually saying online."

She opened the trending topics.

At the very top was the hashtag #TheBitchNatalie.

She tapped on it.

Then, in a calm, precise voice, she began reading the comments aloud.

"Didn't Natalie act like she was way out of any ordinary guy's league? How did she end up in bed with Doug?"

"Wait, let's be clear. That wasn't in bed. They were having sex inside an elevator!"

"Why would Natalie do this? Such a beauty, wasted.Look at her, crying like that.What a shame." "Don't pity her. She had no issue fooling around with Doug, a married man. Now Joyce is a widow, and Natalie's just a home-wrecking slut who deserves what's coming to her!"

"Everyone should hate Natalie! Get rid of her already!"

Daniela continued reading with the smooth detachment of a news anchor.

But the moment Elyse heard her daughter being called a "bitch," she couldn't take it anymore.

"Daniela, stop! Stop reading! These people online are just spewing garbage!"

Daniela put the tablet down and tilted her head slightly, feigning surprise. "Oh? Is that so? Then I suppose all these photos, videos, and gifs flooding the internet are fake? if that's the case, we should sue these media outlets immediately.Would you like me to call a lawyer for you?"

Elyse wrung her hands together and hesitated."Well... it did happen, but Doug was the one who seduced Natalie! She's virtuous, completely innocent. How could she ever be interested in someone like him?"

Just as she finished, a sharp laugh came from Nina.
Elyse's eyes darkened as she turned to glare at Nina before quickly looking back at Daniela. "Doug set the whole thing up. That scoundrel deserved to die!"

Daniela studied Elyse, watching how easily she shifted the blame onto someone else. Her voice was calm as she asked, "So, what exactly do you want me to do?"

Elyse didn't hesitate. "Isn't Joyce your stepsister?()-Tell her to stop spreading rumors online. I'll have Natalie issue a statement, and she just needs to stay quiet."

Daniela spread her hands with an easy shrug. "I'm afraid that's not possible."
At those words, a flicker of malice flashed across Elyse's face, but she quickly smoothed it over. "Why not? Elite Lux is far ahead of the Fairburne family in wealth and influence. What, are you afraid of them?Daniela, you're not someone who backs down that easily,are you?"

Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "Doug died. And it happened while Natalie was with him. You expect me to use power to cover this up? That doesn't seem right, does it? Besides, as you said, Joyce is my stepsister. I can't help you crush her, can I? My father wouldn't be happy about that."

Elyse's expression twisted. "Daniela, ifyou don't want to help, just say it. Why bother making excuses? Everyone knows you cut ties with your father ages ago. Who are you trying to fool?"

Elyse's expression darkened with displeasure.

Daniela's face turned cold in an instant, the last traces of amusement vanishing. "So,since I've cut ties with Caiden and my mother passed away long ago, that means I have no reason to help Natalie,doesn't it?"

Her voice was sharp, carrying the weight of authority.  A chill ran down Elyse's spine, as if she had been doused with ice water.

Daniela leaned back slightly. "Since you also don't see us as family, please leave."

Nina stepped forward, raising a hand toward the door in an unmistakable gesture.

Elyse's face burned with humiliation. She shot a glare at Nina, then at Daniela, before stomping her foot in frustration and stormning out.

Natalie had been waiting downstairs. The moment she saw Elyse's furious expression, anxiety flashed in her eyes."How did it go? What did Daniela say?"

Elyse let out a sharp breath. "That woman's a bitch.She refused to help you!"

At those words, Natalie's composure cracked. Tears spilled down her face as she choked out, "What are we supposed to do now? Mom, I can't show my face anywhere! You have to find a way to erase everything online! And then-find a way for me to marry well." Elyse scoffed, "In this situation? Who wNould even dare to marry you now?"

" would." A cold voice cut through the air from behind them.
###Chapter 501 Marry Me


Natalie and Elyse lit up at the words.

They spun around eagerly, only for their excitement to fade the moment they saw Linden standing there.

"You?" Natalie scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain.

What could a mere family doctor possibly bring to the table?

How much money could he even have?

She was certain she could earn more on her own than she ever would by marrying him.

Marrying a poor man and living a life of struggle?

Not a chance!

That was never going to happen.

If wealth hadn't been her priority, she wouldn't have settled for someone as hideous as Doug in the first place.

Without a second thought, she and Elyse turned to leave.

Linden's voice rang out behind them. "I may not have much money, but Daniela does."

Natalie stopped in her tracks and let out a sharp laugh. "You actually think Daniela would listen to you? Do
you think you're Cedric?"

Linden met her gaze calmly. "She promised me that if I got married, she would give me a gift."

Natalie eyed Linden with suspicion.

"I already asked her for that hillside villa you used to own.If you marry me, it'll be yours." She didn't believe him for a second.

Linden pulled out his phone and showed them a photo of the property deed. "If you're doubtful, you can wait until I officially get the villa before deciding."

Elyse said nothing.

Natalie was equally quiet.

Seeing the greed in their eyes, Linden pressed on. "That villa, if sold properly, could easily go for billions.Natalie, isn't marrying rich exactly what you wanted? Marry me, and you won't just have money on paper-you'll have real, tangible wealth. Be honest. In Olisvine, besides Daniela and Cedric, who else can offer you that kind of fortune? If you marry me, you marry a rich man, don't you?"

His argument was airtight. All those years of education hadn't gone to waste.

Natalie shot a glance at Elyse.

Elyse hesitated. "But at the end of the day, it's still under your name. It's yours. Who knows who you'll hand it over to? And if you divorce Natalie, won't we end up with nothing?"

Linden's lips curled into a smile. "I can sign an agreement. If I'm the one to file for divorce, the villa will go to Natalie, no conditions attached."

Elyse leaned in slightly. "And what if Natalie,can't stand it anymore and wants to leave?"

Linden's smile didn't waver. It was relaxed, even generous. "As long as she stays married to me for five years,then whether she wants to stay or go, the villa will belong to her. Everything I just said can be written in the contract."

Silence fell between them.

Natalie bit her lip, clearly tempted.

Five years.

Just five years! After that, she could leave Linden and keep the villa.

It was like making billions in five years!

Even marrying Doug wouldn't guarantee that kind of money.

Natalie wavered, on the verge of agreeing, but Elyse held her back."We need to think this through."

Natalie turned to her, confused.

"If you marry him and he refuses to divorce you, then what? Are you willing to waste your entire life?"

Besides,once married, any, disputes would become family matters-outsiders wouldn't be able to interfere.

Linden seemed sharp. Natalie might not be able to outmaneuver him.

And self-made men were always more guarded about their money than people like Doug.

"In any case, we need time to consider." Elyse's tone was firm.

"Fine. I'll give you three days. If I don't hear back, then let's drop this entirely-I'll just propose to Nina instead."

Elyse pressed her lips together and pulled Natalie away.

Linden watched Natalie disappear down the hall. His mind flashed back to the day Doug had backed her into the elevator. She hadn't looked frightened. She had looked pleased.

His fists curled tight.
###Chapter 502 What Does It Matter to Me


Natalie and Elyse arrived home, but Elyse couldn't shake her agitation as she glanced at Natalie.

If not for Natalie's insatiable greed, she could have lived a carefree life, comfortably relying on her secret agreement with Daniela.

But now, Daniela was furious and that deal was good as dead. If it still held any weight, Daniela wouldn't have given the villa to Linden instead.

They had lost everything and gained nothing.

Regret twisted in Elyse's chest as she snapped at Natalie, "What do we do now? I warned you to behave yourself, but you insisted on being with Doug. Now, your reputation is in shambles, Doug is dead, and we're drowning in the aftermath. You've ruined our future!"

Natalie whipped her head around, dsbelief etched across her face, throwing Elyse a sharp glare."Mom,you were the one who taught me from a young age to do whatever it takes to get what I want!"

Elyse rolled her eyes. "Then what's your plan? Why not just marry Linden? A few billion is enough to live comfortably for the rest of our lives."

Natalie's expression darkened with displeasure.
She knew Linden all too well, and men in general. She hadn't chosen him before, yet had openly had sex with Doug, with photos and videos circulating for all to see. And still, Linden was there, willing to marry her.

That wasn't love.

It was about feeding a man's sense of superiority and soothing his resentment.

Getting married was easy, but getting a divorce later would be far more complicated.

Moreover, during the marriage, any domestic violence could only be dealt with privately, within the family. Marrying Linden would be like walking straight into a lion's den.

And Linden's five-year agreement was just a lie and an excuse.

Natalie wasn't naive. She had dumped Linden once. If she married him now, she knew she would onlybe getting herself into a world of cruel treatment.

Natalie wouldn't agree to that.

She needed another way so, she went to Daniela.

Gone was her usual arrogance. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she pleaded, "Daniela, please help me."

Unlike Elyse, who deflected blame, Natalie admitted her mistake. "I wasn't thinking straight. I never expected Doug to be so weak. I didn't mean for him to die. It's my fault. Please, Daniela, help me."

Outside, the sky was heavy with clouds, casting a shadow over everything.

Daniela stood by the towering floor-to-ceiling window, watching the city's bustling traffic below.

She stayed silent for a long while, lost in her thoughts.

"Daniela, I'm begging you. Please give me a way out."

Daniela's black dress blended into the darkening sky outside.

Natalie stared at Daniela's back, crying softly, her tears slipping soundlessly.

"Daniela, we're family. Your mom adored me when she was alive. She promised me a life of luxury. You're her daughter, Daniela. Won't you honor her wishes?"

Tears streamed down Natalie's face as she looked at Daniela."You wouldn't want to see me destroyed by Linden,would you? Your mom is watching over us, Daniela. She's watching you."

The rain hammered down, relentlessly pounding against the windows.

Lightning streaked across the sky and low and menacing thunder rumbled. Natalie flinched as thunder cracked.

Then, she heard a mocking laugh.

Natalie stared at Daniela in shock.

"Can you even recall what my mom looked like?" Daniela's voice echoed through the room.

Natalie hesitated.

Brylee?

She had been too young back then, and the memories were hazy and unclear.

But Natalie nodded anyway, forcing a smile. "Of course, I remember. She was gentle. She always put family first. She never let me or my mom suffer, and you wouldn't either, right?"

"I can barely remember her at all." Daniela's voice reverberated through the empty office. "Her image is slipping away from my memory, and I can no longer recall the exact words she said to me. Natalie, my mom vowed to protect you and your mom for a lifetime. But in the end, she couldn't even protect her daughter.During those years when I struggled under the same roof as Katrina, neither you nor your mom ever came to see me, not even once. Tell me, if my mom truly knew what happened, would she still stand by you? Elyse is my aunt, and you're my cousin. When I could barely afford a meal, where were you?"

Natalie bowed her head, her mind drifting back to the past.

They lived lavishly off the shares Brylee provided, rising to become the most respected socialites in Olisvine.She studied abroad, traveled the world, and indulged in the most extravagant lifestyle.

"We're family, so why are you holding this against me? The past is behnd us. Why dwell on it? We're all doing well now, isn't that the best outcome? Besides, you have a father. If he didn't love you, that's not our fault."

Natalie had been pampered since childhood, accustomed to getting everything she wanted.

Her brief moment of admitting fault quickly faded. She straightened up, her posture now radiating an air of superiority. Daniela looked at Natalie standing before her and couldn't help but laugh, finding the situation almost absurd. "Then by that logic, Doug dying because you had sex with him in the elevator isn't my problem either."

"That's different. You're my cousin and older than me, so you should take care of me." Natalie spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
###Chapter 503 What Did You Say To Daniela


"Is that so?" Daniela scoffed, sinking lazily into the sofa.

Daniela's indifferent tone made Natalie's lashes quiver.

Natalie bit her lip as her confidence slowly crumbled. "Daniela, what exactly do you mean?"

Daniela smiled. Her lips, a delicate shade of red, curved gently, like a rare winter rose in bloom.

"Natalie, take a guess. What do you think I want?"

The moment those words left Daniela's lips, Natalie's heart skipped a beat. She eyed Daniela with growing wariness.

Daniela remained composed, like a seasoned predator watching its prey squirm.

Natalie struggled to find her words before finally whispering,"What do you want to know?"

Daniela folded her hands in front of her, exuding effortless ease. With a calm gaze, she asked, "Take a guess.You've always known exactly what I'm after, haven't you?"

Just then, the office door creaked open.

Cedric strode in, flipping on the desk lamp to cut through the darkness before settling beside Daniela.

Natalie darted a glance at Cedric before returning her wary gaze to Daniela. "I don't understand what you're saying."

"That's fine." Daniela's voice was calm, almost soothing.

She had a way of making everything feel unhurried, as if time itself bent to her will-calm, measured,yet always in command.

"Go ahead, keep pretending." Daniela chuckled softly, her smile pure yet laced with amusement. A sharp pang of fear shot through Natalie.

"Let's keep playing. I just hope you can afford the stakes." Daniela's amused gaze bore into Natalie.

A chill ran down Natalie's spine, sending goose bumps across her skin. "You want to know...?"

"Yes."

"So this was all your doing!"

"Naturally."

The instant Daniela confirmed it, a wave of fear crashed over Natalie.

Her once-confident expression dissolved into sheer shock.

"You mean from the moment I tried to get close to Doug, this was alI part of your plan? You were setting me up?"

Daniela shook her head. "It started long before that. From the moment I first met you, from when you told me you wanted to join Elite Lux-I had already factored you into my plans. In fact, ever since you came back from abroad, I knew this day would come."

Natalie stared at Daniela, terror creeping into her wide eyes. "That's impossible!"

Daniela offered a serene smile. "Believe it or not, it doesn't change anything. As I said, keep acting-I'll play along." Her tone was light, almost casual, as if she were merely discussing the weather.

"You..." Natalie's voice wavered, trembling against the eerie silence of the office as a nameless fear gripped her.

It dawned on her-her fate had long been trapped in Daniela's grasp.

She now understood-Linden's hatred, his contempt, everything had been orchestrated by Daniela from the start.

Daniela's machinations were too precise, too ruthless, and for the first time, true fear took hold of Natalie. "What do you want to know?" Natalie's voice trembled as the weight of realization bore down on her.

She couldn't deny it-she was utterly outmatched by Daniela!

Against Daniela, she was nothing but powerless.

"I want the truth about my mother's death-every detail, every name. No one gets away with it!"

Cedric rose from his seat, setting down a pen and paper in front of Natalie.

"And if I tell you, what do I get in return?"

Daniela's expression remained unreadable.′′As you pointed out, the villa you stayed in is still yours. I can send you abroad for further studies until the scandal with Doug fades. Once people forget, you can return.
Whether you resume as my secretary or pursue something else is entirelyyour choice."

Natalie hesitated, lost in thought.

Staring at the blank sheet before her, she spoke. "If I give you the names, I want more. When I return, I want a company under Elite Lux."

The thought of remaining Daniela's secretary made her stomach churn. Daniela's mind was far too dangerous. It was better to carve out her own path.

"And one more thing, you can't harm my mother."

Daniela sat up, her smile razor-sharp as she met Natalie's gaze. "You get one-either a company, or my promise not to touch your mother. Pick."

Natalie's teeth dug into her lip. Silence stretched before she finally spoke. "The company."

Her decision was final.

Self-interest always came first.

That was the lesson Elyse had drilled into her since childhood.

She had always been the dutiful daughter. This was a world governed by laws-what real harm could Daniela possibly inflict on Elyse?

She clung to that reasoning, conveniently pushing aside the grim memory of Caiden's fate.

"Yes." Natalie gave a decisive nod. "I choose a company."

Without hesitation, she knelt by the table, pen scratching across the page as she jotted down the names.

"Natalie, you know me," Daniela murmured, watching as she wrote. "I already know parts of the truth. This is just to test your sincerity. If you write false names, and I uncover the truth later, you won't be making it back from abroad. Don't expect me to let family ties hold me back."

Natalie's grip on the pen tíghtened. After a brief hesitation, she scratched out a few names-Joyce among them.

As she slid the list over, she spoke with forced certainty. "Every name is there. None are missing."

Daniela skimmed the names before flicking a dismissive hand. Without another word, Natalie straightened up and left.

Elyse was pacing anxiously downstairs. The moment Natalie emerged, she rushed over.

"Sweetheart, I just borrowed some money from Nina. If Daniela won't help, don't worry, I'll find another way."

Natalie's gaze softened with pity. "Mom, don't you get it? We can't win against Daniela. It's time to accept reality."

That single sentence froze Elyse in place.

A heavy silence followed before she finally lifted her head, disbelief written all over her face."What did you say to Daniela?"
###Chapter 504 A Painless Death Or A Miserable Life

Natalie's expression darkened as she sharply withdrew her hand from Elyse's grip. "Mom, you need to own up to your actions. It's unfair to offload your responsibilities onto your daughter, don't you think?"

Elyse was visibly shaken by the confrontation, rooted to the spot."You..."

"Indeed, I've informed Daniela about everything," Natalie responded in a composed voice. "I've realízed something important. It's futile to contend with someone more powerful. Daniela is far too intelligent and cunning for us; we are but insects to her."

Elyse let go of Natalie's hand. "Did you really tell her everything?"

Natalie affirmed with a nod. "Yes, I did."

Worry creased Elyse's face. "What about Mr. Perry and the others? Did you mention them too?"

With a look of contempt, Natalie answered, "Why should we protect their secrets? They ignored us when we needed help. Why not leverage the truth to our advantage with Daniela?"

Elyse's voice shook with fear. "Natalie, that's dangerous! Don't you understand what they're capable of doing for money?"

Natalie sneered, brushing off her concerns. "I'm not worried about that."

Exhaustion was evident on Elyse's face, which seemed to have aged significantly. "What did Daniela offer you?"

For a brief moment, a mix of emotions flashed through Natalie's eyes at the question.

Several moments slipped by.

She answered casually, "Nothing much. Daniela agreed to let me study abroad. Oh, and she returned the villa we used to own. While I'm gone, you'll have to manage on your own." At this, Elyse grasped Natalie's hand desperately. "Natalie, please, take me with you! Daniela knows too much; I'm dispensable to her now. If you leave me here, neither Daniela nor Mr. Perry will let me be!"

Natalie's lips tightened. She methodically removed Elyse's fingers from her hand.

"Mom, that's not going to happen. You're Daniela's aunt, and we're family. Why would she harm you?Besides, Nina is still here. She's your daughter too, and she won't let you come to harm. I need to leave;my flight is at three. Just promise me you'll look after yourself. Once I return from my studies, Daniela has promised me a company. I'll make sure you're well cared for then."

Natalie then signaled for a taxi. She walked away without a second glance.

Left alone, Elyse stood frozen, as if struck by a sudden revelation.

It was unbelievable to her. The child she had raised and loved was now casting her aside to fend for herself.

Elyse's eyes darted around in panic. Then, suddenly, a piercing scream tore through the air.

Reflexively,Elyse looked upwards.

At that moment, her heart stopped.

From somewhere above, a flowerpot plunged straight towards her.

Elyse's breathing halted.

She barely registered the forceful pull on her arm when, moments later, the sound of the pot smashing into the pavement echoed around her.

Gazing at the broken pieces on the ground, Elyse's face registered utter disbelief.

"Daniela," Elyse whispered, her body shaking, her complexion ashen. "I need to get to Daniela.She's the only one who can shield me now!"

She rushed to the elevator, her heels nearly slipping until she finally managed to hit the call button.

As Elyse burst into Daniela's office, tears cascaded down Elyse's cheeks. "Daniela, it's all my fault! I shouldn't have colluded with outsiders against your mother. Mr. Perry wants revenge. He knows I turned on him! You must help me. I don't want to die, Daniela, please!"

Daniela regarded her with a detached calm. She had not anticipated Elyse's spinelessness. Such a minor scheme had unraveled her completely.

"Do you expect me to save you?" Daniela's voice was cold as she remained seated. "To save the one responsible for my mother's death? What are you thinking?"

"I can disclose everything I know, just as Natalie did. I know more than her! She was too young to remember everything."

Desperation filled Elyse's eyes as she pleaded, "Daniela, please give me a chance. We're family, after all."

Daniela chuckled. "Since we're family, I'll let you decide-a painless death or a miserable life."

Without a moment's pause, Elyse exclaimed,"I choose to live!"

Little did Elyse know, there existed a fate much harsher than death itself.

From then on, every day of her life was tainted with remorse over her decision.
###Chapter 505 Smug Attitude


Daniela offered a faint smile, stepping closer to lend Elyse a hand to her feet. "I need you to draw out Mr.Perry."

Elyse trembled at the weight of those words. "l.."

Daniela's smile widened, her voice soft but chilling. "Or would you prefer to die?"

Elyse crumpled to the floor, her gaze fixed vacantly on Daniela, her heart heavy with a tide of regret.

If only she had known then. If only she had killed Daniela too after getting rid of Brylee all those years ago.

Now, it was too late.

With no other option, Elyse nodded in resignation. "Alright."

Doug was dead, and Natalie had gone abroad.

With Alexander's backing, Joyce had taken the reins of Fairburne Group, her fortune soaring past the billion-
dollar mark.

In a way, it was a masterstroke of a comeback, all thanks to Natalie.

Alexander's expression darkened as he turned his gaze to Joyce. "Don't forget I want Daniela."

Joyce smiled sweetly at him, playfully pushing him back onto the bed. "No rush. You want Daniela, and I've got my/ eyes set on Cedric. Let's let the cards fall where they may."

Afterward, Joyce made a beeline for Elite Lux.

Downstairs, she crossed paths with Cedric.

Her eyes roamed over him, from head to toe. The real one truly outshone the fake one.

That natural authority, that boldness, that self-assured swagger... It was something Alexander coud never hope to grasp, something he lacked deep in his core.

It was an innate arrogance, woven into the very fabric of his being.

No wonder Cedric was the man she had chosen.

Cedric, however, was oblivious to her presence, lost in admiration for a finely crafted jade bracelet he planned to gift to Daniela.

Inside the elevator, his focus remained glued to the bracelet.

Joyce tilted her head to steal a glance at him, letting out a chuckle. "I never knew you could be such a devoted husband, Cedric."

Before speaking,Joyce instinctively adjusted her outfit. When she finally spoke,her tone was laced with playful mischief.

It was only then that Cedric turned his head.Upon noticing Joyce, his brows knitted together.

First Natalie, and now Joyce. When would he finally find peace to pursue his dream of having a child with Daniela?

Cedric's expression was anything but pleasant.

Joyce couldn't care less. Wearing a cheerful smile, she sauntered over with an air of mischief. "You seem rather displeased to see me. Did I do something to offend you in the past? Let's not forget-I'm Daniela's stepsister. Technically speaking, doesn't that make us family?"

Now that Joyce had wealth on her side, confidence clung to her like a second skin. She had a knack for teasing men, especially those who seemed unseasoned. Her playful remarks often left her targets fumbling,blushing,or both.

She lived for the awkwardness. It was a game she savored. So, with a glint of mischief in her eyes, she fixed her gaze on Cedric, waiting for his telltale reaction.

Cedric didn't so much as flinch. With calm, he stepped aside. "My wvife cut ties with the Harper family long ago.Let's not waste time dressing this up with all that 'family' nonsense."
Joyce's smile faltered. "Well, aren't you the protective one?"

As the elevator doors slid open, Joyce took a deliberate step out, glancing back at Cedric with a lingering gaze that danced over his broad chest for just a moment too long.

Her lips then curved into a smile of intrigue.

At that very moment, Nina emerged from the secretary's office and happened to catch the tail end of the scene. Nudging Lillian with her elbow, she whispered, "Did you see that? Joyce was totally checking out Cedric."

Lillian's eyes flicked to Cedric.
The sunlight poured through the tall windows, gilding the room in a warm glow. Cedric stood tall and poised,his tailored suit hugging his frame with surgical precision, exuding both sophistication and restrained power.

In that golden light, a faint, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his lips, andhis shadow stretched long across the floor.

In that moment, Cedric seemed to glow with a golden aura, effortlessly commanding admiration.

Lillian crossed her arms and clicked her tongue, then turned to see Nina's face filled with infatuation.

As Cedric passed by, Lillian muttered under her breath, "What a dangerously captivating charmer!"

Cedric paid her no mind and walked straight into Daniela; s office.

Right now, his priority was to have a child with Daniela. Everything else was secondary.

Cedric pushed the door open and entered, while Joyce's gaze naturally followed him.

Daniela noticed the way Joyce's eyes followed Cedric, and frowned ever so slightly, though the expression was fleeting, and Joyce didn't catch it.

Now seated across from Daniela, Joyce carried herself with the smug air of someone who had clawed their way to the top and wanted the world to know it.

“Daniela, I'm here to discuss a potential collaboration with you." Only she knew how satisfying it was to say those words.

After all, the whispers had followed her: Katrina's daughter would never measure up to Brylee's.

She had endured years of hardship and suffering just to sit on equal footing with Daniela.

Now, as this moment finally arrived,it all felt worth it.

It took Daniela less than a second to see through Joyce's newly-rich bravado. She smiled faintly."What kind of collaboration are we talking about?"
###Chapter 506 The Blossom Cedric Gave Her


Joyce said, "Our family has long been rooted in mining. With Doug's passing, the business has grown beyond my capacity to manage alone. As we're half-sisters and I prefer to keep the business in the family,I'm proposing we become partners."

Leaning back, she exuded a sense ofpride.

She had evolved significantly from her earlier days.

Daniela gave a faint smile and replied, "Really?"

Joyce said with a nod, "Absolutely."

Daniela, remaining silent, rose and approached the coffee table to pour herself a cup of coffee.

Joyce watched Daniela, a look of confusion spreading across her face. "Daniela, what's your hesitation? I'm here offering a partnership that includes significant financial benefits. Why not accept immediately? Are you aware of how profitable our mines are?"

She gestured with her fingers, indicating a figure. "This much."

Daniela sipped her coffee quietly, her smile slight. She disregarded the figures Joyce suggested, familiar with the financial details of major corporations, including those based in Olisvine.

Her leadership at Elite Lux was no coincidence.

She knew of Doug's reputation as a financial powerhouse.

Daniela maintained her smile.

Joyce's expression turned to one of frustration.11|get that you're wealthy, Daniela, but more wealth never hurts. This is an exceptional chance. I'm offering this because I trust you."

Daniela's smile persisted. Joyce always felt a twinge of annoyance at Daniela's grin. It was as if Daniela knew everything.

"You trust me..." Daniela began with a smile. "Alexander's father visited me recently."

Joyce stiffened.

Daniela looked up, noting Joyce's reaction. "He was upset, mentioned you wouldn't see him, and that Alexander has gone missing. He's quite concerned and asked if I could help locate his son, given our past connections."

Joyce narrowed her eyes slightly.

Daniela added, "I've agreed to help. Now that you're here, perhaps you might know something. Where could Alexander have gone? It's unusual for a person to just disappear. Those in the know are aware he's missing,but outsiders might suspect he's up to something."

Joyce's eyes darted away. "I haven't kept up with him. He never valued my presence much, and I'd rather not be entangled with his issues now."

Joyce's pulse quickened under Daniela's perceptive smile.

Trying to maintain composure, she said, "Daniela, let's not get sidetracked. I need to know if you're in on the partnership. If you're not interested, I'll look elsewhere. Many would jump at the chance to collaborate with me."

Daniela responded with a mild smile.

She noticed Joyce's eyes darting towards Cedric as she spoke.

Daniela's expression became thoughtful.

It suurprised her that after all this time, Joyce still seemed infatuated with Cedric.

"Do you find it appealing?" Daniela suddenly asked.

Caught off guard, Joyce hesitated.

For a moment, she thought Daniela had actually noticed something. But after a brief pause, Daniela's voice cut through the silence. "I was talking about the flowers in Cedric's hand."

Cedric's workspace was typically stark and formal.

Yet today, it was adorned with various blooms, lending an intriguing air to the office.

"Not bad," Joyce commented, redirecting her attention away from Cedric. "I'll give you three days to think it over. If I don't hear from you by then, I'Il seek another partner."

With that declaration, she rose to leave.

Her eyes lingered on Cedric once more.

Noticing Daniela engrossed in her coffee, Joyce hesitated. She then approached Cedric and asked, "Where did you get those flowers? They're beautifully arranged."

While arranging the flowers, Cedric responded, "I can send you the shop's details."

Joyce looked back at Daniela, now absorbed in her phone, and bit her lip. "Cedric, perhaps you could get some for me as well? I'll pay you handsomely."

Cedric glanced up at Joyce, somewhat bewildered. "With all your resources, surely you can find someone else for this task. I don't require any compensation."

A shade of annoyance crossed Joyce's face. She pointed at some flowers Cedric had set aside. "May I take them?"

Cedric had no objections. Those were destined for the trash anyway. His attention was fully on arranging the blossoms to make them look even more perfect.

"Sure," Cedric agreed, focusing on his task.

Joyce, slightly embarrassed,reached for the flowers.

She thought of them as a gift from Cedric.
###Chapter 507 How Will | Know If I Don't Try


To Joyce,Cedric was like a distant star, brilliant, radiant, but forever out of reach.

When her mother stil held the power of the Harper family, she had once believed there was hope for her to be with him.

But when she plummeted to rock bottom, she abandoned those extravagant dreams though a twinge of regret would creep into her heart occasionally.

Now, with her newfound power, those long-buried desires stirred once more, rising bit by bit like embers reigniting into flame.

The flowers before her were the first flicker of that hope.

"Apologies," Daniela said smiling and picked up the flowers from the table. "We're not done with them just yet."

Joyce had been on the brink of happiness, only for Daniela to steal it away with a single, unwavering gesture.

Joyce barely managed to suppress the fury on her face at that moment. Who did Daniela think she was to challenge that? For over a decade, she had basked in favor, while Daniela had been the ignored one. And now, Daniela dared to flaunt her power in front of her.

Joyce's expression darkened with fury, but she forced herself to maintain her composure. "Daniela, don't be so petty! It's just some flowers and you can't even spare them for mne?"

Daniela lifted a flower to her nose, breathing in its delicate fragrance.

"This is a gift from my husband. Every flower holds meaning for me. I can't give it away."

Joyce sucked in a sharp breath, her chest tightening as she locked eyes with Daniela, the bitter realization sinking in that she had no way to argue against Daniela. So she turned to Cedric instead, her voice softening into something almost pleading. "Cedric, you promised earlier that you'd give me the flowers."

Her tone carried the same entitlement she'd always wielded as a child when she used totake things from Daniela, knowing she had Caiden's favoritism on her side.

But the woman before her was no longer the same girl from their childhood.

And Cedric was surely not Caiden.

"Please forgive me," Cedric said evenly,"but this is a gift I gave to my wife. I have no right to give it away.However, if you like, I can have my secretary get you the contact information of the florist's shop. You can buy them yourself."

A faint, mocking smile played on Daniela's lips as she watched Joyce.

Unable to reveal her true feelings, Joyce could only swallow her anger and remain composed.

She glanced at Daniela and muttered begrudgingly, "I expect an update in three days."

After saying that, she spun on her heel and strode away.

But the further she walked, the more unwilling she felt. As she stepped into the elevator, an idea ignited in her mind.

Slipping away from prying eyes, she sought out one of the cleaning staff at Elite Lux and pulled out a wad of cash.

She lied to the cleaner, "I really like the flowers in Daniela's office. I'll pay you ten thousand if you get them for me."

The cleaner's eyes widened in surprise. "But..."

She hesitated, clearly conflicted.

Joyce raised two fingers."Twenty thousand."

The cleaner stared, dumbfounded. "Twenty thousand? You must be joking. Or are the flowers worth millions?"

After all, if it was Daniela's, it had to be priceless.

Joyce scoffed. "The flowers are nothing special. You can find them everywhere. I just think flowers from Daniela's office could bring in good luck. You know how businesspeople are. They all believe in these things."

With that, Joyce grabbed the cleaner's phone and, without hesitation, transferred thirty thousand. "It's just some flowers. You can get them for me, can't you?"

The cleaner stared at the money in her account. The temptation was too great. Finally, she nodded hesitantly. "Ms. Harper's pretty easygoing. She won't make a fuss even if something goes missing. Give me your address, and I'll deliver the flowers tonight."

Joyce's face lit up with delight. "I'll wait downstairs, no matter how late it gets."
That evening, the cleaner lingered until the last employee had left the Elite Lux building. Concealing the flowers within a garbage cart, she maneuvered it past the security guards, slipping out unnoticed.

Joyce could hardly believe her luck.

She had actually managed to get her hands on the flowers that Cedric had carefully chosen himself.

Tears welled in Joyce's eyes as she cradled the flowers. It felt like she had spent her whole life chasing an unattainable dream. But now, at last, it was within her grasp.

Overcome with joy, Joyce sent the cleaner an extra fifty thousand before carrying the flowers home, her heart overflowing with satisfaction.

When Alexander saw Joyce walk in, cradling the flowers, he strode towards her, but she dismissed him,not even bothering to look up.

"I'm not spending the night with you. I have things to take care of. Now leave and don't forget to close the door behind you."

Alexander stood at the foot of the stairs, his expression unreadable as his gaze lingered on her in silence. He had come to remind Joyce of her promise, to transfer the Fairburne Group shares after Doug's death.

But it was clear she had completely forgotten. Joyce's excited voice echoed through the halls, brimming with delight.

"I got some flowers! Find someone who knows plants and send them to my house immediately!" Her voice overflowed with excitement.

Alexander's gaze darkened, his eyes turning cold and unreadable.

The next day, when Alexander came, he found Joyce still doting over the flowers.

"You're overwatering them. If you're not careful, you'll kill them," Alexander said flatly, putting deliberate weight on the word "kill."

Joyce was so engrossed in tending to the flowers she failed to notice it.

Alexander's voice grew even colder. "You promised a cut of the shares of Fairburne Group.. When do you plan to transfer them?"

Joyce chuckled, her gaze never straying from the flower. "Alexander, do you really think owning those shares will make Daniela see you any differently? You're insignificant compared to Cedric. What makes you think she'll ever love you again? All this effort you're putting is nothing but a futile game. Even if I handed you every last share, it wouldn't change a thing. Daniela will never love you again. It's time you accept the truth,Alexander."

Alexander's eyes darkened as he stared at Joyce.

A dagger slipped from coat sleeve, settling effortlessly into his palm.

His voice dropped to a chilling whisper. "How will I know if I don't try?"

Daniela had once loved him wholeheartedly, and he refused to believe she could now be so utterly heartless.
###Chapter 508 A Hit Order In The Criminal Underworld


The next day, as soon as Daniela stepped into her office,she immediately noticed something was off-the flowers Cedric had bought for her were gone.

Without hesitation, she called Lillian inside.

Lillian's brows furrowed. "Huh? But they were still here when we left last night. Let me check with the cleaning lady."

She hurried off to investigate, but when she asked around, the administration department delivered unexpected news-the cleaning lady had abruptly resigned, even refusing her half-month's salary.

That was strange.

Lillian quickly checked the surveillance footage and discovered the woman sneaking out of Daniela's office,clutching a large garbage sack.

"What would she want with the flowers?" Lillian asked in confusion.

Daniela sat motionless in her chair, the warmth in her expression replaced by an icy chill.

"I'm afraid it's not the flowers she's after, but the person."

Just as Lillian was about to ask what she meant, Cedric suddenly pushed the door open, carrying a fresh bunch of flowers.

"Where are the flowers from yesterday?" He glanced around, looking for them.

Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile. "The cleaning lady knocked them over this morning and took them out."

Cedric nodded in understanding."Okay."

He got to work arranging the new branch. Lillian leaned in and murmured under her breath, "Joyce?"

Daniela gave a firm nod."Yes."

Her tone remained steady as she instructed, "Keep a close watch on Joyce."

Just as the words left her lips, a knock sounded at the office door.

Richard stepped inside.

He looked noticeably older than before.

Worry had etched deep lines into his face, and with Alexander stilI missing, the weight of his troubles had only grown heavier.

The Bennett family had crumbled into bankruptcy, leaving Richard with just one last hope-Alexander.

"Daniela, I hate to trouble you, but have you heard anything about Alexander?" His voice carried a desperate edge.

Daniela studied him for a moment, her gaze settling on the gray streaks now threading through his hair.Then, in an even tone, she said, "Someone's seen him."

Richard's eyes lit up instantly. "Please... if you find anything,let me know."

Daniela gave a small nod of acknowledgment. Grateful, Richard bowed several times before making his way to the door.

He turned back for one last look at Daniela.

She had grown even more like Brylee-her face bright, her presence effortlessly radiant.

If only she were still his daughter-in-law.

If that were the case, Bennett Group wouldn't have collapsed.

Alexander wouldn't have vanished.

None of those terrible mistakes would have ever happened. If only life had a reset button...

But it didn't.

With that heavy truth weighing on him, Richard walked away in silence.

Suddenly, a strong hand yanked Richard around a corner.

Panic surged through him, and he nearly let out a scream-until he caught sight of the person gripping his arm. His eyes narrowed in disbelief.

"Cedric?".Confusion flickered across Richard's face. "What the hell are you doing? And why are you dressed like this?"

Cedric was nothing like before. On TV, he always dressed in a dignified suit, with a cold face that warned strangers to stay away.

But the man standing before him was dressed in black, with a hoodie pulled over his head and a baseball cap on top.

His face was deeply hidden under the brim.

If they weren't standing so close, Richard wouldn't have even known it was him.

"Take this money. Use it however you want." "Cedric" shoved a check for a million dollars into Richard's hand, his voice low and firm. "And forget you ever saw me."

Richard froze, staring at the check in stunned silence. "Why are you giving me money?"

"Cedric" turned to leave, but Richard grabbed his wrist. "If you don't explain, I'm not taking a cent."

Richard tried to shove the money into his hands. In the struggle, he caught sight of the birthmark behind the other man's ear.

"Alexander?" Richard's breath hitched as his eyes widened in sheer shock. He gripped the man's arm even harder,his voice cracking with raw disbelief."Alexander, is that you?"

At the sound of his name, Alexander's steps faltered. Richard's entire body shook, his breath coming in shallow gasps. His fingers twitched at his sides, barely able to grasp the reality before him.

"Is it really you? What happened to you? Have you been suffering all this time?"

Alexander hesitated, then slowly reached up and pulled off his cap. The dim light revealed his face--identical to Cedric's.

"Dad, trust me. I'll turn everything around. I made mistakes with Daniela before, but once I have wealth beyond measure, I'll repay her a thousand times over. For now,take this. It won't be long before | corne home for good."

Richard's eyes burned red. He nodded repeatedly, his grip tightening around the check. "Alrighnt.I will wait for you.You and Daniela will come home together, and we'll finally live like a family again."

Alexander pulled his cap back on and slipped into the shadows, vanishing without a trace.

When he returned, Joyce was still seated, absentmindedly toying with the flowers.

"Just ignore the flowers, Joyce. Isn't Cedric the one you really want?" I've thought of a way."

Joyce didn't bite immediately. She merely twirled a petal between her fingers, watching it as if deep in thought. There was no rush. Daniela had three days to consider the partnership. A deal that profitable-she wouldn't refuse.

Once it was set in motion, she would have all the time in the world to be by Cedric's side.

Love cultivated under the right circumstances would last. That was her belief.

Now that there was no marriage to bind her, she had every opportunity to make him hers.

Alexander studied her coldly, seeing right through her schemes. "Men are easily enamored before marriage.Even after marriage, some still stray. But if a child is involved, that changes everything."

He leaned back against the sofa, his gaze sharp. "People have been saying Daniela and Cedric were planning for a baby. Who knows? Maybe she's already carrying his child." Joyce's fingers stiffened against the petals. Then, her eyes turned cold, filled with malice. "What was the plan you just mentioned?"

Daniela rested her chin on her palm, her gaze lingering on Cedric as he arranged the flowers.

Suddenly, her phone on the desk vibrated violently.

She reached for it without much thought, answering casually.

Russell's voice came through, tight with urgency. "Daniela, someone put out a hit in the underground network. Ten billion dollars-for Cedric."
###Chapter 509 The Most Considerate And Gentle


Daniela's expression turned grave in an instant.

Cedric turned his head and saw the solemn look on Daniela's face.

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice low with concern.

Daniela slowly lifted her head, a faint smile curving at the corners of her lips. "Nothing. Just go ahead."

Cedric wasn't convinced. He was about to say that Daniela looked unwell, when the office door suddenly burst open.

Lillian rushed in, panting, her phone clutched tightly in herhand.

She froze for a split second when her gaze landed on Cedric.

Still holding the scissors, Cedric straightened, eyeing Lillian in confusion.

Lillian pressed her lips together before blurting out an excuse. "Daniela, Ryan is bullying me."

Daniela gave a brief nod. "I'll take care of him."

Without another word,Lillian turned and backed out of the office.

Daniela sat still for a moment before reaching for her water glass. Cedric watched her and immediately moved to help. "I'll get the water for you."

Daniela pointed to the flower instead. "That needs trimming."

Cedric followed her gaze, then picked up the scissors and resumed cutting.

Lillian was already waiting just outside the door. "Daniela, have you seen the underworld bounty?" she asked in a hushed tone.

Daniela's gaze turned sharp, ice-cold and laced with deadly intent. "I saw it." "Who the hell would do something this insane? An underworld bounty isn't just some petty hit. The base price alone is over ten billion, enough to mobilize every mercenary out there. And all of this-just to capture Cedric? That's completely insane!"

Daniela's eyes remained as cold as steel.

"Should we tell Cedric?" Lillian hesitated, then quickly shook her head.′′NO′, never mind. If he finds out,he'l probably freak out! He's just a regular businessman. And if he starts asking questions, your identity as a mafia boss won't stay hidden for long."

Daniela glanced through the gap at Cedric, who was unaware of the storm brewing around him. For once,there was a rare sense of tranquility.

"It's unnecessary," Daniela said firmly."Spread the word-Cedric is under my protection. Anyone who dares touch him is declaring war against me."

Lillian grinned and shot her a thumbs-up. "Got it."

Inside the office, Cedric's phone buzzed nonstop. He picked up.

"Cedric, you've been issued an underworld bounty." The voice on the other end was frantic. "Who's the lunatic behind this? You're leader of the Lone Wolf, for God's sake. That's unheard of! Cedric, I've already called back all our men to protect you. You have no idea what kind of reputation you've built."

Cedric listened, unsure if the caller was panicked or secretly thrilled.

"Cedric, should we let Daniela know someone just slapped a massive price on your head?"

Cedric frowned. "No need;" he said impatiently.

Lately, he had been trying to find time to focus on having a baby with Daniela. She was always busy, and now,with this chaos looming over them, telling her would only make things worse.

If she found out, she'd be too stressed to even think about starting a family.

"Cedric, I don't know, but Daniela doesn't strike me as the type to scare easily." The man on the other end couldn't explain why he felt that way-it was just a gut instincf.

"What do you know?" Cedric snapped. "She lost her mother young and had no one to rely on but herself.She had to become strong and independent, but that wasn't who she was meant to be. She used to be the sweetest, most gentle girl. Life forced her to be tough, but that doesn't mean she wanted to be. No woman wants to shoulder everything alone. Deep down, they all want to be protected. No mafter how strong she looks, she still gets scared. If she finds out about this, she might not sleep for days. She's just a businesswoman, brilliant in the corporate world, but she's never dealt with something like this. Who knows how terrified she'd be?"

Cedric's expression darkened. "I'm heading back to Phillips Group. I need to get to the bottom of this. I want to see who's willing to spend that much money to take me down."

The man chuckled. "Cedric, you do remember your wife is the richest person in the world, right? You don't reach that level without having nerves of steel."

Cedric clicked his tongue. "You don't get it. My girl is the most considerate, the gentlest-sweet as a bunny.You wouldn't understand."

There was a long silence on the other end.

A bunny?

"Cedric, I swear, you're beyond saving.Between the two of you, I think you're the real sweet little thing."

Cedric laughed. "Get lost!"

When Daniela returned with her glass of water, Cedric looked up."Phillips Group has an urgent situation.I need to head back and take care of it. I'll be gone for a few days."

Daniela nodded slightly."Alright. Have your secretary prepare an office for me at Phillips Group. I can work from anywhere."

Cedric hesitated."What?"

Daniela took a sip of water, her lips curving into a smile. "What? You don't want me there?" Cedric nodded."◯f course, I'd love to have you there. But didn't you say before that you didn't want to disturb mne at Phillips Group?"
Daniela tilted her head slightly, as if she were ringing a bell. "Did I? Later, I thought about it and realized that as a couple, we shouldn't keep our distance. There's no reason to worry about getting in each other's way."

Cedric had no argument against that. Since Daniela had made up her mind, there was nothing more to say.

And so, she accompanied him to Phillips Group.

The journey, however, was anything but smooth.

Their brakes failed. A tire blew out. As they neared Phillips Group, unidentified objects came crashing down from above.

Cedric kept his gaze on the road, but he stole a glance at Daniela and asked gently, "Honey,are you alright?Are you scared?"

Daniela blinked."Oh,absolutely.I'm terrified."

Cedric's heart tightened. Without hesitation, he guided her inside Phillips Group.

Just as they stepped through the doors, Daniela's pitiful expression hardened. Her gaze flicked to a shadowy corner across the street-sharp, calculating, and lethal.
###Chapter 510 Would You Support Me Financially

The underground bounty order left no room for doubt.

Mercenaries from every corner of the world, regardless of their allegiance, could claim the staggering reward-so long as they completed the mission.

Once issued, the bounty could never be revoked.

For mercenaries, fear was a foreign concept. They lived on the edge, gambling their lives for money.

Cedric sat in his office, eyes flicking to the clock with a furrowed brow.

It was already noon.

Apart from some minor accidents that morning, the day had been unsettlingly quiet.

That was unusual.

His phone, resting on his desk, suddenly vibrated with relentless urgency.

Cedric silenced the call and typed out a message instead.

"What's up? Mywife's in my office, so I can't talk. Just text me."

The moment he hit send, the person on the other end lost all restraint.

One voice message came through. Then another.And another. Each one over a minute long.

Cedric glanced at Daniela, who was lounging on the sofa, lazily scrolling through her phone.

He plugged in his headphones and played the messages.

"Oh my God! Cedric, do you have any idea what just happened? We went all out this morning-fully armed,ready to put our lives on the line to protect you and your wife. But guess what? Do you even know what happened? You wouldn't believe it! Cealmaur-the elite mercenary group-is protecting you. I swear,I    thought I was hallucinating. And you know who I saw? Shadow. Right before that whole falling object incident, I actually saw her in person. Cedric, is there something you're not telling us? Do you have some kind of insane, hidden background we don't know about?"

"Shadow. It was really her. And here you are, just sitting in your office, while outside, those bounty-crazed maniacs have already tried and failed hundreds of times. And us? We just stood there and watched. Do you have any idea how incredible Shadow is? She took on an entire army single-handedly! That spinning kick-perfect.Her chokehold-flawless. She was like a ghost, taking them down before they even saw her coming.It was insane! Cedric, be honest-if I begged to join Cealmaur as their janitor, do you think they'd let me?|swear, I'm top-tier when it comes to cleaning bathrooms."

Cedric shut his eyes briefly, already regretting listening this long.

His subordinate had zero ambition.

The voice messages kept rolling in.

He glanced at Daniela again. She was still sprawled on the sofa, completely absorbed in her phone. Gunfire and explosions crackled from the speakers.

He noticed Daniela seemed to have a particular fondness for shooting games.
His subordinate's voice came through again."Cedric, you're a genius. You knew those mercenaries would stop at nothing to get to you, so you hired Cealmaur ahead of time. That's some next-level planning."

Cedric typed back. "No. I didn't hire them."

A second later, his screen flooded with a stream of question marks.

"Then explain why Shadow is here. And more than that-I heard Cealmaur's leader, Clarinda, just publicly announced that you're under her protection. Clarinda never gets involved in bounty orders. She only takes paid assignments. For her to make a statement like that... Cedric, don't even try to tell me there's no story behind this, because I won't buy it."

Cedric looked completely dumbfounded. "Who did you just say is protecting me?" "Clarinda. The boss of Cealmaur."

Cedric stared at his screen, speechless.

"No way! Cedric, don't tell me you seriously had no idea!"

"None at all." Cedric had always disliked the ruthless, bloodstained world of mercenaries. After inheriting Lone Wolf from the previous leader, he had barely touched its operations, steering the group towards legitimate business instead.

When he heard about the underground bounty order, his first instinct had been to resolve it the easy way-by throwing money at the problem.

But for Clarinda to personally declare her protection over him? It was beyond ridiculous.

"Clarinda is a woman. You're a good-looking guy. Maybe she's got a thing for you?"

Cedric let a beat of silence pass before replying evenly, "I'm married. In this lifetime, there's only one woman for me. No matter how impressive Clarinda might be, I'd never be interested in anyone but my wife Now, stop wasting timne and figure out what's going on. Also, check Cealmaur's protection fees. I'll pay them the market rate."

There was a brief hesitation on the other end. "Shadow's rate alone is already insane. And this time, it's not just her. Apparently, their entire base has mobilized. Every single one of them is worth a fortune. If you're paying market rates, you might want to prepare for bankruptcy."

Cedric was too stunned to evenrespond.

Letting out a deep sigh, he turned to Daniela with a wistful expression. "Honey."

Still absorbed in her game, Daniela barely reacted."Hmm?"

"I have an idea," Cedric said, his voice suddenly serious.

"Goon,′′she muttered, her focus still locked on her screen.

Cedric studied her features before murmuring, "If I went bankrupt, would you support me financially? Work is exhausting. I want to retire early and finally see what it's like to be spoiled for once."
###Chapter 511 Watching So Closely


Cedric's secretary entered with a tray of fruit.

As soon as he stepped in, he caught the word "bankruptcy" and nearly dropped the tray.

"Bankruptcy?" He snapped his head towards Daniela in alarm.′′Ms. Harper, does Elite Lux's secretary department happen to need a capable male secretary?"

Daniela let out a small, amused smile
The secretary,however,remained completely serious, his expression almost reverent. "I mean it.I've wanted to join Elite Lux for the longest time. If Phillips Group actually went under, would you consider taking me in?"

Cedric turned to glare at the secretary he had worked with for years, his gaze sharp and unreadable.

Without a word, he strode past him and headed straight for Daniela.

Lowering himself onto the seat beside her, Cedric softened his tone. "I can cook, clean, and even keep the bed warm. I don't cost much either-just enough to make ends meet."

The secretary stood there in stunned silence.

Just enough to make ends meet?

That wouldn't do.

He wanted wealth.

Realizing he had already lost this battle, the secretary sulked in defeat while Cedric threw Daniela a victorious smirk.

Daniela simply smiled back.

She agreed immediately, hoping Cedric would always be as carefree and lighthearted as he was in that moment. At noon, Cedric had the secretary bring lunch to the office.

He told Daniela, "I have a client meeting at noon. After lunch, you can rest in the lounge."

Daniela gave a small nod of agreement,and Cedric left.

As he made his way to the second-floor canteen, he glanced out the window.

The traffic below moved smoothly, thestreets appearing peaceful, but Cedric knew better. Beneath that calm surface, unseen threats lurked.

He pulled out his phone and called his subordinate, Rex Patel. "What's the situation now?"

Rex chuckled. "Situation? What situation? Shadow's already handled it. There's nothing she can't take care of. But I heard the leader of Extinction has his sights set on you. Better watch your back."

Extinction was a fast-rising gang-ruthless, merciless, and bound by no code. They would do anything for the right price.

Lately, word had spread that their leader had ambitions of becoming the new underworld overlord, wiping out several major organizations to clear his path.

They had never crossed paths with Cealmaur before, but this time, things felt different.

"I heard their leader publicly challenged Clarinda to a one-on-one fight. No word yet on how Cealmaur's responding," Rex added.

Cedric's eyes darkened. "Find out more about Clarida's and Shadow's market prices."

Whatever the circumstances, they had been dragged into this because of him. It was only right that he paid them accordingly.

Rex hesitated. "Cedric, Shadow might have a price, but Clarinda... If you want her market rate, well, let's just say it might cost you your entire fortune."

Everyone knew that Cealmaur's leader wasn't a legend for nothing.

When Cealmaur first emerged, they took the mercenary world by storm with only two people-the leader and Shadow. Even when multiple rival gangs banded together to crush them, they failed spectacularly.

That battle wiped out their enemies and reshaped the entire criminal underworld, sending shockwaves through every faction.

Since then, no one had dared to challenge the authority of Cealmaur.

Even Shadow had vanished for years.

"Cedric, level with me. Do you know Cealmaur's leader? Otherwise, why would she be stepping in because of you?"

Cedric narrowed his eyes.

No matter how hard he searched his memory, he couldn't recall any connection between himself and Clarinda.

But one thing was certain-he hated owing anyone.

Daniela woke from her nap to a message from Lillian lighting up her phone screen.

She glanced at it, then headed to the bathroom to freshen up.

After splashing cold water on her face, she tied her hair into a neat ponytail.

Stepping out of Cedric's lounge, she found him at his desk, punching numbers into a calculator.

"What are you working on?" she asked, approaching him.

Cedric muttered, "I need to keep a small company intact for a future comeback and liquidate the rest." He pressed the intercom and said, "Have the finance department calculate the full value of Phillips Group's assets."

After ending the call, his expression remained a mix of seriousness and ease, as if he had already accepted the weight of the decision. Yet, beneath it all, there was something unreadable in his gaze.

"Honey, I'm deep in debt and need to pay it off in cash. You okay with that?" Daniela responded without hesitation, "Of course."

The secretary standing nearby swallowed hard.

Could this couple stop talking about billion-dollar assets like they were discussing the weather?

Unbothered,Daniela resumed playing her video game.

Cedric mentioned he had a meeting in the conference room.

Daniela gave a small nod, and once he left, she finished her game, stretched her neck, and told the secretary, "I'm heading downstairs for a walk."

The secretary's eyes lit up. "Would you like me to accompany you?"

Daniela shook her head. "I'm just taking a quick tour of the departments. No need to tag along."

The secretary's excitement deflated instantly.

Half an hour later, Cedric wrapped up his meeting.

A wave of regret hit him-he should have kept Daniela close. It was too dangerous these days.

When he returned to his office and saw it empty, his pulse skyrocketed."Where's my wife?"

His secretary bolted out of the department, pointing to the lower floors. "She said she was touring the departments downstairs."

Cedric's expression darkened. Without another word, he rushed into the elevator.

The secretary stood frozen. "What's wrong with Mr. Phillips? I've never seen him this rattled. His wife is just walking around the company, not leaving the building. What's he so worked up about?"

What possible danger could there be in Cedric's own company?
###Chapter 512 Clarinda


Cedric was frantic.

At first, he couldn't locate Daniela until his secretary indicated towards the meeting room. "She's over here!"Cedric hurried to the room and found Daniela comfortably nestled in the office armchair, bathed in sunlight while she napped.

As the noise of his approach disturbed her, Daniela's eyes fluttered open, and she greeted Cedric with a smile, "Why the hurry? | was just taking a nap."

With a great sense of relief, Cedric embraced Daniela tightly. "You had me worried."

Daniela responded by patting Cedric's back lightly and laughed. "Scared? Don't be. I'm here, all safe."

Throughout their walk to the office, Cedric gripped Daniela's hand firmly.

Observing them, the secretary believed in love again.

Once back, Cedric only relaxed after he sat watching Daniela for some time.

Daniela had felt unusually tired these past days, and upon reaching the office, she immediately took to the sofa for a sleep.

Cedric stole glances at her repeatedly before he finally diverted his attention to his phone.

He had received many voice messages from Rex.

Choosing not to use headphones this time, Cedric converted the audio messages into text to read them.

"Wow,Cedric! You won't believe what happened! Down in the alley on Old Street, the leader of Extinction was gotten rid of. It took me by surprise. Guess who I saw? Clarinda! She was decked out in all black: a loose hoodie, a baseball cap, skinny jeans, and a mask. When she first showed up, she seemed like any other young woman with her hair in a high ponytail. She moved in silence, and before | fully realized what was happening, it was all over. The encounter was just a blur of swift actions."

Cedric raised an eyebrow at the message."The Old Street?"

"Yes, that's right! The Old Street, just opposite Phillips Group. Quite the coincidence, huh? I meant to message you, but everything happened so quickly. They neutralized the leader of Extinction before | could even reach for my phone. Following this incident, it's obvious to everyone that Clarinda has got your back.Who would dare to touch you now?"

Cedric paused for a moment before he asked,"Can you get in touch with Shadow? I'd like to see her personally tonight."

Rex responded, "I'll see what I can do."

Cedric was confused.Had they become that close?

Minutes later, Rex messaged again. "Shadow's on her way up to see you now."

Cedric's confusion deepened.

With a chuckle, Rex added, "I'm coming up as well. I want to say hello to your wife."

Shortly after, the door to Cedric's office opened.

A tall woman clad in black entered Cedric's office.

Cedric glanced at Daniela, who was still sleeping, and signaled for Shadow to speak on the other side of the room.

It might have been his imagination, but Cedric thòught Shadow's eyes lingered on Daniela a moment longer as she walked past.

Cedric frowned, and Shadow stepped closer.

"Why are you looking out for me?" Cedric asked.

Shadow folded her arms, her voice calm and detached. "Our boss just told me to stretch my legs."
Cedric was skeptical of her response but chose not to challenge her. "I'm willing to pay for protecti on at the going rate."

Shadow gave a nod and said, "Alright, but I'm not the one to set the price. You'll need to discuss that with our boss."

Cedric didn't beat around the bush. "When can I meet your boss?"

Once more,Cedric noticed Shadow's gaze drifting towards Daniela.

Cedric positioned himself to obstruct Shadow's view.

With a slight smirk, Shadow said, "Relax. I was merely appreciating your wife's beauty. Nothing more. Our boss will meet with you whenever she decides."

With those words, Shadow gestured with her hand and exited the office.

As she walked past Daniela, she crisply announced, "I'm heading out."

Cedric and Rex observed as Shadow stepped into the stairwell and quickly blended into the shadows.

Rex turned from the now empty stairwell to where Daniela lay asleep on the sofa.

He quietly said to Cedric, "Cedric, why is your wife still sleeping at this hour?"

They came and went, and she remained undisturbed.

Rex wondered if his boss had married a lazy woman.

She was undeniably attractive, though her apparent lethargy was less appealig.

"Hmm," Cedric responded, gazing at Daniela with fondness. "She just went for a quick walk downstairs and it wore her out."

Rex offered a strained smile. Tired of just a brief walk? On the other hand, Clarinda had just been involved in a significant altercation.

"Alright, Cedric. I need to get going." Before leaving, Rex took another look at Daniela.

Despite himself, he felt a strange resemblance between Daniela's figure and Clarinda's.

It had to be his imagination.

After all, Daniela had become fatigued merely from a brief walk downstairs.
###Chapter 513 I'll Catch The Real Culprit Myself


As Rex was on his way out, something caught his eye.

He spotted Daniela's hair ribbon just as the elevator doors were beginning to close.

"Cedric!" Rex hastily pressed the button to reopen the elevator doors. "Your wife..."

Could she actually be the leader of Cealmaur?

This idea flickered through his mind but Rex quickly shook it off.

How could it be possible?

That woman led Cealmaur. It was inconceivable that she would appear in Cedric's office, let alone be his wife.

Rex scratched his head, entered the elevator, and departed.

Three days later, Joyce visited Phillips Group to meet with Daniela about a potential collaboration.

It was her first visit to Cedric's office.

Her heart raced with excitement, yet she maintaineda calm demeanor. "Daniela, I've brought the contract.Please sign it."

Daniela declined.

Joyce's expression darkened. "What do you mean? Are you turning down easy money? Daniela, what's holding you back?"

Daniela wasn't scared of anything. She simply didn't have the time recently.

Joyce tightened her lips and turned to Cedric. "What about you? Don't miss this golden opportunity."

Cedric also showed no interest. For him, nothing was currently more crucial than their plans to have a baby. Visibly annoyed, Joyce scowled. As she walked out, she said sharply, "Turning down easy money? I wonder how long you can maintain this pretense of nobility."

Joyce stormed down to the parking lot.

Once inside the car, she fixed a cold stare on Alexander, who occupied the passenger seat. "Didn't you claim that the so-called bounty order would ensure my desires were fulfilled? I just visited them, and Cedric is unharmed."

Alexander also found this puzzling. He had relied on insider information that boasted of the bounty order's flawless track record.

Considering Cedric was merely a businessman, lacking any form of protection, his evasion was puzzling.Now, the intermediary Alexander had used was nowhere to be found.

This situation left him with a bad feeling.

Alexander had initially planned to take out Cedric first, then get rid of Joyce, clearing his path to Daniela.

However, it appeared his strategy required some revisions.

Upon her return home, Daniela was met by Lillian with unexpected news. "Joyce has disappeared."

Daniela looked at Lillian. "Are you sure? She was in my office earlier today."

Lillian confirmed with a nod and showed Daniela a video.

The surveillance footage captured Joyce walking through a mall when suddenly, a battered, nondescript van pulled up alongside her. Within moments, she was pulled into the vehicle.

The incident caused panic among the bystanders, who quickly alerted the police.

By the time the police arrived, Joyce was already missing.

Lillian explained, "This appears to be a well-planned abduction. The van managed to evade all cameras while exiting. As of now, there's no sign of Joyce." Daniela's expression turned serious.

There was something particularly strange about this event.

Lillian continued, "Fairburne Group is in chaos. There's widespread speculation about who will inherit Joyce's assets should anything happen to her."

Since Joyce hnad no children and Katrina had passed away, the only remaining relative was Caiden, still officially recorded as family with Joyce.⑤

That indeed was a stroke of luck.

Lillian smiled broadly. "Daniela, given that Caiden is under psychiatric care and you're his only child,you have a legitimate claim to this wealth." Her excitement was evident.

Daniela, however, did not share her excitement. "If someone orchestrated this entire situation, do you really think they'd simply allow Caiden or me to inherit everything without a challenge? Just wait. The person responsible will show themselves eventually."

Daniela's insight was remarkably accurate.

Later that day, Fairburne Group convened an urgent press conference.

A mysterious figure, dressed in a black suit and masked, declared on camera that he would act as the interim chairman of Fairburne Group during Joyce's absence. He added that should Joyce be officially declared deceased, he would legally inherit all her assets.

This announcement stunned the public, who began to speculate about the masked man's identity.

Watching the broadcast, Daniela focused intently on the man's eyes visible behind the large mask. They looked remarkably like Cedric's.

She was not alone in her observation.

Others also made the connection, comparing photos of Cedric.

Before long, rumors circulated that Cedric had inherited Joyce's vast fortune. Resourceful Individuals even uncovered video footage of Joyce at Philips Group merely an hour before she vanished.

As a result, # sparked widespread speculation that Cedric was, in fact, the new chairman of Falrburne Group.

Public curiosity envisioned a dramatic love triangle and an intense battle for power.

However,following the press conference, the interim chairman withdrew from public view.

This absence only intensified the rumors, leading people to conclude that Cedric had to step back from public appearances as he could not juggle two roles.

Cedric scowled as he read the flood of congratulatory texts on his phone from business contacts. For a moment, he was at a loss for words.

Seeing Cedric's puzzled look, Daniela chuckled lighntly.

She reached out and gently patted his back as if comforting a puppy. "I know you're not responsible.Pl catch that person myself."
###Chapter 514 Trying To Get Back On Daniela's Good Side


As newfound wealth began to circulate, previously unattainable possibilities started to unfold.

Alexander meticulously erased every shred of evidence linking him to his cosmetic surgery.

He then declared that Fairburne Group's vast resources would be rechanneled to support Bennett Group.

Bennett Group, once teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, miraculously rebounded with the vigor of a phoenix ascending from its ashes. It soon became the crown jewel of Olisvine's business sphere.

Given the lucrative nature of the mining sector, it was a genuine fortune chest, promising colossal profits.

Who, after all, could resist such a lucrative opportunity?

Richard,having endured years of scorn and humiliation, savored his long-awaited return to prominence.

His eyes sparkled with unshed tears as he settled all of Bennett Group's debts, reclaimed the once-lost villa,and slipped back into his refined suits, restoring his status among the elite.

Though Richard's haughty demeanor made a comeback, he maintained a courteous front around Daniela.

One afternoon, their paths crossed in a bustling shopping mall.

Spotting her from afar, he approached with a warm, inviting smile. "Daniela, it's been ages! If you're not too busy, perhaps you could come over for a chat?"

As Daniela strode away, Richard remained motionless, his gaze lingering on her with the warmth typically reserved for a father observing his son's wife.

It wasn't solely Alexander who harbored regrets about their shared history. Richard too lamented his prior missteps with a heavy heart.
Daniela had been a remarkable daughter-in-law, and their loss was due to their own misjudgments,Resolute in his determination, he vowed to value her presence if the opportunity for reconciliation ever arose. Moreover, Richard took deliberate steps to shield Daniela from any disparagement, making sure no one dared to speak ill of her.

One of his friends, picking up on his protective stance, joked, "Richard, what's gotten into you? Trying to get back on Daniela's good side, are you?"

With a chuckle, Richard replied, "Daniela's a good girl and once my daughter-in-law. Now, with Bennett Group flourishing, it's hardly about getting back into favor. Times have changed, love is liberated, and modern relationships are fluid. Daniela held a deep affection for my son. If there's a path to them coming together again, it wouldn't be odd. She was once part of my family, and in my eyes, she always will be."

His words blended defensé, pride, and a renewed authenticity.

His friends exchanged uncertain looks, wondering if Richard's comments were heartfelt or merely for appearances.

Could Daniela truly have a change of heart?

Would she remarry Alexander?

Indeed,Daniela had once harbored affection for Alexander. Who could claim to understand the whims of a young woman?

Because of this, the Bennett family began to garner newfound respect.

Several key clients, motivated by regard for Daniela, proposed exceptionally advantageous partnerships with Bennett Group.

Elated, Richard phoned Alexander to relay the joyous developments.

Yet Alexander's response was devoid of enthusiasm. Instead, he responded,"Dad, don't push too hard.Daniela treasures her privacy. If she learns of this, it won't sit well with her. And regarding those who seek partnerships because of her influence, we should decline them."

Richard paused, torn between the allure of profitable deals and therisk of displeasing Daniela.

But his priority was clear-he could not bear the thought of causing her distress. Recognizing the vital role of patience, he consented and commenced a meticulous search for suitable collaborators.

This decision only stoked the fires of rumor. The people grew increasingly convinced that Daniela had indeed reconciled with the Bennett family. After all, why else would they have spurned such lucrative offers?

Consequently,proposals for partnerships flooded in, one after the other.

Within a brief period, Bennett Group evolved from a struggling entity into one of the nation's most distinguished enterprises.

Nevertheless, the public's curiosity remained piqued. Why had Alexander kept such a low profile for so long?

His knack for business was indisputable. Under his stewardship, Fairburne Group had soared, securing its position as a frontrunner in the industry.

Previously,Doug had been too engrossed in his indulgences to helm the business effectively, while Joyce simply lacked the necessary acumen.

Thus, when Fairburne Group published its latest quarterly report, it quelled any skepticism regarding Alexander's prowess.

With the internal machinery running smoothly, Alexander organized a charity auction and extended an invite to Daniela.

Meanwhile, behind the curtains, he masterminded a delay for Cedric's car, guaranteeing his late arrival at the event.

Lurking in the shadows, Alexander observed Daniela's face, his fists slowly unclenching after being tightly bound in tension.

At that instant, a wave of satisfaction washed over him, confirming that his efforts had indeed paid off.

Silently, he trailed her, choosing not to reveal himself. Instead, he settled into a seat just behind her, his eyes locked onto her with a fervor that teetered on the edge of fixation. Every time Daniela lifted her paddle only to lose the bid on an item, Alexander stepped in, securing the auction.

The gathered crowd glanced back at the mysterious, masked figure, murmuring to each other in curiosity.

Yet,Daniela remained oblivious to the murmurs, her attention glued to her phone as she texted Cedric. She would occasionally participate in the auction before diving back into her conversation.

From his spot, Alexander caught glimpses of her cheek and the subtle smile playing on her lips.

A smile crept onto his face as well. He was utterly engrossed, following her every action with a fervor that came dangerously close to obsession. To him, it seemed impossible to divert his gaze, even for a fleeting moment.
###Chapter 515 His Surname Was Perry


Alexander was gripped by a profound sense of regret as the charlty auction concluded all too early.

He hadn't spent enough time with Daniela, and just like that, the event was over.

He was left with an aching desire for more.

Compelled by this longing, he trailed after Daniela into the cold evening air.

Daniela was composing a message when a voice, rich and familiar, pierced the silence. "Daniela." It was a voice that echoed with the timbre of Cedric's.

Surprised, she whirled around, her face erupting into a brilliant smile, her eyes dancing like celestial bodies under the grandeur of the street lamps.

Watching her, Alexander's heart warmed. "Daniela." Disguised by his mask, he closed the distance between them.

With a graceful flourish of his hand, he directed the people behind him. "Place these items in Daniela's trunk,please."

Lillian, her brows knitting together in displeasure, sauntered to the car's rear, her fingers deftly popping open the trunk.

Daniela looked at the man standing before her. His eyes were exactly like Cedric's. "Alexander?"

A sharp sting of regret hit Alexander. As her voice called out his name, the radiance of her smile dimmed,slowly replaced by a curtain of cold detachment.

In that instant, Alexander's heart ached with a fervent wish to truly become Cedric.

He longed to be the only Cedric in existence, the one who could draw out Daniela's smile so effortlessly and unguarded. Regrettably, he was not. Alexander pulled off the mask and gazed at Daniela,illuminated by the city's shimmering lights.

"Daniela, I don't need to be Alexander. I can be anyone you want me to be. I would traverse the farthest corners of the earth and do the most daring things if it meant making you happy. Daniela, you can't even imagine the depth of my love for you."

Daniela's eyebrows knitted together, her face shadowing over.

Nearby, Lillian sensed something amiss. The man before them had worn Cedric's features, but an eerie coldness had radiated from him.

"Daniela, don't waste your words on someone like him. Let's leave."

Daniela didn't spare Alexander a second glance as she turned to climb into the car.

Alexander made no move to follow her. Instead, he remained rooted to the spot, his lips curving into a gentle smile as he waved. "Daniela, we'll see each other again very soon."

As the car pulled away, Lillian cast a sidelong glance at Daniela, her voice tinged with disbelief."What is he thinking? Who in their right mind undergoes plastic surgery to resemble Cedric? Is he mentally unstable,or simply out of his mind?"

Daniela remained stoically detached. She harbored no curiosity about Alexander's thoughts or underlying motives. Her heart harbored only two pursuits: seeking justice for her mother and standing by Cedric.

She spared no time for distractions, nor did she have any desire to engage with those who professed their love through bizarre and baffling actions.

Upon returning home, Daniela headed to her study. She retrieved the list Natalie had handed to her earlier.

It was time to confront those individuals.

Elite Lux, renowned for its stable, robust maneuvers in the market, had recently shifted gears. It was now on an aggressive spree, seizing control of well-known domestic companies.

Wasting no time, Phillips Group quickly started to mimic these bold moves. From pharmaceuticals to education, from aviation to private banking, Elite Lux had spread its influence far and wide, leaving no sector untouched.

The immense scale of their acquisitions stirred confusion and unease ämong the masses.

Elite Lux's approach was merciless and unyielding. They gave no quarter, employing monopolistic practices that inevitably led their targets towards financial ruin.

Each acquisition was finalized at the shockingly nominal fee of one single dollar.

The industry was in upheaval, with widespread anxiety about who could be next in line for Elite Lux's aggressive expansions.

In a frenzy, they frantically sought connections and leveraged every possible influence, desperate to understand what had driven Daniela, the CEO of Elite Lux, to such extreme measures.

Some approached Richard, laden with lavish gifts, hoping to glean some understanding through him.

Yet Richard's demeanor remained unaffected; his tone was smooth, his assurance palpable. "Daniela has always possessed a serene disposition. For her to adopt such aggressive strategies, someone must have profoundly provoked her. There's no cause for alarm. If you've conducted your affairs transparently, what reason is there to fear? Daniela isn't one to unjustly direct her frustrations at others. Return to your homes;don't fret over matters that are out of your hands."

Despite his soothing assurances, his visitors departed with lingering concern clearly etched upon their faces. Richard, in contrast, maintained a composed and detached air, seemingly unperturbed.

But then, one unexpected day arrived.

"Mr. Bennett, a gentleman is at the door claiming to be the president of the National Commerce Association.He wishes to speak with you. He introduced himself as Mr.Perry."
###Chapter 516 Hackett Perry


Richard lounged in the warm embrace of the sunlight, his laughter booming out when he heard those words.

Daniela had quite the knack for stirring things up.

Even the president of the National Commerce Association had been alarmed.

The National Commerce Association was a prestigious coalition, voluntarily established by the nation's elite enterprises.

Only companies boasting assets over ten billion dollars could claim membership, and its ranks were composed of the finest and most powerful business giants.

To put it bluntly, anyone from the association was a heavyweight in the business world.

The association served as a powerhouse for these giants, constantly abuzz with the latest and most lucrative market insights. In essence, these were the individuals dominating the market, skimming the cream off the top. By the time they had their fill, even the leftovers were enough to enrich those on the periphery.

Previously, when the Bennett family had been desperate to enter this association, Alexander had leveraged every connection and pulled every possible string, pouring immense resources into the effort.

The reception expenses had run into the tens of millions, yet after all that, the association's president had brushed them off with mere words. "The Bennett family only recently soared past the ten-billion-dollar mark.Who can say whether their fortunes will hold? It's premature to let them into our ranks so readily. Is the National Commerce Association some sort of club you can simply buy your way into?"

The association then refunded the membership fee Alexander had paid.

Following this incident, Bennett Group was the butt of every joke in the industry for the better part of a year.

Now, the president of the association making a personal visit surely had to be linked to Daniela's aggressive acquisitions. Richard quirked an eyebrow, slowly rose from his seat, and took a leisurely stroll through the garden,circling four times. It took him a full half-hour before he meandered back into the villa.

"Ah, Mr. Perry," Richard said, his voice dripping with a theatrically courteous tone as he entered.He flashed a sardonic smile. "This is an unexpected honor! I had almost resigned myself to the idea that we would never see you grace our place in my lifetime."

Previously, Richard had only ever seen Hackett Perry through the filtered lens of the media.

Now,meeting him in person, Richard gave him a quick once-over.

Hackett was on the shorter side, barely scraping five feet three, with a build that spoke of too many lavish dinners. He was clad in a polo shirt that was a tad too snug over his plump belly, his gleaming forehead reflecting the light as he greeted Richard with a broad, beaming smile.

Upon their meeting, Hackett gifted Richard a golf club valued at millions. Ignoring the sarcasm lacing Richard's comments, he flashed a warm smile as he presented a badge denoting membership in the association. "There was just a bit of confusion earlier. Today, I have no agenda other than to resolve our previous misunderstandings. The error was purely on my staff's part, and I'm here personally to set things right. This badge represents the pinnacle of status in our business circle."
Hackett, ever the persuasive speaker, handed over the badge and rose to his feet. "I'll keep my visit short today. But Richard, in a few days, our association will host a gathering. It's essential that you attend."

Before exiting, Hackett passed Richard a list of the gathering's attendees.

"Richard, my friend, here's the list of companies attending the gathering. Have a look, and if there's anyone else you'd like to bing in, just say the word-I'll handle the details."

His smile unwavering, Hackett made his departure. Richard escorted him to the door.

Before Hackett even got in the car, Richard's face contorted with disdain. He spat in the direction of the car,ensuring the sound was loud and clear.

Hackett turned, his smile still intact, and gave Richard a parting wave before sliding into the car. Richard stood there, pondering if Hackett had failed to hear him or if the man was just impossibly composed.

How was Hackett managing to keep it together?

Behind him, a secretary hesitated before voicing her concerns.MIr. Bennett, isn't it unwise to antagonize Mr.Perry in such a manner?"

Richard responded with a sneer, "What's the risk?" He gave a nonchalant glance at the list Hackett had passed to him earlier. "Granted, the names here represent some of the giants of the industry. Yet, that's simply the nature of the business world. When you're ascending, everyone's your ally. They're only showing up now to cling to my success and plead for Daniela's mercy. Otherwise, do you really think they'd spare me a second glance? I haven't lost touch with reality. In this arena, friendships are fleeting, interests are eternal.As long as I'm an asset to them, even a direct insult would be met with a forced smile. Earning money is hard, but swallowing one's pride is even harder. All those high-flying big shots you see are merely puppets dancing in the shadows."

The secretary raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Yet, I've never witnessed Ms. Harper bow to anyone."

Richard's features softened at the mention of Daniela. "That's because Daniela is one of a kind. She's got an innate gift. Ever perceptive since her youth, mirroring her mother's keen intellect. The Bennett family has surmounted myriad upheavals, all thanks to her steadfastness. In the realm of business prowess, she eclipses even Alexander. Were Daniela not a woman, suitors from every corner of the globe would be vying for her attention."

He chuckled heartily, a playful spark in his eyes. "Fortunately for Alexander, she is a woman-his ideal counterpart. Initially, Alexander failed to recognize her worth, but given a second chance, they're destined for a blissful union."

However, the secretary's brow furrowed with skepticism."Considering Ms. Harper is already wed, is it plausible she would forsake Cedric for Alexander?"

Richard replied, "Without a doubt, she will. How long has Daniela been with Cedric? She has known Alexander for ten years. Of course, Alexander suits her better." The secretary harbored a contrary view. He believed that relationships weren't measured by time, but by the depth of understanding between people. Yet, he lacked the courage to voice his disagreement aloud.

Instead, he posed a subtle inquiry. "Mr. Bennett, do you plan to attend the upcoming gathering?"

Richard discarded the association's badge into a drawer. "Naturally, I'll be there. Why would I miss out?It's going to be quite the spectacle seeing those formerly arrogant giants taken down a notch by Daniela's triumph. The mere thought brings a smirk to my face."

Furthermore, the National Commerce Association was a treasure trove of the latest market trends.

Involvement in it was clearly beneficial.

Additionally, with a throng of people keen to ingratiate themselves with him, how could he pass up such a gratifying chance?

Undoubtedly,he was set on going.
###Chapter 517 Force Daniela To Plead With Us


Unbeknownst to Richard, Hackett had stopped by Phillips Group before showing up at his home.

Cedric's secretary, always poised and courteous, had indulged Hackett in an afternoon of coffee.

As Hackett prepared to leave, he left a badge behind.

Upon noticing the badge, the secretary offered a gracious smile. "You're far too generous, Mr. Perry. This is simply too precious for us to keep. I'll make sure to inform Mr. Phillips upon his return."

Hackett's smile remained gentle, radiating a friendly and relaxed demeanor. "Mr. Phillips is truly a standout individual. We've extended an invitation to him to join our association previously, but his schedule has always been too full. I took the opportunity to deliver this in person since I was in the area."

The secretary gave a slight nod. "I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Perry. Should Mr. Phillips find some free time,he will undoubtedly contact you."

As the badge was handed back to him, Hackett's expression shifted subtly, his smile fading into a stern look. "Is this how Phillips Group shows their regard for the president of the National Commerce Association,by denying me even a token of respect?"

The secretary maintained his composure, his hands neatly clasped in front of him, exuding professionalism and courtesy. "How is that possible? You are a figure of national renown. It would displease Mr. Phillips greatly if I were to show you disrespect."

Despite his words, the dismissal was undeniable.

Hackett, clearly annoyed, abruptly exited with a final jab."In the future, let's see if Cedric comes crawling back to me for this privilege."

Upon leaving Phillips Group, Hackett made his way to Elite Lux, but he didn't even manage to enter.

Lillian, far less indulgent than Cedric's secretary, briskly turned him away.′′Ms. Harper is recuperating and is not receiving guests at this time."

The incident unfolded before the eyes of many spectators, causing Hackett's face to cloud over with fury.

Thankfully, Richard granted him entry and even accepted a badge; otherwise, Hackett could have reached his boiling point.

Back at the association, Hackett broke down crying during a meeting.

The members of the association exchanged looks of bewilderment."Is there a problem,Mr.Perry?"

Hackett, with a wave of his hand and a sorrowful shake of his head, let his tears drop onto the surface of the conference table.

"What's occurred? We implore you to tell us!"

Having served as the esteemed president for over twenty years, Hackett was deeply respected within the community.

Throughout his long stewardship, he had only ever encountered two significant crises.

The first involved Brylee. Her resolve was as hard as steel, and her influence in the business world was unyielding.She wielded her authority with a sharp, commanding aura.

In a bid to unify the community, Hackett had once offered her a chance to join the association.

But Brylee had scoffed at the notion. She held a firm belief that business triumphs were earned through personal merit alone-victory was the prize for the powerful, and defeat was the scourge of the weak. Why would bother becoming part of such a′′prretentious" association?

To her, it would be wiser to invest that time and money into something that truly helped people.

Her actions spoke as loudly as her words; She had financed educational programs for children in need,extended suppoort to farmers devastated by locust invasions, and initiated a fund specifically for children suffering from hearing impairments.

During this time, the media lavished endless praise on her. Consequently, many commerce association members started to switch their allegiance. Had Brylee's sudden, premature death not occurred, the association's collapse could have been inevitable.

This marked the first major crisis Hackett encountered.

Over ten years later, Hackett had settled comfortably into his role, enjoying the power and perks that.came with it.

However,Brylee's daughter, Daniela, emerged as a brilliant force, posing a new threat to his authority.

Daniela proved even more daunting than her mother due to her forthright tactics. She had openly declared war.

Several companies under the association's protection had already been cleverly overtaken by her, and there were clear indications that her campaign was far from over.

While outsiders could overlook the strategy, Hackett saw the method in her moves.

Daniela was strategically targeting pivotal enterprises within the association, methodically weakening its structure.

Hackett felt the oppressive threat hanging in the air.
Facing the members, he dabbed at his moist eyes and managed a strained smile. "It's nothing major, really.Just a minor hiccup. We're all esteemed individuals here; let's focus on maintaining peace and harmony."

His vague reassurances only served to stoke the flames of their curiosity.

Hackett, pressing a handkerchief to his eyes once more, conceded, "Alright, alright. I hadn't planned to bring this up, but since you're pressing, I'll share. Just promise not to overreact. It's truly nothing to fret about."

Some members, their patience waning, prodded him further. "Mr. Perry, out with it! You're torturing us with this suspense."

Seizing the momen as the tension peaked, Hackett drew in a theatrical breath.′′We∥,here's the scoop.Elite Lux is flourishing, and I thought, why not extend an invitation for them to join us? Daniela, though young, possesses remarkable talent. So, I paid her a visit. But you won't believe what happened next."

He stretched out his words on purpose, drawing out the suspense.

The members leaned in, brows knitted in concern. "What happened? Come on, tell us."

"Daniela dismissed us outright. She claimed that a titan like Elite Lux wouldn't fit into a petty organization like ours. She went so far as to scoff at our association, saying that even combined, we wouldn't hold a candle to the smallest of Elite Lux's branches. At first, I brushed it off-youthful arrogance, I thought. But then, she crossed a line. She actually spat at me, telling me to grovel if I ever hoped for her to even consider our offer."

The room burst into a chorus of shocked gasps.

Hackett continued, "I even went so far as to offer to resign as president and let her assume the role, hoping it might satisfy her. But do you know what her response was?"

The members' eyes narrowed in anticipation. "What did she say?"

In a tone laden with grievance, Hackett responded, "She dismissed the position outright. Not only that,she proclaimed her intent to methodically take over every company within our association."

At these words, the room devolved into chaos.

"Daniela has become insufferably/ arrogant. What is she implying with this? Does she believe she can just beat us all?"

"Exactly! Her arrogance knows no bounds. We need to stand our ground."

"Absolutely! Isn't her company just another fancy luxury brand? We have suppliers in this association who work with them. Marc, consider halting their supply chain to disrupt their operations and force them to reconsider.Make Daniela plead with you!"
###Chapter 518 Marc Wanted To See Her


The crowd voiced their approval.

"Exactly! Stop supplying Daniela!"

"Let Daniela see what we're made of!"

"Marc, don't worry. We support you!"

Voices overlapped in the room. Yet, Marc Green remained silent in his chair, uttering not a word.

In the harsh world of business, any sign of weakness could provoke an attack. The same friends who supported him today might exploit him if he showed any real vulnerability.

Hackett looked over at Marc, who was quiet, and smiledslightly. "Marc, why so silent? It's not the end of the world. Your business doesn't rely solely on Daniela's orders, right?"

Another man interjected, "Exactly! Our association is strong. If Daniela stops her orders, we'll help you.What do you think?"

"Also, you've always complained about Elite Lux's strict standards. Now's your chance to break away and prove your worth. Isn't this the perfect opportunity?"

"Come on, Marc. Daniela is just a woman. What's there to be afraid of? What can she really do to you? She'll come crawling back for your materials soon."

The group's enthusiasm grew as they spoke louder, their confidence building.

They all were eager to bring Daniela down a notch.。

The idea of a successful company led by a woman seemed to irritate these men.

They were determined to undermine her, asserting that true success was still a man's domain.

Furthermore, they believed the reputation of their trade association shouldn't suffer because of this. Marc remained silent for a long while.

At last, under their intense gazes, he responded in a calm tone, "You can support me now, but can you continue to do so forever?"

Elite Lux was a globally renowned luxury brand.

Although Marc had often complained about their strict quality requirements, the substantial payments they made were beneficial.

The five-year contract with Elite Lux had been reassuring. If Marc terminated it prematurely and Daniela chose another supplier, would he not become merely a tool in their hands?

Hackett observed Marc reflecting, a smirk of ridicule crossing his face briefly.

A second later, he sighed again. "Alright, Marc, I understand. We shouldn't pressure you like this. Let's pretend we never had this discussion."

Hackett's act of swallowing his pride left a faint sense of guilt hanging in the room.

Someone said, "Marc, I hear you have a five-year deal with Daniela. It's just for five years,right? Why don't you show us the contract? Whatever she's buying, we can take it off your hands!"

The suggestion ignited excitement among the crowd.

With some hesitation, Marc took out the contract.

A hush fell over the room as they began to read through it.

Hackett, grinning mischievously, picked up the document. "What's the matter? What's with the silence? Is it such a bigissue? It's only a five-year commitment...".

But as hespoke, his smile gradually disappeared, and his face stiffened.

He could no longer find humor in the situation.

"Marc, are you serious? Is this the volume you supply to Elite Lux?" "Wait, is your entire company dependent on Elite Lux?"

"Is this even real? How are we supposed to handle such a large amount?"

"That's not fair,Marc."

One of the quieter guys exchanged a glance with Hackett, then patted Marc on the shoulder. "Marc, this isn't right. Remember when your daughter was kidnapped abroad? Hackett saved her. Without his help,who knows what might have happened? Now it's time for you to repay him, don't you think?"

Marc's stomach dropped at the memory.

Hackett dismissed it with an air of false humility."Oh,that was nothing significant."

"Nothing?" the other man retorted."Marc1Hackett saved your life. Now he's been offended, and you won't support him? Do you even belong to this association? Look, we're not abandoning you. We'll take twenty percent of the order. You figure out the rest. It'll work itself out, right?"

Before Marc could respond, Hackett stood up. "Thanks, Marc. Don't look so down. Daniela's big orders mean she depends on you, doesn't she? She won't dare upset you. Maybe she'll even beg you later. What do you think?"

Marc responded with a forced,bitter laugh.

Leaving the trade association, he felt an overwhelming weight on his heart.

The underlying message from everyone was clear: they wanted him to test the boundaries.

If he didn't comply, he risked being expelled from the association.

Daniela was reviewing documents in her office when Lillian knocked on the door. "Daniela, Marc is here. He wants to meet with you."
###Chapter 519 You Can Only Blame Yourself For Being Stupid


Daniela nodded.

Soon, Marc stepped into the room, carrying a gift. "Ms. Harper, it's been a while. Just a small token of appreciation."

Daniela barely glanced at the gift. "What do you want?"

Marc knew Daniela had little patience for small talk or needless conversation, which only added to her enigmatic nature. People like her were the hardest to read.

He let out a short, nervous chuckle. "Well, there's something I need to discuss with you."

Daniela nodded again. "Then get to it."

Marc swallowed hard. "The cost of raw materials has risen recently. So, would you consider raising our price?"

Daniela remained calm as she looked at Marc. "We have a contract, don't we?"

Marc nodded quickly. "WVe do. But business has been rough, and I'm in a tight spot. Could you consider a little flexibility, maybe a slight percent increase?"

Lillian rested against the doorframe, her gaze fixed on Marc.

Daniela, however, remained unfazed. "How much are you asking?"

Marc licked his lips nervously. "Just twenty percent." He stole a glance at Daniela, but her expression remained unreadable. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a badge."I'd also like to invite you to join the National Commerce Association. This is the badge."

Daniela glanced at the badge, then met his gaze with a faint smile. "I understand what you're asking."

Marc exhaled in relief, thinking he'd completed his mission. "If you no longer wish to continue our partnership,that's finn1′′Daniela added.

Marc's smile stiffened. "No, no, that's not what I meant," he stammered, panic creeping into his voice."We can renegotiate the price. And as for the association, at least consider joining. We're very sincere about this."

Marc was about to speak again when Daniela slowly lifted her hand.

Marc stood still, frozen.

He had meticulously prepared for this meeting, envisioning countless possible responses from Daniela and crafting the perfect replies for each. But he hadn't anticipated this.

Daniela simply stated, "Our partnership with you ends today. Lillian, please show him out."

Marc's mouth was wide agape. "Ms. Harper, please, listen! I wasn't trying to threaten you! I just wanted to persuade you. The association offers real benefits. Please, give me another chance."

Lillian picked up the phone and called security. She tossed the badge out along with Marc.

Shortly after, Elite Lux's official website announced the termination of its contract with Marc's company.

The news spread fast, shaking the entire association.

Everyone was astonished as no one had expected Daniela to be so ruthless.

A partnership worth billions a year was terminated just like that?

No negotiations, no second chances?

Marc stormed into Hackett's office, fuming. Hackett, however, merely smiled, consoling him. "Relax. Just wait. How long do you think Elite Lux will last without a major supplier like you? Women make impulsive decisions. Give it time. She'll come crawling back."

That very evening,Hackett paid Daniela a visit.

She had just stepped out of her car when he intercepted her. "Daniela, was that necessary? I was an old friend of your mother's. We've known each other for years. Why would you make this unpleasant? I have only one request. Call off your acquisition plans, or at the very least,leave our association members out of it. Let's move forward without bad blood. Otherwise, Marc will be just the first. More companies will walk away, one after another. Elite Lux may be powerful, but it's still finding its footing in the domestic market. Its foundation isn't äs solid as you think. Who will stand by you then? Take my advice, play fair, and the road ahead will be much smoother."

Still smiling, Daniela sidestepped Hackett and walked into the Elite Lux building without a word.

Days slipped by.

Contrary to Hackett's predictions, Elite Lux stood firm. Not only did it maintain its supply chain, but Marc's company was the first to collapse.

Elite Lux's business was vast, and the association members' contributions were nothing more than a drop in the ocean. They couldn't make up for Marc's losses.

Desperate, Marc rushed to Elite Lux, hoping to see Daniela but instead, he found Cedric tending to a row of lush green plants in the hallway.

"Mr. Phillips, please, could you put in a good word for me? Tell Ms. Harper we're willing to stick to the original contract and continue our partnership. We can talk about joining the association later. Please, help me out."

Cedric looked up, mildly surprised. "You're too late."

Marc's stomach twisted. "What do you mean?"

Cedric smiled faintly. "Were you not aware? When Elite Lux entered this market, it had already built its own raw material processing plant."
Marc waved his hands frantically. "That's impossible. I checked! There was no plant. And we signed a non-compete agreement. Elite Lux wasn't allowed to process its own raw materials. Ms. Harper knows that!"
Cedric nodded: "That's true, but Daniela has me. My company never signed a non-compete with you. So,when you terminated your contract with Elite Lux, we stepped in and sealed the deal. You're really out of the loop. It's been days, and you're still living in denial?"

Marc stumbled back a few steps, his eyes wide in disbelief. Without wasting a second, he ordered his team to investigate the company Cedric had mentioned.

Moments later, Marc broke down right then and there.

He collapsed at Daniela's office door, sobbing, "Ms. Harper, please give me another chance! I swear I won't threaten you again! I won't raise prices anymore! I was misled! I can't survive without Elite Lux's orders.Please, I'm begging you!"

But Daniela never showed up.

Marc's company's funds dried up. Investors pulled out one after another.

Five days later, the once-thriving company declared bankruptcy.

Before his bankruptcy was finalized, Marc turned to Hackett, clinging to a last shred of hope for help.
But Hackett merely smiled and said, "There's no room for you in this game anymore. Coming to me won't change that. If you need someone to blame, look in the mirror and blame yourself for being stupid."

That same day, Marc tragically ended his own life by throwing himself off the association's headquarters.He was dead on impact.

Unfazed, Hackett instructed his staff to take care of the matter.

That same day, Daniela continued her expansion, securing another acquisition under the association's umbrella.

The entire association fell into a state of silent, suffocating fear.
###Chapter 520 It Has Nothing To Do With Us


Richard stepped into the gathering, his gaze sweeping over the once-mighty business tycoons, now sitting in silence, their faces etched with an uncharacteristic heaviness.

Settling into a chair, he crossed one leg over the other, his posture dripping with quiet arrogance.

The same men who once swaggered around, barking orders like kings, were now forced to swallow their pride.

His future daughter-in-law had struck with razor-sharp precision.What a remarkable woman!

"Richard, you've made it!" Hackett greeted him with a warm smile, lowering himself into a chair by the coffee table. "You're looking better than ever these days."

Richard let out a light chuckle. "Naturally. Nothing lifts the spirits like watching a grand spectacle unfold."

The meaning behind his words wasn't lost on the others. Their expressions turned grim.

Hackett, however, kept his smile intact. "Indeed, it was quite the display. Daniela has an uncanny decisiveness, and her strategies are nothing short of brilliant."

Hearing Hackett commend Daniela sent a wave of satisfaction through Richard, his chest swelling with pride.

"But..." Hackett's gaze drifted across the room, his smile slowly dimming."Isn't she being a little too high-profile?"

Richard's voice remained calm. "If she's got the talent, why should she have to keep a low profile?"
"Fair enough, but she's been making moves a bit too boldly. At the end of the day, she's still just one woman.No matter how skilled she is, she should be wary of steering straight into a storm, don't you think?"
"Exactly." Someone else let out a chuckle. "No matter how sharp she is, she's still just one person. Richard, I hear there's talk of Daniela possibly making amends with your son? If that's true, let me give you a word of caution. Building a company is tough, but protecting it is even tougher. Don't let her boldness put your family's future at risk."

A quiet chuckle came from someone nearby. "We seasoned players have been keeping our distance out of respect. But if we were to move as one, do you really think Daniela could hold her ground? We've been generous to the younger crowd, yet she walks as if she's untouchable."

Hackett's smile stretched wider as he noticed Richard's brow crease. His voice remained light, but the weight behind it was unmistakable. "We're just concerned about Alexander's future. The Bennett family has already seen its fair share of hardships. You, more than anyone, know what it's like to fight through adversity. Would you truly want your son and his future wife to keep walking that same treacherous path?"

Richard's gaze flickered with a mix of emotions, his face giving nothing away.

Hackett leaned in, his voice smooth, coaxing. "We're extending a genuine invitation to Daniela to join our association. If she accepts, the Bennett family can come aboard too. We'd be one big family. Doesn't that sound ideal? Why keep butting heads? Isn't pooling our strengths and making money together the smarter move?"
As he spoke, Hackett poured Richard a cup of coffee, his smile stretching even wider. "Give it some thought, won't you? Can Daniela really take on all of us alone? And what's she even gaining from it anyway?"

Richard inhaled deeply, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts. He wasn't sure what Daniela's endgame was, but he had to admit-Hackett had a point.

Profit was the priority. Stirring up hostility left and right wouldn't bode well for Alexander either. If Daniela married into the Bennett family, her enemies would inevitably become theirs.

Richard's frown deepened under the weight of the dilemma.

Noticing his hesitation, Hackett gave a faint smile and patted Richard's hand.

"One more thing, Richard. I hadn't brought this up before, but since we're having such a productive conversation today, I'll say it now. Your future daughter-in-law's strong-handed approach might start chipping away at your authority within the family." Richard parted his lips to reply, but Hackett smoothly cut in with a knowing smile. "I get it-you don't mind.But as a father, are you truly fine with your son always playing second fiddle to a woman? If you and Daniela join our association, we're all reasonable men here. If any disputes arise in your family, we'd be right there to back you up, mediate in your favor. Doesn't that sound like a win?"

Hackett's words seemed to ease the burden pressing on Richard's mind. His brows slowly relaxed. "Fine.I'll talk to her. Daniela's taken things too far this time. We're all part of the same circle-there's no reason for this kind of hostility. No need to make life harder for each other."

At his words, the others exchanged pleased smiles, their expressions bright with satisfaction.

Once Richard had left, a man beside Hackett leaned in and murmured, "Do you really think Daniela will agree? She doesn't seem like someone who's easily swayed. Could it be that she's going after us because she's uncovered something about her mother?"

Hackett shut him down. "Rubbish! What mother? Whose mother? That's got nothing to do with us!"
###Chapter 521 Talk Her Out Of It
After stepping out of Hackett's office, Richard didn't head straight to his car.

Instead,he pulled out his phone and dialed Alexander.

"Hackett asked us to try and talk Daniela out of it."

Silence stretched on the other end of the line.

Richard exhaled sharply. "Why is Daniela so determined to go up against them? These men are industry giants. If she pushes too far, they won't just sit back and watch. If they decide to retaliate, she won't stand a chance."

Still, Alexander said nothing.

Frustration crept into Richard's voice. "Alexander, I know how hard you worked to build your success. And I know you want to be with Daniela, but is it worth risking everything you've achieved? What if she refuses to back down and offends the wrong people?Even if you two get back together,you'll be walking into a storm that won't just pass."

Finally, Alexander spoke, his tone steady and unwavering. "Dad, stay out of this. Daniela isn't  reckless. If she's making a move like this, she has a reason.Let me figure it out."

Richard's frown deepened, but after a long pause,he let out a reluctant sigh. "Alright."

Once he hung up, he ran a hand over his face.

No matter how much he respected Daniela, his priority was always Alexander.
And above all, he didn't want to go back to the struggles of the past.
StilI, if Alexander was willing to wait, he would trust him to handle it.

He forced himself to hold back from confronting Daniela.

But the next day, Daniela made headlines again, this time for boldly acquiring yet another major corporation.

Richard sat stiffly in front of the television, his eyes glued to the screen as Daniela's interview played.A cold unease crept through him.

Then,his phone rang.

Hackett.

"Richard,don't you think your future daughter-in-law is crossing the line?" Hackett's voice was low, edged with something dangerous.

Richard's stomach tightened. "Well, uh..."

"Have you spoken to Daniela or not? Or did you, and she just brushed you off? If she doesn't even listen to you, don't expect us to sit back and watch. The association represents over three thousand of the country's top companies; we won't let this slide."

Richard swallowed hard. "What's the rush? I haven't had a chance to talk to her yet. My schedule's been packed. I'll meet with Daniela this afternoon. No, I'll go right now!"

He ended the call and shot to his feet, panic etched across his face.

What the hell was Daniela thinking?

Was she seriously going up against the nation's most powerful enterprises? If they joined forces against her,she'd be crushed.

Meanwhile, Daniela was reviewing reports when a knock at the door interrupted her. Lillian stepped in."Daniela, Richard's here. He looks frantic and says he needs to see you right away."

Daniela's brows lifted slightly. "See me?"

Lillian nodded. "He was completely out of breath when he arrived. His face was pale from running, and he chugged a full glass of water before he could even speak."
Daniela's brows knitted slightly. "Ask him what it's about. I have an international meeting coming up. If it's nothing urgent, tell him to come back another day."

Today's meeting was with headquarters to review the latest round of financial data.

The overseas executives had always been skeptical of Daniela's decision to return to the country, enforcing strict accuracy checks on every report.

Lillian nodded and stepped out.

Richard paced the lobby, checking the time every few seconds. When Lillian returned, he didn't wait for her to speak.

"Let's go upstairs," he said, already striding to the elevator.

Lillian held up a hand, stopping him. "We can talk here.Daniela is in an international meeting. Tell me what you need, and I'll pass it along."

Richard's face darkened. "That won't do! This is serious, and you can't speak for her. I need to see Daniela-now!"

Lillian gave an indifferent shrug. "Then come back  another day."

Her casual response nearly made Richard lose his temper.

His gaze flicked around the lobby until it landed on Cedric, who was idly trimming the branches of a potted plant.

Richard's irritation boiled over. "Look at him! Just look at Cedric! He used to be the fearsome CEO of Phillips Group-calm,ruthless,always in control. And now?Now he's lounging around like some spoiled brat.Don't tell me he's riding on Daniela's coattails now?"

Lillian followed his gaze.

Cedric was carefully snipping away at the plant, his expression oddly serene.

Spoiled? Not exactly. But ever since he had married
Daniela,he had become more approachable, even at ease.

Cedric's secretary had once mentioned that before Daniela entered his life, Cedric never smiled.

Now,Lillian often caught Cedric grinning at Daniela,flashing a fullset of teeth, completely unguarded.

"Lillian, te most important thing in any relationship is sincerity!" Richard's voice carried weight, his emphasis on the word unmistakable. Lillian arched a brow. "And?"

"Daniela's been making some aggressive moves lately,acquiring one company after another. Alexander and I are beside ourselves with worry-we haven't had a decent night's sleep in days. You're her right hand,aren't you? You know as well as anyone that if she thrives, so do you. So, talk some sense into her. No one takes on a giant and comes out unscathed. Just because her company is thriving now doesn't mean she should get ahead of herself. She needs to stay grounded, don't you think? Hackett spoke to me a few days ago. His message was simple: harmony benefits everyone. I think it's a sound approach. Daniela is still young; she should aim for a smooth, steady path instead of being so-"

Richard stopped short, realizing the word he was about to use might not sit well. He adjusted his tone,gentler now. "What I mean is, she shouldn't back herself into a corner. Someone as sharp as Daniela wouldn't do that. Don't you agree?"
###Chapter 522 A Slight Move In One Part May Affect T...
Richard was displaying an unusual level of politeness at that moment.

Daniela's status had changed dramatically.

His voice carried a softer tone than it had in previous days.

Catching Lillian's eye, Richard chuckled and said, "I've come here in a complete rush,worried sick. Alexander is concerned too. Yet, it seems Cedric isn't worried at all."

Lillian picked up on the subtle insult. It was a clear swipe at Cedric,though it was far from discreet.

She had no desire to engage in a lengthy conversation with Richard and responded briskly, "I get what you're saying. I'll relay your message to Daniela."

She then rose to leave. However, after a few steps,she paused and turned around.

"Before I go, let me offer you some friendly advice.Daniela holds him in high regard and won't appreciate anyone speaking ill of him. Moreover,she has both the means and the desire to keep him content." The people at Elite Lux were fiercely protective of their own people. They might criticize Cedric themselves, but external criticism was not welcome.

Richard remained still for a moment, his mind slowvly catching up as he realized that Lillian was talking about Cedric. His face quickly turned sour.

He hurried out and dialed Alexander's number.

As soon as Alexander found out Richard was at Elite Lux, he became anxious. "Didn't I tell you I was still considering it?"

"Still considering it? Hackett and his associates are gearing up for a move. If they act, it will lead to an economic showdown nationwide. If it reaches that point, and you're forced by the business community to choose a side, what then? Fairburne Group's core business is mining, but you're expanding into other sectors. You've just started making inroads there.What's your plan if the situation escalates because of Daniela? Cedric doesn't appear trustworthy, and the same goes for Lillian. Should things take a turn for the worse, they are likely to be the first ones to flee.When that situation arises, it will be just you and Daniela left. Do you genuinely believe you can support her and face the entire world alone? That's ridiculous!"Alexander remained quiet for an extended period.Undeterred, Richard added, "Lillian brushed off my comments. Don't worry, I'll seize another chance to speak with Daniela soon."

As Richard was on the verge of ending the call,Alexander abruptly said, "Dad."

Richard stopped.

"Dad, if it comes to that, I will be there for her, and together we will face the world."

Richard's eyes narrowed.

"I have lost her once before," Alexander continued."She ended up with someone else, and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I won't step back this time.I'm determined to stay by her side, no matter the consequences."

Richard frowned. "Have you lost your senses?Consider all you've had to endure to achieve what you currently hold!"

To secure his position, Alexander faced humiliation and disgrace while associated with Joyce. He had even undergone plastic surgery to make himself look like Cedric.Was he reatly willing to risk everything now?

"Dad, I'm sorry." With those words, Alexander disconnected the call.  Richard remained standing, exhaling deeply.

What a complicated situation!

Meanwhile, Daniela's strategy to expand her influence was progressing.

Hackett had mustered the support of the entire business community, readying them for a collective attack on Daniela.

Upon hearing this, Richard approached Hackett. "Just grant me a bit more time. I believe I can persuade Daniela."

Hackett narrowed his eyes at him. "You've had all the opportunities I could offer, and you've wasted each one. Daniela's behavior is so reckless and arrogant. If I don't put her in her place, she'll assume we're all pushovers. She has already provoked considerable outrage,and people are prepared to confront her!"

Richard pleaded, "Just give me one hour. I need to speak with Daniela."

As Richard made his way into Daniela's office, he found her observing Cedric arrange some flowers.

Out of breath, the security guard offered an apology to Daniela. "I'm sorry, but he was just too quick for us to stop."Daniela stood up, fixing her gaze on Richard. "What brings you here?"
Richard entered with urgency, casting a disapproving look at Cedric. "Daniela, there's a major issue at hand!"

Daniela responded with composure, "Are you referring to the matter you discussed with Lillian yesterday? I'm already aware of it and have devised a strategy of my own. I'm puzzled as to why you're so agitated."

Richard,having rushed up the stairs, caught his breath,and Daniela noticed his effort, which made her tone a bit gentler. Otherwise, she could have easily responded with, "It's none of your concern. Why are you getting so upset?"

Richard was taken aback, momentarily speechless. He briefly wondered if his concerns were unwarranted.Should he just leave?

"Hold on." Richard faltered, his earlier urgency deflated by Daniela's calm demeanor. "Doesn't this situation worry you? Hackett mentioned that if you continue to acquire companies from the association,they will band together against you."

Daniela merely nodded. "So?"

Richard was surprised by her casual reaction. "You aren't worried at all?" "Worried about what?"

"The association!" Richard stepped forward. "Are you even aware of what the National Commerce Association entails? There isn't time to go into depth now, so I'll simplify it for you. The association is a powerful alliance of individuals each with a net worth of at least ten billion. They combine their resources,connections, and influence to safeguard their collective interests. When one member faces a threat,they unite to confront the challenge as a united front."
###Chapter 523 What Are You Afraid Of Exactly
Richard paused, considering his words. "The power of the National Commerce Association can obliterate anything in their way. Even the media agrees-standing against them is like standing against the entire world."

Daniela gave a slight nod. "Oh, that does sound impressive."

Richard dabbed at his forehead, his confusion deepening as he sudied Daniela. This wasn't the reaction he expected. Something was off.

Richard hesitated, searching for the right words. After everything he had said, Daniela remained unfazed.Finally, he asked, "What's on your mind?"

Daniela remained composed. "As I said earlier, Lillian has already passed along your message from yesterday. As for the association, it doesn't concern me much. My future plans remain confidential, and I'm not at liberty to discuss them. If there's nothing else,I have another meeting to attend."
Richard stood still, momentarily stunned. After all his effort, was Daniela really brushing himn off so easily? "Daniela, listen. You're young and don't grasp how serious this is. This association isn't something to take lightly. You can't just-"

Before he could finish, Lillian stepped in and led him out.

Richard found himself standing outside Elite Lux,shoulders slumped in frustration.

Why was Daniela so impossibly stubborn? Just because her company had some success didn't mean she could let it go to her head. When trouble camne,she would have no choice but to rely on Alexander to clean up her mess. And Cedric? He was just a man who indulged in luxury, living for pleasure without a care for responsibility. He was nothing compared to Alexander-pragmatic, forward-thinking, and always considerate. Alexander was a hundred times the man Cedric would ever be.

With these thoughts, Richard turned on his heel and left.

He hadn't even reached home when he saw Hackett already waiting at his doorstep.

Richard stepped out of his car, tension rising.

Hackett, exuding authority, wasted no time. "What did Daniela say?" Richard hesitated,pressing his lips together.

Hackett let out a cold laugh. "So, I wasted my time coming here? I thought Daniela would actually listen to you, but it seems I gave you too much credit. Since that's the case, I won't hold back anymore. I've already united over five thousand top enterprises across the country to impose sanctions on Daniela and Elite Lux. Richard, I have just one question for you.Are you standing with Daniela against us, or will you join us to bring her down?"

Richard mustered a weak smile. "Don't you think that's a bit excessive?"

Hackett's lips curved slightly, but his eyes stayed ice-cold.

Richard cast his gaze downward. "How about give me a little time? I'll have Alexander talk to Daniela. You don't want an all-out war either, do you?"

One thing was clear to Richard. Elite Lux wasn't some minor company-if it were, Hackett wouldn't be so persistent. Even for the association, crushing Daniela wouldn't be without consequences.

"Daniela is headstrong, and I'm not the best at convincing her. Let my son handle it," Richard added.
Hackett locked eyes with Richard, his voice like steel."You have three days. No more, no less. If I don't see  Elite Lux's application to join the association by then,I'll take it as a declaration of war. And when that happens, don't expect mercy."

With that, he turned on his heel and left, heading back to the association.

He held a meeting with the members of the association.

"Hackett, what exactly are you afraid of?"

"Yeah! Why are you cutting Daniela so much slack?"

"Just push her out of the domestic market entirely.Make her pack up and go. Isn't that the simplest solution?"

"I think you've gone soft, Hackett. You're not the same as when you dealt with Brylee back in the day.Back then, you were decisive and ruthless. But now,when it comes to her daughter, you're hesitating?"
###Chapter 524 If You Stand On The Wrong Side,You...
The meeting was private, attended by eight individuals who had all been involved in dealing with Daniela's mother.

Arrogance was written all over their faces except for Hackett's.

Hackett shot them an angry glare. "Have you forgotten how much effort it took to bring down Brylee? What happened then? Was she really defeated in the corporate world?"

His words wiped the smug looks off their faces.

"Daniela isn't like Brylee. Brylee built her empire within the country, meaning she had to maintain local ties and protect her reputation. That forced her to be flexible, giving us room to strategize against her. But Daniela? How many people is she connected with?Other than that stubborn Cedric, there's only the muddle-headed Richard. If I don't squeeze him, what other option do we have? And if this escalates into a full-scale price war and your business starts crumbling,don't come whining to me."

His words left them momentarily speechless. "That's not what we're saying, Hackett. We just think it's too humiliating."

"Why should we be afraid of her? Imagine the embarrassment if people heard that the head of the association was pleading with her!"

"That's right, Hackett. You're giving Daniela too much credit. Having money isn't everything in today's world,is it?"

Hackett had a reputation for being both decisive and ruthless. But when it came to Brylee and her daughter,his soft approach baffled everyone.

Noticing Hackett's stern expression, the group smirked."Alright, Hackett. We'll give Alexander a shot for you sake. But if he fails, don't expect us to hold back against Daniela."

Hackett smirked icily. "Go ahead, do whatever you want. It's not like I owe Daniela anything. When the battle begins,handle it yourselves-leave me out of it."

He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The moment Hackett was out of sight,Winslow Flores,who had been sitting beside him, smirked. "We give Hackett respect most of the time, and he acts like he runs the place."

Huey Murray scoffed. "Exactly! It's just Daniela. What's so terrifying about her? This whole thing is absurd!"
Bruno Deleon slammed the table. "If you ask me, we should just eliminate Daniela and make an example of her.Let the world see the power of our association!"

Farley Astley, the youngest and usually the quietest,finally spoke. "Have you considered that Daniela isn't challenging us out of arrogance? She's the richest person in the world. Taking her on might come at a steep price."

Across from Farley, Marcus Beckett chuckled dismissively. "What's there to be afraid of? Once Daniela is gone, the market is ours. Any losses we suffer now, we'll take back from her tenfold!".

At that, the entire group erupted into laughter.

In the end, Richard managed to set up a meeting with Alexander.

Under the cover of night, Alexander sat clad in a black suit,his face concealed behind a mask.

Richard gazed into Alexander's eyes-so different from before-and felt a deep pang of sadness.

"Alexander, Hackett's message is exactly as I told you.What do you think? They're not bluffing. You've seen how the association has ruthlessly dominated the market for years, pushing countless families into  financial ruin. If you don't fall in line, they'll hit you with economic sanctions. Do you recall when our family business nearly collapsed just because I upset a minor figure in the association? It was Brylee who helped us out. Without her, we would have lost everything. This time, there's no Brylee to save us.You need to think carefully-choosing the wrong side could be catastrophic."

Alexander dropped his gaze, lost in thought.

Since his appearance had changed, he hated meeting people,as if he belonged in the shadows, unworthy of the light.

Even now,sitting before his father, he couldn't bring himself to meet his eyes.

"Dad," Alexander said as he stood up, "I get it. I'll think it over."

After that,Alexander made his way to Elite Lux.

He lingered outside until Cedric was gone, then took off his mask and stepped into the sunlight.
###Chapter 525 Block Elite Lux In The Country
As Alexander walked along, everyone greeted him with a respectful "Mr. Phillips."

Alexander acknowledged them with a nod. As he walked past Lillian, she looked up, slightly confused,and called out, "Hey, didn't you leave to pick up some food for Daniela? You're back already? Did you get the food?"

Alexander remained silent. After a few more steps,he turned to look back at Lillian. She was smiling,her entire presence exuding an easy familiarity.

"What's the matter?" Lillian asked, still puzzled.

Alexander simply shook his head.

He realized that as long as he bore Cedric's appearance, those close to Cedric treated him with warmth and regard.

Alexander muttered to himself, "This appearance really comes in handy."

He then entered Daniela's office and locked the door behind him. Outside, the sky had turned ominously dark. Rain was clearly on the horizon.

In the dimly lit office, Alexander's figure was barely discernible, his face only faintly visible in the subdued lighting.

At that moment, the dark clouds seemed to envelop Alexander,shielding him.

Daniela was engrossed in a game and didn't look up.

The sound of the lock clicking made her instinctively think it was Cedric, as he was the only one bold enough to lock her office door.

A slight smile appeared on Daniela's face. "Cedric, you know it's working hours, don't you?"

The game company had recently launched a new game, and Daniela was testing it out.

"Is it enjoyable?" His voice was low and gentle,reminiscent of how Cedric often spoke.

Daniela laughed, focused on her game. "It's quite good,actually. Join me for a round later. The account number is 5566, and the password is the same. Hurry and log in so we can team up."

They were playing a team game against the game's developers. Upon logging in, Alexander was immediately greeted by the developers. "Hey, Cedric!"

Their interactions suggested they played together regularly and were comfortable with each other.
In the game, Daniela was as skilled as ever.Whenever Alexander lost focus, she was quick to cover for him.

These moments reminded him of the last seven years.

During that time, Daniela had been just as protective in real life, vigorously defending both him and his business interests.

"Hey, Daniela, that's not fair! Why only look out for Cedric? Ah! I'm out!"

After a teammate was eliminated, the developers launched a fierce offensive against both Daniela and Alexander.

Yet, Daniela managed to keep the upper hand,securing a strategic position that led their team to a resounding win.

Alexander put the game controller down and looked around.

Daniela sat back in her executive chair, her face lit up with a triumphant and relaxed smile, a contrast to her expressions over the past seven years. Seeing this, Alexander also let a smile spread across his face.

From her chair, Daniela looked to the door, still smiling. "Why are you standing by the door? I can hardly see you. Come in."

Daniela then moved to the sofa, her smile unwavering."Let's play another round!"

She restarted the game, and the background music picked up energetically.

Daniela noticed that the figure in the shadows hadn't moved. Her smile suddenly halted.

"Ce..." She cut herself off, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. "Who are you?"

This was a new game, and their teamwork had been slightly shaky, which was why Daniela hadn't picked up on any anomalies until that moment.

She placed her phone down and rose from her seat,her intense gaze locked on the door.

Just as she made a move towards it, the door clicked open, and the person in the doorway dashed away in a hurry.

Daniela stopped in her tracks.In the corridor, Lillian shouted in bewilderment,"Cedric, why are you running like that?"

She suspected something was amiss and approached Daniela."What's going on?"

Daniela,her eyes narrowed, stayed quiet and headed straight for the security room.

Inside, Ryan was absorbed in his phone but looked up as Daniela entered, with Lillian close behind.

Daniela immediately brought up the security camera footage.

Standing off to the side, Lillian and Ryan appeared confused. "Daniela, what's happening?"

"Hey,isn't that Cedric?"

"He just left the building. How did he get back so fast?"

Daniela, leaning forward on the desk with both hands,said, "That's not Cedric."

At her words, Ryan and Lillian were stunned into silence.

Subsequently, Elite Lux enhanced its security measures.

Daniela later received a text. "Be cautious of Hackett. He poses a threat."

Daniela gave it little thought and erased the message.

The commerce association soon discovered that Alexander's effort to approach Daniela had not succeeded.

Hackett tried to convince them to make another attempt,but the members of the association declined.

They declared that, effective immediately,they would impose an economic sanction on Elite Lux and cut off all access to it.
###Chapter 526 Return Our Money
The domestic supply chains of Elite Lux were cut off as soon as the war started.

Every source for raw materials was completely blocked.

Not even basic necessities could be purchased.

Members of the commerce association relaxed in the meeting room, their faces lit up with gratification.

Huey said, "Now that we've all made our moves, let's see how long Daniela can maintain her pride."

Bruno interjected, "Honestly, we should have done this to Daniela much earlier. Who does she think she is?The world's wealthiest person? Last year, my family invited her to a banquet, and she didn't even show up.Such arrogance! Clearly, her family never taught her manners."

Farley laughed and said, "Buno, is it really such a big issue? She skipped your family event, so what? It's well-known you just wanted to set her up with your son. She figured it out but kept quiet about it. Now,you're holding a grudge. How long has it been?" "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Daniela didn't reach her position by accident. We must be careful not to become a joke ourselves," Hackett said, smiling briefly.
Huey casually brushed at his leg. "Hackett, you excel in many areas, but sometimes you're too cautious."

Farley agreed. "Right, no matter how skilled Daniela is,she's still just in her twenties. With no one supporting her,what can she really accomplish alone?"

"Just watch. In less than three days, Daniela will be coming to us, asking for forgiveness," Bruno said with a hearty laugh, his plump cheeks bouncing. "The image of her,looking just like Brylee, bowing down to me,delights me!"

The group erupted in laughter.

Hackett allowed himself a moment of ease.

As Bruno was leaving, he clapped Hackett on the back."Just excel in your role, Hackett. The best is yet to come for you."

In the following days, a nationwide price war disrupted the market.

The association's members went from being relaxed to anxious, meeting first daily, then hourly.

"Find a solution!" Bruno shouted, clearly agitated.  "We're in chaos here, and I hear Daniela is just playing games in her office!"

Farley's expression grew even more concerned."We're all in the same business community. How can Daniela be so harsh with us?"

Bruno clenched his fists. "You all mocked me for wanting Daniela as my daughter-in-law. Now you see her capability, right? This morning, my company's stocks fell again. The shareholders are glaring at me like they want my head!"

Even Winslow, who was typically quiet, frowned with concern. "The real issue is figuring out how to stop the losses."

When they instigated the war, they overlooked a critical detail.

They severed Elite Lux's supply lines, yet Elite Lux dealt in luxury goods. Their customers cared solely about product quality, not the supplier.

Furthermore, Elite Lux, globally recognized,constituted only a small portion of Daniela's broader portfolio.

Severing her domestic supply lines was insignificant.She had numerous flights daily bringing in supplies from overseas, ensuring uninterrupted production. While costs rose slightly, they gained enhanced control over product quality.

Daniela's business empire extended across multiple sectors including luxury goods, entertainment,education, construction, port transportation, and even aerospace. These varied resources supported Daniela's operations.

The commercial conflict not only demonstrated Daniela's robustness but also highlighted their own weaknesses.

It exposed their motivations driven by greed to the public eye.

They were fated to lose this battle from the start.

It wasn't just about losing anymore; what mattered now was finding a way to stop the losses.

Should the losses persist, the association members risked not only their own downfall but also the survival of their enterprises.

Daniela's self-reliance was evident in her ability to operate independently.

She gathered the few remaining smaller items from local businesses, giving them a boost. The owners of these small businesses, eager to earn Daniela's approval, worked with greater enthusiasm and efficiency compared to the veterans from large corporations.

This conflict irrevocably cut off their prospects for future partnerships with any of Daniela's companies.

As everything crumbled, they were left in awe,realizing that the title of the world's richest person was truly earned. They had definitely overreached.
Reflecting on their earlier criticisms, they now felt as though they were metaphorically hitting themselves.

The repercussions were painfully clear.

Within the association, desperation set in as members scrambled to address their mistakes.

"Hackett, this was a flawed decision. You need to be accountable!"

"Exactly!"

"We joined the association thinking it would offer business insights and financial gains. Now, we've ended up with nothing. We've even lost contracts from Daniela's companies-those were major contracts!What's your plan now?"

In the business world, the bottom line is to make money.

They had eagerly joined the association, which had yielded no profits, and now they faced substantial financial losses. Just the thought was infuriating.

"I want to leave the association! Reimburse me for my losses and return the ten million I paid for the annual membership!"

"Yes! Return our money!"

"Return our money!"

"Return our money!"
###Chapter 527 As Long As Daniela Is Gone
Hackett was overwhelmed by the barrage of complaints. He couldn't bring himself to face these people.

The commerce association had flourished for years.Each company contributed ten million annually in sponsorship fees, and new entrants paid an additional fifty million as an initiation fee. These funds alone allowed Hackett to live extravagantly.

Additionally, the members, who were either wealthy or influential, frequently sought his favor to secure new business opportunities for financial gain,reputation,or profit.

The potential mass withdrawal of these companies posed a severe threat to Hackett's lifestyle.

Understandably, he was not prepared to let go without a fight.

After hiding for half theday, he eventually emerged,exuding a forced confidence as he approached the agitated crowd.

"Who here is considering leaving the association? Those wishing to leave, please proceed to register with the secretary now!"

Following his directive, the members rushed towards the secretary's office.

Hackett, hands clasped behind his back, clenched his fists nervously,though he appeared composed. "But before you decide to leave, listen to what I have to say. Think carefully about future regrets. If you're certain you won't have any, then you're free to withdraw."

Seeing Hackett's enigmatic attitude, the crowd paused,uncertain of their next move.

Bruno interjected from the side, "Hackett, just speak plainly. We're supposed to be like a family here;there's no need for such secrecy."

Hackett looked around at the crowd and sneered,"Really? Do you still see me as your president? I've dedicated myself to guiding us towards success, yet now you question my leadership. If you want to leave,then go-forget all the efforts I've put in over the years!"

The crowd fell silent.

One member stepped forward and asked Hackett,"What exactly do you mean?" Hackett, seizing the moment, continued to act mysteriously,suggesting he held a secret too sensitive to disclose, which only heightened the group's curiosity.

Farley, observing the tense atmosphere, caught Hackett's gaze briefly. He gave a slight nod and declared, "Well, if Hackett won't explain, I will. You've all disappointed Hackett deeply! Are you aware of all he's planned for your benefit?"

The crowd exchanged puzzled looks upon hearing this.

Farley continued,"Daniela is quite influential, isn't she?"

The crowd unanimously agreed."Absolutely!"

"But she's also quite arrogant. She once approached Hackett with a condition for joining the association-only if certain members were removed. From her demeanor, it was clear she intended to take over your businesses. This wasn't about Hackett or any of us initially. The companies facing eviction wouldn't include any of the eight of us. Yet, out of loyalty to all of you, Hackett still tried to negotiate with Daniela.Consider this; Hackett is not only a senior but also a figure of respect here, and yet, he humbled himself before Daniela to plead on your behalf. Even more remarkably, he knelt before her!"

The crowd was taken aback. "Daniela was that bold?"

"We've already made settlements, and she's still unyielding? The market is huge, how can she manage everything by herself?"

"Right! So, leaving the association won't protect us from her,will it?"

As the tension rose, Hackett let out a deep sigh."That's precisely my concern. Think about it; even together, we struggle against Daniela. If we split up,wouldn't the local market become even more susceptible,essentially handing it over to her? Do you really want that to happen?"

The crowd,motivated by Hackett's words, responded at the same time, "No,we don't!"

Hackett nodded and responded, "I thought so. The association hears you. That's why we've decided to reduce the annual fee from ten million to one million during this challenging time, as a sign of our support."

This prompted a murmur of disagreement among some attendees.

A loss of nine million per person was significant.

Who would invest in the association if not for profit?

Hackett reassured the group with a confident look, saying, "Furthermore, the association will also lower its entry requirements. Companies with an annual revenue of just ten million can now join us without an entry fee; they'll only need to pay the annual fee. Plus,the person who introduces a new member will receive a bonus of one hundred thousand!"

This announcement sparked renewed discussion among the crowd.

The other seven, sensing Hackett's strategy, silently applauded him with thumbs-ups.

Although they lowered the annual fee and cut the entry fee, there would be more companies joining them. And they could unify these new members against Daniela.

Once Daniela was no longer a factor, wouldn't the local market be theirs for the taking?

Huey, seizing the moment, stood and declared, "We are honest with you, and we ask for your support in eliminating this threat to our market, paving the way for fair competition."

The crowd, filled with excitement, eagerly worked to bring in new members.

The following day, news of the association lowering its entry barriers dominated the headlines.
###Chapter 528 Come Back to Me
The room was alive with conversation.

Daniela and Ryan were leisurely playing cards with a few others, not currently focused on expanding their business,so they appeared quite at ease.

Only Nina was feeling tense.
The headlines in the news were specifically pointed and alarming, making her uneasy just to read them.

"Daniela, aren't you concerned?" she asked. "The commerce association is scheming against you. They plan to gather all domestic companies to boycottus.They've been attracting a lot of new members.If they consolidate all that business power, won't Elite Luxbe in a difficult position?"

Nina's complexion was tinged with concern.

Daniela responded with a casual smile, "Two pairs!That's a win for me."

Ryan and Lillian, sitting opposite, had their faces covered by sticky notes.

Watching Daniela remain jovial, Nina sighed and exited  the room.

"Daniela,when do we make our move?" Lillian asked,mixing the cards again.

"Let's wait a few more days, let things escalate-it'll be more fun then."

At that moment, Nina re-entered and informed Daniela, "Someone is here to see you downstairs."

"Who is it?" Daniela asked.

She thought it might be those boring folks from the association.Bored, she decided to head downstairs to see what was going on.

To her surprise, it wasn't them but Alexander.

The lighting that day was favorable, and Daniela recognized him instantly despite his all-black attire and hat pulled down over his face, nearly hiding it entirely.

Finding the situation dull, Daniela turned to walk away.

Alexander hurried after her. "I need to speak with you."

Daniela faced Alexander, visibly confused. "Why do you keep appearing like this? What are you trying to say?"

With a senseof urgency, Alexander begged, "Just give me five minutes. I truly have something important to discuss with you."

The lobby was filled with activity. Daniela was unperturbed by the crowd, but she was bothered by Alexander's decision to wear Cedric's face and act recklessly.

She found a quiet spot and sat down.

Alexander came and sat beside her. "Daniela, I was wrong before. I didn't appreciate you. After all this time,do you still resent me?"

Daniela shook her head. "No." That was the simple truth. She just found it all very bothersome.

"We were never that close, and now I have a husband who gets quite jealous. I want to keep him happy every day. Your presence would only disturb him."Daniela looked at Alexander. "Nobody wants to see his face worn by another. My husband might be forgiving, but I'm not. I believe everything about my husband should be exclusive to him."

Alexander felt a pang of pain at her words. He managed a weak smile. "Daniela, remember how you used to stand up for me? You made me unique gifts for my birthday, insisting they had to be unique."

Now, those sentiments were being used to defend anot her man, and it saddened Alexander. "But it's okay. We have a long future ahead," he said.

Daniela's expression showed her growing impatience.

Alexander reached into his pocket and took out a bank transfer device.

Daniela eyed it warily. "What's this about?"

Alexander explained, "Daniela, perhaps you no longer care for me, but you're still the only one in my heart.I won't dwell on the past. I'm just asking for a place in your future. This device lets you access funds from Fairburne Group as needed. I know you're being targeted by the association. I don't know your current strategy, but money is always useful. It could help you execute whatever plans you have."

Alexander was earnest, but Daniela remained composed.

"Alexander, I don't need it."

"Why do you have to be so stubborn?" Alexander frowned. "I get that you're still upset with me, but let's leave the past behind. Why jeopardize your business just to spite me? The association is seriously challenging you.This money could keep your operations going. If things really get bad, you could relocate your company overseas. Also, I spoke with Hackett before coming here. He's agreed to give you a day to withdraw from the domestic market. He
promised me, and he'll keep his word. Daniela,consider this. You've achieved so much as a woman in this tough environment. Don't aim too high. I've witnessed your efforts, and I acknowledge them.Can't we leave it at that?"

Alexander's words were heartfelt and emotional."Daniela, please, come back to me. I'll value you. Let's start anew,shall we?"
###Chapter 529 I'm Married

Daniela remained silent, her only emotion being pure disgust. "Alexander, are you sure you're confessing to the right person? I'm married. Are you seriously trying to pursue me? Do you enjoy being a home-wrecker?"

Alexander's head jerked up, his eyes clouded with hurt beneath the brim of his hat.

"Besides,Alexander,you'venevertruly understoodme,"Daniela added.

Stunned,Alexander protested, "That can't be! Daniela,we've known each other for years. How could I possibly not understand you?"

"Do you honestly think you know me? I'm not the kind of person who dwells on the past-be it people or things.I married Cedric because I genuinely love him.Haven't you ever wondered how I can always tell that you're not Cedric?"

"Why?" Alexander asked, his gaze locked on hers.

"Because I love him. The first clue was a scar. Then,there was a habit of yours that didn't match. And over time, even the smallest gesture of yours was enough for me to recognize that you weren't Cedric." Alexander's eyes went wide with shock. "A scar?Where is it? No way! The plastic surgeon made sure l was an exact replica of Cedric, down to the smallest detail!"

Daniela sighed, shaking her head. She had said plenty,yet he only clung to what suited him.

Alexander tensed, as though he'd just uncovered a vital secret.

So that was it-Daniela saw through him because of a scar he didn't even know existed. If he recreated that scar, he could deceive her once more. He could reclaim her smile, her protection-everything.

Consumed by desperation, Alexander tugged his hat down further, as if trying to disappear from sight.

Snatching the bank transfer device from the table, he thrust it into Daniela's hand and rushed out without another word.

He would leave the country, undergo another surgery.He would become Cedric-the man Daniela loved-through and through.

Just before departing, Alexander shot a message to the company's finance team.

"No matter how much is spent, don't report it to me.My wife is the one using the money." The finance team confirmed the instruction but couldn't help feeling confused. His wife? Did he mean Joyce?

Daniela brushed Alexander off and headed upstairs to play cards with Ryan and Lillian.

A few days later, A newly formed group of members convened at the commerce association,initiating yet another business embargo against Daniela.

But they quickly found out their efforts were useless -there was no reaction at all.

Meanwhile, Elite Lux held a groundbreaking fashion show.

Stunning models showcased exquisite designs on the nation's most prestigious stage, captivating the audience.

The public remained indifferent to the intense corporate warfare.

The fashion show turned out to be a spectacular triumph.

Elite Lux celebrated its most remarkable success in years,raking in tens of billions in on-site orders.

With this single move, the association's embargo became meaningless. One by one, members started silently pulling out of the association.

Hackett scowled as he scanned the latest membership report.

Huey slammed his fist down. "Daniela's going too far!"

Bruno propped his head on his hand,frowning."What the hell is Daniela up to? Damn it!"

Farley, visibly frustrated, snapped, "Is there really no one who can step in? If Daniela keeps pushing like this,our business embargo will become nothing more than a laughingstock!"

Hackett narrowed his eyes. "I've already dispatched someone to track down Richard. He claims he's with Alexander in another country. Who knows what they're up to while we're dealing with this crisis here?"

Bruno nervously rubbed his hands, his voice dropping."Is Daniela coming after us because of what happened to Brylee? Why else would she single us out? We've always been courteous to her."

Leaning back in his chair, Hackett narrowed his eyes."Caiden lost his mind, Katrina's dead, Elyse vanished,and Natalie fled the country. Now, Daniela is coming after us. Given all that, it's highly likely that her sudden hostility stems from Brylee's dea Bruno's eyes went wide. "So... what's our move?"

Marcus lifted a hand. "Let's not lose our heads. What if we're wrong? If we act rashly, we might expose ourselves. Let's invite Daniela to dinner and feel her out first."

Huey shuddered. "Daniela's brutal-she won't let us off easy. So many companies have gone bankrupt lately. Who's to say we won't be next? I refuse to let my family's business collapse while it's under my watch!"

Hackett's face darkened. "Enough talk. We need to gauge the situation. Get ready. My secretary will set up a dinner with Daniela. Stay alert. I hear Cedric means a lot to her. We'll split up-one group will test Daniela,the other will work on Cedric."

Huey jumped in. "I'll deal with Cedric. Honestly,Daniela's cutthroat approach freaks me out."

Another said, "I'll handle Cedric too. Daniela is too unpredictable, and I don't want to risk making a mistake."
Hackett's eyes narrowed in irritation. "Fine! I'll handle her myself! Huey,Marcus,you're coming with me!"
With that, Huey's and Marcus'faces fell instantly.They had hoped for an easier task. Things had been unbearably tense lately.

To them, Cedric seemed like the safer bet.
###Chapter 530 They Think I Am The Easy Target

Daniela was playing an online game with Cedric when Lillian entered the room. "Daniela, the commerce association has invited you to join them for a meal."

Daniela straightened up, her lips curling into a slight smile. "They couldn't resist any longer, could they?thought they would hold out a bit more."

Lillian sneered, "Those old foxes are cunning. They never dirty their own hands; they prefer to have others do the heavy lifting while they enjoy the fruits of their labor. It's sickening!"

Daniela laughed and said, "Show them no mercy. Let them see our strength. Tonight, we handle those merchants, and by tomorrow, those veterans will be the ones on the offensive."

Lillian nodded and exited the room.

Nina lingered at the doorway, observing Daniela.

She held great admiration for Daniela.

She had never encountered anyone as bold and unapologetic as Daniela, who fearlessly embraced both love and hate. Daniela's radiance was undeniably compelling.

Nina, who was usually timid and reserved, felt empowered by Daniela's presence.

She aspired to always stay close to Daniela.

Lillian reappeared and said, "Daniela, does this mean you won't be attending the dinner tonight?"

Daniela was disinterested. She found large gatherings and dining out overly noisy and bothersome.
"Your mother's old friend is indebted to Hackett. He hopes that you join them for a meal for his sake."

Daniela smiled. "They've even got in my mother's friend. Skip dinner. I'll just meet them for coffee."

Lillian responded to the invitation right outside Daniela's office.

The other party was exceedingly grateful and quickly sent over the details.

"Wow!" Lillian chuckled. "They've arranged to meet at the Alejandran Coffee, where a single cup costs a hundred thousand. These old guys are really splurging this time."

Daniela waved dismissively. "Tell them to meet me at the cafe downstairs instead." Lillian nodded and then glanced at Cedric, who was still in the room. "Is he going too?"

Cedric flashed a grin. "Am I included?"

"Yes, your name's on the list. Will you be attending?"

Cedric chuckled, clearly seeing through the group's motives.

Daniela remained determined. After their recent setbacks, these old folds were likely hoping to gain an advantage by negotiating with him.

"Of course, I'll attend. If I don't, it will just terrify them."

Nina overheard this and thought Cedric and Daniela made a perfect team. She was deeply impressed.
Daniela turned to her with a smile. "One day, I'll find someone suitable for you."
Nina returned a smile, although her interest in marriage had waned.

The meeting was scheduled for eight o'clock that evening.

Daniela had just wrapped up a multinational conference when Lillian entered. "Daniela, they've arrived. All eight of them are here, but they're trying to keep it under wraps to avoid any media attention that could embarrass them if it leaks that they're here to negotiate. They're dressed very plainly."

Daniela nodded and made her way downstairs with Lillian and Cedric.

Initially,these people were worried, but their anxiety eased upon seeing Daniela. Their posture improved visibly.

Why? Daniela was so pretty, they immediately assumed that she got what she had today by relying on men.

Her slight build didn't suggest a powerful CEO but rather resembled a television star.
They believed she was outwardly dazzling, though internally, she might be feeling the pressure.

The group exchanged looks, a mutual understanding passing between them.

They suspected Cedric had orchestrated this business move,not Daniela.

Given her delicate demeanor, she appeared more as eye candy than a force in business.

As Daniela drew closer, their anxiety diminished.

They had been standing, but before Daniela even reached them, they had taken their seats. Noticing this, Daniela's smile widened. She turned to Cedric and whispered, "It seems they think I'm the easy target." ###Chapter 531 Suppression

Daniela and Cedric arrived, only to find that Hackett's group had already made themselves comfortable.

Pretending not to notice Daniela, they remained clustered together, murmnuring in hushed, secretive tones.

Daniela's lips curved into a mocking smile.

Only then did Hackett act as if he had just noticed Daniela.With exaggerated surprise,he exclaimed, "Ms.Harper! What a rare sight! It's been ages. I've been trying to invite you to dinner,but you keep turning me down."

He wasted no time in delivering a lighthearted reprimand.

Daniela held her smile, unbothered by Hackett's remarks. But Hackett barely acknowledged her reaction,turning his attention to Cedric with a sudden change in attitude.

His tone turned deferential. "Mr. Phillips, it's been too long."

Hackett's companions exchanged glances, eyeing Cedric before briefly glancing at Daniela's small frame. Chuckling, they stood up, offering Cedric warm and polite greetings.

It was clear they saw Cedric as the true power behind the scenes.

To them, Daniela, with her youthful appearance,hardly seemed capable of making waves in the business world.

Paying no heed to their flattery, Cedric pulled out a chair for Daniela, his voice soft as he said, "Have a seat."

Daniela took her seat.

The eight men chuckled,exchanging knowing glances."Mr. Phillips, you truly dote on your wife."
Hackett joined in, laughing. "That's how it should be!A happy wife means a happy life, after all."

Marc added with a smirk, "No wonder your company thrive in business. We should take notes from you, Mr.Phillips."

While they talked, Hackett politely gestured for Cedric to take a seat. ①

Cedric settled into his chair, prompting the eight men across from him to do the same.

Cedric sat with a straight posture, while Daniela's chair was slightly askew,making it appear as though Cedric alone faced the eight men.

With her petite frame almost swallowed by the oversized chair,Daniela faded into the background,easily ignored by the eight men.

Cedric poured a glass of water for Daniela, but she shook her head. "I'm not thirsty."
Setting the glass in front of himself, Cedric offered,"Want to go for a walk later? There's a new shopping plaza, and I heard they have great snacks. You've been craving something sour lately, haven't you?"

Daniela gave a small nod. "Let's go once this is done."

The eight individuals on the other side observed their conversation,exchanging glances as if they weren't even present.
Cedric was known for being difficult to deal with,yet his attentiveness towards Daniela was undeniable.

If Cedric stayed firm, their backup plan was to target Daniela instead.

In the end, women could always be won over with jewelry,designer clothes,and lavish gifts.
Modern women were all gold diggers anyway. Daniela couldn't possibly resist the temptation of wealth. That assumption put them at ease, making them believe the night wouldn't be a total loss.

They could only hope this business feud would end soon, or the entire association might fall apart.

Unable to hold back any longer, Farley spoke up first."Mr. Phillips, we're here not only to reconnect but also to discuss some pressing business matters."

Sitting upright with an unreadable gaze, Cedric asked evenly, "What business matters?"

Once again, the eight of them exchanged uncertain glances.

Huey let out a small chuckle, took a sip of water, and said, "We've met before, haven't we? At the last charity auction, we both had our eyes on a piece of jewelry,and you eventually..."

Clearly,Huey was attempting to butter Cedric up.

Cedric lifted a hand to cut him off. "Apologies, but l have plans to take my wife for a walk later. I'll give you fifteen minutes. Will that be sufficient?"

The eight men across the table froze in disbelief.

"Fifteen minutes?" Hackett choked out. That wasn't even enough time for introductions. They had prepared extensive arguments and even planned to invite the couple to a private club later. But faced with Cedric's detached demeanor, Hackett swallowed his frustration. "Fifteen minutes it is!"

Cedric gave a slight nod of acknowledgment. Even in casual attire,he carried himself with an air of authority that commanded respect.

Hackett's grin stretched wider, becoming even more obsequious. "There was a minor misunderstanding recenty, Mr. Phillips," he said, pulling a pre-filled check from his pocket. "I acted too rashly, and for that,I take full responsibility. The eight of us are here today to see if we can settle this matter amicably."

Cedric's gaze flickered briefly towards the check resting on the table. His lips curled into a smirk. "Do you take me for a beggar?"

Bruno, ever the one to obsess over money, widened his eyes in disbelief. "Mr.Phillips,did you look closely?That's two hundred million! Since when does a beggar receive that kind of sum?"

Bruno had spent the entire night agonizing over the exact amount to offer.
Cedric, a veteran in the business world, lounged back in his chair,tilting his chin slightly as he regarded them.

His posture was casual, but the sharp glint in his eyes carried a silent challenge . "This money isn't for me," Cedric said smoothly. "My wife has a kind heart. There are countless homeless children in impoverished regions, and she hopes to unite charitable businesses to fund schools worldwide -working toward a world where poverty no longer exists."

Cedric's statement sent a chill through the eight men,leaving them uneasy.

A world without poverty?

Marc let out an awkward chuckle, clapping hesitantly."Eliminating poverty worldwide sounds a bit ambitious.Perhaps we should start on a smaller scale? Maybe in Olisvine first? And your wife's vision is quite idealistic.Mr. Phillips, don't you think it would be wiser to take things step by step?"
All eight pairs of eyes turned to Cedric, waiting for his response.

Cedric shook his head effortlessly. "That won't do.Kindness shouldn't have borders. And considering that you all are at the helm of the domestic business world,don't you think two hundred million is a little underwhelming for such an ambitious project?"

A heavy silence settled over the room.
Hackett's thoughts raced as he hesitated before asking, "Then, what would be an appropriate amount?"
###Chapter 532 Bruno Deleon

Cedric chuckled lightly, his amusement barely concealed.

The eight men across from him remained stiff, their gazes locked on Cedric's lips, bracing themselves for whatever shocking words might follow.

Then,Cedric raised a finger.

The men opposite him stiffened.

Their expressions turned blank, shock flooding their features.

"Did you mean ten million?" Bruno asked, his voice shaking.

Cedric said nothing.

Farley's fingers tightened around his water glass as he forced a strained chuckle. "Ten million for each of us.Nothing we can't handle,right?"

Hackett,sitting to the side,found his smile faltering.
Still,Cedric remained silent. He knew these old foxes weren't confused-they were just buying time. But in the end, they would have to accept the reality before them.

Hackett's feigned pleasantness gave way to a scowl."Mr. Phillips, just what exactly are you playing at?"

Cedric responded with cool indifference, "I believe I've made myself quite clear,haven'tl?"

Hackett lowered his gaze. "A hundred billion?"

Cedric chuckled lightly. "If that sounds low to you,feel free to increase the amount. For a project of this scale, a hundred billion is merely the baseline."

The moment he finished speaking, the eight men collectively shut their eyes, inhaling sharply.

"A hundred billion?" Bruno erupted, slamming the table as he shot to his feet. "Are you out of your mind?You trying to drive us all into bankruptcy? This is extortion! Do you really think we fear you? We showed up here today out of courtesy, and yet you have the nerve to push things this far? Do you actually believe you can dominate the entire business world on your own? Let me tell you something-you'd better take ths two hundred million while it's still on the table. Otherwise, soon enough, you might not even get that much!"

Bruno was shaking with rage, his face contorted with fury. But Cedric remained as composed as ever. "If you think it's too much, then we have nothing more to discuss. We'll manage just fine on our own.Our fifteen minutes are up. Daniela, shall we take that walk?"

Daniela rose to her feet, slipping her hand into Cedric's as they walked away.

The eight men sat frozen, their expressions blank with shock.

Huey blinked in disbelief. "They just walked out?"

Farley frowned. "Not even a chance to negotiate?What the hell was that?"
Hackett spun towards Bruno, eyes blazing. "Are you insane? Why the hell did you lose it? We're already at a disadvantage. Did you forget why we came here?"

Bruno clenched his teeth. "Did you not see Cedric's greed? A hundred billion! He's trying to bleed us dry!And Daniela-did you catch that glare she gave me?That gold digger! Who the hell does she think she is?Just because her husband's got power, she thinks she can look down on us? She actually thinks she's something, huh? Yet when it came down to it, she didn't even have the guts to speak. The richest person in the world? What a complete joke!"

His voice boomed, cutting through the air and echoing across the lobby. Hackett yanked at Bruno's sleeve, trying to rein him in.

Bruno jerked his arm free, seething. "I want them to hear! They're nobodies! Daniela? The richest person in the world? Not even close!"

The moment those words left his mouth, the figures near the exit halted.

A beat later, Cedric turned his head, his gaze cutting through the room like a blade, locking onto the eight men.

Bruno stiffened, his bluster faltering under Cedric's icy stare.

"I..." Bruno stuttered, watching Cedric and Daniela disappear. His frustration boiled over. "Did you see that? What was that attitude? So damn arrogant!Shouldn't we put them in their place?" His voice rang out,still loud and indignant.

Ryan, Lillian, and Nina stood nearby, arms crossed,their gazes turning sharp and icy.
After their stroll, Lillian eyed the snack in Daniela's hand and asked, "Daniela, is it time to start the plan?"

Daniela glanced at the three fuming faces before her,
a small smile playing on her lips. "That mad,huh?"

Ryan clenched his jaw. "Absolutely!" Nina huffed. "Furious!"

Daniela chuckled, nodding. "Seems about time. Let's pick one of the eight to test the waters."

The moment she said that, the three instantly answered in unison, "Bruno Deleon!"

Daniela raised a brow, surprised. Then, she heard Cedric spat, "Bruno Deleon."
###Chapter 533 You Look Like The World's Ending
Daniela laughed lightly. "I didn't expect you'd all agree on this. Bruno it is."

Bruno was the second most powerful figure in the commerce association.

Raised in poverty, he relied on borrowed money to complete his education. When the internet boom hit,he was among the first to seize the opportunity,securing his initial fortune.

He later married into an influential family in the tech industry, using his father-in-law's connections to ascend the social ranks quickly.

Before his father-in-law's passing, the old man entrusted the internet company to his daughter-Bruno's wife. But within a few years, Bruno manipulated events, stripping his wife of control and claiming the company for himself.

The moment he solidified his position, he discarded his wife without hesitation.

Back then, Bruno had masterminded a horrifying event-having a group of men raping his wife,leaving  her emotionally shattered.

The very next day, she had taken her own life, leaving behind one chilling statement-Bruno would pay for his actions.

Years went by,yet Bruno continued to rise, backed by Hackett's support.
Bruno once smugly declared on camera, "Justice? It doesn't exist. It's just another luxury for the wealthy."
Having clawed his way up from nothing, Bruno had no qualms about resorting to dishonorable tactics. He valued money more than anyone else in the room.

So,when Cedric demanded a hundred billion,Bruno was the first to crack.

The eight remained seated in the cafe.

Bruno slammed his fist on the table. "Are you all just going to sit there while Cedric walks all over us? I'm telling you, a hundred billion dollars would ruin me!Forget it-I'm not handing over another cent!"

Hackett sighed,his brows furrowing. "Bruno, you're as impulsive asever. We haven't even decided if we'll pay."
Fuming, Bruno planted his hands on his hips. "We have to get rid of Cedric. I've had enough of his arrogance.No one has dared challenge me like this in years. It's  infuriating."

Bruno grabbed his glass and downed the water in one go.

Winslow, leaning back, spoke with quiet composure."If you ask me, just pay and move on. Whether we like it or not, Daniela is recognized as the world's richest person. A hundred billion is a steep price, but with new members constantly joining the association, we'll make it back in time."

Winslow wasn't like the others. He had crossed paths with Elite Lux before. He didn't know them personally,but he recognized that Daniela wasn't just there as Cedric's plus-one.

"Winslow, if you're just going to bow down, then keep quiet!" Bruno spat.

Winslow might've been ranked lowest among them,but he was the most calculated. When he spoke,there was usually a reason.

Hackett shot Winslow a hesitant look, reluctant to part with such a large sum. "Why don't we hold off a little longer?"

Winslow gave a casual shrug before standing up. "I won't argue. If we're paying, just give me a heads-up so I can plan accordingly. But if you're thinking of going against Daniela or Cedric, don't count me in. I've  got family obligations, so I'm out."

With that, he walked away.

Bruno scowled at Winslow's retreating figure, seething."Spineless coward! It's just Daniela! What's there to fear? Look at him scurrying away like he's being hunted! Afraid of a woman? Pathetic!"

Hackett ran a frustrated hand through his hair."Enough about Daniela-she's irrelevant. Cedric is the real problem here."

The others murmured in agreement and launched into quiet deliberation.

Bruno headed back to his newly acquired villa.

By his side was his latest conquest-a second-rate celebrity barely clinging to fame.

She exuded a captivating, seductive energy.

Just as Bruno was about to indulge, his phone buzzed.

Irritated, he picked up. "This better be important!"

His secretary's frantic voice crackled through the line."Mr. Deleon! We've had several major order cancellations tonight! You might need to come immediately!"

Holding the woman close, Bruno scoffed, "So what?  The company's thriving, and our new game is about to drop. A few cancellations aren't the end of the world.Stop overreacting."

And with that, he ended the call.

Bruno's secretary stared in horror at the crashing player count for the new game, his anxiety mounting with each passing second.

He didn't dare call again, opting instead to flood Bruno's inbox with updates.

Bruno,too preoccupied,ignored his phone the entire night.

The sleepless secretary watched the game's numbers nosedive, a sinking sense of doom settlingin.

Five billion dollars had been poured into this game.

It was supposed to be their gateway into the international market.

But with such dismal engagement, they'd have to give it away for free just to get players.

The next morning, Bruno finally showed up at the office.

A crowd had formed outside his office door.

The tech,marketing, and PR teams were all clustered  anxiously outside.

"What the hell is this?" Bruno eyed his secretary's exhausted face and sneered. "You look like the world's ending. What's with the long face?"

Trembling, the secretary lifted his gaze to meet Bruno's.
###Chapter 534 | Shouldn't Have Cursed At Her
Bruno's smirk stiffened instantly, his expression hardening. "What the hell is going on?"

His secretary trailed closely behind as they stepped into the office.

The finance director anxiously extended the latest financial report, hands slightly trembling.

Bruno's composed demeanor shattered in an instant,morphing from detached disinterest to sheer disbelief,before twisting into unchecked rage. "What the hell did you just say? Repeat that!"

The marketing director hesitated before stepping forward, his gaze averted. "Elite Lux's gaming division has just launched a direct competitor to our title.Their visuals are crisper, their characters more dynamic, and the gameplay offers a level of depth that players find irresistible. And..."

Lowering his voice even further, he added, "It's absolutely free. Players can unlockevery weapon and skin simply by progressing in the game. To make matters worse, every celebrity affiliated with Elite Lux is actively promoting it. In short, there's no room left  for us in the market."

Bruno's temple throbbed, veins pulsing with fury.

The marketing director took a cautious step back, his expression grim. The sales director quickly took his place. "Mr. Deleon, this launch has set off a domino effect. Our entire game portfolio is suffering-every single title is seeing a decline in sales!"

The technology director added, "Mr. Deleon,I reached out to a friend working in Elite Lux's gaming sector. He confirmed that they have over a hundred more titles lined up-and every single one of them will be free!"

Bruno's eyes narrowed dangerously. "All free? What is this, a damn charity? How the hell is Daniela funding this madness?"

The finance director said, "Elite Lux's gaming division is merely a fraction of their empire. They've seamlessly incorporated subtle advertisements within their games. While the games themselves aren't profitable, their in-game ads and strategic product placements generate significant revenue. According to highly credible sources, the income from advertisements and merchandise sales has not only offset their development costs but has already pushed them into profitability."
Bruno's fury burned so intensely, he felt like his entire being might combust. Cedric was absolutely ruthless! "Cut the damn explanations! Give me the numbers.How much have we lost?" Bruno clutched his chest,his breath coming in ragged gasps under the crushing weight of the revelation.

The finance director looked ready to sink into the floor. "Our stock prices have been in freefall, and as of tonight, they've bottomed out. We've already hemorrhaged over 30 billion dollars. If this decline doesn't stop, by the time tonight is over, our losses will surpass 80 billion."

Taking a deep, steadying breath, he delivered the final blow. "We've lost what would have been five years' worth of profits gone."

With his report concluded, the director lowered his head,unwilling to meet Bruno's gaze.

The entire room remained silent, heads bowed in a shared sense of dread.

A suffocating silence filled the office,thick with tension.

Unease was etched across their expressions.

A minute passed.

Then another five dragged by.

The employees exchanged uneasy glances. The secretary hesitated,then cautiously lifted his gaze.

"Mr.Deleon!" he shouted in panic. Bruno had slumped over his desk, completely unresponsive.

"Quick! Call an ambulance!"

Chaos erupted within the company, spreading like wildfire.

News outlets pounced on the story, and by the time Bruno stirred awake, Deleon Group had hemorrhaged over 100 billion dollars.

A single day had undone everything Bruno had spent years building.

The second his eyes fluttered open, he blacked out once more.

The remaining members of the commerce association were just as dumbfounded, shaken by Cedric's growing ruthlessness.

They convened once more, though none of them had anticipated their next meeting would be in a hospital room the very next day.
"This is absurd! Completely insane!" Bruno bellowed from his hospital bed. "Cedric is out to destroy me!"

Winslow, standing off to the side, idly clipped his nails. "I told you-we should've just paid up.If you had,you wouldn't be down 80 billion now, would you?"
Regret gnawed at Bruno. "How was I supposed to know they'd be this ruthless? What's our next move?"

If he caved now, that 80 billion loss would be for nothing! The very idea made his blood boil.

Hackett narrowed his eyes, just as shaken by Cedric's cold-blooded efficiency. It was clear-Cedric wasn't holding back in the slightest.

"But why start with Bruno?" Marcus, who had been quiet until now, finally spoke up. "Cedric could've gone after Hackett or even Winslow, the youngest. So why go after Bruno first?"

No one had questioned it until now, but once the thought surfaced,it lingered.

Bruno felt wronged. "Exactly! Why me?"

Hackett leaned in. "Bruno, did you cross Cedric in any way?"

Bruno shook his head furiously. "How could I? I've always treated Cedric with respect. I have no idea why he'd single me out first!"

Eighty billion-gone!

That kind of money would take years, maybe decades,  to recover.

This wasn't just financial ruin-it was an execution.

"If you never stepped on Cedric's toes before,then ..." Hackett's words faded into silence.

The rest of the group exchanged wary glances, a silent revelation dawning upon them.

Bruno noticed their expressions and grew agitated."What's with those looks? I swear, I never crossed Cedric! The only thing I did was curse at Daniela."

Bruno stopped cold. Then, smacking his thigh, he gasped, "I shouldn't have insulted her!"

That same night, Bruno discharged himself from the hospital, clutching expensive gifts and a hefty check,sprinting towards Elite Lux.
###Chapter 535 Stunning Beauty
Bringing gifts to Daniela was nothing more than a gesture of respect for Cedric.

Upon arriving at Elite Lux, Bruno made sure Cedric had already departed before rushing upstairs.

Just as he neared his destination, Ryan and Lillian blocked his path.

Bruno's brows furrowed. "What's the meaning of this?Step aside!"

Lillian folded her arms, her gaze cold. "And what exactly do you want?"

Bruno hoisted the bags slightly. "I'm dropping off gifts,isn't it obvious? Lend me a hand!"

To Bruno, Lillian was nothing more than a mere secretary.

When she didn't budge, his temper flared. He jabbed a finger at her. "You're just a secretary! Who gave you the guts to talk back? Do you even realize how easily I could ruin you?"

Deep down,Bruno never saw women as his equals. In his mind, they existed only to serve his whims.Respect? That was laughable.

"These are high-end luxury goods, worth millions.Take them to Daniela's office-and be careful! You couldn't afford to replace them if you tried!" he spat.

A passing janitor, oblivious to the tension, casually carried the gifts into Daniela's office.

Bruno's smugness swelled. He sauntered in, let his gaze wander critically around the room, then lowered himself onto the sofa, preparing to cross his legs.

Before he could settle in, Lillian's steady voice rang out. "Bruno Deleon is inside."

A moment later, Daniela stepped in.

Bruno sprang to his feet, flashing a practiced smile."Ms. Harper, my apologies for dropping by unannounced."

His words carried an apology, but his expression certainly did not.

The smile was forced, his eyes laced with barely concealed contempt.

"What do you need?" Daniela didn't waste time with niceties. She simply walked past him and took her seat. Bruno hesitated, expecting an invitation to sit,but none came.

Irritation prickled at him, but he couldn't let it show.

Forcing a chuckle, he lowered himself into the seat."Yesterday, I let my mouth run and said some things l shouldn't have. I came to apologize. And I hope you'll like these gifts."

Daniela gave them a brief glance, then let out a soft chuckle. "And what makes you think I'd like them?"

Her response nearly made Bruno choke on air. These gifts were worth a fortune! And she had the nerve to say she didn't like them?

"I was in a bit of a rush." Fishing a check from his pocket, he extended it forward. "Please accept this."

Daniela gave it a glance, a faint smirk playing on her lips.The same two-hundred-million-dollar check from the day before.

"Look, we're all businesspeople. No need to make things so difficult. Think of this as a goodwill gesture,"he added.

Daniela leaned back slightly, her tone measured. "And what exactly do you want from me?"

Bruno's eyes gleamed with anticipation. He believed Cedric was the real power behind all this. Daniela? She was just a pretty face. But with Cedric wrapped around her finger,she held influence.

Of course, what he said was the opposite. "Last night,Mr. Phillips took extreme action against my company,leading to severe losses. Could you have a word with him? Ask him to ease up a little?"

Daniela chuckled, plucking the check off the table. "If my memory serves me right, Cedric mentioned a hundred billion dollars yesterday, didn't he? And if l recall correctly, you lost around eighty billion last night. Had you acted sooner, you wouldn't have ended up paying this much."

Bruno swallowed his pride, his jaw tightening. "Yes,I was foolish."

Unhurriedly, Daniela placed the check back on the table and slid it toward him. "Cedric told me this morning-he gave you a chance yesterday, and you didn't take it. Now? A hundred billion won't cut it. It's a trillion. So, are you going to come up with it,or pretend this meeting never happened?"

The sheer number nearly made Bruno choke. "A trillion? You can't be serious! Even if all eight of us pooled our wealth, we wouldn't have that much!"

Daniela's voice remained unhurried. "But you haven't even tried. How can you be so sure?" Ultimately, Lillian tossed both Bruno and his gifts right out the door.

"Scram! Who do you think you are, acting all high and mighty? Please! When I was spending millions like pocket change,you were still scraping by in the slums!"she mocked.

A powerful business mogul, yet here he was-thrown out like a nobody. Onlookers gawked, and some even pulled out their phones to record.

By nightfall, Bruno's humiliation had become industry gossip.

Word spread like wildfire-Bruno Deleon was tossed out of Elite Lux by a secretary.

In a dimly lit private lounge, Bruno fumed at the remaining seven.

"I haven't been humiliated like this in years! Daniela is insufferable! Absolutely unbearable! What now? Does she run the market? She demands a hundred billion,and we just hand it over? She demands a trillion, and we magically find it? Who does she think she is? It's all because of Cedric! She acts untouchable now, but back when she was chasing after Alexander, wasn't she meek and submissive? Hackett! Say something!"

Hackett,silent until now, narrowed his eyes and turned to Bruno. Bruno frowned. "What are you getting at?"

Hackett smirked. "Even the most powerful men have their weaknesses-especially for beautiful women.If we can't sway Daniela, we need someone else in Cedric's ear. Someone loyal to us, and utterly irresistible."

Bruno blinked in disbelief. "Isn't Daniela exactly that?"

No matter what they thought of her, they had to admit-Daniela was stunning.

Hackett let out a knowing chuckle. "No matter how beautiful she is, I'm sure Cedric would get bored.Bruno, that beauty you've been keeping under wraps might be just the answer."
###Chapter 536 Who Would Be Next
Bruno clung to the hope that the woman he had kept could shift the balance in his favor.

He hosted an extravagant banquet, expecting Cedric's presence, but the man never showed.

Before Bruno could come up with his next move, he was hit by a crushing defeat so absolute that any attempt to recover felt impossible.

His phone buzzed incessantly with calls from the marketing department.

"Mr. Deleon, there's a major problem with our latest game."

"Mr. Deleon, hackers have cracked our newest release;pirated copies are flooding the market!"

"Mr.Deleon, our market share has plunged from 50%down to a mere 5%!"

"Mr. Deleon, our stock is on the verge of a historic crash!"

"Mr.Deleon..." Bruno was drowning in dire reports. Yet he was completely incapable of stopping the downfall.

Once more, he stood at Elite Lux's entrance,the time since his last visit feeling like an eternity.

Memories surfaced-his last visit, his harsh words towards Daniela.

Now,Daniela remained untouchably brilliant, while he teetered on the edge of financial ruin.

Bruno took a step towards the entrance of Elite Lux.

The security guard smirked. "Apologies, Mr. Deleon.No appointment, no access."

Bruno lifted his gaze to the towering building, tears carving paths down his face.

With a hollow thud, he collapsed to his knees at the entrance.

The pride he once flaunted now mirrored the depth of his current desperation.

He bellowed, "Cedric! Please! Just one more chance!I'm begging you,Cedric!"

Onlookers gathered, watching as Bruno slapped himself repeatedly.

Blood seeped from his lips, dripping onto the  pavement in crimson streaks.

Without warning, the heavens unleashed a torrential downpour.

The crowd scattered, leaving Bruno drenched and alone, his desperate cries slicing through the rain."Cedric! Please! See me!"

The sound of approaching footsteps made Bruno's head snap up in shock.

Cedric loomed over him, an umbrella in hand, his gaze icy. "Your chance is long gone."
Bruno latched onto Cedric's leg, his voice trembling."I swear, I never meant to cross you! I shouldn't have insulted your wife. I get it now. Please, have mercy!"

Cedric peered down at Bruno, whose outward submission was betrayed by his tightly balled fists.

A lethal glint flickered in Cedric's eyes.

If not for men like Bruno, Daniela would have remained the radiant young woman she once was.

He could never erase the image of Daniela, broken and despondent.

A girl once as luminous as a princess had been dimmed by their greed. After all this time by his side, Daniela was only now relearning how to smile and truly unwind.

People admired Daniela's strength, but who remembered that she was just twenty-four?

A young woman in her prime, meant to bask in love and parental care, had instead carved out an empire with her own hands.

The world called her formidable, but all he felt was sorrow for her struggles.

Daniela was so remarkable, so gentle, so full of life.Yet because of these people, she endured so much pain.

A storm of hatred and fury brewed in Cedric's gaze.

He sent Bruno flying with a kick. "Mercy doesn't exist in my world!"

Bruno lifted his gaze, only to meet Cedric's unyielding,icy stare.

"Cedric, why? Why are you doing this to me? I don't understand!"

Cedric's lips curled into a cold, indifferent smile."Because you had it coming!"

Bruno stumbled back to the commerce association, a  mere shell of the man he once was.

Inside the conference room, the remaining seven members were already gathered.

Their eyes flickered with astonishment-some surprised, some fearful, others indifferent to his downfall.

Hackett sighed."Bruno,you got too careless."

The rest nodded in silent agreement.

Huey smirked. "If you ask me, your plan was weak.Otherwise,how could you fall so completely, with no way to fight back?"

Farley nodded. "You should've secured the shareholders from the beginning. Now, you've lost their trust and control."

Bruno scanned the room-each of them speaking as though they bore no responsibility.

He threw his head back and laughed a loud, unhinged laugh. He clutched his stomach, pointing at them,laughing until tears rolled down his face.

Hackett frowned. "Bruno, have you lost it? It's just one defeat. Is it really that bad?"
Bruno stood, wiping away his tears. "Is it worth it? Easy for you to say when you're not the one suffering-but  don't worry, your turn is coming."

With that, Bruno turned and strode toward the exit."Let's see if you stay this composed when it's your head on the chopping block."

Just as he reached the door, he paused and turned back. His sharp gaze locked onto Hackett's.

"You yes, you. You orchestrated Brylee's death. Just wait. Daniela will come for you! Ha-ha!"

Bruno's crazed laughter echoed through the halls of the association.

A moment ago, the room had been full of chatter and amusement; now, everyone sat frozen, their smiles erased.

In that instant, a single thought consumed them all.

Who would be next?
###Chapter 537 How Clueless!
Daniela had expected that sooner or later, someone from the commerce association would come and visit her.

What she hadn't anticipated, however, was that it would be two.

They arrived separately, one after the other.

Winslow was the first to show up, patiently waiting downstairs for more than an hour.

As lunchtime neared,he finally stepped into the dining area,stopping beside Daniela. "Ms. Harper, may I have five minutes of your time?"

Daniela lifted her gaze,briefly glancing at Cedric.

"You're hee for me?" she asked, her tone measured.
She had always thought the association members were blind fools, clinging to the illusion that Cedric was the true power behind everything. Yet here stood someone who actually seemed to have some sense.

Winslow, ever reserved, simply nodded,his posture and tone radiating deference towards Daniela. "Yes. I came to speak with you." Daniela gave a slight nod. "What do you want?"

Lowering his voice, Winslow spoke. "Most believe Cedric is the mastermind, but I know better. Yourtitle as the world's richest person is no accident-it's earned. I've always respected your business acumen,though I've never had the opportunity to say so in person."

Daniela brushed off the compliment. "Get to the point."

Winslow got straight to the point. "When the association was first formed, I was the last to become a member, holding the eighth position. Many of its earlier dealings had already taken place by then,including that particular matter. By the time I became part of it, everything was already nearing its conclusion, and I had no role in that incident whatsoever."

That "incident" was Brylee's death. He deliberately left it unsaid, trusting that Daniela would catch his meaning.

As he spoke, he pulled a check from his pocket. "I won't deny that I profited from it-roughly fifty million dollars. I did the math yesterday. That money never sat right with me, and it's time it went back where it belongs. With interest, calculated at your earning rate,that brings the total to two billion." Winslow slid the check forward. "Regarding the eighty billion you demanded, the others refuse to pay, but l will. If we split it evenly among the eight of us,that's ten billion each. I'll add five billion on top of that,as an apology. That makes my total fifteen billion.Please review the numbers. If anything is off, let me know,and I'll correct it immediately."

Winslow kept his head lowered as he spoke, the very image of sincerity and humility.

Daniela's eyes flicked to the check resting on the table.

Winslow had spoken of fifteen billion, yet the check in his hands boldly displayed twenty billion.

He was indeed a smart man.

Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile as she passed the check to Lillian. "Please donate this to a charity for those less fortunate, on my behalf."

Winslow bent even lower in a deep bow. "Ms. Harper,I'll take my leave now. If you ever require my assistance again, simply have Lillian notify me, and I'll give it my all."

With those words, Winslow departed with great respect, never once lifting his head during the entire exchange. From the moment he entered until his departure, a mere five minutes passed.

As soon as he was gone,Lillian commented to Daniela,"He's clever, knowing to come to you instead of Cedric. His humility speaks volumes. He's quite impressive."

Daniela picked up her fork, taking her time with each bite.
Hackett had just exited his car when his attention was drawn to a sleek black car, weaving through the rain.

He pointed to the car, asking his secretary, "Whose car is that? It looks familiar. Could it belong to one of our members?"

The car sped off, and the secretary adjusted his glasses, straining to get a better look, but it had already blended into the flow of traffic. "Mr. Graves,I can't make it out clearly."

"Never mind, let's head inside."

The secretary quickly held an umbrella over Hackett.

Hackett wasn't tall, but his well-tailored, elegant suit gave him an air of dignity.

He took his seat across from Daniela at the dining table, a smile playing on his lips. "Mr. Phillips, may I have the honor of sharing a meal with you?"

Compared to Winslow, Hackett seemed far less appealing. His purpose was to speak with Cedric, so he merely nodded politely at Daniela before shifting his focus entirely to Cedric.

"I wasn't expecting company," Cedric said, dishing out some food for Daniela, his tone flat. "Mr. Graves,what brings you here?"

Hackett chuckled lightly. "Indeed, I have a matter to discuss with you."

Having held the presidency of the business association for far too long, Hackett was unwilling to lower himself.

He managed a strained smile, attempting to appear polite. "Mr. Phillips, may we speak privately?"

His request clearly implied he wished to exclude Daniela.

Before Cedric could respond, Lillian let out a soft chuckle from the side.

Hackett, slightly puzzled, asked with a forced smile,"What's so amusing?"

Lillian crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. "I'm amused by how clueless you are, begging the wrong person.It's surprising you've made it as president of the ommerce association."
###Chapter 538 Then I'll Wait For You
It had been many years since anyone had dared to speak to Hackett in such a manner.

Not even Brylee would have been bold enough to speak to him like this in the past.

Hackett fought to hide the flush creeping up his neck.He briefly shut his eyes, inhaled deeply, and then forced a tight smile at the corners of his mouth.

"Ms. Harper," Hackett said with a faint smile, trying to project generosity, though the anger simmering in his eyes was barely concealed. "You really should keep your subordinates under control."

Hackett turned his steely gaze to Daniela, "Ms. Harper,with such an expansive business,it would be quite the scandal if people learned you couldn't even manage your own team properly."

Hackett let out a cold, humorless laugh before tilting his head slightly, locking eyes with Cedric, his tone now laced with respect. "Right,Mr.Phillips?"

He was clearly attempting to impress Cedric, putting on an act. Daniela let out a sharp snort of laughter.

Cedric joined in the laughter, and for reasons he couldn't pinpoint, Hackett felt an unexpected twinge of unease.

Then Cedric said, "Lillian is family. We can't treat her as an outsider. What's the matter, Mr. Graves? Do you have an issue with that?"

Hackett's face drained of color at the words. He had clearly made a blunder.

"Oh, I see. I thought she was just a secretary. How thoughtless of me."

Hackett let out a quiet sigh of relief, quickly glancing over at Lillian.

She stood with her arms crossed, her expression aloof and indifferent.

After a rough start, Hackett leaned in,lowering his voice. "May I have a word? There's a small matter I'd like to discuss."

Cedric looked at Daniela, who gave a small,knowing smile.

Cedric rose to his feet, with Hackett quickly following.
Cedric took a seat a few paces away from Daniela.  Hackett settled into the chair next to Cedric.

Hackett forced a smile. "Everyone knows how deeply you cherish your wife. And I could see it now.

Cedric's expression remained unreadable.

Hackett pressed on, "However, I believe your wife is a bit too ruthless. In business, we should greet people with warmth to ensure success."

Cedric arched an eyebrow, his expression still cool. "Is that so?"

Hackett opened his mouth to respond when Cedric casually added, "Are you implying that your.family's success is thanks to your wife winning favor from others?"

Hackett's face stiffened at the words, his expression locking in place. After all, no one dared speak to the president of the commerce association in such a manner.

Hackett's face remained rigid for a long moment before he clenched his teeth and said, "Mr. Phillips,you must be joking. I was simply offering some advice.Maintaining a balanced relationship is essential. I've heard your wife was your first love, so it's natural for you to be so protective of her. But if you focus too much on your wife, your standing at home will suffer.
In love, it's vital to maintain the upper hand." Cedric's gaze grew cold, his eyes locking onto Hackett.

Hackett's face took on a smug grin. "There are three tricks to dealing with women. Would you like to hear them? First, don't spoil them too much, but don't ignore them either. Treat them like a cat-tease them when you're interested, and give them space when you're not. Second, don't give them too much power.Otherwise, they'll start thinking they're someone important, and it will be harder to put them in their place. Third, don't shower them with too much money or let them flaunt themselves in public. Keep them like a bird in a cage, dependent on you. This way,they'll always rely on you, a puppet in your hands."

With each word, Cedric's expression grew icier.

Hackett had often shared these thoughts with others,and as the president of the association, he was accustomed to flattery. He felt a sense of satisfaction sharing his "insights" with Cedric, believing it might bring him closer to him.

Business and women were always the best topics to bond over. A couple of drinks and men would treat each other like old friends.

"Mr. Graves," Cedric called out.

Hackett smiled, responding, "Yes?"
"If I remember correctly, you started your career in the entertainment industry, didn't you?"

Hackett,slightly puzzled,replied,"Yes."

"I recall your female artists often play roles as independent, strong, and dignified women. So, in your view, are women just meant to depend on men?"

Hackett chuckled. "That's just a marketing strategy.Women today love that image, don't they? They seem independent and strong, but deep down, they're still fragile and need support. We just give the market what it wants."

Hackett's film company had produced many female-led blockbusters,each a hit.

No one expected that beneath the facade of championing female independence, Hackett actually held women in contempt.

"Mr. Phillips, you're just too devoted. We should talk more about these matters in the future. You'll see how enjoyable it can be." Hackett grinned at Cedric. "I wonder if you'd be interested in visiting my home. My three daughters just returned from studying abroad and are at home. They all admire you greatly."

Cedric glanced at Hackett's sycophantic grin, his stomach turning with disgust. "Is that so?" "Mr.Graves, you really go all out for business. Don't forget, I'm a married man."

Hackett chuckled. "That's why I think you're too attached. Only those with little would rely on marriage to secure their lifestyle. What's its true value, other than polishing your public image?' For men, pleasure is what really matters."

Hackett left with a smug grin, handing Cedric a note with his home address before exiting. "I'll be waiting for you at my home,Mr. Phillips."

With that, Hackett left, his smile widening.

Just as Cedric was about to toss the note into the trash, Daniela stepped forward and stopped him.
###Chapter 539 A Dangerously Seductive Man
Cedric shot Daniela a confused look.

Daniela glanced at Ryan and asked, "Did you record what Hackett just said?"

Ryan quickly nodded.

A playful smile crossed Daniela's lips as she turned back to Cedric. "I'd like to see what his daughters look like."

Cedric's expression soured instantly as if he'd just bitten into a lemon. "I'd rather not."

He despised those gatherings where girls drenched themselves in perfume so heavily it clashed like an overused air freshener, the chaotic mix of scents giving him an instant headache.

He'd much rather be at home cuddling with his wife.

Starting a family with her was something he looked forward to.

"Let's go," Daniela said with a playful smile at Cedric."I'm curious what kind of daughters a man like him has raised." Cedric let out a reluctant sigh. "Fine. But if I see anything unpleasant,you owe me."

That evening, as soon as they got home, Cedric wasted no time pulling Daniela upstairs.

The next day, just when Daniela finally had the chance to sleep in, Hackett sent a message to confirm the dinner plans.

By evening, Cedric leaned in, his breath deliberately teasing Daniela's skin as he whispered, "If you don't get up now, we'll miss dinner at Hackett's home."

Then, pressing a gentle kiss against her, his voice turned playful, laced with affection. "Or we could just stay home and play our own little game instead."

As he spoke, his fingers trailed up her flat stomach slowly and deliberately.

But just as they reached a certain point, Daniela caught his hand, stopping him in his tracks. "I'm getting up now!"

Daniela practically bolted out of bed, rushing to the bathroom. "I need to freshen up!"

Cedric chuckled as he stretched out on the bed,utterly amused.

Standing at the sink, Daniela lazily brushed her teeth,  feeling every bit of the exhaustion lingering in her body.Cedric had been experimenting with some new tricks lately, and she was paying the price for it,completely worn out.

"Why do you look so drained? Was last night not satisfying?"

Cedric's usual stern expression melted into something softer, laced with desire, making his eyes all the more mesmerizing.

And in this state, Cedric was undeniably captivating.

In moments like these, Daniela recalled Lillian's words about Cedric. He was dangerously seductive.

Right now, Cedric was the very embodiment of temptation.

He lowered his gaze, his fingers tracing a slow, lazy path down her back. He leaned in, his lips brushing against her ear, his voice husky and intimate. "Shall we try something new,my dear?"

How he said those last two words sent a shiver down her spine.

Daniela swallowed hard. She was still recovering from last night. The bathroom was a disaster, and she couldn't even look at it.

Another round? There wasn't even a place leftto do  it again.

Apparently, Cedric had the same realization because he let out a long, dramatic sigh.

When Daniela finally emerged from the bathroom,feeling refreshed, she found Cedric on the phone.

"Yes,the villa in the south of the city. Make the entire second floor one massive room. Have the designer send over the layout."

Daniela opened her mouth wide surprised.

That was a villa spanning several hundred square meters.

Cedric wanted to turn the entire second floor into one massive room? Had he lost his mind?
As Daniela stood stunned, Cedric turned to her with a mischievous smirk. His sirt was unbuttoned, his loose collar offering a tantalizing glimpse of his bare chest.

He stood there, effortlessly relaxed, radiating an irresistible allure from head to toe.

Daniela drew in a sharp breath.

Lillian was right all along.

He was a dangerously seductive man.
###Chapter 540 A Mischievous Grin
Lillian knocked on the door. "Daniela, the car is ready."

That evening, Daniela was joined by Ryan, Lillian, and Nina on her outing.

At the wheel was Cedric.

As they arrived, Hackett's eyes first landed on Cedric behind the wheel.

His face beamed with smiles,but when Cedric opened the door and Daniela stepped out, his grin faltered ever so slightly.

Cedric asked, "What's the matter? Can't bring my wife along?"

Hackett quickly masked his discomfort with a strained smile. "Of course,you can!"

As they followed Hackett inside, Daniela was struck by how the unassuming exterior of the house gave way to a world of hidden opulence.

First, a vast sea of blooming flowers greeted them,followed by an endless stretch of manicured golf greens, and yet another garden before they reached
 the villa.

It was no surprise that Hackett had suggested driving in.

Daniela took in her surroundings with interest,her smile widening. "Mr. Graves, it seems you employ over fifty servants, mostly women except for the security. Your public support for women seems more than just words."

Hackett let out a hearty laugh.

The group followed him through the doors, greeted by an interior so opulent it could have been lifted from a classic painting.

Their eyes were drawn to priceless antiques,while the luxurious surroundings were complemented by the soothing sound of flowing water.

Even Nina, a seasoned traveler, couldn't hide her amazement. "This isn't a home; it's like living in a palace."

Delighted by the praise, Hackett clapped his hands,and in an instant, the maids appeared to serve the dishes.Each plate was a masterpiece of culinary art.
Hackett clapped once more, and three young women descended the stairs, their anklets chiming softly with each step, lending an enchanting charm to the villa. "Allow me to introduce my three daughters," Hackett said.

Nina was already captivated.

One of them was the epitome of purity and grace,her large eyes seeming to hold a gentle, flowing stream within them. Her smile was so captivating that even Nina, a woman herself, felt her heart flutter with admiration.

Daniela observed the three girls. Hackett had truly spared no expense.

After dinner, Hackett concocted a reason to take Cedric to meet an important shareholder, guiding him to his study.

Inside the study, Hackett poured coffee for Cedric with a cheerful demeanor. "Mr. Phillips, I hope the meal was to your liking."

Cedric gave a curt nod.

Hackett offered a faint smile as the study door swung open.

His three daughters stepped in and greeted Cedric."Hello,Mr.Phillips."

Hackett flashed a smile before stepping out of the room. Cedric rose from his seat as well.

Hackett quickly flashed a smile and said, "Mr.Phillips,please make yourself comfortable. I'll return shortly."

It was evident that Hackett intended to leave Cedric alone with his daughters.

Though Cedric had encountered many unsavory situations, this one still left a bad taste in his mouth.

Noticing Cedric's frosty demeanor, Hackett quickly added, "Mr. Phillips, did my words yesterday hold no weight?"

Hackett waved dismissively, signaling for his daughters to leave the room.

"Mr. Phillips, my three daughters are quite stunning.Are you interested in any of them? I'd like to propose a deal."

It was at this moment that Hackett's true intentions became clear.

"I know Daniela is just a figurehead. You're the one pulling the strings in the business world. I hope you'll cease your efforts and give us some space." Hackett smiled faintly. "As part of the deal, my three daughters will be at your disposal."

Cedric narrowed his eyes. "All three?" Hackett nodded. "It's their fortune to be with someone like you. Rest assured, they've been raised to be ideal companions."

Meanwhile, downstairs, Daniela was savoring the fruit,while Cedric descended with a sour expression.

Daniela beamed, offering the fruit in her hand. "It's a new variety. Very delicious. You should try it."

Cedric cast a helpless glance at Daniela, who seemed unfazed by everything, before pulling her up and saying,"Let's go."

Hackett bid them farewell. "Mr. Phillips, if you decide,have your secretary reach out to me. I'll be waiting for you!"
On their way back, Daniela continued to enjoy the fruit she had just sampled at the villa. The tomatoes were small, fresh, and juicy,bursting with sweetness.

Lillian and Nina each picked one, their eyes lighting up with delight after tasting it.

Cedric sighed deeply. "You three only care about the food. Daniela, if you keep eating like this, someone might steal your husband away!"

Daniela,oblivious to him, continued discussing the new tomato variety with Lillian and Nina. Cedric closed his eyes in frustration, and after stepping out of the car, he called his secretary to look into the fruit, casting a resentful glance at Daniela.

As Daniela was gently laid back on the bed, her senses were filled with the sweet aroma of the fruit.

Cedric's mind began to blur, and he found himself muttering,"This fruit really is delicious."

Daniela, exhausted, nestled in Cedric's arms and let out a soft laugh.

"What's so funny?" Cedric asked, trying to sound authoritative.

Daniela, unfazed, kissed Cedric on the lips. "Whyare you upset?"

"You don't care about me!" Cedric accused, his voice tinged with frustration.

"How could I not care about you?"

Cedric's expression darkened as he pulled her close,holding her tightly.

Daniela asked, "Didn't you notice? Those three girls don't resemble Hackett at all. Not only that, but they don't even look like sisters."

Cedric's grip loosened, and he slowly lowered his head,  considering her words.

Daniela gazed up at Cedric, her smile full of mischief.
###Chapter 541 It Was Daniela All Along
Hackett was certain no man could resist beautiful women, especially ones as mesmerizing as his three daughters.

His secretary muttered, "Do you think Cedric will take the bait?"

Hackett snorted, a mocking laugh escaping him. "I have whatever type he likes."

At his words, the secretary quickly averted her gaze,a fleeting look of fear passing through her eyes.

Hackett gave his secretary a quick glance, grinned,and tugged her into the room.

The night dragged on,filled with the anguished sobs of the secretary.

The following day, the commerce association gathered once again for another meeting.

But this time, Winstow was absent.

Marc furrowed his brow. "What's happening with Winslow? We're at a turning point. Cedric just took down Bruno, and we have no idea who's next. Does Winslow really think Cedric won't go after him?"

Huey narrowed his eyes at the group, a sharp warning in his voice, "Listen up, we're a team. If anyone tries to cozy up to Cedric behind our backs, don't say I didn't warn you. I'll be ruthless if I find out!"

At Huey's words, the group quickly murmured their assurances. Yet in their minds, the opposite was true.It seemed smarter to offer a token of goodwill.

After all, if they ended up as the next target, they might end up like Bruno, who could barely afford a luxury hotel these days. If not for marrying off his daughter to the head of a global corporation, his company would have crumbled.

The group was deep in thought as the meeting continued.

After the meeting, everyone sent their gifts to Cedric.

Taking Daniela's advice to heart, Cedric accepted them all,putting the givers at ease.

The only one who didn't send a gift was Huey,and the other seven exchanged looks of pity.

Huey ruled the hardware industry, from basic screws and scissors to advanced aerospace components, and his products were unparalleled.

Over the years, he'd ruthlessly acquired any competitors that dared to emerge, monopolizing the field.

The only challenge to his reign had been Brylee,whose innovative hardware company shattered Huey's monopoly.

Brylee had been the only one to have succeeded in this over the years.

Huey was arrogant, ranking third in the association but carrying himself like a top dog.

He dismissed the fear that gripped the others, secretly plotting to take on Cedric.

So,he scoffed at the idea of sending gifts.

Daniela had set hersights on Huey next.

When his authority was first challenged, he was the one who suggested eliminating Brylee by any means before anyone else even thought of it.

The day before Daniela made her move,she attended a banquet.

Cedric, occupied with greeting international guests,mentioned he woutd be arriving late.

From a distance, Huey spotted Daniela and made his way towards her,holding a glass of wine. "Ms. Harper," he greeted in a dismissive tone.

Daniela gazed at him with indifference.

"What's with the attitude?" he sneered. "Everyone knows you're just a puppet for Cedric. He's the one behind it all."

Daniela gave Huey a look that suggested he was an idiot.

Huey chuckled, leaning in closer to whisper, "Being with Cedric isn't easy, huh? Let me show you a better way. If you ever choose to leave him, come to me.I promise you'll live a life of ease."
He took in Daniela's delicate profile, then added, "You look just like your mother. Maybe you could do what she wouldn't. I'd be more than happy to welcome it."

His words were laced with a suggestive undertone.

Lillian quickly stormed over and slapped him.

Enraged, Huey attempted to retaliate,but Ryan kicked him away.

The commotion drew the attention of everyone at the banquet.

Daniela stood facing Huey, her eyes cold and emotionless. She moved closer to him, bent down, and with a soft chuckle,whispered something in his ear.

At her words, Huey's face drained of color, turning pale and pitiful.

That night, Elite Lux made their move.

Every one of Huey's ships bound for overseas was ambushed by pirates.

Eleven ships, packed with valuable goods, disappeared without a trace.

After receiving the call, Huey slumped into his chair,hastily arranging to meet Cedric, only to be told Cedric was still occupied with the foreign guests.

Huey bribed the hotel staff to gain access to the surveillance footage, confirming that Cedric hadn't made any calls during the meeting.

A cold sweat broke out along Huey's spine.

This meant the real mastermind wasn't Cedric. It was Daniela all along!

And tonight, he had insulted not just Daniela, but her late mother as well.

Huey's eyes widened in disbelief, his mind going blank as he struggled to comprehend the situation.
###Chapter 542 Submitting

The eleven ships contained Huey's entire fortune.

His legs shook uncontrollably.

He couldn't decide whether this was just bad luck or if
Daniela was behind the whole thing.

Desperate, he reached out to every contact he had,
hoping to recover the goods from the ships.

Huey dialed Hackett's number.

Hackett,dismissive of the situation, responded, "What does Daniela have to do with this? Even Cedric couldn't pull something like this off. Eleven ships with hundreds of containers, worth billions. Do you really think Cedric has the power to do that? Even if he did,he couldn't sell it all."

Huey voiced his suspicion. "What if it's Daniela instead of Cedric? She has connections overseas!"

Hackett laughed out loud. "Huey, have you lost your senses? Daniela? She's insignificant! Do you believe she could hijack so many of your ships? If it were really her, I'd cover your losses, no problem."

Hackett burst into laughter on the phone. Huey looked down, saying, "I just confronted Daniela today, and then, my ships were ambushed by pirates.How could that be a coincidence?"

Hackett chuckled. "Don't worry. I'll look into it, but with that much lost at sea, it's usually gone for good.Brace yourself."

Hackett ended the call.

Huey spat,seething with anger.

He stood by the hotel entrance, waiing for Cedric to finish with his foreign guests.

Over half an hour later, Cedric finally appeared, and Huey's phone rang.

A friend told Huey, "No matter what you offer, those ships are gone for good."

Huey felt his heart drop. "Why?"

"They say you've upset someone. The goods aren't coming back. Stop wasting your time."

Desperate, Huey said, "You've been in this game for over fifty years. Don't you have any sway? This represents everything I've worked for. Those raw materials are of no use to them. These are client orders, and if I mniss the deadline, I'll face heavy penalties! It will destroy me!" The person on the other end paused for a moment,then said, "I can't help you here. I don't have that kind of influence. You should find someone locally to produce a new batch and beg the person you've angered for mercy. That might be your only shot."

Huey sighed, ending the call.

He needed to locate a factory to produce the goods,but where could he possibly find one?

In his days of monopoly, he'd crush any competitor at the slightest challenge.

Now, there wasn't even a small workshop available,let alone a factory.
Huey looked up and saw Cedric had already departed with the foreign guests, leaving the area deserted.

Feeling defeated, he told his driver to head for Daniela's place.

As Cedric returned from the reception, he noticed Daniela holding a shivering stray puppy in her arms.

As they got ready to take the puppy to the vet, Huey showed up.

"Not right now," Daniela said, pointing to Cedric behind her. "Talk to Cedric." This time, Huey was more cautious.

He gave Cedric a quick glance before following Daniela as she walked out.

"Ms. Harper, I know a great pet hospital with skilled doctors.Follow my car."
Huey's behavior now was utterly submissive, a sharp contrast to the arrogance he displayed at the banquet and his ruthless nature after being humiliated by Lillian.

The puppy was taken to the hospital, and Cedric gently placed a coat over Daniela's shoulders.

"Ms. Harper, today's incident was a misunderstanding.
I'm truly sorry! I spoke without thinking! I was
incredibly drunk! Please don't hold it against me."

Cedric turned to face Huey, his brows furrowed in confusion. "What exactly did you say?" His voice carried an underlying menace.

Huey's heart dropped. "I forgot. It was a slip of the tongue, not intentional. Please, I'm really sorry!"

Huey, known for his appearances on financial channels, was typically arrogant and dismissive.

The last time he visited this pet hospital, he'd even assaulted a doctor.
Now, his submissive behavior, almost bowing in front of them,was a gratifying sight.

All eyes turned to Daniela in curiosity.

They hadn't anticipated that the CEO of Elite Lux would be so powerful.

After all, this was Huey.

Daniela's expression remained calm as she took the puppy from the doctor and said to Huey, "I told you,if you have a problem, talk to Cedric. It's pointless to speak to me."

Huey quickly responded, "If talking to you is useless,then I have no one left to beg. Ms. Harper,it's all my fault. Please speak to whoever took my ships and ask them for mercy. If I lose these goods, I'll be ruined!"He begged earnestly.

Daniela instructed the vet, "Give it a vaccine. I'm keeping this dog."

The vet, intimidated, glanced at Huey and asked nervously, "What will youname your pet?"

Daniela responded, "Monster."

Huey's jaw dropped in shock. He couldn't fathom that the tiny puppy would have such a name.Monster? But there was no time for him to dwell on it. As the vet took the dog inside, Huey immediately begged Daniela. "Ms. Harper, please, have mercy on me."

Daniela looked at Huey, observing as he slowly knelt before her.

People moved about them.

Daniela, dressed casually, remained indifferent,her eyes emotionless. She wondered if her mother could see this. The ones who once inflicted harm upon her mother were now finally bowing to her.
###Chapter 543 Women Are Men's Accessories
Nineteen long years had elapsed since the tragedy of Brylee's untimely demise.

This day had come too late. But fortunately, it had finally come.

Daniela accepted the puppy from the vet, before slipping into her car to head home.

Huey trailed behind her every step of the way.

At the entrance of the villa, Daniela paused on the stone steps. Her gaze, cold and piercing, landed on Huey, as if looking at a dead man.

Her words sent a shiver down Huey's spine. "This is just the beginning. Why give up now?"

Huey,visibly shaken,raised his head to meet Daniela's steely eyes, which glittered menacingly under the moonlit sky.

Overcome by a mix of fear and uncertainty, he remained kneeling outside the villa until the stroke of midnight. Gradually, the realization dawned on him that his waiting was in vain. Numbness crept into his knees, yet with a burst of resentful determination,he forced himself to his feet.

As dawn painted the sky, Huey found himself at the commerce association.

The moment Bruno caught sight of him, a smirk curled his lips. "Didn't expect to see you this early."

Huey's response was a silent, chilling glare that he directed towards Bruno, his eyes narrowing into slits.

Bruno grinned. "Remember how you mocked me before? At least I managed to hold out for two days.What about you? A mere phone call was all it took for you to crumble!"

He vividly remembered the scorn in Huey's voice when he had desperately sought assistance,how Huey had derided him with a smug sneer plastered across his face.

By ten o'clock that morning, everyone had convened.

Bruno, having resigned himself to his fate, exuded an air of unusual calm.

Hackett, having presented his gift, appeared utterly disinterested.
Winslow stretched languidly, curling up in a corner and shutting his eyes; the others couldn't tell if he was  actually sleeping or merely feigning it.

Huey's fist came down hard on the table, his voice seething with rage. "Daniela is venomous! If she dares,I want her to face me herself! She's behind all this,using underhanded tactics! She's stripped me of everything. Her greed knows no bounds! Hackett,you've witnessed my ruin. If you remain passive, it won't just be our association that appears weak-your companies will be jeopardized as well. I may have been stripped of everything, but I refuse to let this go unanswered! You simply can't turn a blind eye to this Who's next on the list?"

Tension rippled through the group as they traded wary looks.

Hackett scrunched his features in concentration,the pieces of the puzzle gnawing at his mind. "What did you just say? She's behind all this?"

Huey nodded. "Daniela herself admitted it! She was playing dumb and outsmarting us all! We've all been deceived by her!"

Color drained from Hackett's face as the revelation sank in.

Daniela was the mastermind behind it all?

But he had given his gift to Cedric.  Hackett's heart sank.

Winslow observed Hackett with a disinterested yet piercing gaze. He saw the sudden ashen look on Hackett's face,the stiffening of his posture.

Dropping his gaze, Winslow said, "Hackett, what's got you so rattled all of a sudden? Does it really make a difference whether the mastermind is Daniela or Cedric?"

With that, all eyes turned to Hackett.
Hackett's heart thudded painfully against his ribs, yet he managed to drape a cloak of feigned outrage over his features. "What exactly are you suggesting? I'm utterly astonished at the depths of Daniela's cunning."

Marcus' gaze sharpened as he scrutinized Hackett, a flicker of suspicion crossing his features.

Despite lengthy discussions, the meeting concluded without any decisive outcomes.

As for the goods from Huey's company, their best resolution was merely a promise to dispatch an investigator soon.

Huey departed, his steps heavy, the glaring sunlight outside intensifying his sense of defeat.

Later that afternoon, Hackett returned to Elite Lux,his hands filled with elaborately wrapped gifts.

Perfectly timing his entrance with the lunch hour,he perched in the cafeteria, a practiced smile playing on his lips as he waited for Daniela.

Before sitting down with Cedric, Daniela said to Lillian."We must enhance our security measures. Tell Ryan to implement a faciaI recognition system at the entrance of the cafeteria. It's imperative that we restrict access to employees only."

Lillian acknowledged with a quick nod.

Hackett's smile briefly faltered as he addressed Daniela. "I hope you don't mind my impromptu visit.Ms. Harper. Your fondness fo jade came to mind when I spotted some exquisite pieces at last night's auction. I couldn't resist getting them for you."

He gingerly set a lavish gift box on the table, its price tag boldly indicating five hundred million-a testament to its value, accompanied by a gleaming certificate.

Daniela,raising an eyebrow, responded with a mix of amusement and suspicion, "This is incredibly generous of you. But are the others in the association aware of this?"

In stark contrast to Cedric, Daniela exuded an icy aloofness, her polite detachment rendering her seemingly unapproachable.

Hackett's heart fluttered anxiously in his chest, yet he managed to conjure up a strained smile.

As he was gearing up to speak, Daniela dropped a casual bombshell. "I've heard about your three beautiful daughters."

The comment sent a shiver down Hackett's spine, his forehead beading with sweat.

Daniela's lips twitched into a slight, enigmatic smile as she continued, "My husband never tires of lauding your skills in nurturing such beautiful daughters."

At her words, Hackett's mouth twitched, caught between a grimace and a smile. He was unsure if he was being praised or subtly ridiculed.

He clung to his smile, a bit too tightly, and bowed his head slightly, masking the surge of bitterness that threatened to show.

"So, what brings you here today?" Daniela probed, her voice light but with an undercurrent of scrutiny.

Hackett let out a nervous chuckle, more of a stammer than a laugh. "Considering you're at the helm of this acquisition, I just wanted to clear the air. Any past misunderstandings-I hope there are no hard feelings."

Daniela looked at him, her expression shifting to one  of perplexity. "Why? There's nothing to clear. You seem to be overstating things. Weren't you the one who always preached that women should be seen as mere adornments for men, advising Cedric against pampering me too much? I must admit, sometimes your observations might hold a grain of truth."

Her last words, coated with a sweet, sardonic smile,sent a fresh wave of anxiety crashing over Hackett,his complexion turning ashen as the implication of her words fully dawned on him.
###Chapter 544 It's All Because Of Brylee
Cedric and Daniela couldn't have been more different.

Her indifference was absolute.

After speaking,she focused on her meal, completely ignoring Hackett.

Not even his role as the president of the commerce association influenced her.

She didn't even bother with a few concluding remarks.

Across the table, Hackett sat on pins and needles,embarrassment nibbling at him.

It wasn't until Daniela had left, without so much as a glance backward, that Hackett's face hardened. He rose,his expression cold.

The surrounding diners, familiar with Hackett, were visibly shocked. They had always seen him as a commanding figure,yet here he was, diminished by Daniela.

Murmurs filled the room.

"Hackett seemed so powerful before!" "Absolutely. At a recent auction, after he was outbid on something he wanted, the winner ended up with a broken leg. Everyone thought Hackett was untouchable."

"It's surprising to see him outmaneuvered by a young woman like Daniela, given his experience."

"Look at him, drenched in a cold sweat."

"But shouldn't all eight association members be here?What is Hackett here alone?"

"He must be trying to secure Daniela's mercy behind closed doors while boasting about his influence in public. Knowing Daniela, she won't bother to set the record straight."

While they talked, they captured Hackett's stern visage and shared the images online.

Fuming, Hackett could barely contain his anger.

It had been a long time since he had been so humiliated.

He straightened up and strode out of the Elite Lux dining hall.

Even as he walked away, the echoes of laughter followed him. "Look at him! Nothing but empty threats. We all know he's lost his edge. It's about time he stepped aside!"

As Hackett entered the elevator, his face contorted with fury, and he slammed his fist against the wall.

With renewed resolve, he vowed to bring down Elite Lux.

Hackett rushed to the commerce association and summoned the other seven members.

On the phone, he insisted they assemble urgently within half an hour to plan their counterattack against Daniela's economic measures.

As he paced, hands clenched on his hips, his anger intensified, fantasies of retribution against Daniela occupying his thoughts.

Despite his demands, thirty minutes ticked by without any of the members appearing.

The sun dipped below the horizon, and only then did Bruno walk in, unfazed by his tardiness.

"What seems to be the problem?" Hackett snapped,losing any semblance of calm. "Bruno, weren't we supposed to address a crucial issue today? Why the indifference? Am I the only one facing these sanctions? Don't you care about your enterprise anymore?"

With a smirk, Bruno dragged over a chair and settled  into it with a sigh of indifference.

Gradually, the rest began to appear, with Winslow being the last to arrive, well after ten in the evening.

Suppressing a yawn, Winslow asked, "I've got plans later.Can we get this over with in thirty minutes?"

Standing firmly, hands still on his hips, Hackett stared at them with cold contempt. "What's this supposed to mean? Are you telling me you can't even manage to gather everyone for a meeting now? Am I the only active member here? If that's your attitude, we might as well dissolve this association!"

Rage simmered within Hackett.

Marcus, wearing a grim expression, confronted him."Hackett, who are you trying to deceive? You think we're oblivious?"

Stunned, Hackett asked, "What are you implying?"

"Exactly, what are you implying?" Farley asked in a sharp tone. "Did you secretly meet with Daniela to beg for mercy? Hoping she would spare you? Hackett,should I play the recording where you malign her?"

Hackett's voice wavered as his lips tightened. "What are you implying?"
Marcus, visibly annoyed, flung his phone towards him."Take a look! You met with Daniela earlier today,right?  It's all over the internet. We never thought you'd deceive us like this."

A noticeable shock ran through Hackett. Yet,he soon regained his composure and raised his voice. "Now you're accusing me? Who was I trying to protect? Do you think I enjoyed degrading myself before Daniela?What drove me to do it? If I weren't president, I would prefer to avoid this mess. I couldn't bear to see you end up like Bruno and Huey, so I went to beg Daniela to spare everyone. Was it your assumption that l pleaded only for my own sake? Had I realized this misunderstanding, I would've indeed pleaded solely for myself.How utterly thankless!"

Hackett's face, round and flushed,quivered with what seemed to be genuine resentment.

Confused looks were exchanged among the group,with none able to discern Hackett's honesty.

Firmly, Hackett continued, "Daniela now wields considerable influence. Without solidarity, she'll overshadow us. Do you really want that to happen?This association has thrived for years, benefitting everyone. If you're ready to surrender and let a woman like Daniela command you, then I wash my hands of it."

With a smirk playing on his lips, Hackett eyed their grave expressions. "Let me clarify something else.Daniela's leniency won't extend to you simply because  you submit. Do you think she's after you for your business dealings? False! That's utterly false! This is all about Brylee's death!"
###Chapter 545 The New President
The moment those words left Hackett's lips, everyone stiffened except Winslow. His eyes stayed vacant, his expression detached, as if he were still half-asleep.

Hackett swept his gaze across the room. "Look for yourselves. If you're truly fine with this, let's just act like this meeting never took place."

Saying no more, he turned to leave.

Farley quickly got to his feet,blocking him."Hackett,take a breath. We haven't even started talking, and you're already fired up. That's not like you. We've always had each other's backs, and now you're making it sound like we're strangers. Come on, we need to stand together, don't we?"

Marc rose as well. "Exactly! With something this serious, none of us can afford to stay out of it."

Tripp Morris furrowed his brow. "We've already tried everything, and none of it worked on Daniela. What's left?"

"We've imposed sanctions, we've reasoned with her,but nothing gets through. What else is there?" A heavy silence settled over the room.

By the time Alexander returned from abroad, fresh from his plastic surgery, the entire domestic landscape had changed.

Wasting no time, he absorbed the market shares that once belonged to Bruno and Huey.

Within just two weeks, Bennett Group successfully integrated the assets of Fairburne Group.

Capitalizing on this golden opportunity, Bennett Group skyrocketed into the market's spotlight.

Richard's face lit up with excitement as he watched Bennett Group's stock rise steadily. Turning to Alexander, he said, "Alexander, we've officially made it onto the world's billionaire list. We may not be at the top yet, but it's a solid beginning."

Alexander's eyes traced the latest rankings, drifting from Bennett Group's position to the undisputed leader-Elite Lux.

Richard let out a light chuckle. "We can take our time catching up, but honestly, I don't think you need to wait until your wealth matches Daniela's. Everyone knows how effortlessly she makes money. And once you're family, does it even matter? There's no need to compete. Your wealth will end up in you children's hands anyway." Alexander nodded; the logic made perfect sense.

When lovewas genuine, wealth became irrelevant.

And Daniela wasn't the type to care about money anyway.

Alexander studied his reflection, his gaze scrutinizing the freshly refined features.

"Dad, check my left side. Does it still look uneven compared to Cedric's? It doesn't seem as seamless to me."

Richard examined him briefly. "Not atall. It's flawless.If you and Cedric walked side by side, I wouldn't be able to tell you apart."

Alexander's lips curled into a faint smile at those words.

He glanced at the inside of his arm,where there was a faint scar. With it, Daniela would never be able to tell him apart from Cedric.

"If a fake is convincing enough to fool the world,it becomes real!" Alexander mused as he kept looking at his face in the mirror. This face would be his key to winning Daniela back.

His eyes flickered to Cedric's schedule displayed on his tablet. His plan was simple--slip into Cedric's world piece by piece until he became Cedric entirely.

Hackett made his way to Richard again.

The moment Hackett placed a check for eight hundred million in front of Richard, Richard's eyes gleamed.

"No hidden agenda here. I'm getting old, and I can't hold on to this seat forever. We've all witnessed the Bennett family's rise. We believe Alexander should take over as the new president of the commerce association," said Hackett.

Richard barely contained his delight.

It was common knowledge that the association's membership fees were exorbitant.

The association's membership fees alone were enough to support countless individuals for ten lifetimes.

And the presidency? It carried perks far beyond what met the eye. In the corporate world, it was akin to holding a crown.

"A golden opportunity, huh?" Richard's gaze lingered on the check, his grip on reason hanging by a thread."But why Alexander?" Hackett flashed a knowing smile, producing an antique he had long cherished. "Come on, Richard. We're all friends here. No need for questions.Leadership should be in the hands of the capable. And with Alexander's talent, isn't he the natural choice for the top spot?"

Hackett had his eyes on Alexander because of Daniela's years of attachment to Alexander. Once Alexander took the presidency, Daniela wouldn't have the heart to move against him.

More importantly, Alexander understood Daniela better than anyone.

It was said that the closest people knew each other's weaknesses best. Compared to anyone else,Alexander had the upper hand when it came to understanding Daniela.

As for the presidency-once the dust settled, Hackett had every intention of taking it back.

For now, Alexander would be his pawn, paving the way for his true ambitions.

Hackett's scheme was meticulous. He had a knack for reaching his goals without breaking a sweat.

Hackett departed Richard's office brimming with confidence. After all, who in their right mind would turn down the presidency of the association? Hackett strode away, his confidence unwavering.

This time, Daniela dealt with Farley first, then Tripp,and finally Marcus.

After that, their reputations were left in complete shambles, and unrest spread like wildfire throughout the association.

For the first time, the association was flooded with an overwhelming number of refund requests.

Desperate, Hackett and the remaining seven rushed to the Bennett family's.

Up until this point, everyone-except for Hackett and Winslow-had suffered major financial turmoil.

Hackett, gripped by anxiety and fear, stole a glance at Winslow's unwavering calm.

A chilling realization crept in-he was next.

The looming uncertainty, paired with the certainty of his downfall, nearly shattered him.

In desperation,he gathered his people and sought out Alexander.

But this time, Richard didn't invite them in. Instead,he handed back the check and gift Hackett had previously offered. "Sorry, I spoke with my son. He told me that Daniela isn't someone who loses her temper easily or acts out of arrogance. If she's coming after you now, it means you must have done something to provoke her. We're staying out of this mess."

Hackett's expression darkened with unease. "But this is the presidency of the association! Are you saying Alexander truly has no interest in it? You might want to reconsider!"
###Chapter 546 Preparing For Pregnancy
Richard let out a faint smile. "Respect and admiration are what give the president of the commerce association real power. But if the entire industry resents them, then what's the point? When Alexander wanted to join, you shut him out without hesitation.And now, when trouble comes knocking,you turn to us. Do you really think we're stupid enough to make an enemy out of Daniela just for a title?"

At first, Richard had nearly been swayed. He had even sought out Alexander's opinion, but after Alexander had analyzed the situation thoroughly, he had been furious. These people were looking for a scapegoat.

"Richard, you're reading too much into this. The association is a force to be reckoned with. Why would we be afraid of Daniela?"

"Oh, really?" Richard scoffed. "Then why the sudden generosity? Don't take me for a fool-I know exactly what's got you all rattled. Get lost! I have nothing more to say to you!"

Richard was about to kick them out.

Hackett stepped forward. "Richard, thisis all just a  misunderstanding. How about this? When Alexander has time, we'll sit down and talk face-to-face. Would that work for you?"

Richard's brows pulled together in a deep frown.

Hackett smoothly pushed the check and gift back into Richard's hands. "We came here sincerely, after all.And let's be honest-holding a position of power comes with challenges. Otherwise,how would anyone respect it? We're not asking you to go against Daniela,just to have Alexander mediate. She's young, and being so combative won't do her any favors in the long run, right? I won't deny it-Daniela's capable.Right now, we can't match her. But luck doesn't last forever, does it? Just let Alexander know. Have him meet with us. And if you're still uneasy, then at least keep the gift."

Hackett was nothing if not calculated. Richard was completely outmaneuvered.

After Hackett's remark, Richard fell silent for a moment before muttering, "Wait here. I need to make a call."

He stepped aside, phone in hand.

Bruno narrowed his eyes. "Hackett, why does Alexander always keep such a low profile?"

Huey nodded in agreement. "Yeah, he didn't even show up at the last press conference."

Hackett's brow furrowed slightly. "Now that you mention it, it is strange. Didn't Richard say Alexander went missing? Then suddenly he turned up, and not long after, Bennett Group merged with Fairburne Group.But Joyce has vanished without a trace. None of it adds up."

Winslow cast a sharp glance at Richard, who was speaking in hushed tones over the phone. "Look into him."

A moment later, Richard returned, his phone still in hand. "Sorry, Alexander's schedule is packed. He said he'll discuss with you some other time."

Hackett smiled faintly, slipping his own phone back into his pocket. "Oh? Alexander is too busy to meet?I wonder what's keeping him so occupied."

Richard's expression hardened. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

Hackett tilted his head slightly. "Fairburne Group belonged to Joyce, didn't it? But now she's gone, and out of nowhere, all her shares fall into Alexander's hands.That company is massive-it controls a fortune in mineral resources. Hard to believe Joyce would just hand it over out of the goodness of her heart."

Richard's face darkened. Hackett's smile didn't waver. "Well, since you won't help us, I suppose we'll have some free time to investigate Joyce's disappearance instead."

Richard's anger froze on his face.

The eight men across from him saw everything clearly.

Huey's tone was ice-cold. "I suggest you bring Alexander out. We're not interested in digging into Joyce's situation-we just want to talk. There's no need for him to act so secretive, is there?"

Richard's patience was wearing thin. "Fine! I'll call him right now!"

He pulled out his phone and dialed Alexander's number.

The moment the call connected, Hackett snatched the phone straight from Richard's hand.

"Alexander, let's meet. Your position isn't solid yet,and going against the association might not be the wisest move for Bennett Group, don't you think?Besides, we mean no harm-just a conversation. If things don't go well, we won't force the issue."

Against Daniela, they didn't dare raise their voices, but when it came to Alexander, Hackett still carred an air of arrogance.
For a few seconds, the other end of the line was completely silent. Then came a cold,measured voice.
"Tomorrow night at eight. Lynklee Cafe."

The call cut off. Richard shot a furious glare at the eight men in front of him. "Would you even dare to go up against Daniela? She crushed every single one of you,and now, with nowhere left to run, you crawl to Alexander? What a bunch of damn cowards!" His rage boiled over.

Hackett, unfazed, gave a composed smile. "If you want someone to blame, blame Daniela for being too powerful. If she weren't, we wouldn't be scrambling for solutions. But don't worry-we have no intention of harming Alexander."

Even after suffering heavy losses at Daniela's hands,the association's eight most powerful companies still had plenty of influence.

And among them, Hackett held the most sway-his authority wasfar from diminished.

Just as the group was about to disperse, Winslow suddenly muttered, "Did you notice? Alexander's voice on the phone-it sounded familiar. Like someone we've met recently."
The others barely paid attention. "Who else could it be? It's just Alexander. We've heard his voice before,  so of course, it sounds familiar."

With that,they scattered.

Daniela was reviewing the latest designs when her phone vibrated with a message from Alexander.

"The association wants to meet me. Seems like they're looking to back me as the new president. How should I coordinate with you?"
She glanced at the message but didn't bother replying,focusing instead on the documents in front of her.

Later, her phone rang. It was Alexander.

Without hesitation, Daniela ignored the call and blocked the number.

A few minutes later, an unknown number popped up on her screen.

Still flipping through the files, she answered, "Hello?"

"Daniela,did you see my message?"

Her fingers turned another page. "Alexander, I thought I made myself clear before. Whatever's going on with you-it has nothing to do with me."
While Daniela spoke, Nina and Lillian were off to the side,chatting and laughing. "Is Daniela preparing for pregnancy? Cedric's been working out every day and  eating double portions. Are they trying for a baby?"

Without waiting for a response, Daniela ended the call and blocked the number.
###Chapter 547 Cedric Is Daniela's Achilles' Heel
Alexander stood rooted to the spot, his face a mask of shock and disbelief. His mind was a complete blank.
He couldn't believe what he had just heard.

Daniela was preparing for pregnancy? And she and Cedric were trying for a baby?

He had been working so hard to draw nearer to
Daniela. How could she possibly yearn for a childwith another? Why couldn't she wait for him?

It had to be Cedric! Cedric must be pressuring Daniela.

Anger surged through Alexander, his hands balling into fists so tight his nails nearly pierced the skin. He wanted nothing more than for Cedric to be gone-permanently.

Once Cedric was gone, there would be no other-just him!

He was even prepared to sacrifice his own life for Daniela-provided she reciprocated his love.

At dusk, Alexander's face bore an expression of grim resolve. The following morning, Alexander arrived at the designated meeting spot for his appointment with the eight members of the commerce association.

A partition separated them; Alexander seated on one side and the group of eight on the opposite.

Hackett peeked over repeatedly, puzzled by Alexander's motives.

Weren't they here to engage in conversation?

How was any meaningful discussion possible with that barrier in place?

The group exchanged baffled looks, shrugging at Alexander's odd conduct.
With Daniela,they had at least been able to see her face.Was Alexander trying to surpass her in aloofness?

"Forgive me. I've been under the weather recently and prefer not to be seen. Just speak freely," Alexander said firmly.

Hackett and the others were unconcerned with his absence of visibility; the business at hand was their priority.

They settled into their chairs.

Winslow glanced at the partition, a familiar sensation  returning.

"Alexander, we propose to nominate you as the president of ourassociation."

Alexander's response was cold. "And what benefit do I derive from accepting?"

Just as Hackett opened his mouth to speak, Alexander preempted him, his voice dripping with disdain."Merely a title? And you expect me to spearhead your battles? Do you truly consider me that naive?"

Bruno's expression darkened, his forehead creasing with a mixture of anger and disbelief. "Alexander,how can you speak such words? Have you forgotten that your ascent was only made possible through the doors we unlocked for you? How can you display such blatant ingratitude?"

A sardonic laugh escaped Alexander's lips. "Oh really?Doors you claim to have opened? Let's be clear-wasn't it rather that you failed to stand up to Daniela,found yourselves financially shackled, and unable to pursue other interests, which left the field open for me to capitalize on the opportunities you missed?"

Bruno's response caught in his throat, his cheeks flushing with suppressed fury as he struggled to articulate his frustration.

Huey narrowed his eyes slightly. "Alexander,  remember the time you were eager to join our association? I commanded you. Despite the outcome not being favorable, I always treated you with fairness,did I not?"

Alexander nodded. "Indeed, you did. Yet, let's not overlook the outrageous fifty million you charged for that introduction, promising me a lucrative spot within the association. And what was the outcome? My money evaporated, and the promised membership turned to dust. I was left out of the loop during the profitable times; I certainly have no intention of sharing in the losses now."

As Alexander's final words hung in the air, the tension in the room became palpable, and one by one,everyone stood, their bodies rigid with indignation.

"Alexander, curb your arrogance!" Marcus exploded,his voice resonant with fury.

Pointing a finger sharply at the screen, Bruno cursed,"Alexander, such ungratefulness is beneath you!"

A sudden crash rang out as the coffee cup smashed against the floor, splintering into shards.

Alexander's voice cut through the air, cold and sharp."Who is the ungrateful one here? Remember, you're the ones seeking my assistance!"

At his words, frustration contorted their faces on the  other side, their expressions tightening with irritation.

Hackett rose slowly, his voice deliberate. "There's no benefit in dwelling on old grievances. You must have some strategy since you agreed to this meeting.What's on your mind? Surely, you aren't inclined to let Daniela take control of everything, are you?"

However, Hackett was mistaken.

Alexander harbored no objections to Daniela holding sway.

In his eyes, Daniela's vast wealth was destined to merge with his eventually.

He was all for Daniela ascending to power.

But there was an exception.

He harbored a deep-seated desire for Cedric to fail.

In fact, he wanted nothing more than for Cedric to take his last breath.

A shadow of loathing briefly crossed Alexander's gaze,and he paused, collecting his thoughts.

Then, reclining slightly in his chair, he stated, "I have no interest in presiding over the association,nor do l wish to participate."

As Huey nearly burst with anger,Hackett restrained him. "Then what do you suggest?"

"Allow me to offer a piece of advice," Alexander stated, his tone even and measured.

Hackett's gaze darkened, his eyes sharpening with suspicion.

Could Alexander genuinely afford such generosity as a businessman? Ultimately, he refused to confront Daniela.

Alexander stated firmly, "Daniela is out of your league.Trying to take her down is futile and won't get you anywhere."

Hackett asked, "Then what's our move?"

Alexander replied, "Strike at her weak spots. What is Daniela's current priority? Target that."

Silence enveloped Hackett at those words.

Alexander explained, "Cedric is her vulnerability.Phillips Group is thriving, but with all eight of you united,you can still pose a threat. When push comes to shove, Daniela will undoubtedly rush to Cedric's side, which will give you a chance to negotiate."

Alexander's voice was steady. "Remember, if you can control Cedric, you can control Daniela. She may be tough,managing businesses that are lucrative and fast -growing, eclipsing the older, established industries.  Yet, Phillips Group isn't as formidable as her company.If you're looking for an escape, Cedric is your key."

The tension in the room began to ease as he spoke.

Hackett hesitated. "But what if Daniela intervenes to support him?"

Alexander let out a sly chuckle. "Once or twice might not count,but if she continually bails him out, Cedric's ego will take a hit, and he'll inevitably clash with Daniela. Being seen as weak and dependent on a woman will only bring him scorn. That tension could drive them apart, giving you some breathing space."

The group nodded, taking in the strategy.

Winslow asked, "And if Daniela strikes back later,aren't we back where we started?"

Without missing a beat, Alexander responded coldly,"Cross that bridge when you come to it. If you can't handle your current troubles and all eight of you go under, don't point fingers at me for seizing an opportunity."
###Chapter 548 Attacking Cedric's Company
The eight of them exited the cafe.

Bruno frowned, utterly perplexed. "What's Alexander playingat? Helping us for nothing?"

Winslow spoke, arms crossed. "No way. He wants us to take down Cedric for him. He just makes it sound like he's doing us a favor."

Huey turned to Hackett. "Hackett, what's the move?"

Hackett's expression remained cold and unreadable."We don't have a choice. Either we go along with this,or we wait to go bankrupt."

A heavy silence settled over them.

Hackett's voice hardened. "Starting tomorrow, we attack Phillips Group from all sides."

Just before leaving,Winslow glanced back at the cafe,a nagging feeling creeping in.
That voice inside didn't sound like Alexander. Who else could it have been? He couldn't place it just yet.

The eight of them spent the night strategizing. By the time the stock market opened the next morning, Phillips Group's shares took a sharp dive.

By the day's end, they had plunged to a historic low.

Rumors spread like wildfire.

Cedric returned to Phillips Group, working to contain the fallout.

Daniela studied the stock chart, her gaze darkening with every dip.

Lillian stood behind her, arms crossed. "They're smarter than I gave them credit for-targeting Cedric instead."

A heavy tension radiated from Daniela, sharper than ever before.

Even Nina, after a quick glance at her, instinctively took a step back.

Nina whispered to Lillian, "What's wrong with Daniela?"

Lillian smirked, casting a knowing look at Daniela."She's pissed."

Nina rarely saw Daniela lose her temper.

In fact, she was indifferent to most things,except Cedric. This was the first time Nina had seen her truly upset.

"So what happens now?" Nina asked, barely above a whisper.

Lillian let out a low chuckle. "Someone's about to regret their choices."

Nina turned to her,wide-eyed.

Traditional industries moved at a different pace than Daniela's company, which thrived on rapid profits.
They depended on raw materials, labor, fluctuating markets, and customer demand. In short, too many variables.

The eight members of the commerce association had deep-rooted connections within the country.

They leaned heavily on those ties, which kept them afloat.

For Phillips Group, the pressure mounted from every direction, crises piling up one after another.

The association members, watching Cedric struggle,finally exhaled in relief, applauding Alexander's cunning strategy.

That day, Hackett sent Richard a rare antique.

Richard beamed with satisfaction. Alexander was just as pleased. Once Phillips Group collapsed, Cedric would have nothing. Then, he could take Cedric's place.

Daniela wanted to step in and help Cedric, but he insisted he could handle it.

So,for the next few days, she stayed on the sidelines,watching. And just as he promised, Cedric pulled through.

She decided to leave it be for now.

A man's pride had to be respected.

Since Cedric didn't want her interfering in. Phillips Group's affairs, she continued to target the association.

Hackett was next.

That night, Hackett and his group sat drinking, basking in their supposed victory. Soon, Cedric would surrender, and they could negotiate with Daniela on their terms.

Bruno exhaled in relief. "For a second, I thought we were actually done for."

Huey wiped the sweat from his forehead. "No kidding.That was brutal. If there's one lesson here, it's that Daniela is not someone to cross." Marcus gave a knowing nod. "True, but luckily, Cedric is her Achilles' heel. Without him,she'd never back dowvn."

Tripp scowled, swirling his glass. "Even so, we took a massive hit. Next time, the membership threshold needs to be raised. We need to recover those losses."

Bruno sneered. "Daniela should be the one paying for it! Who does she think she is, acting so high and mighty? At the end of the day, she's just a woman. If I get the chance, I'll make her regret ever challenging us!"

Huey nodded, his voice dripping with disdain. "She thinks she can avenge her mother's death? She should've died with her! The moment we get the chance, we'll make sure she's out of the picture for good!"

Hackett's expression darkened at those words. "You're underestimating her. Daniela has some serious connections. Plenty of people want her gone,yet she's still standing. That should tell you she's not as easy to take down as you think."

Huey scoffed,rolling his eyes. "Connections? So what?At the end of the day, she's just one person. No matter how powerful she is, when it's her turn to die,she'll beg for mercy like everyone olso." Laughter erupted around the table, their voices
brimming with arrogance.

Just then, Hackett's phone rang. Still smirking, he answered, leaning back in his chair. "What is it?"

The others watched as his confident grin slowly stiffened. Then, in an instant, it vanished, replaced by pure terror.

"What did you just say?"

As Hackett's shaking voice filled the air, the rest of their phones started buzzing with notifications.

One after another.

The breaking news alert flashed across their screens,the headlines bold and damning.

"Scandal of Women Abuse at Graves Group!"

"Hackett's Three Daughters Are Adopted!"

"Graves Group's Charity for Poor Girls Was a Front for Grooming Them for Future Gains."

"Shocking! The Collapse of Graves Group's Public Image!"

Hackett's fingers shook as he clicked on the first article, dread tightening in his chest. A recording of Hackett's conversation with Cedric in the study had gone viral.

In the audio, his voice rang out clearly."As part of the deal, my three daughters will be at your disposal."

"Women are worthless by nature-you can't let them think they're special. Keep them locked away, cut off from the world, make them need you for everything.That way,you can do whatever you please."

Hackett's words played from the phone, his tone cold and calculated.

The other seven people present stared at Hackett in shock.

Bruno slowly rose to his feet, his voice sharp. "So, you went behind our backs and met with Cedric."

Farley's lips curled into a bitter smile. "You told me your eldest daughter was the perfect match for my son. Said they should get engaged after Christmas."

Marcus narrowed his eyes. "You were the one who made it clear-no one was supposed to contact Daniela or Cedric alone."

Huey let out a scornful laugh. "Hackett,you really are something else. Trying to make a secret deal with Cedric? Looks like he played you instead." Hackett stumbled back a step, his face pale. Disbelief flickered across his features, then dread.

He had built his empire in the entertainment industry,where the illusion of female empowerment was a gold mine. But with this scandal, every actress, model, and brand tied to him would be dragged down as well.

Graves Group was spiraling towards disaster.

That night, under the cover of darkness, Hackett visited Alexander again, his hands full of extravagant gifts.
###Chapter 549 What If I Play The Role Of Cedric
That evening, Alexander was at home. In his study,a partition still divided the room.

This time, Hackett didn't argue about it like before. He was already backed into a corner, with the public turning against him.

Even the association members were keeping their distance.

He had to fight back, and hard.

"Alexander, please, you have to help me! That recording going around online is a complete lie!Cedric fabricated the whole thing-I had nothing to do with it. Cedric is ruthless! He showed up at my family,and all I did was introduce my daughter to him. That's it! But now he's twisting everything. The worst part?I never even said those things! It's all slander!"

On the other side of the partition, Alexander sat at his desk,leisurely pouring himself a cup of coffee.

Hackett, sweating, glanced to the partition, trying to push past it, but the bodyguards stopped him.

He wiped a shaky hand across his forehead. "Alexander, if you help me get through this, consider it a favor you can cash in anytime. What do you say?"
Silence stretched between them, until a soft,mocking chuckle drifted from the other side of the partition."You can barely keep yourself afloat right now.What makes you think your favor is worth anything to me?"

Hackett's jaw clenched. He pulled a check from his pocket and held it up. "This is just a small token of my gratitude. Once this whole mess is taken care of,l promise you'll be repaid tenfold."

The bodyguard carried the check over to Alexander,who barely spared it a glance. "I need you to agree to one condition."

Hackett's pulse stuttered. "What condition?"

Alexander's voice was smooth but unyielding. "Once this crisis is over, you'll resign from the association,and I'll take over as president."

Hackett's forced smile twitched. His original plan had been to let Alexander take the role temporarily, only to rally the other seven members and force him out once the dust settled.

Alexander gave him no time to dwell on it. "The other seven must step down with you."

Hackett's fingers curled into fists. This wasn't just a minor concession-this was handing over an empire he had spent years cultivating.

He drew in a sharp breath, barely masking his frustration. "Don't you think you're asking for too much?"

For years, he had ruled over the association,overseeing annual revenues that exceeded a million dollars under normal circumstances.

And now Alexander expected him to give it up just like that?

Alexander's tone remained indifferent. "Have you not grasped the situation yet? Daniela is coming for you and the others. I may not know the full story, but based on what I do know, there's only one reason she would go to such lengths.Brylee's death."

Hackett's chest tightened.

Then,Alexander delivered his next words with unwavering certainty. "You were involved in Brylee's death. That's why Daniela wants revenge. Do you really think your association is worth more than a human life?"

Hackett didn't hesitate. "Of course! My association is my life's work! No one's life-especially not Brylee's -compares to it!" Alexander exhaled lightly, almost amused. Then you'd better think carefully. You've seen what Daniela is capable of. Would you rather end up with nothing? Or lose the association but keep Graves Group intact?Take your time deciding."

Hackett's gaze darkened with suppressed rage.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, his voice steady."The first twenty-four hours in PR are critical. You don't need me toremind you of that, do you? If you don't mae a decision now, I won't be able to pull you out of this mess."

Hackett stood stiffly, his fists clenching at his sides.
His voice shook with barely contained fury-losing the association felt like tearing away a piece of himself.

But Alexander's composed demeanor made one thing painfully clear: he had no other options.

A long silence stretched between them before Hackett finally spat out, "Fine! But I have one condition. I want Cedric dead. I want Daniela to lose the man she loves forever!"

Behind the partition, Alexander's lips curled into a slow,calculated smile. "As you wish."

Once the agreement was signed, Hackett's voice turned cold. "Now tell me-how do we fight back?" Alexander let out a low, mirthless chuckle. "Cedric released a recording that painted you as someone who disrespects women. You'll counter with footage of Cedric drinking, getting cozy with your three daughters, and later, entering a hotel with them. After that,you..."

His voice dropped, every syllable laced with a quiet,lethal intent.

Hackett's lips curled into a sinister grin as he listened.

"Alexander,you really are a master at manipulating public perception. I won't deny that your plan could throw Cedric intodeep trouble. But the person in the video must be Cedric himself. If the footage is unclear,it won't hold up. Besides, Cedric isn't an idiot -he won't give us the chance to frame him. We could end up facing serious charges for falsifying evidence."

Alexander let a beat of silence pass before drawing out his response."Is that so?"

Hackett nodded firmly, his confidence unwavering."Of course. Do you think Phillips Group's PR team is weak? They'll scrutinize every second of that video,tearing it apart for inconsistencies. If Cedric himself isn't clearly visible, the whole plan is useless.I can't back this strategy."

His words were polite, but his expression made his  opinion clear-Alexander's idea was ridiculous.

"Then make sure Cedric appears in the footage."Alexander's response was cold and direct.

"What?" HHackett's eyes widened in disbelief."Alexander, you can't be serious! How the hell would Cedric ever cooperate with me? Have you not seen how obsessed he and Daniela are with each other?They're practically glued at the hip! No one could ever come between them!"
Frustration twisted in his chest, and he felt like he was wasting his breath trying to reason with Alexander.

Just as he was about to rise from his seat in exasperation, the bodyguards stepped forward,gripping the parttion on both sides and removing it.

At the center of the room, Alexander sat composed,his presence commanding.

Hackett's breath hitched as their eyes met.

Slowly,Alexander lifted his gaze and asked, "What if I play the role of Cedric?"
###Chapter 550 He'll Be The King
Hackett was utterly stunned.

His jaw dropped, and he found himself unable to snap it shut.

He thought he was staring at Cedric himself.

Rising to his feet, Hackett began to circle Alexander,examining him closely from every possible angle.

Every detail, from the hairstyle and clothes to the facial expressions and mannerisms, mirrored Cedric perfectly.

"Is this really you, Alexander?" he asked.

A shiver of realization crept down Hackett's spine at that moment.

That explained why Winslow had always remarked on the familiarity of Alexander's voice.

Now, paying closer attention, Hackett confirmed that Alexander's voice was indeed identical to Cedric's.

Hackett couldn't believe what he was seeing. "If you remain this shocked, you'll run out of time to deal with your company's emergency!" Alexander reminded him.

Hackett took a deep breath. Looking intently at Alexander, he asked, "Where did you have the surgery done? You must tell me!"

Hackett went to pick up his three daughters, so that they could have a video shoot with Alexander at his hotel.

During the drive,Hackett buzzed with excitement.

If altering one's appearance was indeed so straightforward,why not replicate Cedric's by the dozen?

And why stop at Cedric? He could replicate Daniela too.

Feeling as though he had stumbled upon a fantastical opportunity, Hackett promptly called an overseas plastic surgeon he knew.

When he mentioned it concerned Alexander, the response was immediate. "Hold on."

Shortly thereafter, they sent Hackett a pricing list and a video documenting the procedure.

Hackett scanned the figures and inhaled sharply. The cost was astronomical-nearly a hundred billion dollars!

He then clicked on the video marked "Top Secret."

Minutes into the video, Hackett was so shocked that he smacked the driver on the back and yelled, "Stop the car!"

The moment the car came to a halt,Hackett bolted outside and threw up.

His secretary hurried after him, confused. "Mr. Graves,what happened? Was there something in the surgery video that..."

Hackett vomited again.

The secretary stood frozen in shock.

Hackett bent over, retching up his recent meals.

Visions of the harrowing surgery footage overwhelmed his mind. The procedure involved brutally reshaping bones and reassembling them, an agonizingly painful process. The plastic surgeon's voice message then played. "If you haven't braced yourself for the potential of death,I advise against proceeding lightly. This surgery might completely alter someone's appearance, but it carries a mortality rate of ninety-nine percent!"

After regaining some composure, Hackett rinsed his mouth and spat out the water. "Alexander has completely lost his mind!"

His secretary asked cautiously, "Mr. Graves, are you still considering transitioning the association leadership to Alexander?"

Hackett narrowed his eyes. "Yes. He's set on getting rid of Cedric anyway. In the end, the world has room for only one Cedric, and Daniela will love only that one. Alexander is more desperate than us. The enemy of my enemy is my ally. Once Alexander steps into Cedric's shoes for Daniela, the doors to numerous collaborative ventures will open. Imagine the advantages we'll hold over him then."

The most pressing matter was to navigate through the current turmoil.

After Hackett had left, Richard entered Alexander's study.

Even after all this time, Richard couldn't help but be amazed when he saw Alexander's face.

"Alexander, weren't you bothered by the association's demands? What's changed your mind now?"

A storm seemed to brew in Alexander's eyes as he explained, "Daniela's standing is unattainable. If wealth doesn't bring me to her level, then I'll climb the social ladder. My interest isn't in the association itself, but l won't overlook any opportunity that might bring me closer to her."

Once he cleared the association of current members,his next move would be to bring Daniela into the association. By then, he would rule the association,with Daniela as his most devoted ally.

For him,the setup was ideal.

That evening, Alexander accompanied Hackett's three daughters into the hotel room.

Under the scrutinizing gaze of the high-definition camera, Alexander wore Cedric's face. He tried to maintain composure but evidently relished the role.

Behind the camera, Hackett watched, utterly astonished.

Alexander truly was a force to be reckoned with.

Ruthless and determined, he wouldn't stop until Cedric was dead.

His actions would drive Cedric into an inescapable corner of public scandal.

Meanwhile, Cedric had just navigated through a corporate crisis. Fresh from a shower and dressed in comfortable pajamas, he reclined on the bed, anticipating Daniela's arrival.

Cedric greeted her with a suggestive grin as she entered.

Daniela laughed.

"My love." Cedric leaped across the room and wrapped her in a tight embrace. "When will you make me a father? I yearn for a child with you."

Daniela's response was a gentle laugh. "Alright."

Cedric's face brightened at her words, pulling her in for a deep kiss.

Daniela expressed a desire to shower, and Cedric insisted on joining her.

Reluctantly agreeing, Daniela was about to embrace him whenthe ringing of a phone interrupted them.

Daniela glanced towards the sound, breathless. "Your phone."

Cedric whispered seductively, "Let it ring."

Then Daniela's phone began to ring as well.

As she reached for it, Cedric drew her back to the bed. "Let yours ring too," he murmured, his kisses trailing her skin.

Daniela struggled to catch her breath under his affection.

Suddenly, a knock at the door interrupted them."Daniela," called Lillian's voice from outside.
###Chapter 551 Who Is In The Video Daniela grasped Cedric's hand to pause his advances.

Cedric gave her a sulking look.

With a soft chuckle, Daniela teased,"Calm down,will you?"
She then slid off him, quickly dressed, and retrieved her phone from the nightstand to contact Lillian.

Lillian responded promptly on the call. "Daniela?Aren't you home? I'm right outside your door."

With a glance at Cedric, who sprawled on the bed looking dejected, Daniela responded with a gentle smile, "What's going on?"

Lillian immediately adopteda more grave tone. "It's important!" "Give me a moment; I'll meet you downstairs," Daniela said into the phone. Cedric's expression grew even more somber as he overheard. After ending the call,Daniela leaned down and shared a lingering kiss with Cedric, leaving them both short of breath.

Cedric then rose to get dressed, his demeanor still one of mild annoyance. "You owe me one."

Daniela agreed with a smile, nodding. "Absolutely."

Cedric's face brightened when he checked the time."Let's make this brief. Return straight here after your discussion downstairs!"

However,neither found their way back upstairs that night.

Descending together, Daniela and Cedric normally encountered Lillian's playful remarks during such moments.

Today was different.

A grave look marred Lillian's face as she stared at Cedric.

"What's going on?" Daniela inquired, sensing the tension.

Lillian silently extended her phone towards her.

The screen was swamped with trending news, all centered around Cedric.

"Scandal Surrounds Cedric!" "The Illusion of Cedric's Loyalty Destroyed!"

"Cedric Caught with Three Women!"

"Revealed: Cedric's Scandalous Video!"

"Cedric's Passionate Night with the Graves Sisters!"

"The Deceit of Cedric Uncovered!"

"Cedric's Betrayal of Daniela!"

Lillian said, "This isn't just trending here; Cedric's scandal has flooded the entire internet!"

Ryan chimed in, "This has gone beyond our borders.International platforms are also ablaze with condemnation of Cedric."

Lillian faced Ryan, asking urgently, "Have you found anything conclusive? What does the technical analysis say about the authenticity of that so-called scandalous video?"

Setting the phone aside, Ryan looked towards Daniela,then Cedric, and sighed. "There's no evidence of tampering. The video appears authentic."

Shock registered on Lillian's face.

Ryan's expression turned to one of disbelief and resentment as he stared at Cedric. Despite the tension, Daniela remained composed."That isn't Cedric in the video."

Ryan,visibly upset, asked, "Daniela, how can you still defend him?"

Daniela shook her head calmly. "Check the video's timestamp. It's dated the day after the family banquet.Remember what was happening then?"
A moment of realization hit Lillian. "Yes, I recall now!That was the day Ryan suffered a bad bout of food poisoning,and Cedric was by his side the entire night."

Ryan was visibly shocked. He checked the timestamp closely. Indeed, it was true. "Who could possibly be in the video then?" he asked.
Cedric was equally astonished, scrutinizing the video again and again. He fixated on the face that mirrored his own,rendered speechless for a considerable time.

Grabbing his lapotop, Ryan said, "I'm going to pull the video offline immediately! Who is this doppelganger,and how could he impersonate Cedric to such an extent? This must be a deliberate frame-up!"

Meanwhile,Cedric's phone was incessantly buzzing.

The public relations team was in disarray.

They couldn't fathom Cedric engaging in such  behavior.

Despite the damning nature of the online evidence,they scrutinized the video over and over, yet found no clues to suggest the man wasn't Cedric.

Initially, even some skeptics online refused to believe the claims.

They sent the so-called explicit video for forensic analysis.

The resulting verdict was blunt.

"The individual in the video is undeniably Cedric!"

As the storm of public opinion reached its zenith, the mastermind behind the chaos delighted in the turmoil,introducing yet another explosive element-a recorded conversation amid the fervent discussions.
###Chapter 552 Phillips Group In Trouble
Five recordings had surfaced online.

Each one contained what was unmistakably Cedric's voice.

Lillian, alarmed, clicked on the suddenly popular recordings.

Cedric's voice filled the room.

"Hackett, I'm responsible for those misogynistic comments about you online. What are you going to do about it?"

"Daniela is my wife, and with her support, I'm untouchable in Olisvine."

"As long as we're married, she's my shield. Merely by being her husband, I command respect and open doors throughout Olisvine."

"Hackett,you value your daughters,but to what end?You've lost your influence. If you don't want to face bankruptcy or worse-seeing your daughters end up in a nightclub-then they better followmy lead.Why the tears, Hackett? Being associated with me should be seen as an honor for your daughters!"
"Tonight, bring your three daughter to Room 1308,Night Lounge Hotel."

The release of these recordings dominated the trending topics.

Servers were overwhelmed and crashed for almost thirty minutes due to the traffic.

"Cedric,protected by Daniela."

"Divorce Daniela and Set Her Free."

This plea quickly climbed the rankings.

The PR team from Phillips Group arrived in a rush,confronting Cedric with serious expressions.

"Mr.Phillips, did these words really come from you?"

"Our technical experts have verified these recordings.They're authentic, just like the high-definition video."

"Please,we need your response."

Cedric had cultivated a reputation as a business prodigy admired by many.

His followers idolized him and struggled to reconcile the man they admired with the villain portrayed in the media.

Meanwhile,Ryan was trying to access hospital security  footage.

If he could find that footage, it could confirm Cedric's alibi-that he was at the hospital that night, not at the Night Lounge Hotel as claimed.

Ryan's hands shook as he navigated the security system.

Seeing his struggle,Daniela took over the computer.

Her fingers danced rapidly across the keyboard, but after a few tense minutes, the screen displayed a frustrating message, saying, "The requested page is not archived."

Daniela briefly closed her eyes, sensing that their adversary had meticulously planned their moves.

After passing the computer back to Ryan, she approached the doorway, surveying the Phillips Group staff assembled below.

"I understand your shock and your anger. As Cedric's wife,l,too,was stunned by these accusations online.But I ask you to have faith in my husband. He is a wonderful man,and I implore you to allow us the time to gather evidence and clear his name. Please, stand with Cedric and me during this challenging time."
Wade Blake, from the tech department and a long-time admirer of Daniela, stepped forward. "Ms.Harper,  do you truly stand by Mr. Phillips? You know the technology better than any of us. You've seen the videos. They're real, aren't they?"
Daniela nodded in acknowledgment. "The footage online hasn't been altered, but the man in them isn't Cedric. I realize how difficult this is to believe, and all I ask is for a little time. We will vindicate him."

Daniela's appeal, in light of the compelling evidence against them, seemed weak at best.

Some staff members suspected she was sacrificing her integrity to protect Cedric.

Nevertheless, they returned to their duties, motivated not by the scandal but by their longstanding respect for Phillips Group and the decent treatment they had always received.
The undeniable nature of the online evidence seemed almost final,leaving scant opportunity for defense.

Back in the living room, the team gathered, their expressions troubled as they strategized their next move.

Daniela lingered for a moment before heading to the kitchen to prepare some food for the group.
Shortly after, the PR manager and several members of Phillips Group's tech team arrived, laptops in tow, ready to collaborate on strategies.

The living room became a makeshift command center, filled with several team members.

Daniela served the food she prepared, and a heavy silence fell as they ate.

Meanwhile, the intense of online debates showed no signs of fading.
The security chief from Phillips Group reported that vandals had thrown garbage at their office building.

Daniela accessed the internet, clicking on the most trending topic.

The headline read, "Cedric, Apologize!"

Chaos reigned throughout the night.

Journalists from every major national newspaper staked out the buildings of both Phillips Group and Elite Lux.

The following morning, the stock price of Phillips Group plummeted,hitting the daily limit.

By the afternoon, more than a hundred business partners had called to sever their contracts.

An unjust boycott impacted all celebrities affiliated with Phillips Group.
Major retailers removed all Phillips Group products from their shelves, exacerbating the crisis.

Phillips Group descended from corporate dominance to public enemy overnight.

It was widely accepted that recovery was impossible for the company this time.

Cedric seemed destined to carry a permanent mark of disgrace.

Elite Lux's official website was swarming with comments like, "Daniela, divorce him!"

Top executives at Elite Lux headquarters quickly became involved as the crisis escalated.

The moodwas grim among the PR and tech teams at Phillips Group; online trolls savagely attacked every public statement they issued.

"Daniela, what's our next move? The trolls are relentless!" Lillian asked, overwhelmed by the onslaught of online attacks.
With a calm demeanor, Daniela suggested, "Let's pause for a moment. I need to rest for half an hour."
 
The PR and tech team at Phillips Group were speechless. How could she be sleeping at a time like this?

Cedric, ever supportive, draped a blanket over Daniela and signaled for quiet.

He suggested,"Why not take this time to rest as well?We have guest rooms ready."

Exchanging suspicious glances, the team was stunned.

Rest at such a time?

Sleep was out of the question!

Right on the heels of a previous mess, Phillips Group was floundering once more.

Their jobs were hanging by a thread!

Falling asleep under such stress was unthinkable.
###Chapter 553 Cedric Will Never Be Able To Make...
Lillian whispered to the assembled group,"Get some rest. When Daniela is up, we'll haveplenty to tackle."

Simultaneously, she and Ryan closed their eyes,surrendering to slumber.

The members of Phillips Group watched in silent amazement.

The people from Elite Lux was so composed-hardly a surprise given Daniela's status as the wealthiest in the world. Her calm was legendary, truly a sight to behold.

Unable to succumb to sleep themselves, yet unsure of their next steps, they merely exchanged bewildered glances.

Cedric found himself in a precarious position;with Phillips Group's official website compromised by hackers, no public statements could be made.

Despite the fervent keystrokes of frantic technicians,the digital breach remained unmitigated.
Cedric had initially planned to hold apress conference,but Daniela had told him it wasn't necessary before she went to sleep, so he had no choice but to sit tight.

Idle and restless, he wandered into the kitchen to slice some fruit.

From the shadows, the PR department manager observed Cedric's relaxed figure and murmured to the tech team, "Has Mr. Phillips resigned himself to this fate?"

"What other options does he have? The evidence against him is overwhelmingly incriminating."

"Could Phillips Group really collapse?"

"It's uncertain, but with Ms. Harper's presence, it's unlikely."

"I've just invested in a house. If the company folds, I'll be ruined. Do you think Elite Lux has any openings? I'd seriously consider a position there."
"Could I possibly join as well? I'd take any job at Elite Lux; I'm not concerned about the salary. I just want to be near someone I've admired so much."

Mutual understanding passed between the PR manager and the tech staff with a series of knowing nods.

Cedric, overhearing the conversation from a short distance,interjected with a hint of amusement, "Hey,the company hasn't sunk just yet." They all turned to Cedric, their laughter tinged with embarrassment.

Cedric,peeling an orange, let the silence hang briefly before adding, "If it really comes to it, I might also seek out a role at Elite Lux. I wonder if my wife would consider hiring me as her personal assistant."

The PR manager and the tech team were utterly dumbstruck. After such a lurid scandal, how could he even dream of becoming her personal assistant?

The PR manager eyed Daniela warily before turning to Cedric,his voice barely above a whisper. "Isn't your wife upset?"
The tech staff added, "The clarity of that footage was startling.Surely,she must be livid after viewing it, no?"

A crafty smirkcurled Cedric's lips as he leaned in, a twinkle of mischief in his eye. "Oh, she's well aware that the man in that video isn't me."
He even wanted to boast about his performance in bed. "I'd do a far better job than the guy in the video."
He recalled the day spent with Ryan at the hospital, a solid alibi. Daniela, with her keen eye, would have instantly noted the man in the video wasn't him.
There was simply no need for explanations-words were unnecessary. Such was their unspoken, profound  connection.

Cedric crossed his arms, reclined further into the sofa,and flashed a grin. "Such understanding comes only with the bonds of marriage."

The others absorbed Cedric's unwavering calm, their expressions mingling shock with a touch of envy.

The tech staff asked, "You're truly not perturbed in the slightest? People online are ruthlessly tearing you apart."

"You wouldn't grasp it unless you were married,"Cedric responded.

As everyone mulled over his repeated phrase,Cedric added, "Once you're married, you'll understand that even if the entire world turns against you, your partner will always be your steadfast ally."

A hush fell over the group, a mixture of surprise and slight annoyance at his overt romanticism.

Unlike the strained mood hanging over the Harper family's villa, the eight members of the commerce association were in high spirits, clinking champagne glasses deep intothe night.
Bruno clucked his tongue, a smirk playing on hislips."The one who knows you best is often the one who strikes the hardest. Alexander's move was truly cruel,  targeting Cedric right at Daniela's greatest weakness!Daniela's definitely too drained to focus on our strategies now."

Huey chimed in, "Exactly. My company's new game is finally picking up steam!"

Farley sighed, his forehead creasing. "I was petrified,thinking my business was on the brink of collapse!"

Amidst the discussions, Winslow stood by, his silence heavy,absorbing every word.

Hackett let out a low chuckle. "Like I've always said,despite Daniela's remarkable skills, she remains merely human. A minor hurdle, and she crumbles!"

Tripp,nodding along with a knowing smile,responded to Hackett, "This time, even Cedric's formidable efforts won't change the outcome. Now that we've handled Cedric, what's our timeline for dealing with Daniela?"

Huey quickly joined the conversation, his voice tinged with urgency. "Yes. Hackett, when do we move against Daniela? You have no idea the losses my company has suffered this time. I won't find peace until Daniela is out of the picture!"

Marcus stood up decisively. "It's time to eliminate Daniela!" The others rose in unison, a wave of agreement sweeping through them.

Still smiling,Hackett affirmed, "Indeed, it's settled then; Daniela's days are numbered. And when we strike,Alexander wvill fall alongside her. If we redirect their business domestically, the profits will more than make up for our recent setbacks-a thousand times over. With Daniela out of the way, the domestic market will finally be within our grasp."

At the thought of seizing control from the wealthiest in the world, smiles spread contagiously across the room.

"But we need to approach this game with caution,"Hackett suggested, his eyes glinting with slyness. "It's too early to provoke Alexander. Let's use him to corner Daniela instead."

As he strategized, Hackett gestured to his secretary with a grin, instructing them to dispatch yet another priceless antique to the Bennett family.

The room buzzed with laughter and merriment as Hackett invited his so-called daughters to partake in the festivities.

Alexander scoffed indifferently at the gift from Hack<ett.

Richard remarked appreciatively, "That's quite  generous of Hackett."

Just then, Hackett's call came through.

"Alexander, I owe you one! Your strategy has turned Phillips Group into public enemy number one, but..."Hackett hesitated, his tone turning serious. "How should we deal the final blow?"
"When someone is down, you make sure they don't get back up, right?" Alexander replied coldly as he stared out at the pine trees dotting the horizon.

With the phone on speaker, the eight listeners in the room exchanged excited glances.

Hackett, rubbing his bald head with a broad smile,exclaimed, "Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Cedric won't have a chance to rise again!"
###Chapter 554 The Darkest Hour
At three in the morning, the fake Cedric stepped forward to hold a press conference.

He made a fleeting appearance, tears of remorse glistening under the harsh camera lights as he confessed to every allegation circulating online.

"I sincerely apologize. My actions have not only caused public chaos but have also hurt my beloved wife. As of today, I will officially resign as CEO of Phillips Group to atone for my mistakes. I vow to never set foot in the business world again."

Standing on stage, "Cedric"-impeccably dressed in an elegant suit-bowed deeply, his face a mixture of regret and turmoil.

"Additionally, I extend my deepest apologies for the irreversible harm this scandal has inflicted upon my wife. I have utterly failed in my dutiesas a husband,and for that, I believe the only way forward is divorce.Daniela deserves far better than a disgrace like me.I have never been worthy of her! From the very start,I was drawn to her wealth,power, and status-I never truly loved her. Now that the truth is laid bare before the world, I cannot face her anymore. I will leave everything behind, entrust my lawyer with the divorce proceedings, and ensure I walk away with nothing as a token of my repentance.Thank you."

"Cedric" came, delivered his statement, and disappeared just as swiftly the entire ordeal unfolding in less than five minutes.

Yet mere moments after the press conference,paparazzi caught "Cedric" slipping into an upscale club,indulging in an intimate rendezvous with another woman.

And with that, the carefully curated image Cedric had built over the years came crashing down in an instant.

The internet erupted in outrage."Daniela,leave him!Dump the scumbag!"

The shocking turn of events left the PR manager and the entire tech department reeling.

They glanced at the Cedric standing before them,then back at the Cedric in the press conference footage.

Indistinguishable!

But how?

If the man at the press conference was truly Cedric,then who was the person standing here? The room buzzed with silent confusion,a collective disbelief hanging in the air.

Cedric let out a quiet sigh, his gaze flickering to the press conference footage before he tenderly pulled a blanket over his sleeping wife.

The PR manager, barely containing his shock,whispered hoarsely, "Holy hell! Mr. Phillips is actually innocent!"

The tech staff groaned internally. "We're done for!l think I went too far with Mr. Phillips earlier. I've been calling him a scumbag in my head all this time! How do I even face him now?"

The PR manager hesitated, rubbing his temples."I'd love to know that too. Also, it's been over thirty minutes. Should we wake Daniela up? The internet is practically on fire. If we don't act soon, we're going under. What's the plan?"

The tech staff said, "Forget it. Let her sleep. With the way the public is raging, unless Mr. Phillipsand the fake one magically appear side by side, the only way to calm them down is if Mr. Phillips takes his own life!"

They exchanged weary looks and let out a collective sigh.

Lately, exhaustion had been Daniela's constant companion. When she finally opened her eyes,she found everyone else had dozed off.

She checked the time, her brows knitting together.

She nudged Cedric awake. "I told you to wake me in thirty minutes! What happened?"

Cedric gestured towards his phone. "No point. You would've just exhausted yourself for nothing. I'll head to the office later and figure things out."

In crises like this, the only way to stabilize the company was to follow through with what had already been announced-his resignation.

Stepping down as CEO of Phillips Group and weathering the storm was the only logical course of action.

It was the standard move the executives made when facing major scandals.

The tech department, now awake, caught Cedric's words and their faces instantly fell.

Cedric, on the other hand, looked completely unbothered.

Daniela studied his easygoing expression and let out a soft chuckle. "Aren't you wNorried? You've married a difficult woman, and now you're walking away from the empire you built.Any regrets?" Cedric pulled her into a warm embrace, laughter rumbling in his chest. "Not a single regret. You're worth everything."

The Phillips Group staff collectively shut their eyes in exasperation.

Of all the times,now?

These two were really acting like this wasn't a full-blown crisis.

Daniela freshened up, then invited everyone to sit down for breakfast.

Once breakfast was over, she pulled her hair into a sleek high ponytail and grinned at the team. "Alright,it's time to strike back! The harder we're hit,the higher we'll bounce. I need everyone on board for the rest of the day."

Under the gentle spring sunlight, Daniela stood in a crisp green sweater, her bright, confident smile radiating assurance.

Without hesitation, they set off for Phillips Group.

A restless crowd had gathered at the entrance, but seemingly out of nowhere, a team of men in black moved in, securing the perimeter with military precision. Not even a single fly could slip past them. Hand in hand,Daniela and Cedric stood tall at Phillips Group's entrance, ready to face whatever came next.

"Hello, everyone. I'm Daniela, CEO of Elite Lux and Cedric's wife. Last night, we were blindsided by an unexpected wave of slander, leaving us no time to react. I don't know who held that press conference,but I do know my husband was with me the entire time.We married young and aren't seasoned in handling such rumors, but we ask for your patience as we address this and set the record straight. Thank you."

After finishing her words, Daniela took Cedric's hand and stepped into the building.

Their figures carried both solitude and defiance.

The public admired Daniela's strength while continuing to vilify Cedric for his betrayal.

Inside the conference room, Daniela addressed the employees eager for revenge."Alright, let's all go all out and roast Cedric. You have one hour-crash the servers with your comments."

A wave of confusion swept through the room.

They exchanged puzzled glances. "Huh?" Did they mishear her, or had she misspoken?

Daniela turned her gaze to Cedric. Cedric strolled in, sipping a glass of juice. Catching everyone's bewildered stares, he smirked."You heard her. Get to it."

And just like that, the entire Phillips Group, along with Elite Lux employees, spent the next hour flooding social media with relentless criticism of Cedric until the servers crashed entirely.

This overwhelming storm of condemnation, combined with the fury of uninvolved netizens, soon became known as The Darkest Hour.

Spectators whispered,"Phillips Group is doomed. Even their own employees and Elite Lux staff are turning on Cedric. A large-scale employee backlash like this has never happened before!"

The man at the center of the storm sat in the break room, casually inspecting the juicer, wondering if it was time for an upgrade.
###Chapter 555 Let's All Roast Cedric Together
An hour had passed. Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees continued their relentless smear campaign against Cedric.

Suddenly, an anonymous post surfaced, telling a shocking story.

"Shocking Revelation! A CEO, once bankrupt and twice-divorced,mysteriously amassed wealth after a former wife disappeared, inheriting her massive fortune. He traveled abroad for plastic surgery,carrying a photo of another ex-wife's current husband."

This post sparked rapid speculation. One clever commenter said, "A CEO down on his luck, twice-divorced, with an ex-wife married to another? Coming into a fortune? Could this be Alexander Bennett?"

As the post gained traction, employees from Phillips Group and Elite Lux scrambled to refocus the public's wrath on Cedric, dismissing the revelation as mere distraction. "Ignore this rubbish! Stay focused on denouncing Cedric!"

Observers suspected a deflection tactic and escalated their insults.  Simultaneously intrigued, they began tracking the whistleblower.

Moments later, the anonymous source uploaded a blurry video.

It depicted a man in a suit, departing the Bennett family's residence and proceeding to a press event. He wore a mask,yet his build bore a striking resemblance to Cedric.

This left everyone puzzled and questioning.

Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees maintained their stance. "Stay focused! Continue to target Cedric!"

However,skepticism was mounting.

Questions arose about why Cedric would be seen leaving Alexander's residence at such a late hour.

These suspicions, combined with earlier rumors about plastic surgery, sparked a wave of curiosity.

Yet, as the public attempted to delve deeper,Phillips Group and Elite Lux staff persisted in their attacks on Cedric.

An onlooker suggested, "Maybe you should look into this. What if Cedric is being set up?"

Phillips Group's PR team, responding from their  official account, dismissed the concerns. "Look into what? The situation is clear. What would anyone gain by impersonating our CEO? Just to show up at a press event and cause a rift between him and his wife?Highly unlikely."

The notion began to take root. "Could it actually be possible?"

Alexander's continued attempts to reconnect with Daniela and his expressions of wanting to reunite,despite her disregard, led to wild speculation. Had he lost his grip on reality over Daniela?

The PR team of Phillips Group scoffed at the idea."That's absurd! Who would go to such lengths? Keep focused;continue the attack on Cedric!"

Following the incident, there was a noticeable drop in the volume of insults hurled at Cedric.

However, the slander persisted among many.

Suddenly, the whistleblower's account  was deactivated.

Confusion spread among the online crowd. "Wait,why was that account banned? Was it on to something real? Could Alexander really have undergone surgery to mimic Cedric, especially with the recent video showing 'Cedric' leaving the Bennett family's residence? This is getting weird. Now, I'm really  starting to question everything!"
Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees continued to instigate, "Come on, keep up the attacks! Don't let up!"

One bystander expressed frustration. "Why are you all relentlessly attacking him without seeking the truth?I'm starting to feel bad for Cedric. What kind of employees does Elite Lux have? Cedric is Daniela's husband; shouldn't you be supporting him instead of adding to his troubles? Daniela, how can you allow your staffto behave like this?"

In response, a Phillips Group employee retorted,"Stay on target! Keep the insults coming!"

An employee of Elite Lux said, "Aren't they supposed to be getting a divorce? Daniela is currently too distraught, locked up in the bathroom, unable to oversee anything."

One individual openly addressed Daniela online,saying,"You're the wealthiest in the world! Dry those tears!There's still a chance to turn things around!"

From her verified account, Daniela responded,"Thanks to everyone for your support, yet what am l to do? After all, I am merely a woman. Could everyone lend a hand in investigating this?"

This response raise an image of Daniela as a delicate figure, overwhelmed by her marital distreSS. The sight of such distress in a woman as admired as Daniela moved people profoundly.

Consequently, tech experts across the globe initiated a thorough examination of the surveillance systems around Bennett Group, managing to infiltrate all the security cameras that very night.

Despite these developments, the staff at Phillips Group and Elite Lux were undeterred, continuing their efforts to incite further negative attention. "Stay here!Enjoy bashing him! I'll even pay the bill for your comments!"

Their calls went unanswered.

Only the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux remained active in their denunciations of Cedric on social media.

Eventually, the scandal subsided and fell from the trending charts, prompting Phillips Group to purchase a spot to keep the issue alive.

Observers were flabbergasted,publicly advising Cedric,"With the scandal winding down, perhaps it's time for a staff overhaul. What leader could tolerate such betrayal?"

Cedric chose not to reply to these comments.

The staff at Phillips Group glanced at the incendiary  messages with concern and turned to Daniela. "With all this cursing, won't our boss give us a hard time later?"

Daniela offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry.Instead, I'll give each of you a bonus."

Shortly after, she made a generous transfer to everyone in the group chat.

Each member received ten thousand dollars.

Their spirits lifted instantly!

The insults escalated to such extremes that even those not involved felt compelled to turn away.

Not long after, a new revelation surfaced online under the headline "Shocking Revelation!"

The post said, "A chief surgeon friend of mine from overseas just informed me about a case a few months back. A man from Olisvine, not yet a CEO and reportedly bankrupt at the time, received plastic surgery funded by a woman. Both were somewhat unstable mentally. Due to patient confidentiality, l can't reveal his name, but the surgery documents list his emergency contact as a Ms. Holt, who seems to be his new spouse!"

This explosive information skyrocketed up the trending list. Another netizen then added, "Everyone, I'm just an ordinary observer. Out of concern for Daniela, who seems overwhelmed, I decided to hack into the surveillance around Alexander's residence. Recently,there have been frequent meetings there with the commerce association. Given that Daniela has paused her company acquisitions during this scandal, I believe there's a connection. Moreover, I've accessed 24-hour surveillance footage from around Elite Lux,showing Cedric consistently returning home nightly,including the evening of the press conference.There's no evidence of him leaving at all that night. I'm convinced the man at the press conference and the one at the nightclub wasn't Cedric. People, let's not rush to judgment without knowing the full story!"
###Chapter 556 Feeling Sorry For Cedric
The online user appeared to have a strong admiration for Daniela. They had consistently liked Daniela's posts. Every remark was left intact, without a single deletion, exuding a sense of openness and honesty.

The audience was hooked, fully engrossed in the situation except for the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux. "Stay focused! We need to keep throwing shade at Cedric!"

The growing frustration among online users finally hit its peak.

"Alright, that's it! I've been holding back, but I can't anymore. Phillips Group signs your paychecks, yet you're all too busy slandering your own boss instead of backing him up. What's wrong with you?"

"So this is how it's going to be? Blindly trashing him now? Can Cedric and Daniela not handle their own employees? Are they seriously just letting this slide? If I were in charge, I'd have fired every last one of you already!"
"That's what I don't get! Before, at least there was some excuse, but now that the truth is out, you're not even acknowledging it? What's your deal?"

"I'm honestly done with this. I can't stand to watch anymore.Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees,you guys have officially crossed the line. How does Cedric not feel completely humiliated by all this?"

Just a few minutes later, a peculiar trending topic suddenly surged.

"Feeling sorry for Cedric."

And right behind it, yet another trend surfaced.

"Daniela,your husband is being bullied."

The employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux stared at the screen, utterly dumbfounded.

What was happening?

When insults were discouraged, people seemed to enjoy attacking Cedric even more, as if it was some kind of rebellion.

But the moment they were given full freedom to bash him, they hesitated. Not only that, but now they actually pitied him?

These online users were truly unpredictable-so, in response, the employees of Phillips Group and Elite Lux decided to turn up the heat, doubling down on their criticism. Phillips Group's PR team took it a step further, even shelling out a sizable budget to make sure Cedric stayed trending at the top.

The employees managing the platform couldn't believe what they were seeing.

"Seriously, what kind of deep-seated grudge do you all have against your CEO? This is insane!"

Phillips Group employees simply shrugged and grinned."Relax, it's all for fun! You should jump in too!"

The moderator laughed. "This whole thing is wilder than any drama series. I need to catch up on all the details!"

By the time noon rolled around, everyone was completely drained from the relentless onslaught of online criticism.

Inside the conference room, a tired voice complained,"I swear, I've thrown every insult I know. I'm officially out of material!"

"Are we seriously supposed to keep this up? Haven't we done enough? Even my mom called me,demanding to know why I'm dragging my own boss instead of standing by him. She told me to get home immediately-I'm in for a lecture."

"I'm exhausted too. My phone is practically melting at  this point."

Daniela, keeping an eye on the trending topics,clapped her hands cheerfully. "Excellent work,everyone! Let's take a break and pick this up later.Lunch is on me-premium cuisine and top-tier barbecue!"

At her word, elite chefs arrived, turning the Phillips Group cafeteria into a Michelin-star dining experience From high-ranking executives to security personnel,everyone indulged in gourmet meals worth thousands.

Once satisfied with their lavish feast, the team dove back into the online battlefield.

However,by the afternoon, attacking Cedric became increasingly difficult as a wave of shocking revelations flooded the internet.

Hackers from all corners of the web dismantled Alexander's private life, even leaking flight records of his secret trips abroad for cosmetic procedures.

The criticisms from Phillips Group and Elite Lux employees were buried under a tidal wave of comments dissecting the scandal.

By 5 PM, as the workday wrapped up, the once relentless storm of negativity against Cedric had vanished without a trace. Cedric's name still dominated the trending lists,but now, it was accompanied by waves of sympathy.

"Feeling sorry for Cedric."

"Apologies to Cedric."

"Unbelievable turn of events."

"Too little,too late,Alexander."

"Spineless commerce association! If you have an issue with Daniela,confront her! Why go after her husband instead?"

As the employees wrapped up their final wave of criticisms, an announcement was made-it was officially time to clock out.

Netizens couldn't help but comment, "Phillips Group employees are built differently. Their boss is under fire,and they're enjoying a feast. The scandal flips,and they clock out on the dot. What exactly did they even do? Cedric, are you still hiring? I'd happily take a paycheck without trashing my boss!"

The second they stepped out of the office, every employee was greeted with a hefty bonus-completely unexpected but well-received.

Whispers circulated that the luckiest employees walked away with bonuses equivalent to an entire  month's salary.

The office erupted into cheers. "Thank you, Ms.Harper! Thank you, Mr. Phillips!"

Observers couldn't help but chuckle. "After an entire day of dragging them, isn't it a little too late to start buttering them up?"
###Chapter 557 Olisvine Was Going To Change A Lot
Hackett and the other association members had retreated to the seclusion of the mountains, finding solace in the natural hot springs.
Their choice of refuge was strategic, aimedat dodging any accusations of plotting against Daniela and Cedric.

Bruno, reveling in the comforting warmth, narrowed his eyes contentedly. "Ah, this is the life we deserve!"he exclaimed, contentedly slapping his stomach.

A grin spread across Huey's face as he relaxed."Cedric won't get away so easily this time! I'm eager to see him grovel and lose that smug arrogance."

Farley laughed heartily, reminiscing about a recent encounter. "Last time I bumped into Cedric at Elite Lux,I was so tempted to smack him. His arrogance is unbearable! He thinks he's some kind of business prodigy, but he's nothing compared to us who have weathered many storms."

Marcus, nursing a glass of wine, brooded over his recent losses in their conflict with Daniela. His gaze was cold, his intentions dark. "We should eliminate them both, if you ask me! And for Daniela, let's find a  group of men to rape her. No one will want her after we're done. That'll wipe the allure right off her face!"

Winslow was absorbed in his phone.

Hackett looked over at the preoccupied Winslow and chuckled."You won't find any reception here,Winslow.Relax, we're here to have a good time. Besides,Cedric has been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. No matter what Daniela tries, she won't be able to extricate him. Once we're back, we'll simply seize control of his business."

Everyone around him roared with laughter, though Winslow kept his eyes glued to his phone. "I can't shake this feeling of discomfort."

Bruno burst out laughing. "What's there to worry about, Winslow? Daniela hasn't even made a move against your business yet, so why the nerves?"

"Yeah, you're overthinking it, Winslow," Farley chimed in. "This time, Cedric doesn't stand a chance against us!"

Marcus looked at Winslow, hesitated, and then said,"Winslow, why hasn't Daniela targeted you yet?"

At ease, Winslow continued to stare at his device."Who knows? Maybe she's too busy. My firm is hardly on her radar; it's the smallest fish in the pond." A thought struck Hackett, an image flashing through his mind of a figure resembling Winslow when he went to see Daniela. "You haven't gone behind our backs to strike a deal with Daniela,have you,Winslow?"

Silence suddenly enveloped the hot springs. All eyes in the group fixed on Winslow.

Setting his phone aside, Winslow looked up slowly."What nonsense is this? Me,make a deal with Daniela?Come on, Hackett. You know as well as I do that l couldn't offer her anything substantial. What's mere pocket change to you is my entire operation. If she's willing to go after you, why would she let me off the hook?"

Everyone paused to reflect after hearing this.

Bruno nodded slowly. "That makes sense."

Winslow shrugged off the comments lightly, saying,"Perhaps Daniela just overlooked my company, or maybe she was too busy. You guys really expect me to join your financial misery?"

Huey chuckled and patted Winslow on the back."Come on, we're in this together. Remember, it was your plan to deal with Brylee. Daniela won't forget that." It was meant to ease the tension while also serving as a warning to Winslow. Winslow's gaze was cold as he stared off into the distance, a smirk playing on his lips. "Afraid of Daniela?That day will never come."

Laughter erupted around him as the others nodded in hearty agreement.

They lingered in the comforting warmth of the hot springs for several hours, basking in relaxation.

Once they emerged from the water, their phones,now within signal range, buzzed relentlessly with a flood of notifications.

As they gazed at their screens, the unfolding drama rivaled any prime-time soap opera.

By the stroke of midnight, headlines screamed with scandalous revelations like "Shameless Commerce Association!" and "Apology Demanded from Commerce Association!"

Their own schemes against Cedric had spectacularly rebounded on them.

In a state of panic, Hackett barely took the time to dry off before he was rushing to get dressed and out the door.

Huey, in his haste, slipped and tumbled over.

Though they claimed there was no rush, their voices  quivered with a palpable sense of urgency.

Racing down the mountain, they were glued to their phone screens, absorbing the latest updates.

Bruno said, "Who had the bright idea to retreat to these remote hot springs? We're cut off from everything!"

Farley retorted, "It doesn't matter now. We're already too late."

Huey said, "Whoever's backing Cedric is a genius! How did they flip the script so completely, even with such damning evidence against him?"

Marc yelled from the back seat, "Enough chatter! Just speed up!"

Winslow peered out the window, his expression unreadable.

Olisvine was going to change a lot.
###Chapter 558 Joyce Was Imprisoned
The vehicle raced down the winding road, its occupants gripped by a collective unease.

After hours on the road, they finally reached the Bennett family's estate at three in the morning and rapped urgently on the door.

The instant Alexander appeared,shock rippled through the group.

No one had anticipated such an uncanny resemblance to Cedric.

How was it possible for someone to be his near-perfect double?

Stunned, they gawked at Alexander before hurriedly settling into their seats.

Though Hackett had encountered Alexander before,the resemblance still unsettled him-but he had no time to dwell on it.

He quickly blurted out, "Alexander, you're about to take over as president. What's our next move? How did the tide turn in Cedric's favor? Have you seen the online chatter? People are actually sympathizing with  him! What's our plan?"

Bruno, clearly on edge, chimed in, "If we don't figure this out before ten, our stock prices could take a catastrophic hit!"

Marcus' chest tightened. "If the stock crashes again,I'd rather jump off the building! Mly company won't survive another blow!"

Alexander,clad in an impeccably tailored designer suit,sat in their midst. "So, are you all finally ready to accept me as president?"

Without hesitation, they all nodded.

Right now, the presidency was the least of their concerns.

If their businesses collapsed, titles wouldn't matter-they'd have nothing left to fight over.

As everyone nodded, Alexander caught the fleeting trace of reluctance in Hackett's expression.

With a soft chuckle,Alexander said, "If you recognize me as your leader, I'll lend a hand. If not, I see no reason to bother."

His piercing gaze lingered on Hackett as he spoke.

Bruno tugged at Hackett's sleeve and whispered urgently, "Say something! The presidency is irrelevant now. Our survival is at stake!"

The rest of the group murmured in approval.

Hackett hastily complied, "I never opposed it.Alexander, you're in charge. I have no complaints."

Alexander inclined his head. "Good. Then I'll take care of Cedric."

Alexander hadn't expected that, despite the enormity of the situation, Cedric had stayed silent and still turned the tide in his favor.

The business world now praised him for pulling off one of the most masterful PR maneuvers in history,effortlessly turning a disaster into a victory.

That night, an official statement was released by the commerce association's account.

"Owing to Hackett Graves' advanced age and his inability to continue leading the association, the presidency is hereby transferred to Alexander Bennett of Bennett Group. The association is optimistic that under his leadership, it wil better serve its members.To mark this transition, VIP membership channels are now open, with entry and first-year fees waived.Additionally, members with notable contributions will not only gain access to premium business resources but will also receive complimentary support to elevate their enterprises to billion-dollar valuations." The announcement sent shockwaves through the business world, igniting a flurry of debate!

"Alexander Bennett? How did he end up as the association's president?"

"Haven't you heard? Since Bennett Group merged with the Fairburne Group, they've been raking in wealth,landing a spot on the world's rich list. Richard is grinning from ear to ear!"

"Has Alexander really become that powerful?"

"It's not about his abilities; it's about his marriages.One ex-wife is the richest person in the world, and the other left him a massive fortune. Say what you want,but Alexander sure knows how to pick them."

"Now that Alexander is president, do you think Daniela will join the association?"

As the wealthiest person on the planet, Daniela's business instincts were second to none.

All eyes were on Elite Lux, waiting for their next move.

Rumors swirled that a powerful tycoon had secretly struck a deal with the association. Given their towering status in the business world, their identity remained undisclosed.

Naturally, speculation pointed straight to Daniela. While anticipation mounted, the association's official account subtly fueled the fire by liking a comment on Elite Lux's official post.

Instantly, the public was convinced-Daniela had joined the association.

Before long, businesses were clamoring to secure a membership.

The association's eight members marveled at the frenzy-seven of them couldn't help but give Alexander an approving thumbs-up.

"Alexander's influence is remarkable! Who knew being Daniela's ex-husband would be such an asset?"

"Thanks to this announcement, nearly every major business in the country is scrambling to sign up."
In their rush, no one seemed to notice the tiny line of text tucked away at the bottom of the benefits list.

"All members must unconditionally grant full access to their resources for association use."

This clause allowed them to pool the nation's business resources into a single force against Daniela and Cedric.
No matter how formidable Daniela was, she couldn't take on the entire country's business sector alone.  The group of eight exchanged quiet, knowing chuckles.

Standing in the president's office, Alexande gazed down with a distant, unreadable expression.

In that moment, he felt as though he had finally leveled the playing field with Daniela.

Maybe now, he was worthy of standing before her as an equal.

Now leading the association, Alexander wasted no time in setting up a meeing with Daniela.

Before heading out, he walked alone into the detached villa he had purchased.

Inside, an elderly man with failing eyesight and hearing was the only presence. At the sight of Alexander,he silently locked the door and departed.

The basement was cloaked in shadows, the air thick with the damp, suffocating scent of neglect.

Joyce lay motionless,her wrists and ankles shackled in unforgiving iron.

Her garments were in tatters, the room steeped in the pungent, unmistakable scent of blood and rust.

With a practiced motion, Alexander lifted a  handkerchief to shield himself from the stiflng air.

The measured click of his footsteps stirred Joyce.Slowly, she raised her head, her body bent forward as if in forced submission.

"Alexander, if you've got the nerve, just kill me already! What the hell do you want from me?"

The word "bitch" had been etched into her skin, a grotesque mark of humiliation. Her face contorted with raw fury.

Alexander lingered just beyond her reach, studying her with an unreadable gaze.

"Eager for death?" A slow smirk curled his lips. "Not so fast."
###Chapter 559 Carsick

Joyce's eyes ignited with a venomous, unsettling loathing as she pierced Alexander with her glare."Never forget, the very fabric of your status and dignity is woven from my efforts.When disaster struck the Bennett family, who was your rock? When society shunned you, who was the solitary figure extending a hand in the darkness? Throughout these tumultuous years, I've remained steadfastly by your side.Alexander,pry your eyes open and see the truth-it's me!"

Alexander returned her gaze, his eyes alight with an icy fury that chilled the air between them.

"You claim it was you?" His voice was clipped,harsh with a venom that could freeze blood. "You dare to stand there and claim credit? Let me tell you, Joyce,the empire I built stands on the graves of my pride and conscience. I've become a monster, someone l once viewed with contempt. And you? Far from a savior, you've been a millstone around my neck,treating me as nothing more than a pawn in your games, never as your husband. Your so-called care was merely a facade, spurred by your ego,craving dominance over me. If not for your machinations,Bennett Group wouldn't have toppled so disastrously.If not for your meddling, Daniela wouldn't have divorced me and married Cedric. Every misfortune that has befallen me has your fingerprints all over it!You have no right to keep breathing!"

Alexander advanced on Joyce, his hands clasping around her throat in an iron-tight embrace.

His fingers clamped down with relentless force,squeezing the breath from her lungs.

Looking down, he watched as Joyce's face slowly drained of color. He savored the dominance he wielded over her.

Just as Joyce's eyes began to flutter shut, Alexander's grip loosened.

Joyce crumpled to the floor, her breaths erupting into violent coughs. Yet, amidst the gasping, a wild,hysterical laughter began to bubble up from her.

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she looked up at Alexander,her laughter ringing in the chilling air.

"You regret it now, don't you? How could you not?You let the world's richest slip through your fingers,and Cedric has made her his wife. In the quiet of night,do you torment yourself with thoughts of what might have been if you hadn't chosen me back then? Can you truly blame me? It's not my fault, Alexander. It's your own gullibility. You swallowed every lie I spun,even when the truth was laid bare in those recordings. You knew I orchestrated the fire at your wedding to Daniela,yet you still stood by me. Why? Because of your own foolishness! You were blind to your true feelings for Daniela,convinced that she, who always stood by your side, would never leave. Growing up without a mother's love, you were desperate for unwavering loyalty, never understanding that loyalty must be reciprocated. Only later did you understand,but by then, it was far too late. Daniela, when in love,gave her all. Yet, when her love faded, she severed ties ruthlessly. Regret gnawed at you, but no action could undo what had been done."

Joyce's voice rang out, filled with a malicious glee."Alexander, witnessing the regret etching your face brings me no end of joy. Your own foolishness cost you the love of your life! Now, you're destined to wander loveless as your eternal punishment!"

Reeling from her wNords,Alexander staggered from the villa, each of Joyce's spiteful remarks stabbing at his heart like cold steel.

Yes, he had been a fool-a fool who lost the most profound love he had ever known.

"But that's not the end of it. There will be a way to set things right-there has to be!" Alexander reassured himself, fleeing the scene as though running from his own shadow.

Unbeknownst to him, as he fled, the basement door behind him creaked open, nudged by the whispering wind.

It was a considerable time before Alexander managed to collect himself. He had to meet Daniela soon, and he repeated to himself over and over: the past was just that,the past.

He was determined to compensate Daniela for past shortcomings with future endeavors.

The meeting took place at Alexander's recently inaugurated hotel.

Upon witnessing Daniela and Lillian's arrival, a wave of relief washed over him.

He had dreaded the possibility of Daniela showing up with Cedric.

"Please, take a seat, Daniela," Alexander offered warmly, his tone brimming with attentiveness. "The steak here is exceptional. I recommend giving it a try today."

Daniela, showing little interest, responded tersely,"You orchestrated this meeting through a friend of my mother's. Surely, we're not here just to dine, are we?Let's skip the pleasantries and focus on the matter at hand. We don't have all day."

Despite her directness, Alexander's smile remained unshaken, as if her words held no power to disrupt his mood today.

"Considering your hectic schedule, I made sure to schedule our meeting after business hours. We have a shared history since childhood, after all. Why not enjoy a meal together?"

With a gentle smile, Alexander helped Daniela slice her steak before placing it before her.

"This steak was sourced fresh this morning. I had initially wanted to cook it myself for you, but sadly,my culinary skills fall short. This time, the chef's expertise will have to suffice. Next time, however, I promise to prepare the meal myself."

Alexander was well aware that recently, all of Daniela's meals were personally prepared by Cedric.

His gesture was a clear challenge, a declaration that he could match-and surpass-anything Cedric could do for her.

Daniela wasn't interested. Her face scrunched in displeasure at the aroma of the steak-truly overpowering.

She cleared her throat loudly. "Ahem! Ahem!"

A wave of nausea overtook her, draining the color from her cheeks until she looked positively ghastly. Turning to Lillian, she signaled for her to remove the steak without delay.

After gulping down several sips of water, Daniela barely subdued the gnawing urge to vomit that threatened to overcome her.

Alexander poured water for her, his brows knit together with concern. "What's wrong? Did the ride over here make you carsick? You've always been susceptible to it, even as a child, always complaining about the smell of gasoline."

As Alexander continued to fill her glass, his eyes followed Lillian whisking the steak away. He noted the subtle easing of Daniela's discomfort, and a shadow crossed his features.

Standing close beside her, he observed her delicate profile now shadowed by a touch of vulnerability.

His hand, previously relaxed at his side, slowly balled into a tight fist.
###Chapter 560 You'll Understand Later
"Should I call a doctor for you?" Alexander inquired.
Daniela gestured for the waiter to open the window.As the crisp air flooded the room, she let out a slow breath. Bit by bit, the color returned to her cheeks.

Alexander instinctively lifted his hand,ready to summon a doctor.

Daniela dismissed the gesture with a wave. "That won't be necessary. Just some digestive issues. Speak your mind."

Alexander studied her with a doubtful gaze. Could it really be just digestion problems? His voice carried concern. "Have you at least consulted a doctor?"

Daniela remained silent, and oddly, that silence put Alexander at ease.

For a split second, he had thought she was pregnant.
Daniela took a measured sip of water,her expression unreadable. "You have ten minutes. Make them count."

The message was unmistakable-she wasn't here for idle chatter. Alexander let out a soft chuckle. "Only ten minutes?Come on, we've known each other for years. Cedric won't get jealous over a simple conversation,will he?I mean no harm. Just thought we could talk set the past aside."

Daniela took another slow sip of water,her expression calm yet unreadable. "I deal with countless matters every day and firmly believe in avoiding unnecessary conflicts unless someone gives me a reason to act. As long as you steer clear of those I care about, I'll have no reason to stand against you."

A warning, clear as day.

Alexander caught the message loud and clear but he pretended not to.
He smiled. "We were close once, weren't we? If you're so protective, why haven't I ever been on that list?"

The moment the words left his mouth, Daniela felt that same nauseating sensation stir again.

"Daniela, I have no bad intentions. We both have a place in Olisvine, in the business world. Peace fosters success, don't you agree? We're both at the top. It makes more sense to trust each other than to waste energy on suspicion. I'm offering an olive branch,nothing more. Why not stand together instead of apart?" As he spoke, Alexander lifted his glass and tapped it lightly against Daniela's. "The past is behind us, not worth dwelling on. Why not start fresh-as friends?"

Daniela didn't move, her silence speaking volumes.

Alexander's lips curled into a confident smile. "As the newly appointed president of the commerce association, I now have control over 99% of businesses across the country. I understand that you have no interest in joining, and I won't pressure you.But you need to operate in this environment. Working with me means working smoothly with all these enterprises. Doesn't that make things easier for everyone? I don't know your reasons for going after those eight individuals, but if you intend to proceed,just say the word. You won't have to lift a finger-I'll handle them for you."

Daniela let out a dry scoff. "Oh? I prefer taking care of things myself."

Alexander shook his head, a nostalgic smile tugging at his lips. "Still as stubborn as ever, just like when we were kids. But now that I'm the president of the association, any move I make against them is considered restructuring. However, if you take action,it will be seen as a failure on my part. Daniela,the last thing I want is to stand against you. I give you my word -within a year, those eight will be gone, and no one will even realize it happened. Just stay out of it, alright? If not for me, then at least for Chace. He's my friend now, and if this turns into a public mess,it won't be easy for him either, don't you think?"

Chace Truman had been Brylee's friend.

When Brylee died, Chace oversaw the arrangements and hosted the funeral.

Alexander had Chace step in as a mediator.Chace had said to Daniela, "If your mother were watching over you,she'd want you to be happy. If she knew her death was keeping you shackled, it would break her heart. A mother's only wish is for her child's happiness.You might not see it now, but one day, you will."

Back then, Daniela had thought she wouldn't have to wait long. She'd understand sooner than they realized.

"Fine," Daniela said coolly. "You have a month. If they're still standing after that, don't blame me for handling it my way."

Alexander's eyes gleamed. "Deal! Give me a month,and they'll be gone without a trace!"

With that, Daniela rose from her seat,ready to go.

Alexander sighed with mild regret. "Had I known you weren't feeling well, I would've rescheduled. My apologies. Once this is settled, I'll host a banquet-you have to be there." As Daniela stood, a gust of air carried the scent of steak towards her, making her wrinkle her nose in discomfort.
