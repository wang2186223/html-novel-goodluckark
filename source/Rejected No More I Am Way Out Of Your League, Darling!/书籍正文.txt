###Chapter 1 Murder



On the day the Bennett and Harper families united through marriage, the heavens seemed to unleash their fury,coloring the sky with the deep crimson of roaring flames.


Daniela Harper, clad in her wedding finery, watched in despair as her groom, Alexander Bennett, heroically swept Joyce Holt into his arms and navigated through the scorching heat, not once glancing back at her.


Trapped beneath a massive, fallen screen, Daniela was rendered immobile by its weight, her eyes brimming with tears of frustration and fear.



The air was thick with acrid smoke, and as Daniela struggled for breath, the encroaching shadows of unconsciousness began to cloud her vision, the grim thought of perishing in the blaze gnawing at her mind.


Yet, just as hope seemed to flicker out, a figure emerged through the smoke.


Strong arms lifted her effortlessly, and the steady,reassuring thud of her rescuer's heartbeat against her ear brought an odd solace amidst the chaos.


Suddenly, a piercing hiss cut through the muffled sounds of destruction.



The unmistakable, horrific odor of burning flesh assaulted her senses.



Heart pounding with a mix of fear and confusion,Daniela mustered the strength to pry her eyes open,only to be met with a suffocating veil of smoke that obscured her vision and deepened her terror.



As she fumbled blindly through the darkness,her fingers brushed against something sticky and unsettling. Instinctively, the man bearing her weight recoiled, yet he relaxed soon, permitting her hands to explore without restraint.



The wind screamed in her ears, relentless and chilling.


Gradually, the fierce warmth that had scorched her face began to dissipate.



Struggling against the heaviness of her eyelids, she strained to identify her rescuer.



Through the swirling smoke that clouded her vision,she glimpsed a distinctive mole near the man's eye-a mole that stirred a vague sense of recognition within her.



As the edges of her consciousness began to blur once more, Daniela heard a gentle voice cut through the howling wind. "Sir, the ambulance has arrived. The Harper family is already aboard. We must get moving right away. Your arm requires urgent care, and moreover, today marks Miss Harper's wedding. If people see her with another man, it'll become the talk of the town."







Daniela stirred from her uneasy slumber in the stark,frigid confines of a plain hospital ward.



The moon loomed large outside,bathing everything in its ghostly, somber light. The room lay shrouded in silence, devoid of the presence of her newlywed husband.



Her injuries were grievous: a cracked rib and a deep,ragged cut marred her left cheek. The doctor had cautioned that without meticulous care, the gash could etch a lasting scar on her face.


As dawn broke, the doctor returned to assess her condition.



Glancing around the empty room, he queried,"Where's your family?"


Daniela shook her head with a bitter smile. She had tried to reach Alexander many times, but he hadn't answered.


 
Exhaling a sigh, the doctor advised, "Try to keep still; moving too much could worsen your injuries. If there's no one to assist you, l'll arrange a caregiver for you."



At that moment, a young nurse chimed in, "Aren't you the bride from that fire incident that hit the headlines?Isn't your husband here with you?"



The conversation caught the attention of the head nurse, who coughed slightly, gesturing to silence her colleague. Leaning closer, she murmured, "He's actually upstairs, attending to someone else."


The young nurse's eyes widened in disbelief. "What?But the girl merely sustained a minor scratch on her hand!"



Daniela was the one desperately in need of care.



The head nurse shook her head. "There's an entire team upstairs fussing over her. It's so unjust, isn't it?"


In that instant, a wave of humiliation and despair crashed down upon Daniela. Perched on the edge of the hospital bed, she felt her blood turn to ice, her frame shivering subtly.


Leaning against the wall for support, she made her way upstairs to the exclusive, high-class ward.



Pausing at the doorway, she saw the man she had cherished for a decade feeding her stepsister,Joyce.Their gazes locked, and the connection was palpable.Her stepmother, Katrina Harper, clasped her hand over her mouth, tears sparklingin her eyes. "Caiden,could this be karma? Are my past mistakes haunting our daughter now?"



Caiden Harper, Daniela's biological father and Katrina's spouse, gently touched Katrina's shoulder to comfort her. "No, this was merely an unfortunate incident.None of this is your fault."


"Dad! This was no accident; it was murder! Daniela resents that you and Alexander show her less affection than me. She's malicious. We were the only ones there during the fire, and she pushed me. She wanted me gone."



After saying that, Joyce crumpled into Alexander's embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks as she wept uncontrollably.



Katrina gazed at her daughter's scratched hand before leaning closer to Caiden, seeking comfort in his arms.


"Caiden, Joyce might not share your blood, but she's embraced you as her true father. Who could have imagined such love would spell disaster for her? I've given up so much to keep Daniela content-I vowed to have no more children after marrying you. But it seems nothing will satisfy her. What else does she desire from me? She can take everything from me,even my life, if that's what she wants! But why does Joyce have to suffer? She's done nothing to deserve this."



Katrina's sobs were so intense, so filled with anguish,that an onlooker might have believed she was the one suffering a broken rib and a marred face.



Outside,hidden from view, Daniela overheard every venomous word aimed at her.



She watched, heartbroken, as the two men she cherished most-her father and her husband-lavished their attention on Joyce, neglecting to speak a word in her defense.



Her heart,already fragile, shattered into pieces.



Though her body screamed in protest, Daniela had fought to make it this far. Now, with her pain weighing her down, she turned back, each step slow and agonizing as she made her way back to her room.



After her mother's passing, she seemed to have lost her father as well.



Her husband, whom she had grown up with, had given his heart to another, leaving hers in tatters


Such a harsh betrayal of fate.


As darkness fell, Alexander reached her hospital room,holding a food container. He stopped abruptly at the door, his features carved with a sharp, cutting disdain, as though the very air inside disgusted him.



His eyes, cold and distant, pierced through her.



Summoning every ounce of strength, Daniela pushed herself upright, her voice heavy with a raw, aching despair. "I swear, I didn't push Joyce.She told me her wedding gift for me was in the storeroom. But as we entered, flames engulfed us, and the door was locked from the outside."



With a steely gaze and a hint of impatience,Alexander muttered, "Daniela, stop fooling yourself.There's no sense in pretending any longer. You've always resented Joyce for being everyone's favorite,but to sabotage our wedding day with such malice? |never thought you were capable of being this monstrous!"
###Chapter 2 Apologize To Joyce
With a calm and focused demeanor, Daniela explained the situation to Alexander, her voice ringing with clarity. "The warehouse had surveillance cameras.Even though the fire may have destroyed the cameras,there must be backups stored somewhere."



"Enough!" Alexander's eyes narrowed as he regarded Daniela, hs voice icy and tinged with anger. "Now you're just scrambling for excuses to get out of this.Surveillance footage can be manipulated. I can't trust a single word from you, you deceitful woman!"



Daniela locked eyes with Alexander.



His expression remained stoic, but his gaze was sharp and unwavering. Whenever he looked at someone, it seemed to pierce right through them.



For over a decade, Daniela had clung to the naive hope that she might thaw his icy heart. But she never anticipated it would end like this.



"Go and apologize to Joyce right now!"



His command cut through the air like a chill wind,leaving Daniela feeling as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped on her,her senses reeling.



"I'm your wife! Why won't you believe me?" she demanded, her words breaking with the weight of her vulnerability.



"Daniela,I've told you-apologize! If Joyce decides to take this to court, you'll be the one left in tears,begging for mercy."



His cutting words felt like a jagged knife, tearing through the fragile walls of her heart.



This marriage, these ten years of what she thought was love and devotion, had all been a cruel farce. 3



With a sharp tug on her collar, Alexander yanked her towards Joyce's ward.



A nurse sprinted behind them, desperation lacing her voice. "Her rib is fractured. She needs proper care and rest. What you're doing is downright abusive."


Yet,Alexander blatantly disregarded her pleas.


Daniela faltered, nearly stumbling as he hauled her through the pristine hallways and into the exclusive VIP ward.



The room exuded a warm, tranquil aura. Joyce lay in the bed as Katrina, seated beside her, offered her pieces of fruit. Upon Daniela's entrance, Katrina shot her a fleeting glance then averted her eyes, feigning ignorance of her presence.



Caiden's expression twisted into one of revulsion."You have the audacity to show your face here! Are you even aware of your sister's condition?"


At this point, Daniela felt an icy numbness engulf her heart.



She turned to Caiden and inquired, "Dad, have you forgotten that I'm your own flesh and blood? Do you recall your vow never to remarry after Mom leftus?You promised to look after me. Is this how you do that?"



Her father wasn't even willing to allow her the opportunity to clarify or defend herself.


Caiden's expression wavered momentarily, his brow furrowing in annoyance as he directed a sharp gaze at Daniela. "You're the one who screwed up! Why are you dragging me into it? You've grown quite audacious, haven't you? To think, now you'd even stand up to me!"



In the hospital bed, Joyce appeared robust despite her alleged frailty.


With an exaggerated gesture, she pressed her hands  to her chest as if overwhelmed by a sudden loss of breath. "Do you want Dad to grow old and live the rest of his life completely alone, Daniela? Have you considered how lonely he'll be once you're married?Sitting alone in that huge house, with no one to care for him when he's sick or even pour him a glass of water?"



After that, Joyce turned to Alexander. "Alexander, do you honestly believe I'd start a fire just to end my own life?"



Alexander remained silent, absorbing the weight of the conversation. His face darkened with each passing second,reflecting a growing storm within.



He fixed a cold, unforgiving stare on Daniela and commanded sternly, "Daniela, kneel and beg Joyce for forgiveness!"



Daniela turned to face Alexander, her expression defiant.Why would she do that?






Suddenly, Katrina leapt from her chair and stormed over. Without a moment's hesitation, her hand swung through the air, landing a sharp slap across Daniela's cheek.



Stunned, Daniela could barely register the sudden assault before Katrina collapsed into a heap of raw nerves and tears. Pointing her finger at Daniela, Katrina yelled, "Daniela!You tried to kill my daughter! How can you stand there,unapologetic and accusing her instead? Oh, my poor girl! I'm to blame for everything. I never should've become a stepmother to another's child.It's all on me!I've kept you from the man your heart belongs to and dragged you into danger. I can't forgive myself for this!"



Caiden felt a sharp pang in his chest at Katrina's torment.



Driven by a surge of anger, he approached Daniela and delivered a firm slap too.


The impact sent her reeling back, her body hitting the wall as she struggled to maintain her balance.


Dazed, Daniela stood against the wall, her mind swirling with thoughts as tears blurred her vision.


She fixed her gaze on Alexander, a gleam of hope still lingering in her heart. ①



She silently pleaded for him to defend her, to offer even a single sentence in her favor.



However, Alexander's response shattered her last hope as he said sternly, "Apologize now! Or I'll have to call the police. You're facing charges of attempted murder, Daniela. That could mean life in prison."
###Chapter 3 | Did Nothing Wrong
"Alexander..."



Although Daniela had steeled herself for Alexander's answer,it still cut deeply, like a keen-edged blade tearing through her heart.



How many decades did one get to live, only to have it mean nothing?


She had devoted ten years of her existence to loving this man, investing her soul into the relationship.


Yet, what she received in return was merely his staunch defense of another woman.



"Yes, call the police!" Katrina's voice erupted in the room as she frantically reached for her phone. "Leave this murderer to them to handle!"



Amidst the chaos, only Daniela caught the subtle way Joyce squeezed Katrina's hand following her explosive declaration.



Their eyes met in a fleeting, silent exchange.


Katrina paused, her resolve wavering. Joyce's voice was the epitome of consideration."Alexander, I know you care for me, but this is a matter for our family. Calling the police could lead to my sister's arrest and tarnish the Harper family's reputation. That's the last thing I desire. Perhaps it's best if we..."


She trailed off, her head bowing slightly, her delicate pose belying the cunning glimmer in her gaze."Perhaps it's best if we just let this go."


Her suggestion stirred Caiden and caused Alexander's brow to furrow in contemplation.


His cold eyes bore into Daniela as he spoke with chilling authority. "We can't just let this go! Apologize now! Kneel and beg for forgiveness!"


Despite the sharp agony emanating from her cracked rib,Daniela stood her ground,her spine rigid, unwilling to show any sign of defeat.


In that harrowing moment, a cruel truth crystallized in her mind: her anguish was merely amusement to someone who held no love for her.


"I've already told you, I did nothing wrong! I am innocent, and I refuse to kneel or apologize!"


She had just finished speaking when Caiden closed the distance between them and delivered another harsh  slap to her face.


Reeling from the blow, Daniela, already fragile,teetered dangerously, her form shaking like a leaf in a tempest. Before she could regain her footing, a brutal kick struck her in the back.


With a resonant "thud," she collapsed onto her knees.


The sound of her kneecaps crashing against the hard floor reverberated around the room, sending a jolt of excruciating pain that surged from her knees to her chest.


She braced herself with her palms against the floor.Blood started to ooze through the bandages wrapped around her chest, turning them a stark, vivid red. 2


At the doorway, the nurse could no longer stand to watch the scene unfold.



She rushed over to aid Daniela, then turned to Alexander with a look of stern condemnation. "I've seen the reports. You're Daniela's husband, aren't you?Once you're married, you're supposed to protect each other. How can you treat her with such cruelty? She's seriously hurt, and without proper care, this injury could haunt her for the rest of her life."



"I'd never accept someone so vicious as my wife."Alexander threw a frosty, scornful look at Daniela,who lay crumpled on the floor. His gaze was icy, seeingher as nothing more than a mere fleck of dust on his shoe. "Daniela, today's incident cannot simply be ignored. Joyce may be forgiving, but your actions were severe, and you need to face the consequences.You will kneel here until you acknowledge your mistake!"



He then addressed Caiden."Mr. Harper,you surely see the need for this,don't you?"


With a sharp nod, Caiden agreed, "Absolutely,she needs to reflect deeply. I'm all for it."


At that moment, a doctor summoned the family members, and the room quickly emptied, leaving behind only Daniela and Joyce.


Perched haughtily on the hospital bed, Joyce looked down at Daniela, who was still kneeling, her hands quivering as she supported herself. A derisive smirk played on Joyce's lips.


"Daniela, does it even matter that you're Dad's biological child? Look at yourself, kneeling before me.I like Alexander, and if he's not mine, he sure as hell won't be yours!"


Secretly, Daniela slid her left hand into her pocket and pressed the record button on her phone.


Her pallid complexion was drenched with sweat,each drop trailing down her damp and strained forehead. Holding Joyce's gaze, she demanded in a steady,clear voice, "So, it was you behind the fire all along,wasn't it?"
###Chapter 4 Let's Get A
Divorce



"Yes,I did it! The warehouse was drenched in gasoline,packed with explosives, all set to go up in flames the second you showed up." Joyce gloated triumphantly,her voice dripping with arrogance. "And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do, Daniela? NNo one's going to believe you. They'll think the footage is manipulated! Besides, I've already wiped it clean.Dad and Alexander made it painfully clear today-they think you're useless, not worth even a shred of trust."


With that, Joyce reclined on the hospital bed, a smirk playing across her face.


"Keep kneeling," she commanded smugly and crossed her legs. "Daniela, you're going to kneel before me like this forever!"



Daniela attempted to rise, her body straining against an invisible weight.


Beads of sweat pooled on the floor, dampening the tiles beneath her.



Her heart felt shattered, yet within the shards, a stubborn spark of hope flickered dimly. She had clung to the belief that Alexander, with his meticulous nature, would eventually see through the charade if he scrutinized the details more closely.


But reality was a cruel master. She had given Alexander too much credit.


The sound of Alexander's leather shoes echoed ominously as he approached. He towered over her,his gaze icy and unyielding. "Are you ready to apologize now?"



Pain overwhelmed Daniela, her consciousness wavering. She tilted her head to meet his eyes,her voice a faint whisper. "Have you considered every angle of this situation thoroughly?"


A scornful laugh echoed above her, chilling in its disdain.



His contempt was palpable, wrapping around her like an unrelenting frost.


"Daniela, stop being so pathetic. Just own up to what you've done already. Fine. Let's end this marriage. I'm done wasting my life on someone as malicious as you."


At his words, Daniela's rigid posture crumbled.Desolation engulfed her heart.


"For the last time, I'm innocent."Summoning the last remnants of her strength, Daniela leaned against the wall to pull herself upright.


Though her face was gaunt, her eyes glimmered with an indomitable spirit. She fixed her gaze on Alexander,articulating each word with precision. "Fine by me.I'll gladly take the divorce. Why would I want a husband too blind to see the truth?"



Daniela retreated to her shared ward.



Murmurs from a few patients fluttered around her.With her own phone inoperable, she borrowed one from a neighboring patient.


Instead of making a call, she simply sent a text message.


"Lillian, send people to Northpoint Hospital to come get me."


Without delay, Lillian replied, "Right away!"



Daniela's condition was deteriorating. By the time Lillian Dawson reached her, a severe fever had set in.



The persistent throb of her fractured rib was unrelenting, and her face was so severely swollen,it resembled an inflated balloon.



Lillian seethed with rage. "Have they lost their minds?
Choosing that worthless bitch over you? Let me handle this-I'll put an end to them!"



Without hesitation, she took out her phone and began to dial.



However,Daniela,despite her frailty, placed her hand over Lillian's, pressing the end call button.


Lillian clenched her fists, her voice heavy with desperation. "This is outright domestic abuse! You've been hurt! Are you seriously considering forgiving Alexander after everything he's done?"


Her eyes then caught the glimpse of fresh blood oozing through Daniela's bandages, and tears began streaming down her face.


With Lillian's support, Daniela pushed herself to stand."Let's get out of here for now. We'll deal with them when the timne is right."


Observing Daniela's weakened state, Lillian nodded,her tears mingling with a fierce resolve.


She vowed to tear that despicable pair apart piece by piece.


Lillian then went to take care of the hospital discharge forms. 


Outside, Daniela stood waiting, lifting her gaze towards the hospital's upper floors.


The opulent third-floor ward still glowed brightly.


Inside, Alexander was nestled under the soft lamp's light, peeling an apple. A warm smile played on his lips as he chatted with the woman beside him.



Daniela managed a strained, sorrowful smile.



Ten long years, and the warmth of that smile she desperately sought had never once been hers.


Joyce,however, had earned it effortlessly.


Daniela realized she had been wrong all this time.


She could no longer stand on her own.



Before she collapsed, she saw Lillian rushing towards her,her face etched with worry.


Before long, Daniela was hurried into the intensive care unit.	


The icy IV fluid seeped into her veins, lulling her into a profound slumber.


When she finally woke up, two days had slipped by.


"Daniela! Are you alright?" Lillian's eyes, swollen and red,betrayed her vigil by Daniela's side. Daniela slowly propped herself up, her voice raspy as she replied, "Don't worry. I'm fine."


Following breakfast, Daniela glanced at her phone.



The online frenzy over "the bride from the fire" was overwhelming.



Criticism rained down on Daniela in the comments section.



Lillian exclaimed through clenched jaw, "We can't just let Joyce get away with this! The internet is praising her as beautiful and kind-hearted, declaring that she deserves to be the rightful heiress to the Harper family."


Daniela remained unfazed, her eyes skimming over the hurtful words. They no longer had the power to wound her.


For the first time, she felt the fog lift, leaving her with a piercing sense of clarity.


From this moment forward, she resolved to reserve her heart for those who truly loved her.


The old Daniela had perished in the flamnes.


The naive and deceived Daniela was gone, once and for all.

###Chapter 5 I Don't Want His Damned Money
The rumors online were spreading rapidly, each update adding more fuel to the fire. It seemed as if unseen hands were stoking the gossip, making it burn even brighter.



"No wonder people say being a stepmother is a challenge. And even her biological daughter doesn't have it easy either. Daniela must be the mastermind behind the fire incident, trying to take Joyce out!"


"Exactly! Did you hear that Daniela is indulging in some fancy private hospital room that costs six grand a night? Her father and stepmother are at her beck and call, and her husband's there, peeling fruit for her like she's some queen. Meanwhile, poor Joyce is crammed into a room with five others, struggling even to get water!"



"No doubt about it-Daniela must have everything handed to her on a silver platter!"


"That's right. Daniela got out of the hospital already,but Joyce is still laid up there. I heard Joyce ended up with a broken rib and a scar on her face."



"Poor Joyce! Daniela's absolutely despicable! Justbecause she's the biological daughter, does she deserve royal treatment?"



Amidst the swirling vortex of distorted rumors, one comment in the online chaos stood out, shedding a different light on the situation. "I'm sharing a ward with five others at Northpoint Hospital, and Daniela was here with us. HHonestly, she's a genuinely nice person-beautiful, kind, and nothing like the spoiled heiress everyone makes her out to be. It's her husband who's the real piece of work!"



This comment was soon engulfed by a wave of dismissive responses, with critics sneeringly accusing Daniela of paying people to spread falsehoods.


The netizens jeered, dismissing the accusation as absurd.




Lillian, too, caught sight of the comment and huffed derisively, "Ridiculous! Daniela is a celebrated fashion titan, the visionary behind Elite Lux. If she hadn't thrown her future away on that scoundrel, she'd top the list of the world's wealthiest. What right do these nobodies have to judge?"


Meanwhile, Daniela remained unfazed by the online uproar, finding Lillian's indignant expression somewhat amusing.


"Are you seriously laughing, Daniela? You're going to let these keyboard warriors hired by Joyce defame you?"


Daniela held up her phone, the recording on full display, and smirked. "Definitely not."



Lillian's eyes popped wide open in surprise."What?"


Placing her phone back into her pocket, Daniela declared nonchalantly, "I've decided-it's time to file for a divorce."



She spoke with a chilling calmness, her voice devoid of any trace of emotion.


Lillian's mouth fell open in shock.


With a playful grin, Daniela nudged Lillian's chin up."Have the legal department prepare a divorce agreement for me."


A gleam of excitement flashed across Lillian's face."Are you for real? You're not joking,right?"


Daniela merely raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.



Lillian nearly leaped from her chair, her eyes wide with disbelief. "You've actually come to your senses? I was starting to think you'd let that piece of trash ruin you forever." Lillian put her hand over her heart in an exaggerated gesture, which elicited a burst of laughter from Daniela.



"Was I really that hopeless before?"


Lillian's expression turned earnest as she nodded vigorously. "Absolutely. You were lost."


Daniela let out a chuckle, reflecting on her past.


Indeed, she had been consumed by love for Alexander for ten long years, an entire decade lost in hopeless yearning.


For his slightest attention, she had repeatedly humbled herself, longing for even a sliver of his affection.1



Moved by Daniela's newfound realization, Lillian wiped away a tear and reached out to the company's legal team.



The lawyer, sleeves rolled up and ready for action,inquired seriously, "What compensation do you seek from Alexander?"



With a composed, icy gaze, Daniela replied firmly,"I don't want his damned money!"



"Exactly!" Lillian affirmed with a nod. Daniela had faced the world on her own terms since she lost her mother at the tender age of five. Over the years, she crafted a successful brand that catapulted her into a billionaire status long before she reached adulthood. The thought of needing anything from Alexander was almost comical to her.



Those who scorned Daniela were foolish, thinking she was cut from the same weak cloth as Joyce-a woman with no ambition, content to cling to her family and wait for marrying into a rich family.


How utterly ridiculous!


After departing from the hospital, Daniela promptly reached out to Alexander,her determination unshaken.



The phone rang several times before his secretary picked up with a sniff.



"Daniela? What is it this time?" the secretary asked,his voice dripping with condescension. He was well aware of Alexander's disregard for Daniela and didn't bother to mask his own contempt.


"I need to speak with Alexander," Daniela replied, her voice steady and accustomed to the dismissive attitudes of those employed by Bennett Group.



The secretary cast a glance towards Alexander, who was currently engaged in a close conversation with Joyce.


Joyce seemed to be almost attached to Alexander,her body leaning into his.


"Mr. Bennett is currently in a meeting," the secretary lied smoothly.


Without missing a beat, Daniela responded, "Tell him to meet me at the courthouse at eight tomorrow morning. We're finalizing the divorce."

###Chapter 6 Welcome Back



As Alexander entered, he noticed his secretary had just ended a phone call.


In a casual tone, he inquired, "Who was on the line?"


The secretary,seemingly indifferent, responded, "It was Daniela. She's demanding a divorce and has even scheduled a court session for tomorrow morning at eight."


As words hung in the air, Joyce couldn't help but sneer inwardly.


Given Daniela's deep affection for Alexander, could she truly be serious about a divorce?



Despite her skepticism, Joyce kept up her innocent act.



She clung to Alexander's arm, pressing herself against him, and spoke with a seductive lilt. "I'm to blame,aren't I? Daniela must be upset that you were so attentive to me while I was hospitalized. She's obviously jealous. Perhaps I should apologize to her."


Alexander's soothing touch comforted Joy ce. "Don't let this get to you. None of this is your fault. Daniela can be quite petty. She wants a divorce? Fine, I'll go to the courthouse tomorrow and see if she really means it!" -



With an exaggerated look of surprise, Joyce tilted her head and replied, "Alexander, don't act rashly. How could she really want to divorce you? She's just trying to intimidate you. If you really agreed to divorce her,she'd be embarrassed. Don't go, okay?"



Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark with irritation. "If I don't go, she'll keep using divorce to threaten me. Who the hell can stand that?Furthermore, the fire was entirely her doing. Joyce,you didn't deserve this, and I'll make sure Daniela owns up to it."


Joyce bowed her head, a picture of submission,choosing to remain silent.


Unbeknownst to those present, a chilling, sinister smirk briefly danced across her lips following Alexander's declaration.



That very day, Alexander's secretary laid out the freshly delivered divorce agreement on his desk.



Upon returning from his meeting, Alexander flicked his gaze over the document's cover and dismissed it with a cold, disdainful toss into the trash.



Daniela had taken things too far, and this was the final straw.



Meanwhile, having delivered the divorce agreement,Daniela retreated to her hotel, a smug sense of finality in her stride.



She had always imagined that parting ways wwith Alexander would shatter her,leaving her heart in ruins.


Yet, as the decisive moment unfolded, the only sensation that enveloped her was a profound,liberating relief.



She had held on to the hollow fantasy of loving Alexander for so long that she'd fooled herself into thinking he was all she had.


Yet, leaving him proved surprisingly simpler than anticipated.


With a sniffle, she was about to enter the hotel.



Raising her eyes, she stopped dead, struck by astonishment.



Gathered before her at the entrance stood the core members of Elite Lux's design team.


These were the very individuals who had placed their unwavering trust in Daniela, a minor, when the company was just blossoming. They had stood by her side, except when she had chosen to marry Alexander.



They had cautioned her then, adamant that Alexander was not the man for her, but she had dismissed their concerns outright.


She had clung to the belief that true love justified any sacrifice, crossing any distance, with no regrets. ②


Now, reflecting on those times, she recognized her naivety.



Facing her team, Daniela's lips twitched into a subtle smile, and her eyes shimmered with tears,overwhelmed by the flood of memories.


Standing before her, the group formed a perfect row,their joyful faces lighting up the space. "Welcome back!"


Within the confines of the hotel, Lillian approached Daniela after the others went to their own rooms."Daniela, when do we leave?"



Elite Lux had its headquarters situated far overseas.



"Get Ryan here," Daniela instructed briskly.



Lillian was confused.



"While this marriage has to end, I must clear my name too," Daniela explained.



Lillian strode across the hallway, pushed open the door opposite Daniela's, and called out, "Ryan,Daniela needs you."


Ryan Parker's brilliance lay in his obsession with technology, spending most of his time secluded in a server room. But today, he was here for one reason-to welcome Daniela.


Draped entirely in black, his hooded sweatshirt cast shadows over his face, leaving only his pale lips visible beneath the shroud. His complexion, stark and ghostly,gave him an unmistakable vampire-like aura.


"Daniela,what can I do for you?" Ryan's tone was calm,with a hint of curiosity.
###Chapter 7 Your Life Will Be Sailing Smoothly From H...
Daniela sent the recording to Ryan, declaring, "I want this recording and the surveillance footage broadcast across every media outlet for the entire week,starting tomorrow morning."



Ryan nodded and made an "OK" gesture.



As the sun began to rise, Daniela laced up for a morning jog, enjoying the calm solitude of the deserted streets. 8



Upon her return, she appeared rejuvenated, her skin glowing with the rush of her morning exercise.Meanwhile,Lillian emerged fromn her sleep, disheveled and bleary-eyed.


"Good morning, Daniela," she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.


Daniela changed into fresh attire. Stepping out, she caught sight of Lillian's groggy figure and advised,"Go back to bed. I'm heading out."



This roused Lillian fully, who called out energetically,"Your life will be sailing smoothly from here on."  Outside the courthouse, Daniela paused at the entrance, her presence undeniable in a stark white dress that highlighted her statuesque frame and accentuated her long legs. She commanded attention effortlessly, the bustling environment turning into a mere backdrop to her poise.



Bystanders,whether they were there to tie the knot or sever ties, found their gazes inadvertently drawn to her.



Across the street, parked under the sprawling shade of a large tree, Alexander sat in his car, observing the scene.



He couldn't help but scowl at the admiring looks Daniela received from passersby.


As Daniela waved off the tenth man asking for her number, Alexander flung open his car door and stepped out.



Watching him approach from afar, Daniela noted the familiar cold,detached expression etched across his face. Such indifference once pained her, but now,it barely registered.



In a nonchalant tone, she declared, "Let's get going."


However,before she could move forward, Alexander reached out, capturing her wrist in his firm grasp. 
A frown marred Daniela's features, and with a quick tug, she freed herself, taking a step back.


The corners of Alexander's mouth turned down, his face clouding over with a mixture of anger and disbelief. "Daniela, don't test my patience. It's wearing thin!"



With a scornful laugh, Daniela retorted, "Soon, you won't have to tolerate me anymore. I've been here over three hours. Let's expedite this, shall we?"


Alexander's face darkened further, his tone edged with a dire warning. "Are you certain you want to go through with this divorce? Remember, Daniela, not everything in life offers a second chance."



Daniela's patience snapped, her frustration evident."You're right! Let's finalize this divorce soon."


She briskly collected two forms from a nearby clerk and began filling them out, her movements sharp and determined.



Alexander stood rigid, his eyes narrowing as he towered over her. "I'm offering you one last chance.Admit you were responsible for the fire that day.Kneel and apologize to Joyce. If you do,I might consider letting this all slide."



His expression was stern, his attitude dripping with condescension and righteousness.


"Don't waste your time. My knees don't bend for anyone," she declared as she slid the completed documents across to Alexander. "Just sign here."


Alexander's eyes narrowed as he scanned the papers;everything was in order except for their signatures.


A storm cloud seemed to settle over his face as raw anger ignited in his piercing gaze. "Daniela! Do you think this will intimidate me? Let me make this clear -if you want a divorce, don't expect to walk away with a dime of my money."


Unperturbed, Daniela pointed to the line for his signature,her voice cool and detached. "Oh, please.That pitiful amount? Let Joyce have it-it might cover her hospital bills one day."


A crease formed on Alexander's forehead as he mulled over her words. The thought of Daniela leaving without a settlement seemed unbelievable.


Nevertheless, Daniela promptly signed her name.Raising her eyes to meet his, she wore a taunting smile.


"What's the matter? Getting cold feet? Or are you just realizing you're not ready to lose me after all?"she spat, her words slicing with sarcastic cruelty.


Alexander was about to reply when Daniela abruptly  cut him off,raising her hand with an air of finality. Her voice was sharp, laced with clear disdain. "Save your nonsense. The idea of sharing a man with another woman makes my skin crawl-it's pathetic."



This remark set Alexander's blood boiling. His eyes narrowed into a hard glare, and his voice turned frosty as he spoke. "Is this truly what you want?" ①



As Daniela's serene expression held steady,Alexander felt a surge of resolve. Clearly, she needed to learn her lesson.



If she thought she could leave him and come back like nothing happened, she was living in a fool's dream.



Once this divorce was finalized, her life wouldn't be so easy. Even crawling on her knees wouldn't fix the mess she's made.



With a firm grip, Alexander took hold of the pen and inked his name onto the agreement. The procedure unfolded with brisk efficiency, the staff wrapping up the formalities in a blink.



Moments later, their divorce was finalized.



Nearby, a group of onlookers voiced their astonishment.



"Can you believe it? Even a woman as breathtaking as her is getting divorced. Where's the fairness in that?" "I'd love to know which fool is wvilling to divorce her.He must have been out of his mind."



"Look at this guy-nothing out of the ordinary.Why do the most radiant women settle for such a man?"



"Such a shame!"



"Miss, thinking about another shot at marriage?I know a few top-tier CEOs. Trust me, they'd treat you way better than this joker!"


Daniela offered a gracious smile, her expression cloaked in politeness as she thanked him.


Turning away,her gaze fell upon Alexander. He was a little distance away, his features twisted into a severe frown.



Daniela dismissed his sullen mood with a mere glance.Just as she was about to step away, her wrist was seized once more.



Annoyance marred Daniela's features as she wrenched her wrist back.



Alexander's tone was icy, the chill in his words unmistakable. "Daniela, do you really think that throwing a fit and divorcing me will erase all our problems? Do you have any idea how much Joyce has been suffering? She's been haunted by nightmares from that fire for days. You should kneel before her and beg for forgiveness. It's time to own up to your mistakes!"



Daniela stood frozen, a shiver tracing her spine as his words sank in. For a heartbeat, the world seemed to pause,her blood running cold.



She met his gaze, the man she had known for over a decade,yet in that moment, he felt like a stranger.


A sigh escaped her lips, soft and weary, yet her eyes began to twinkle with a defiant spark.


"Alexander, I couldn't agree more. People should pay the price for their mistakes."






A slow, knowing smile curled the corners of her lips.Joyce couldn't escape the consequences that were coming her way.
###Chapter 8 Video Released



Elite Lux's aircraft soared into the sky an hour later,leaving the familiar landscapes of the country far below.



Daniela remained seated quietly in the opulent cabin,her eyes cast downward in contemplation.



By now, she surmised that the headlines and buzz in Olisvine were likely ablaze with the leaked audio and the footage of the fire.



She had delivered the response Alexander had been pressing for.



From that point forward, their connection was severed -no obligations, no bonds, absolutely nothing lingered between them.



Meanwhile,back at the headquarters of Phillips Group,the oppressive silence in the boardroom shattered with an unexpected knock.



The executives whipped their heads around, eyes wide with disbelief at the boldness of the secretary daring to disturb the solemnity.



After all, the memory was still fresh of the previous secretary who had interrupted Cedric Phillips' meeting,now enduring a bleak reassignment in Antarctica. 



While the executives silently sent their condolences to the unfortunate soul, the secretary confidently closed the distance to the stoic Cedric and whispered something.



"Really?" A flicker of relief passed over Cedric's usually rigid expression, a rare smile breaking through.


The room of executives fell into stunned silence,unable to utter a single word.



With a firm nod, the secretary confirmed,"Yes, Mr.Phillips. They've completed the divorce proceedings."



A ripple of curiosity surged through the room, stirring the appetites of the executives who thrived on company gossip.



Divorce? Who got divorced? What in the world was happening?



Cedric abruptly stood and declared, "That concludes today's meeting. Kevin, arrange the next flight out to Elite Lux for me."



The room fell silent, shock etching the faces of the executives.



After Cedric left, an executive, driven by a blend of confusion and curiosity, reached out and grasped Kevin's arm. "This is unprecedented! A five-minute meeting? Where is Mr. Phillips off to so urgently?"


With a sly grin, Kevin responded, "If everything goes as planned, Mr. Phillips will be walking down the aisle in no time."



His words hung in the air, leaving a trail of astonishment among the listeners.







"Yes,I love Alexander!"



"I was behind that fire! I instructed someone to douse the place with gasoline, and I was the one who set it ablaze. I intended to ruin your wedding to Alexander!"



"So what if you're Dad's biological daughter? Anything you own, I'll snatch it away!"



"Daniela, does it even matter that you're Dad's biological child? Look at yourself, kneelng before me.And what good will your cloud surveillance footage do,Daniela? No one's going to believe you anyway!"6


"Your wedding is just the start. By the time I'm done,your whole life will be in shambles!"



Suddenly, the hashtag #TruthOfTheBridelnFire skyrocketed to prominence on social media. Audio  clips mingled with visuals of a blazing inferno circulated rapidly across various platforms.



Joyce was in the midst of a high-stakes executive meeting between Bennett Group and Harper Group when the controversial video caught her eye.


In a flurry of panic, she inadvertently pressed the play button, and instantly, her harsh and biting voice echoed through the conference room.



Upon realizing her blunder, she looked up to see over a hundred executives from both corporations fixed on her, their faces etched with loaded glares.


Joyce's cheeks flushed a deep scarlet as she frantically waved her hands, exclaiming, "That wasn't my voice! This is slander! It's a setup by Daniela to destroy my reputation.You see now-how malevolent she is! I'm contacting the police immediately!"



Half an hour later, an in-depth professional analysis of the video and audio surfaced online. The findings confirmed that the audio and surveillance footage were indeed genuine, with no signs of alteration or manipulation.



This disclosure struck Joyce like a brutal reprimand.



At last, Alexander grasped the true implications of Daniela's earlier statement-people should pay the price for their mistakes. But the fallout was merciless-Joyce facedan online storm of hatred, her name dragged through the mud



"Unbelievable! I've never seen such audacity from a stepdaughter!"



"The audacity to make the real daughter kneel? I can't decide if it's cruel or just plain ridiculous."



"And really, what gave Joyce the nerve to start a fire at her stepsister's wedding? So Daniela was the bride caught in the fire? All that slander, all those accusations, and now it's clear she did nothing wrong.How embarrassing for them."



"It's truly sad. After her mother's passing, Daniela has lost her father too. And let's be honest, would Joyce have dared such boldness if Caiden hadn't spoiled her?"



"Don't forget Alexander! His own wife was unjustly blamed, yet he sided with the one who lit the fire.What's happening between Joyce and Alexander,anyway?"



"Despicable man!"



As the torrent of online vitriol continued, someone abruptly shared an image.


Displayed was the divorce certificate of Alexander and Daniela.Underneath the photo, the consensus in the comments was clear. "Justice is served!"


Alexander perused the trending topics on his smartphone, his expression turning thunderous.


With a forceful thud, he hurled the phone onto the table and barked at his secretary, "What is the PR team even up to? Why wasn't I alerted before this scandal broke? These headlines have just splashed across the globe, and no one intervened?"


The secretary, with a lowered gaze, responded tentatively, "Mr. Bennett, these topics surged unexpectedly. Our team is actively addressing it.It appears hackers instigated this, and we've yet to neutralize it. The tech team is on it, and we anticipate a resolution shortly."



Alexander scoffed bitterly. It would be resolved shortly? Not instantly, not immediately,but shortly?By that time, the whole nation had witnessed it.



"Daniela, you've truly cornered me this time," he sneered under his breath, his anger barely contained.


Since she dared to cross the line like this, forgiveness would be a luxury she'd never see from him. 


As for rejoining the Bennett family? She'd better forget it-that door was slammed shut for good.
His rage simmered to a boil.


He positioned himself by the panoramic window, his stare icy and piercing. His brows knit tightly together,his whole presence exuding a forbidding, frosty aura.



He was on the verge of telling his secretary to call Daniela when his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.



It was his father.



With a sense of foreboding, Alexander answered the call, only to be greeted by a barrage of anger."Alexander! Has Daniela gone absolutely insane?Everyone is badgering me about whether you've dumped Daniela to fool around with her stepsister!Where the hell is Daniela? I don't give a damn what you have to do-get those damn posts deleted now!"



Alexander's voice remained composed. "I understand."


His father, Richard Bennett, was far from pacified."Tell Daniela she's out of her goddamn mind if she thinks I'll ever forgive her for this!" 



The call terminated with an abrupt click, leaving a heavier frown on Alexander's face.



Now Daniela had truly incited Richard's wrath. It seemed she was courting disaster.
Alexander resolved then and there that she was on her own. No more would he be her protector-not now,not ever. 12



Today,Daniela had truly stirred up a storm


Alexander attempted to call her, but it went to voice mail.


Anger surged within him


What bullshit game was Daniela playing this time?



He thought to send her a message, only to realize he had been blocked.



As he contemplated his next move, his phone rang once more. It was none other than Caiden.


"Alexander! What the hell is wrong with Daniela?Joyce is at home sobbing like crazy now!" 
###Chapter 9 She Chose To Divorce Me

The comments online had grown so rampant that Caiden found himself unable to face the others.



People accused him of favoring his stepdaughter.Some questioned whether he derived some twisted pleasure from parenting another man's child.



Each biting comment sliced through Caiden's pride like a sharp blade. Some of them branded him a brazen social climber,suggesting he had ascended the societal ranks on the coattails of Daniela's deceased mother.Following her passing, he let her daughter bullied by his stepdaughter.  Critics mocked his so-called fragile masculinity,claiming he resorted to such demeaning tactics merely to uphold it



Caiden,seething with fury, shattered several cups at home and bellowed at Alexander, "Tell Daniela if she's not home by the end of the day, she's out of the family for good!"
Alexander responded, "I divorced Daniela today."
"What?" The room seemed to tilt around Caiden."Daniela divorced you? How dare she!" 
Alexander maintained his composure. Our divorce is all over the internet."



Staggered, Caiden clutched at his chest, his breath hitching as his legs folded beneath him.


Upon Alexander's arrival at the hospital, Katrina's loud sobs echoed down the hallway before he even stepped into the room.  As he entered, he noticed the pronounced veins throbbing on Caiden's forehead, a testament to his simmering rage.



The moment Caiden's eyes locked on Alexander, he lamented, "You have endured much. It is our disgrace that we raised such a ungrateful girl.Joyce has cleared up everything with us. The audio clip and footage are fabricated. She didn't say those things!" 



With tears streaming down her face, Katrina added,"Absolutely, they're nothing but lies! Alexander, don't fret over the divorce with Daniela. You and Joyce have grown up together. You two are a perfect match."



She then turned to Caiden, seeking confirmation."Isn't that right, dear?" Caiden nodded vigorously, his face a mask of firm agreement.



The intensity of his defense made it seem to any observer as though Joyce was his own flesh and blood.


"Indeed, it's well known that a marriage alliance exists between the Harper and Bennett families. Alexander,you could marry Joyce instead. That way, we'd still unite our families as intended."



Caiden nodded again, more eagerly this time. "Yes, I'm going to make a public declaration immediately,cutting ties with Daniela. From this moment forward,Joyceis my only daughter."



Overwhelmed, Joyce burst into tears and rushed into Caiden's embrace.



Between heavy sobs, she declared, "Dad, I will be a good daughter to you. I'll take care of you when you're old!"



Katrina dabbed at her eyes with a tissue in a theatrical display of emotion, and remarked to Alexander, "Look at the touching bond between father and daughter!"



Alexander stayed quiet throughout this exchange.



Joyce wiped away her feigned tears and turned to Alexander with a coy smile. "Alexander, when do you  think we should get married?"


Alexander's expression remained unreadable as he spoke in a flat tone. "I'll need to take this up with my family first."



Joyce's smile briefly wavered, revealing a flicker of disappointment before she recomposed herself,donning her charming mask once again.


With a soft, reassuring smile, she murmured,"Alexander, I'll do anything you ask-I'm here for you."


After Alexander stepped out of the hospital room,Joyce hurried after him, her posture meek, radiating a timid and vulnerable charm. Her eyes, reddened from emotion, conveyed a blend of sorrow and distress.



"Alexander, is it because I'm not my father's biological daughter that you hold back? Is that the real reason you won't marry me? Do you scorn me like the rest?" 



In her gestures and tone, Joyce mirrored Katrina,possessing an aura that seemed out of place among refined circles. Her eyebrows arched slightly in a manner that seemed contrived, her voice overly saccharine.



Alexander studied her face in contemplative silence for a long moment before he finally responded, "The audio and surveillance footage weren't tampered with.
I've had experts verify their authenticity."1


Joyce froze in place. She had not anticipated that Alexander would delve into the investigation himself.


She had assumed his unwavering support would shield her,never imagining that the erased footage might be restored.



She had underestimated Daniela.


Yet,with the truth now laid bare, denial was futile.


"Alexander, I'm begging you, please believe me-l had no other option!" Joyce implored, her hands concealing her tear-streaked face. Her voice quivered with desperation. "Daniela knew about my feelings for you and took delight in tormenting me behind the scenes. She branded me a misfit brought in by a stepmother, and mocked me for aiming too high,thinking I could ever aspire to be with someone like you.It drove me to the brink, and in a moment of sheer rage, I lashed out. I had no idea Daniela would stoop so low as to record everything. Alexander, I swear,I was driven to the edge." 2



Alexander's gaze fell on Joyce, her cheeks glistening with a cascade of tears.



He kept his thoughts to himself, his voice low and steady. "Now that you've seen Daniela's true colors,be more vigilant. You're already under scrutiny. Don't  make things harder for yourself." 


With that, he turned and walked away.



Joyce watched his departing figure, her eyes narrowing, a frosty expression settling over her face.


"Joyce, what's happening?" Katrina's voice broke through as she emerged from the hospital room.



"I had the perfect strategy lined up, but Daniela came up with evidence. I totally underestimated her. Never mind-she's out of Alexander's world, and my path to success is just starting to clear."


Joyce glanced briefly towards the hospital room, then leaned closer to Katrina, lowering her voice. "Mom,push Caiden to cut all ties with Daniela. Once he does,the Harper family will be within our reach."


Privately, Joyce never referred to Caiden as "Dad."


Her strategy was clear: claim the Harper family's wealth while Daniela was sidelined, thus preventing any future entanglements should she return.


As long as she wielded control over the Harper family fortune, the Bennett family would overlook her modest origins.



Then, securing a marriage with Alexander would be within reach. Katrina's smile held a hint of smug assurance."No need to worry. Caiden is fully wrapped around my finger."







The topic remained a hot issue online for over a week.



Ultimately, Harper Group had no choice but to enlist a third-party PR firm to handle the fallout.



However, merely an hour later, the controversy resurged, this time cementing its place in the public eye for a whole month.



Alexander, overwhelmed and exhausted, closed his eyes and demanded of the PR team, "What happened this time?"



It seemed these pesky trending topics simply refused to fade away.



The company staff responded with candid transparency, "Mr. Bennett, previously it was a technical glitch. This time, someone has deliberately brought it back."



Alexander's frustration boiled over, his voice piercing as he barked, "Who's behind it this time?"



The answer came back clear and direct. "My boss,  Cedric Phillips."



Consequently, the scandalous revelations about how Caiden had ousted his own daughter for a woman,and Alexander's affair with his wife's stepsister swept across the nation.



Within days, the stocks of both the two groups nosedived to an all-time low.



Driven to desperation, both families scoured for Daniela. Yet, she had disappeared, erased from the world as though she had never been part of it at all.



"Where the hell did she disappear to?" Caiden bellowed, his voice thick with rage. Harper Group had endured catastrophic losses recently, unlike anything before.



His eyes were bloodshot, a clear sign of his sleepless nights and boiling frustration.


The situation was dire. If things didn't turn around soon,he might have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.



Approaching Caiden cautiously, Joyce tried to soothe him. "Dad, try to stay calm. Daniela has always been stubborn. You know that."



Caiden's face flushed a deeper shade of red.



In a fit of fury, he sent Daniela a stern message, warning her that if she didn't address the chaos she'd caused online within three days, he would take the drastic step of disowning her publicly.



Meanwhile,Alexander had taken matters into his own hands by hiring a private investigator to track down Daniela. Yet, after two agonizing weeks, there was still no word from the investigator.



Katrina reached out to a lawyer.



On the same day,Harper Group made a bombshell announcement that rocked the internet. Caiden, acting as the president, officially disowned Daniela.



For Alexander, there was no familial bond with Daniela to sever, but the repercussions on the company's reputation were severe and undeniable.



He reached out to the investigator, his voice low and filled with dissatisfaction. "I've handed you a fortune,and you're telling me you can't track down a defenseless woman?"



The investigator was equally perplexed. "Mr. Bennett,our team ranks among the finest in the nation. If she's eluding us, she's out of reach for anyone. But I must ask-are you certain she is merely an ordinary woman?Could she perhaps be concealing a more formidable persona beneath her unassuming exterior? How else could she vanish without a trace?" With a deep sigh, Alexander squeezed his eyes shut,his mounting irritation finally breaking through.



Daniela was a woman everyone dismissed as a pathetic,lovesick fool. What secret could someone so pitiful possibly be hiding?



Over the last decade, the most extreme thing Daniela had ever done was love him fervently. What other feats could she have accomplished?



If it turned out Daniela did harbor some secret identity,he would swallow his arrogant claims whole. 8



"Mr. Bennett, should we consider engaging another private investigator?" Alexander's secretary offered."It's been quite some time. Maybe something has happened to her."



Positioned by the panoramic window, Alexander surveyed the teeming city streets below, his expression detached.



"Forget it. She's the one who wanted the divorce, so whatever mess she's in now is her own problem,not mine."
###Chapter 10 Did You Offend Mr.Phillips
Three months had passed when a stunning headline captured everyone's attention in Olisvine.



"Breaking News! Landmark of Olisvine Acquired by Mysterious Magnate!"



The elite of the city were abuzz, their conversations brimming with intrigue and wild guesses.


"Can you believe it? Someone is rich enough to snag Olisvine's iconic Luxor Tower!"



"Didn't the owner, Cyrus Bradley, say it would be a wedding gift for his daughter? Why would he part with it?"



"Money speaks volumes, and everything comes with a price tag," Lucian Chavez, the CEO of a major hardware firm,remarked with a smirk, illustrating with a hand gesture. "I've heard the offer was so staggering that Cyrus couldn't refuse. The property was in someone else's hands the very next day."



A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.



"| can't believe this!"

A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.



"| can't believe this!"
As he strode towards the door to take the call, it burst open unexpectedly.
A cold breeze swept past him, and the first thing he noticed was a dark, imposing figure entering the room.Looking up, Alexander realized the man was very tall.


Chairs clattered against the floor as others stood hastily, their voices a mixture of awe and excitement."Mr. Phillips! Oh, what a pleasure to have you grace us with your presence!"



Holding his phone with a firmer grip, Alexander stepped aside, yet his eyes remained momentarily fixed on the newcomer, whose chilling presence suggested a stern warning to those unacquainted.


Coming back to his senses, Alexander finally spoke into the phone. "Dad, what's going on?"


Richard's voice crackled with enthusiasm through the phone. "Did you hear? The Luxor Tower has been bought by Elite Lux's president!" His tone was low, as though he was wary of eavesdroppers.


"Have you ever heard of Elite Lux? It's the crown jewel among transnational design firms, with a valuation in the billions. Undeniably, they are the best of the best! Imagine the boundless opportunities if we could establish a connection with Elite Lux. Alexander,word has it that the president of Elite Lux will be visiting Luxor Tower tomorrow to review the renovations. I want you to bring our company's top-notch design portfolio and try to spark a partnership.
Even if it doesn't result in a collaboration, just catching the eye of Elite Lux's CEO could unlock a lot of opportunities for us in the future!"



Alexander promptly straightened his tie and inquired,"Any chance you could figure out what that CEO might like?"



Richard replied, "No, they keep a low profile. Nothing about them is publicly accessible. However, they might have a taste for exquisite liquors or high-end watches. An opulent gift should definitely leave the perfect impression."



Alexander nodded thoughtfully. "Understood."



Just as he was about to disconnect, Richard chimed in with an afterthought, "Oh, and if it fits into your schedule, take Joyce along with you. Her boutique was a fixture in the Luxury Tower, but with the recent sale, she's been forced to vacate. The building is a landmark, after all, and she's understandably reluctant to leave it behind. From what I've gathered, Caiden holds Joyce in high regard, almost as if she were his own kin. Should the Harper family's wealth indeed fall into her hands, I'd see no issue with you pursuing her.Daniela has lost her relevance. It's time to sever ties."



The words hung in the air as Alexander stood motionless, his expression blank and his gaze cast downward.
Richard's voice broke the silence. "Keep in mind, 8 a.m.sharp tomorrow-bring Joyce along. And make sure to remind her to dress appropriately. No over-the-top outfits!"



Deep down,Alexander understood that Richard's view of Joyce was far from flattering.


Her rural upbringing made her a stark contrast to those born with silver spoons in their mouths.



Once the call ended, Alexander's mind lingered on selecting a suitable and impressive gift for his secretary to handle.



By the time he arrived at the room, everyone was already clinking glasses with Cedric.



Moving closer, the man beside him spoke in a hused tone. "This guy's not one to mess with. Rumor has it,he just snagged the Skyline Tower right across from the Luxor Tower! Talk about a bold move. Looks like he's setting up to be neighbors with Elite Lux's CEO -what a powerhouse pairing!"



This revelation forced Alexander to proceed with measured steps.



He cast a quick, cautious glance at Cedric, who,sensing the attention, locked eyes with him in a cold,piercing stare.
Alexander acknowledged him with a glass raised high,toasting to the ambitious newcomer from a distance.



However,no sooner had he replaced his glass on the table than Cedric averted his eyes,ignoring Alexander for the remainder of the event.



The man beside Alexander leaned in and asked, "Have you somehow angered Mr. Phillips?"


Alexander shook his head in response, his expression unchanging.



The man continued, "You should tread carefully around him. He's not one to be trifled with-ruthless and decisive. The man possesses a remarkable shrewdness; crossing him could invite relentless retribution. Frightening thought,isn't it?"



Spurred by the comment, Alexander's eyes flicked back to Cedric, seated calmly across the table.



Within their industry, a veneer of politeness was typically upheld; outright antagonism was a rarity.



Yet,Cedric exuded an aura of authority that was hard to ignore.


Alexander's eyes lingered on Cedric, who checked his phone with practiced ease before standing with quiet authority.
Passing by Alexander, Cedric spoke quietly into the phone. "What time should I pick you up?"


His voice was casual, yet it carried a subtle undertone of affection.



Alexander's sharp curiosity was instantly stirred.


Who was this person that even the stoic man would make personal arrangements to fetch?


Moreover, the voice responding on the other end of the call struck a chord of recognition in him.


It was a voice he was certain he had heard before.
###Chapter 11 The Mysterious CEO Of Elite Lux
Alexander went to the luxury goods boutique to select a gift for the CEO of Elite Lux.


Joyce walked alongside him, her chatter bubbling with energy.



"See, Alexander? Bringing me along was the best decision you made. I asked my friend and was told the CEO of Elite Lux is a handsome man and a golf aficionado. It seems all these high-flying CEOs have a penchant for the game these days. Imagine gifting him a golf club-he'd be over the moon."


Alexander cast a skeptical glance her way, his brow furrowing slightly. "Are you certain about this?"


Joyce nodded emphatically, her eyes sparkling with certainty. "Absolutely! My friend is incredibly well-connected. This is advice you can count on."


Yet,Alexander's silence lingered, clouded by disbelief.


The CEO of Elite Lux was discreet, and tangible details about their personal likes were scarce. Alexander found himself questioning the credibility of Joyce's so -called "well-connected" source, especially given  that the last time he had acted on such advice, it had led to an embarrassing fiasco.



"Come on." Joyce looped her arm through his and tugged him towards a nearby golf store. "Trust me on this, Alexander. This enigmatic CEO is definitely into golf. My friend is tight with him, and he even promised to make introductions later. Let's just pick out a club."



Alexander's uncertainty lingered as he followed Joyce into the shop, his confidence buoyed by her evident assurance.



"What do you think of this one?" Joyce paused before a golf club, beckoning himn closer.


Peering at the price tag, Alexander saw the figure: eight thousand dollars. The amount struck him as too modest.


For the CEO of Elite Lux, such a modestly pricedgift might not even merit a second glance.


Yet Joyce, radiating satisfaction, countered his concerns. "Do you realize how tough it is to earn a buck these days? Besides, my friend is setting up this meeting. We don't need to splurge on a gift. The CEO of Elite Lux already has more than enough. It's our sincerity that will resonate with him, not the price tag."


Her words did little to assuage Alexander's discomfort.
The cost of the gift wasn't mnerely about the money -it was a testament to their regard for the recipient.


Despite his reservations, Joyce's optimism was infectious. "This is it. It's absolutely perfect!"


Her smile broadened, touched by a spark of anticipation. Recent events had cast a shadow over both their families, and Joyce was intent on mending fences and gaining Alexander's esteem. "Trust me on this, Alexander. My friend won't let you down. Once we meet, all you need to do is focus on your proposal.It'll go smoothly, I promise!"


Alexander gazed at Joyce's self-assured expression with a hint of uncertainty. "Are you sure?"


"Absolutely!" Joyce responded with a vigorous nod,her eyes gleaming with conviction.



As Alexander handled the payment, Joyce lingered by his side, her brow furrowed in mild frustration. "Why even go through with this, Alexander? It's simply throwing money away. In today's world, it's not what you know, but who you know. Having me by your side should suffice. Why lavish money on such trivialities?Just have the staff at the golf shop package it nicely.I'm not demanding like that spoiled Daniela."



With these words, Joyce's face lit uup with a smug triumph, her demeanor dripping with disdain. She radiated an air of superiority, as if she stood leagues above Daniela.



Joyce believed this demonstration of frugality would convince Alexander of her worthiness as a partner,perhaps even leading him to propose.



Alexander,meanwhile,brought the golf club home.


A look of stunned incredulity washed over Richard's face the instant he noticed the price tag.


He spun around, his gaze piercing Alexander as he pointed at the golf club. "You're not seriously thinking of gifting this to the CEO of Elite Lux, are you?"


Alexander tried to clarify his intentions, but Richard burst into scornful laughter.



"That cheap,penny-pinching mindset runs so deep in Joyce, it's pathetic. She's leagues behind Daniela.Remember the last golf club Daniela presented? It was leagues beyond this! And now you plan to offer this worthless stick to the CEO of Elite Lux?Alexander, you're not seriously trying to embarrass yourself,are you?"



Even Alexander had to admit the gift, Joyce's recommendation, came off as slightly unimpressive.



Just as he was about to instruct his secretary to exchange it for a superior golf club, his phone rang with an urgent update. "I've just heard from reliable sources-the CEO of Elite Lux's plane touched down ahead of schedule!They'll be at the Luxor Tower within the hour!"



Exhaling deeply,Richard strolled into the storage room and emerged with a gift box, elegantly wrapped.


"Take this instead-the golf club Daniela gave me before. It'll make a better gift for the CEO of Elite Lux."



Curiosity piqued, Alexander examined the club's intricate patterns and the label on the box. "Is this a custom design?"


Earlier that morning, a shop assistant had mentioned,"Anything custom-designed starts at a minimum of two million." Alexander was aware that Daniela frequently bestowed gifts upon Richard, yet the lavishness of this gesture was unexpected.


"Two million?" Richard gestured towards the inscriptions on the club. "This piece is the creation of a globally acclaimed golf club artisan. It's a singular masterpiece-not even four million could buy one."


Alexander clutched the golf club tighter, his eyes widening in disbelief.



Daniela...


When did she acquire such wealth? As far as he knew, ever since the death of her mother and with Katrina at the helm of the Harper famnily's finances, Daniela had been cut off from any family allowance. How, then, did she manage to fund such an extravagant gift?
###Chapter 12 Daniela And The CEO Of Elite Lux
As they approached their meeting with the CEO of Elite Lux, Joyce was bursting with excitement, eagerly sharing every bit of insider information she had gathered.


"The CEO of Elite Lux is a prodigy! By his teens, he was spearheading a team of young virtuosos, making a splash on the global stage. Against all odds, he turned a simple sketch into a sensational overnight success. He didn't just stop there. After banking his initial millions, he rapidly scaled up his operations. Now,he stands as the wealthiest individual globally.Despite his wealth, he's known for being down-to-earth and extraordinarily sharp."


Joyce's face was alight with admiration, her gaze locked onto an approaching stretch Lincoln, its rarity underscored by its sleek lines.


She nudged Alexander enthusiastically, barely containing her glee. "Look, Alexander! There's the car!It must be him-the CEO of Elite Lux!"


Minutes later, the car glided to a halt in front of Luxor Tower. As Lillian emerged first, the anticipation hung  heavy.



Then, the rear door opened slowly.



Joyce's eyes widened in suspense, her breath caught in her throat, ready to finally lay eyes on the fabled,dashing CEO of Elite Lux.


In the blink of an eye, her thrill morphed into sheer astonishment. Her mouth hung open, agape, as seconds stretched into what seemed like an eternity.



"Daniela!" Joyce's voice pierced the silence, high-pitched and incredulous. "What the hell are you doing here? And in the CEO of Elite Lux's car,no less?"



Her eyes narrowed as she scrutinized Daniela's impeccable appearance, her mind racing to piece together the scene before her. In a scornful tone dripping with malice, she hissed, "After leaving the Harper family and being dumped by Alexander, you seduced the CEO of Elite Lux, did you?"


Joyce's gaze burned with loathing and scorn as she stared at Daniela. "Have you no shred of dignity left?"


Catching sight of Joyce was the last thing Daniela expected upon her return. What back luck!


Blinded by jealousy, Joyce dashed towards the vehicle,peering inside with eager, searching eyes. Where was the CEO of Elite Lux? She would unveil Daniela's true  nature to the CEO. 


Daniela's divorce was still recent, but somehow she'd already landed herself a sugar daddy. The notion was unacceptable to Joyce. She couldn't stand idly by and watch this unfold.


Frantically, Joyce scoured the vehicle, but it was utterly empty-no one was there.


Daniela observed Joyce's wild gestures with evident disdain.


"Daniela!" Joyce jabbed a finger in Daniela, her voice sharp and accusing. "Where's the CEO of Elite Lux?Where did you hide him?"


Daniela summoned the security. "There's a delusional woman here causing a scene. Could you kindly take care of this?"



At this moment, the building manager hurried over with a broad smile. "Hello, Ms. Harper. Mr. Phillips had planned to greet you himself today, but he's been delayed due to his car breaking down. He should be here shortly. He's instructed us to extend every courtesy to you. The renovations on the upper floors,tailored to your specifications, are well underway.Furthermore, in response to your request, we've initiated the renaming of the Luxor Tower. The new signage is on the way and will be installed by this evening." 



Daniela acknowledged with a nod of appreciation.



Leading the way, the manager ushered Daniela through the grand entrance of the building.



He paused briefly, turning to address the security team."Stay vigilant at the doors. We are not to admit anyone without proper clearance. Remember, Ms.Harper is not only our esteemed guest but the new proprietor of this establishment. Should she express any dissatisfaction, prepare to vacate your positions immediately."



The security guards responded with quick, solemn nods, underscoring the gravity of the manager's directives.



Daniela and the manager continued into the heart of the building.



Outside, Alexander and Joyce remained momentarily paralyzed by the unfolding events.



It took Joyce several moments to find her voice as the newly minted sign arrived.


With "Harper" prominently displayed, replacing the old name on the iconic Olisvine landmark, her astonishment was palpable. Turning to Alexander, Joyce exclaimed, "Alexander,did you catch that? Daniela has not only secured ties with the CEO of Elite Lux but has convinced him to rename an entire building in her honor! It seems she has thoroughly enchanted the CEO!"
###Chapter 13 Live Stream



Alexander's expression clouded over.


Since she got out of the car, Daniela hadn't glanced at him even once.



Just a few months earlier, she had loved him deeply.But now, having become involved with the CEO of Elite Lux, she regarded him as if he were a mere stranger.	3



Joyce, observing Alexander's growing discontent,adjusted a loose lock of her hair and remarked,"Alexander, didn't I warn you? Women like Daniela-gorgeous and manipulative-always know how to use their beauty. You doubted me before, but now you see the truth. Freshly out of her marriage, and she's wasting no time seducing the CEO of EliteLux. Utterly disgraceful." 8



Her tone acquired a biting jealousy towards the end,seemingly without her own realization.



Alexander's features turned even more somber.



Next to him, Joyce's jaw tightened in frustration."Alexander, did you catch that? Daniela completely ignored you-acted as though you were invisible!

Remember how she used to pursue you relentlessly?Now, with her newfound status, she parades around,steeped in arrogance. I'd bet she hasn't ev/en informed the CEO of Elite Lux about her divorce. The moment the CEO appears, I'll expose Daniela for the cunning,scheming liar she's always been!"


Joyce was haunted by the humiliation from the audio and surveillance footage. Now, seeing Daniela not only escape any fallout but also cozy up to someone as influential as the CEO of Elite Lux was unbearable to her.1



Joyce's fury simmered, building with each ticking second. Daniela's fortunate streak couldn't possibly last forever.



There was no way she would let this slide. This was her time to expose Daniela's deceit, rip away her mask,and revel in her downfall. Daniela's fall would be her opportunity to rise, using it as the foundation for her own ascent.


Alexander stood there, his face a mask of neutrality,eyes locked on a faraway point.


After waiting for an hour, Joyce could no longer bear the cold silence. She shuddered, wrapping her arms around herself and huffing warm breath into her hands for warmth. She turned to Alexander with a shiver, her voice tinged with impatience. "Alexander, do you think the CEO of Elite Lux will show up? Renovating a building is no small affair. Surely he wouldn't entrust such a task to Daniela. What does she even know about it?"



While speaking, Joyce took out her phone from her coat pocket and dialed a number.


The call connected almost immediately, and her friend's voice came through, laced with surprise and disbelief. "What the heck are you talking about?You've got to be kidding me. My friend in security just confirmed the CEO of Elite Lux is in the building.Why are you still waiting out there?"



Joyce caught Alexander's hand and hurried him inside.



They were halted by a vigilant security guard, but she quickly adapted, finding a hidden path through a cramped corridor used for discarding kitchen waste from the cafeteria.	1



The pungent aroma of her perfume mingled with the acrid smell of rotting garbage, creating a nauseating mix that was almost overwhelming.



With clenched fists and gritted teeth, she muttered bitterly to Alexander, "Get through the worst, and you'll outshine them all!"



She was fiercely committed to unmasking Daniela's sly manipulations before the CEO of Elite Lux. The sting of humiliation still burned brightly in her memory-the ridicule she had faced when the audio and surveillance footage were made public.



But today, she was set to turn the tables.



Daniela had sold her dignity to become Elite Lux's CEO's mistress! Joyce was ready to broadcast this scandal to all of Olisvine, cementing her place as the true heiress of the Harper family.


Driven by her vengeful plan, Joyce logged into her livestream account.



As the elevator glided upwards to the top floor,she activated the live feed. Turning to the camera, she flashed a disarmingly sweet smile.


"Hello, everyone! This is Joyce speaking. Today,something unbelievable happened-I got a call to meet up with my sister, who has been out of touch for three months. Throughout these months, the ache of missing her was unbearable for my parents and me.Despite the silence from her end,our affection for her only intensified. Now, hearing that she's back in the country, I'm bursting with curiosity to find out what she's been up to. Join me on this journey as we catch up with my beloved sister!" 

Joyce expertly angled her phone to capture the intensity of her emotions.
In a clever twist, Joyce discreetly texted Katrina,nudging her to ensure Caiden ended up watching the livestream by accident.



With a practiced, sweet grin plastered on her face,Joyce exited the elevator.



Daniela was by the window, her eyes locked on the sprawling urban landscape below.


As Joyce confidently approached, phone aloft and recording, Daniela remained her focus.



Nearby,Lillian stepped forward, intent on intervening.


However,Daniela reached out, placing a reassuring hand on Lillian's arm to stop her.



Lillian glanced over at Daniela, who told her, "Now that she's here, let's not waste the opportunity. We might as well harness her little spectacle to drum up some free publicity for my comeback and Elite Lux."



With a chuckle, Lillian nodded, giving Daniela a silent thumbs-up in agreement.


Joyce burst in, unaware of the undercurrents swirling in the room.



Her camera was already rolling as she captured the grandeur of the opulent office, her voice bubbling with excitement. "Wow, look at this, everyone! Can you believe my sister? Only three months out on her own, completely cut off financially by our family, and she's already made it into one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. And here she is, being personally hosted by the manager! Isn't my sister just remarkable?"



Her tone, though seemingly admiring, was heavy with sarcasm and insinuations, suggesting that Daniela might have ascended the social ladder through less-than-reputable means.


Continuing her broadcast, Joyce turned her critical gaze on the manager and quipped sharply, "You should watch out. Some people just can't help but lie.I'd bet Daniela doesn't even have a hundred bucks in her pocket right now."



The manager took a step forward,intending to clarify the situation, but a glance from Daniela stopped him



Daniela's signal was clear to the manager-let the idiot put on their pathetic little show.
###Chapter 14 A Joke!



Joyce spotted Daniela stopping the manager,which affirmed her suspicions. A self-satisfied grin crept across her face.



With a raised eyebrow, she taunted, "I got it right,didn'tl?" 3



Clad in her flowing, elegant gown, Daniela returned a serene smile. "Indeed, I don't have a hundred bucks on me right now."



At Daniela's admission,Joyce could barely contain her glee. Her eyes sparkled with a victorious gleam.Daniela was on the brink of public embarrassment.



"Listen up, everyone! She just confessed. She doesn't even have a hundred bucks, but here she is,putting on a show like she's a millionaire. So, Daniela, are you actually the Elite Lux's CEO's mistress, or is this just another one of your pathetic lies? Did you deceive the manager to gain entry to this esteemed establishment?I once thought you were merely superficial and materialistic, but now it's clear you're a complete charlatan. Are you aware that such deceit could land you behind bars?"



Joyce was thoroughly convinced of Daniela's duplicity Yet,Daniela observed with a calm demeanor as Joyce embarrassed herself.



Meanwhile, Joyce's theatrical tirade was already causing a stir online.


Caiden was the first to comment, his words laden with indignation.


"Daniela! Will you stop at nothing to tarnish the Harper name? Joyce, inform Daniela that I have cut all ties with her. From this moment forward, her actions and her words are her own. She is no longer my daughter."



Following his outburst, the internet buzzed with reactions from the public.



"Oh my, is her father really casting her aside so publicly?"



"What did Joyce just announce? Daniela is linked with the CEO of Elite Lux? Are we talking about the same Elite Lux? The one that's a titan in the international design industry?"



"It must be! Didn't you catch the location in the background? That's the iconic tower in Olisvine! Who else but the CEO of Elite Lux could be involved with such a landmark?"
"Daniela certainly moves in impressive circles if she's acquainted with someone like the CEO of Elite Lux!"



"Daniela looks breathtaking today. Did anyone else see her ensemble? It's thenewest limited edition from Elite Lux. Absolutely stunning, though the price tag is astronomical."



"Indeed, does anyone know how much it costs? I'm tempted myself!"



"I do! The whole outfit runs over a million-not even counting the heels Daniela was sporting. But, let's be honest, the exquisite craftsmanship and design of Elite Lux are worth every penny."



"They're entering the domestic market soon. With some luck, the prices will become far more accessible.I'm thrilled at the thought of finally wearing a luxury label myself!"



The conversation shifted away from Joyce's allegations, centering instead on Daniela's stunning beauty and grace.	



Fuming with vexation as her conspiracy crumbled,Joyce barked at the camera, "Listen-don't be swayed by such twisted values! Daniela's just a climber,hanging on the coattails of the influential! She's even been forsaken by her own father!"
Daniela, however, remained beside the expansive window, her demeanor composed. A beam of sunlight sliced through the gloom, spotlighting her and casting an ethereal glow.



A torrent of eager, heartfelt comments overflowed across the screen.



"Wow! She looks simply divine!"



Joyce's gaze landed on Daniela, and for a moment,she was transfixed by her luminous presence.



Regaining her composure, she marched up and spat out accusatorily, "Daniela! What filthy schemes did you pull to sink your claws into the CEO of Elite Lux?You're just a gutter rat dressed in stolen silk!" 2


Daniela's laughter was light but resonant. Gazing into Joyce's twisted, angry face, she replied with a calm,mocking smile, "Why not gaze into a mirror and see who truly resembles an ugly gutter rat?"



She accentuated "ugly" in a biting tone, her words slicing through the tension.



Joyce's face flushed a fiery red.



From the moment Katrina introduced her into the Harper family, endless comparisons to Daniela shadowed her every move. Over and over, they deemed her no match for Daniela's charm.


It was intolerable for her.


Yet the stark truth was unavoidable. Her protests only underscored her desperation.



Her appearance, a tender sore spot that haunted her endlessly, became Daniela's cruel weapon, viciously twisted to publicly disgrace her and deepen the wounds she already carried.



Engulfed by fury,Joyce was on the brink of exploding.



Right when she was about to retaliate, the elevator doors parted with a whoosh.



Spotting someone through the opening, Joyce turned to Alexander, her voice filled with anticipation "Alexander, look! There's Joshua Dennis-the one I've been talking about. He's connected to the CEO of Elite Lux. He's about to uncover Daniela as the imposter she truly is."



Joyce then confidently pointed her livestream camera towards Joshua, waving at him with a radiant smile."Joshua..."



However, Joshua blatantly ignored her and walked straight to Daniela.


Flashing a polite smile, he gave a slight bow."Ms. Harper, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Joshua Dennis from Dennis Electronics. We met briefly at an international gala. It's a genuine pleasure to see you again. My father intended to be here, but unfortunately, his car broke down. I've taken the liberty of arranging a dinner. I'd be honored if you joined us."



Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her face etched with disbelief. She gazed at Joshua-typically so haughty and domineering, yet now, he stood before them,subdued and hardly able to meet Daniela's gaze.


Her incredulity quickly morphed into a sharp, derisive laugh. Clutching Joshua's arm, she gestured wildly towards Daniela. "Are you freaking insane, Joshua?Did I hear you right? You're telling me that Daniela-of all people-is the CEO of Elite Lux?"



Spinning towards her livestream camera, Joyce couldn't contain her amusement, and her laughter boomed,echoing in the air.


Tugging at Alexander's sleeve, she amplified her tone for dramatic effect. "Alexander, did you hear that?He's claiming Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux! Can you believe that? It's the grandest joke l've heard in years!"
###Chapter 15 Identity
Revealed



Joyce burst into uncontrollable laughter, her body shaking as she nearly folded over from the sheer hilarity.



Alexander extended a hand to steady her.



Joyce faced the camera and exclaimed, "Guys, if Daniela's really the CEO of Elite Lux, I'll eat a fresh pile of crap for dessert."



Joshua stood to the side, his jaw dropping.


Inviting Joyce had been his call, but now unease crept in, the thought of upsetting Daniela making his heart race.



With a storm in his stride, Joshua marched up to Joyce and delivered a stinging slap across her face. "Have you lost your fucking mind?" s



The laughter vanished from Joyce's face,replaced by a stunned silence. She touched her swelling cheek,staring at Joshua in utter disbelief. "Why did you hit me?"



With a fiery glare and a low growl, Joshua spat, "What the hell is wrong with you? She's the freaking CEO of Elite Lux, and you're sitting here spouting nonsense about eating crap? Where is your sense of decorum?I told you to bring a gift, not insults. Where is the gift?"


His gaze flickered towards the two boxes Alexander clutched in his hands.



Joyce pointed to the less expensive of the two,priced at eight thousand dollars. "That one."


Without hesitation, Joshua yanked the box, gripped Joyce's arm, and went straight for Daniela.



With a strained smile plastered on his face, he began,"Ms. Harper, please accept my apologies for the disruption. This is my friend, Joyce Holt. We crossed paths overseas a few years back." He tapped his temple lightly, his expression awkward as he went on,"She's a bit out of sorts today. Nevertheless,she's one of your ardent admirers and even brought a present for you."



As he lifted the lid of the box, an eight-thousand-dollar golf club was revealed.



With one glance at the contents, Joshua's expression grew grim. He shot a quick, piercing look at Joyce,then at Alexander.



Daniela, on the other hand, let out a chuckle as she picked up the golf club. "An admirer, you say? This club..."



She glanced at the price tag, a wy smile creeping across her features. "Eight thousand dollars..."



Red-faced and clearly flustered, Joshua shoved the golf club into the box. "I'm so terribly sorry, MMs.Harper. These two, well, their judgment can be a bit off at times!" ①



He then spun around to confront Joyce, his voice thick with frustration.2



"Joyce! Are you seriously this clueless? This is Ms.Harper, the CEO of Elite Lux! Her empire includes golf courses that stretch over thousands of acres, and here you are offering her a golf club worth a mere 8,000dollars. Are you out of your damn mind? This is simply outrageous!"



In a fluster, Joshua scrambled for the other box.


Upon opening it, his features relaxed, a look of relief washing over him. Now, this was a gift befitting the occasion.


With both hands, he presented the box to Daniela.


Daniela, who had so far seemed unimpressed, now raised an eyebrow, her eyes glinting with a touch of irony as she inspected the box. She reached into the box and drew out a stunning,custom-tailored golf club, its flawless finish radiating sophistication. Joshua added, "Ms. Harper, please consider the first one just a small extra token. This right here is the true gift meant for you."


As a golf enthusiast, Joshua immediately recognized its value-it was worth at least ten million dollars.


A smile tugged subtly at the corners of Daniela's mouth as she studied the club. "Is this golf club really for me?"



The second she saw the club, recognition washed over her-it was the very gift she had bestowed upon Richard.



Alexander's face clouded over. He remained silent,choosing not to answer Daniela's query.
To him, a golf club was merely a piece of sports equipment. Surely,Daniela couldn't actually recognize this specific one,could she?



Daniela pointed at the grip of the club, where the surname "Bennett" was elegantly engraved. "I didn't know the Bennett family was involved in making golf clubs."
Upon hearing that, Joshua suddenly stiffened, his smile faltering completely. He peered down at the golf club, and a crimson flush spread across his face.Seriously, even the dumbest person alive would know this club was custom-made.


"Re-gifting, huh?" Daniela pressed, her voice even but laced with unmistakable sarcasm. "Mr. Bennett,you certainly have a talent for business."



Joshua was taken aback. Having just returned from overseas, he was utterly baffled by Daniela's insinuation.



At that moment, Lillian stepped in, her fingers wrapping around the club's handle. "If Mr. Bennett is going to treat our boss's generosity like trash, then we're more than entitled to take it back." She brought the golf club back.



The atmosphere turned excruciatingly tense, the silence bearing down like a merciless weight,suffocating any chance of recovery.



The only disruption was Joyce, muttering incredulously to herself, "What the hell? How on earth could this even be possible?" 



She couldn't accept the revelation that Daniela, of all people,was the CEO of Elite Lux.
Daniela was disowned and discarded by her own father,Caiden. How on earth had she ascended to such heights?



Joyce's mind reeled from the shock. With a brittle chuckle, she turned to Joshua, desperation coloring her tone. "Joshua, come on, cut the act. How much did Daniela pay you to concoct this elaborate prank?It's not amusing in the slightest."


Joshua's cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson,his discomfort palpable.


Alexander's gaze was dark and inscrutable.


Meanwhile, on the internet, the announcement about Elite Lux set off a frenzy, with everyone buzzing in excitement and speculation.


"Everyone, look at this! Elite Lux just dropped a bombshell on their official site!"


"Elite Lux is branching out! They're penetrating the domestic scene, spearheaded by none other than their CEO, Daniela Harper. She's leading the charge into Olisvine. The company is all praises and is rooting for her success!"



A chilling quiet enveloped the room, the air so heavy it seemed to stifle even the faintest sound. Every gaze was fixed on Elite Lux's official announcement, expressions ranging from shock to disbelief-everyone except Joyce, who seemed oddly unaffected.



"Ha! Daniela, look at you,all high and mighty! You even went so far as to hack Elite Lux's official site to spread your fake news. Just wait till they catch on and hit you with a lawsuit!"①


Joyce's laughter rang out, bordering on maniacal.


As her laughter echoed, she caught the sober stare of everyone around her.
###Chapter 16 Daniela's Triumphant Return
The echo of Joyce's laughter was gone,replaced by stillness.



She approached Alexander, pulling on his sleeve."Alexander,surely you don't believe this nonsense, do you? This is Daniela we're discussing-the same woman who has adored you for over a decade! How can she suddenly be the CEO of Elite Lux? Does she even possess the resources or the capacity to achieve something like this? Take a good look! We're standing in the iconic building of Olisvine-a genuine landmark!How could Daniela, of all people, manage to own such a place? Alexander, it's impossible that she's the CEO of Elite Lux. Don't be deceived by her!" Daniela had spent more than twenty years playing the flawless role of the Harper family's heiress.



For the samne duration, Joyce had existed under her shadow.



Daniela was renowned for her beauty, grace, and intellect-attributes that allowed her to shine in whatever she pursued.


But now? She was supposed to have tumbled from grace, shamed by the Bennett family. Yet here she stood, bathed in the illustrious aura of Elite Lux.



How could Joyce ever come to terms with this?


Alexander faced Daniela. Unlike Joyce, he maintained his composure.



Although the revelation had stirred him, he couldn't ignore the undeniable reality before him.


Had reality been different, Daniela wouldn't have been able to set foot inside this establishment,let alone receive a cordial welcome from Joshua and the building manager.



A subtle smile graced Daniela's lipsas she stood there,and Alexander found the expression rather disconcerting.



He gazed at her, his voice tinged with confusion and a hint of accusation. "If you're really the CEO of Elite Lux, why keep that a secret until now? Did you find amusement in this charade?"



Was her pretense of vulnerability merely a ploy to garner his compassion?



Such a sly schemer she was.	~ As these thoughts swirled in his mind, an old memory bubbled up to the surface. Richard had mentioned that the CEO of Elite Lux had first become a prominent figure while still a teenager.


Following the release of her lauded final work,"Unrequited Love," she had abruptly receded from the limelight. The whispers at the time had been tantalizing; many believed this young visionary had been struck by a real-life romance, choosing love over her career.



And now, if Daniela indeed was that CEO, had she relinquished her role at Elite Lux for the sake of a heartfelt affection? And more intriguingly, who was the person that swayed her heart?



Standing apart, Alexander observed Daniela with a bewildering sense of estrangement cloaking him. For the first time, it dawned on him that perhaps he had never truly known her.1



Unruffled by Alexander's intense scrutiny, Daniela offered a slight, enigmatic smile and responded, "It appears you've forgotten. You've always been too engrossed in your own affairs to allow me a moment to clarify, haven't you?"


Initially, Daniela had intended to unveil all her secrets to Alexander before their impending nuptials.



However,Alexander had told her that he had no interest in her and all he wanted was for her to behave herself after their marriage.


In simpler terms, he held no real expectations of her.


To the public, Alexander's father had even stated that the union was simply a long-standing commitment made between the two families years earlier.



Yet, beneath this facade lay a more strategic calculation. The Bennett family had consented to the marriage solely due to the considerable influence wielded by the Harper family.


Daniela,being Caiden's only biological daughter, stood to inherit a substantial portion of the Harper family's fortune, despite Caiden having remarried and having a stepdaughter. Given these prospects, the Bennett family welcomed her into their family.


Upon discovering the true motives behind their acceptance, Daniela's eagerness to disclose her true self dwindled.



Alexander's expression darkened dramatically, his jaw tightening as his eyes became turbulent with frustration. Underneath lay a palpable fury,fueled by the bitter realization that he had been deceived.



With a steely glare at Joyce, he declared in a frosty tone, "We're leaving."



Remaining would only tarnish the honor of their  families further.


Just as they neared the exit, Lillian's commanding voice stopped them in their tracks. "Hold on a moment!"



Reluctantly, Alexander paused, his body tensed as Lillian strode forward, a golf club in hand. "Here,take your $8,000 golf club. I doubt even our caddies would bother with such an inferior piece."



Her mocking words cut deep, visibly embarrassing Joshua,who turned a deep shade of red.


He hurriedly pressed the elevator button and ushered Alexander and Joyce out.


With that, Daniela made her triumphant return to Olisvine.



As the CEO of Elite Lux, she now presided majestically over Olisvine's most famous landmark.



Recovering from her astonishment, Joyce was already weaving new plots. She leaned towards Caiden, her voice oozing sugary charm. "Dad, Daniela's now the CEO of Elite Lux and she owns Olisvine's top landmark building. Do you think you could convince her to spare one floor for me?"
###Chapter 17 Shameless



Caiden paused, uncertainty clouding his expression.


It wasn't fear of Daniela's defiance-she wouldn't dare cross him. 



Rather,his reluctance stemmed from a recent public declaration he had made, cutting all ties with her. To seek her out now, after such a proclamation, would surely raise eyebrows.



What would everyone say about this?


Surely, they would label him as a conceited, self-centered man, desperate to maintain his grip on wealth and status.



His pristine reputation meant everything to him; the very idea of becoming fodder for idle gossip was utterly unbearable.



Throughout his life, Caiden had lingered in the shadow of Daniela's influential mother. Now, having finally liberated himself and taken command of his destiny,he was determined to steer clear of any further familial entanglements.



Nearby, Katrina observed his indecision with a keen  eye, understanding that Caiden had no desire to comply with Joyce's demand.



The room fell silent for a long beat before Katrina's eyes brimmed with tears.


"This mess is entirely on me. When you took me as your wife, it was right after Daniela's mother had passed. All these years, Daniela has harbored resentment towards me, and rightfully so. I can't blame her-it's my fault for falling so deeply in love with you. I am to blame for everything. Joyce had no part in this, but Daniela's hatred for me has dragged her into the crossfire. Now, her business has been damaged. It's all my fault-every single problem stems from me. I'll face Daniela and apologize. If she won't accept it, I'll kneel and beg for her forgiveness.Sisters shouldn't be divided because of their parents 'sins." 3



Her face was streaked with tears as she rose to her feet.



Caiden grasped her hand, his own heart twisting at the sight of her distress. "Why apologize for the past? As her father, do I really need Daniela's approval to choose who I spend my life with?"



Caiden locked eyes with Joyce. "Joyce, you've always been the sensible one. Your sister's the one stirring up all the drama. Don't worry, I'll have a word with Daniela. Just give me a little time. Now, remind me,which floor were you considering for your new office?"



With a delighted grin, Joyce clapped her hands together. "Dad, I consulted a fortune-teller who recommended the 18th floor. It offers an incredible view and it's said to be lucky."



It was common knowledge in Olisvine that the 18th floor of the landmark building was the prime spot.


Yet Katrina's ambitions for Joyce stretched further.Snuggling closer to Caiden, she coaxed,"Joyce is no longer a little girl. She truly deserves her own space.I considered a villa for her, yet with Daniela yet to acquire one, it seems only fair that Joyce waits her turn.However, now that Daniela owns an entire building, why don't we gift Joyce the 18th,19th,and 20th floors? It would give her a suitable home of her own. Surely, we don't want rumors floating around that she is still nesting at home in her twenties,right?"


Joyce's eyes lit up with excitement, her jaw dropping slightly as Katrina's bold proposal sank in.



The Luxor Tower stood as Olisvine's pinnacle of luxury,with each floor valued immensely.



The floors from the 18th to the 20th were especially prized, each valued at over a hundred million dollars Acquiring these would not just mnean a lavish residence;it would be akin to receiving a windfall of three hundred million dollars.



Such wealth could catapult her into the upper echelons of society.


Quietly applauding her mother's strategy with a discreet thumbs-up, Joyce then turned to Caiden,her voice oozing with honeyed charm.


"Dad, considering Daniela's immense wealth,parting with just three floors should hardly dent her resources,right? Plus, I am your daughter as well. If I ascend socially, wouldn't that reflect gloriously on the Harper family?"


With a subtle tilt of her head, Katrina moved closer,her words soft yet deliberate. "Caiden, the girls are all grown up now. It's not sensible to keep them cooped up at home. Plus, Daniela is flush with cash and could really benefit from having a sharp sister like Joyce by her side. It's beneficial for both of them. Moreover,isn't it within your power to make such decisions for your daughter?"



These words startled Caiden into action. He stood abruptly, his voice filled with incredulity. "As her father, am I not entitled to the ultimate decision?Would Daniela actually challenge my authority? She wouldn't dare oppose me. Just wait-I'm calling her this very moment." He glanced towards Joyce, seeking confirmation."18th, 19th, and 20th floors, correct?"  Joyce's eyes gleamed with anticipation, and she nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, Dad! Just those floors!"


The sheer intensity of her excitement was impossible to miss.



The moment Caiden stepped away to make the call,Joyce wrapped Katrina in a heartfelt hug,her face lit up with an exuberant smnile. "Mom! We're about to be filthy rich. Three entire floors are going to be mine.I never in my life thought this could happen. And the moment I move in, I'll make Daniela's life a living hell every single day."



Katrina, with her arms folded and exuding authority,observed Caiden's silhouette in the garden. "Don't worry, my dear. I have everything in hand. You're the crown jewel of the Harper family.Whatever you desire,I'll ensure Caiden provides it for you."
Joyce, overflowing with happiness and pride,embraced Katrina firmly. "Thank you, Mom!"
###Chapter 18 Caiden's Confidence
As Katrina and Joyce reveled in their laughter in the living room, the door burst open abruptly.


Caiden marched in, his cheeks tinged with the redness of anger.


Upon seeing him, Katrina rose quickly from her seat."Did Daniela agree?"


Caiden threw up his hands in exasperation, his words cutting through the air. "That ungrateful girl blocked my number!"



He extended a demanding hand towards Katrina."Hand me your phone!"


Without hesitation, Katrina passed her phone to him.Caiden hastily dialed Daniela's number, only to realize Katrina's number had been blocked too.


Caiden fumed, his frustration mounting. He grabbed Joyce's phone and attempted the call once more,only to face the same result.


Joyce,aware that all their numbers had been blocked,kept up her facade of innocence. She approached Caiden and spoke in a soothing tone."Dad, calm down. This must be a misunderstanding Daniela might have blocked us, but she'd never block you. You're her father-she wouldn't be so cruel."


Caiden responded with a derisive sneer. He understood Daniela's nature all too well. That ungrateful girl,much like her mother, showed little regard for family ties.


Without hesitation, Caiden snatched a phone from a servant and redialed Daniela's number. This time, the call connected instantly.


His features twisted into a scowl, his simmering rage rolling off him like an ominous storm.


"This is Ms. Harper's office. She's currently in a meeting and can't come to the phone. May I know who I'm speaking with?" a poised and professional voice responded.


Caiden roared, "I'm Daniela's father! You tell her to give me an explanation! Blocking me, her mom, and her sister? Why would she do something like that? Is this what money does to people? Does she think she can just erase her family from her life? What, am I invisible to her now? Would she even come if I were on my last breath? What kind of father ends up with a daughter this ungrateful?" 
On the other side of the line, Lillian was not about to let anyone cast aspersions on Daniela, not even her own father. "If I'm not mistaken, you declared publicly just five days ago that you were disowning Ms. Harper.Following your own words, you are no longer recognized as her father. Why, then, do you expect her to answer your calls now?"


Caiden's complexion deepened to a furious shade of crimson, and he nearly spluttered with indignation."What the hell did you just say? Aren't I her biological father? I'm the one who brought her into this world.Without my care and the sacrifices I made, she wouldn't have made it this far. Even if we've severed ties, shouldn't she be the one to mend them? All she's ever been to me is a bitter disappointment!"



Lillian was left utterly speechless.How could someone like this even dare to call himself a father? He was always playing the martyr, hiding behind a mask of fake righteousness.


"Ms. Harper is unavailable at the moment as she's in a meeting.Would you like me to relay a message for you?" Lillian answered smoothly, her voice calm and professional, embodying poise under pressure.


After all, he was Daniela's father, and showing basic courtesy was the least she could do.


Caiden's voice turned icy, slicing through the air with increased sharpness. "You make sure Daniela calls me back within the hour. And she owns Luxor Tower,correct? I want the 18th to 20th floors."



Lillian blinked, taken aback. "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"



"Don't act like you didn't hear me!" Caiden growled,his tone sharp and impatient. "The building's being renovated, isn't it? Ensure those three floors are included. I'll forward my own blueprints later, and you will adhere to those designs. Understood?"


Caiden ended the call abruptly, slamming the phone down with a triumphant expression, his smugness practically dripping off him.


Almost fifty minutes later, Daniela strode out of the conference room.



The moment she appeared,Lillian promptly delivered Caiden's directives.



"Your father mentioned he would send someone with the blueprints for the renovation. Also,he insists you return his call within the hour."
###Chapter 19 A Fool For Love
Daniela took her time signing the pile of documents resting on her desk.



Still focused on her paperwork, she asked casually,"Has an hour passed already?"



Lillian quickly checked her watch and replied, "Just a minute past the hour."


Daniela gave a small nod. "Perfect. No reason to call back now."



Lillian paused, momentarily startled by Daniela's easy dismissal. After a second, she asked hesitantly, "And the blueprints?"



Daniela shot her a look, and Lillian quickly nodded,catching the unspoken message. "Understood."



When the blueprints finally arrived, curiosity got the better of Lillian, and she couldn't resist peeking at them.2



Her jaw nearly hit the floor.



Unbelievable.



Seriously,how shameless could someone be? The design looked like it belonged in a royal palace -over-the-top and dripping with extravagance.



"Easy to splurge when it's not your own money, huh?"


Lillian passed the blueprints over to Daniela, who took one quick look and threw them into the trash can without a second thought.


Meanwhile, Caiden had been sitting around for over two hours,growing increasingly restless.



He kept his eyes glued to the phone,staring so hard it made them ache, but Daniela never returned his call.


His expression turned stormy and intense.



Katrina let out an exaggerated sigh from her seat on the sofa. "Well, it's obvious Daniela isn't calling back.They say once a daughter gets married, she stops being part of the family. She's clearly not close to you anymore, dear. Maybe it's time to accept it.Relationships require mutual respect, you know.Pushing it won't lead anywhere good."



Caiden remained silent, his piercing eyes locked on the phone like he could will it to ring.



Joyce's eyes welled up with tears. "Dad, Daniela's not going to give me the three floors, is she? Does she hate me that much? Is she still angry about what happened before? I already apologized. I was young and made a stupid mistake. I'd even get on my knees and beg if that's what it takes. But even after all that,she still won't forgive me?" 9


Joyce leaned against Katrina, the two clinging to each other as they sobbed dramatically.



The endless sound of their crying gnawed at Caiden's patience. With a sharp crash, he smashed his favorite cup against the floor and marched upstairs in afury.


As soon as he was out of view, Joyce stopped crying instantly. She turned to her mother and murmured in a low voice, "Mom, what's the next move?"


Katrina stopped to think for a moment before saying,"Get Alexander to talk to her. Daniela's always been the type to let her heart rule her head. She'll believe anything he says. If he steps in, she won't say no.Those three floors are worth a fortune. You have to make sure you get them."


Joyce nodded firmly, her eyes gleaming with resolve."Got it."



Meanwhile, Richard paced in the living room, chain-smoking cigarette after cigarette.



At last, the sound of a car in the driveway made him stop and turn to the front door. "Alexander, you're here." Richard crushed his cigarette into the ashtray and glanced at his son as he stepped inside.



Alexander didn't fit the mold of a traditional heartthrob, but his icy demeanor and quiet arrogance gave him a magnetic presence that was impossible to ignore.


Richard hadn't thought much of Daniela in the past.



But ever since it came to light that she was the CEO of Elite Lux, Richard had started to see her in a new light. 3



Alexander raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised to find his father still up at this hour.



Richard settled into his chair and motioned to the one across from him with a commanding gesture."Take a seat."



Alexander stayed where he was, refusing to move.


Richard didn't press the issue; he knew better than to push the boundaries of their strained relationship.



"Did you see Daniela today?" Richard asked,breaking the silence.



Alexander nodded in response. "I had someone dig into it," Richard went on. "It's confirmed-she's the CEO of Elite Lux. What's your opinion on that?"



Alexander hesitated briefly, then asked, "What exactly are you getting at?"


Richard leaned back in his chair and spoke in a calm,deliberate tone. "I know Caiden wanted you to marry Joyce, but that was before we learned who Daniela really is. Now that we know she's the CEO of Elite LuX,everything has changed. Her status isn't just higher than the Harper family's-it's higher than ours. She's barely been back in Olisvine, and already, people are lining up to court her favor. You've heard about this,haven't you? But here's where you have an edge-Daniela has always been in love with you. Blindly so.Between Joyce and Daniela, there's no competition.If you marry Daniela,our family would instantly climb to the top of Olisvine's social ladder. It'll save you years of hard work. For the family, this is the smartest move you could make."



Richard was brimming with confidence about the situation.



In his mind, Daniela's deep love for Alexander was undeniable.



He was convinced that if Alexander so much as lifted a finger,Daniela would come rushing back, more than ready to rejoin the Bennett family as his wife.


To Richard, Daniela's unwavering love for Alexander was an unshakable truth, something he believed would never fade.



Alexander, on the other hand, remained completely still, his expression unreadable and distant.



There was a time when he might have agreed with Richard's certainty.



But after seeing Daniela earlier that day, his confidence wavered. Her attitude towards him was nothing like it used to be.



She had hardly even looked at him, as though he were invisible.



Not a single word had passed between them.



Her indifference towards him was impossible to miss.



Richard caught Alexander's silence and let out a scoff."Some things never change, do they? A fool for love then, still a fool for love now. You honestly think Daniela's any different? She's just sulking because you left her for Joyce. This is nothing more than a tantrum.Now that she's running Elite Lux, all you need to do is play along with her for a bit. She'll fall back into line."


His voice carried the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.
###Chapter 20 The 18th Floor -Heaven or Hell
Richard, upon noticing Alexander's silence, resumed speaking, his voice tinged with his customary self-assuredness. "Joyce called today. She's set her sights on the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. I've given her your nod. Spin this as your chance to engage Daniela. She'll feel jealous, no doubt, so take advantage of that to reconcile. As for the Harper family, save yourself the trouble of mediating.Daniela's fortune outshines theirs by far. With her backing Bennett Group, we've no need for the Harper family's leftovers. Caiden's declaration of cutting ties with Daniela publicly was his most foolish move yet.He's become the laughingstock. If I were in his position, I would make every effort to win back her favor." 



Richard rose from his seat, laying down his strategy for Alexander with a sagely nod. "In the past, Daniela was merely one of many smitten with you, relentlessly pursuing your attention. Now, her circumstances have changed dramatically. It's imperative you take her seriously now. Yet, tread lightly; no one admires a sycophant-it's disgraceful and fruitless. Entice her-offer just enough to keep her intrigued, but withhold enough to keep her yearning. The essence of desire is to chase what remains elusive."



Richard's advice was delivered with the weight of a seasoned strategist.



Alexander remained stoic, his face an unreadable mask. 5







Joyce, buoyed by Richard's assurance, was already acting as if the three floors of the Luxor Tower were hers by right.


Long before any official announcement, she gathered her friends for a tour of what she already viewed as her future property.



The security guard, taken aback by the commanding presence of her group, hesitated only momentarily before allowing them passage.  Joyce's smugness blossomed further as she faced her circle of friends. With a triumphant air, she declared,"See? There's nothing beyond my reach!"



Alma Herrera lingered by the window, her eyes wide with admiration for the panoramic view from the 18th floor.



"Joyce, you're amazing. This is the most sought-after building in Olisvine. You requested these floors, and Daniela just gave them to you?"


Puffing up her chest, Joyce flashed a confident smirk."Naturally! I'm pampered by everyone-no one dares defy me!"



Her words ignited a wave of supportive cheers from her group, each member flashing her an enthusiastic thumbs-up.



Basking in their admiration, Joyce gestured to the nearby security guard, her voice smooth and commanding as she asked him to bring them some water. She then swept her hand grandly towards the seating area, inviting them to find themselves comfortable spots.



"But Joyce, didn't your stepfather cut all ties with Daniela? How on earth is she still bending over backwards to grant you such a prime spot? They say even piles of cash can't open doors here."



"Truly, Joyce, you outshine even the most privileged heirs of the wealthy families!"



"Does this mean the Harper family's entire fortune will be yours one day? And didn't you mention the Bennett family was the one who made this possible?So does that mean Alexander's father has a soft spot for you too?"



Joyce tilted her chin slightly, her lips curling into a self-satisfied smile.


"Oh, absolutely! Do you even know how incredible Joyce is? She's not just some heiress-she's the heiress! The epitome of class and power!" Alma gestured dramatically, her voice rising with each word as though proclaiming the arrival of royalty.


The flattery washed over Joyce like a warm wave,her ego swelling visibly as she soaked up the praise.


She leaned back slightly, a hand casually brushing her hair, preparing to deliver a smug remark to keep the admiration flowing. But then, the soft chime of the elevator arriving pierced through the chatter, silencing the group instantly.


The air grew heavy with anticipation as the doors glided open.


Daniela stepped into view, her figure draped in an exquisite, limited-edition Elite Lux autumn outfit that hugged her with flawless precision. Her heels clicked against the polished floor, each step deliberate,exuding a regal confidence that turned every head in her direction.



She was like a flower blooming in the wild-breathtakingly beautiful but undeniably distant, an untouchable force of nature.



Daniela was holding the building's design draft as she stepped out.


She halted in her tracks, her eyes widening as she took in the group of people gathered on the 18th floor.


The cheerful expression slowly drained from her face.



Turning to the security guard, who had just emerged from the elevator with a tray laden with beverages,Daniela inquired, "How did they manage to come up here?"



The group that had followed Joyce upstairs was keen to use her as a bridge to Daniela.


After all, Daniela had ascended to the position of CEO of Elite Lux and was rapidly becoming a prominent figure in the national business arena. Many were eager to forge ties with her.



Despite her unwelcoming demeanor, they huddled around Joyce, offering Daniela their most ingratiating smiles."Hello,Daniela!"



Daniela's face remained stoic; she was not one to lash out at those who approached her with a grin.



Yet,she recognized every single one of them-these were the very women who had scorned her in the past, mocking her for being overlooked by Alexander.Their derisive laughter and scornful glances were etched in her mind. Now,they acted as if they were good friends.


"What are you doing up here?" Daniela demanded,cutting straight to the chase, dispensing with any semblance of cordiality.
###Chapter 21 Shameless



Daniela's eyes narrowed, casting a frosty silence over the group that had been eagerly vying for her attention.



Nearby,even the security guard fidgeted nervously."Ms. Harper, I deeply apologize. I saw them arriving together and assumed they were associated with the design firm. So I didn't confirm their identities before allowing them in." 


A shadow of irritation passed over Daniela's face as her brow furrowed.



Given that the building was still undergoing renovations, such mix-ups were somewhat understandable. She couldn't blame the security guard.However, it did serve as a warning for her.


Without hesitation, Daniela dialed Ryan. "Install a facial recognition system throughout the building.From now on, entry is restricted exclusively to those registered in the system."


Ryan's reply was swift and affirmative. "UJnderstood!"


At that moment, realization dawned on the group standing before her. One of them leaned in, whispering to Joyce, "What's the deal here, Joyce? So your sister didn't give you these floors. How could you bring us up here like this?"



Discomfort spread among them, their voices tinged with unease.



"Joyce, let's not get wrapped up in trouble. We don't want to stir up any drama for our families. Our folks made it clear we should show utmost respect to Daniela. What were you thinking,bringing us here to cross her?" 


Joyce fixed her spineless friends with a piercing gaze,her eyes blazing with reproach.


She whirled towards Daniela, her voice slicing through the air like a knife. "Daniela, what's this about tightening the building's security? Aren't I your sister?"


Daniela returned her look with a scornful smile."You?My sister? I'd rather not. The very idea that I would call you my sister is absurd."


"What are you implying? You reject me as your sister?You reject Dad too? Just because you've come into some money, you think you can discard your own family like that?" Joyce didn't hesitate to bring up Caiden.



Daniela let out a sly smirk, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Am I even still family? If my memory serves me correctly, wasn't it you who urged them to sever all ties with me? Or is my memory failing me?"


Joyce stood her ground, undeterred. "Yes, they disowned you. That means the Harper family's wealth is none of your concern anymore. However, after Dad brought you up, it's only right that you take care of him!"


With a bitter chuckle, Daniela crossed her arms. "Sure,I'll take care of him-that's the right thing to do. But you? I don't owe you a damn thing. I don't have time for this. Grab your people and get out of my building."

 Joyce's hands clenched into fists, her eyes blazing with indignation. "Really? You refuse to even acknowledge Dad? What about Richard? He's Alexander's father! He sent me here today to inspect this place!"



Sure of her advantage, Joyce smirked inwardly.



Richard wasn't just anyone-he was Alexander's father and Daniela's former in-law.



It seemed inconceivable to Joyce that Daniela would dare to cross Richard.



Convinced of her victory, Joyce raised her head high,expecting Daniela to relent and relinquish control of the three floors.
Daniela, however,looked at her with utter disbelief."Feeling a little unhinged, are we? Perhaps it's time to get yourself checked out. Trying to use Caiden didn't work, and now you're dragging Richard into this,who,by the way, has nothing to do with me anymore.Joyce,do you even use that brain of yours, or is it just there for show?" 



Color drained from Joyce's face as she processed the rebuke. She glared at Daniela, her voice trembling with fury. "You dare defy Dad and Richard? I'll make sure they disown you for this!"  


Daniela merely shrugged, her indifference palpable."Go ahead.Tell them."



Infuriated beyond words, Joyce stamped her foot like a spoiled brat, but Daniela, ever composed,had already called the guards to escort her and her friends out.



The term "escort" was used loosely here.



The guards forcefully removed Joyce, who was gripping the doorframe with a desperate tenacity,from the premises.  



This scene unfolded under the watchful eyes of numerous passersby, some of whom promptly began to record the incident, quickly catapulting it to viral status online.
"Is that Joyce? The one who tarnished Daniela's reputation all over social media? She's bold to even step out in public after that."


"Absolutely shameless. Now she wants a piece of Daniela's success? Impressive. I didn't think it was possible to top the nonsense I've already witnessed.She destroyed Daniela and Alexander's marriage, and now she has the audacity to suck up to Daniela? The hypocrisy is astounding."  


"Typical stepfamily soap opera-no sense of limits or decorum."



"Get this. Joyce was brazen enough to demand control over the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. She had the gall to use Daniela's father to press Daniela, not just to relinquish her rights but also to cover the expenses for the renovations!"



The netizens were abuzz with reactions.



"Daniela, need a sister? I swear I won't steal your husband, sabotage your wedding, or stir up trouble.I'll just be the quiet, compliant sibling you never had.How about it?"  
###Chapter 22 Don't Wrestle With Pigs
That evening, an auction was being held at a hotel.


Lillian, ever persuasive, had managed to coax Daniela into accompanying her.



As they took their places in the front row, the event yet to commence, Daniela casually browsed through online comments, a slight smile touching her lips.


Lillian nudged her, murmuring under her breath, "Look who decided to show up-trouble herself,with her endless baggage of bullshit."



Lifting her eyes, Daniela's smile lingered just a moment as she caught sight of Alexander and Joyce making their way to the front. 

Joyce's posture tensed noticeably as she clung closer to Alexander, her voice low and strained. "Alexander,have you noticed? Daniela is still obsessed with you.The moment you walked in, she smiled at you.How utterly shameless!"



Alexander, his expression stoic and authoritative,settled into his seat, disregarding the murmurs around him. As the auction commenced, the auctioneer took his position at the center, his gaze momentarily meeting Daniela's. Acknowledging her presence, he offered a courteous nod.


Daniela, maintaining her composure, responded with a restrained smile, which did not go unnoticed.



Joyce, watching like a hawk, leaned towards Alexander, her voice dripping with disdain. "Look at her, flirting with the auctioneer now! And him,old enough to be her father. How scandalous and disgraceful!" Joyce, overwhelmed by the unyielding barrage of online critiques, lamented to Alexander, "Alexander,Daniela is inciting those netizens against me! You must intervene!"  



Alexander stayed quiet, his stoic demeanor betraying nothing.  



As the room's lights faded and the auction commenced, he turned his gaze towards Daniela.


Daniela possessed an undeniable allure, her large,expressive eyes and gently waving hair drawing attention effortlessly. Her smile turned her eyes into mesmerizing crescents, effortlessly captivating those around her. She was the kind of woman who made a lasting impact, stunning at first sight and increasingly enchanting upon further observation.



Tonight, she donned a bespoke gown from Elite Lux,quickly becoming the center of whispered awe among the socialites.



Without intending, Daniela had turned into a living showcase for Elite Lux.



As the auction unfolded, Joyce, driven by a need to assert her presence, enthusiastically lifted her bidding paddle time and again.


She was clearly in no position to fund anything herself -most of the money came from Caiden's pockets.



Daniela gazed at the stage, her expression one of detached disinterest, while Lillian seethed next to her."This is an outrage! That money was your mother's She was the cornerstone of the Harper family's company. And now, this woman has the audacity to squander it? Daniela, how can you remain so composed? I'm livid!"



Years ago, Caiden had used his charm and striking good looks to win over Daniela's mother, a billionaire heiress.Despite her vast wealth and strong personality,she had fallen hopelessly in love with him, her judgment clouded by affection. Her love for Caiden was fervent, yet she maintained her iron will,compelling Caiden to adopt the role of a docile spouse while he quietly nurtured his bitterness.	 



Merely days after the tragic death of Daniela's mother,Caiden hastily married Katrina.


The once obedient husband changed overnight,parading around as if he owned the world, reveling in his emancipation and shamelessly flaunting his elevated status.



He had discarded his earlier facade of servility and flattery towards Daniela's mother.


It seemed he had even convinced himself of his fabricated narrative-that he was the sole architect behind the success of Harper Group.



"There's no reason to be distressed," Daniela replied aloofly,fidgeting absentmindedly with a small trinket in her hand. "Since my mother chose to marry Caiden,he rightfully inherited a portion of her fortune.Whatever he does with it is beyond my concern."



Lillian exhaled a weary sigh.



Daniela had a knack for amassing wealth, yet she remained indifferent to its allure.



She effortlessly generated an abundance of income,a sum she regarded as trivial, and she never found herself flustered over mere pennies.


The auction progressed smoothly.


When a jade tiger was presented, Lillian's eyes sparkled with excitement. She turned to Daniela, her expression filled with earnest hope, imploring her to purchase the striking artifact.


Lillian, a founding pillar of Elite Lux, had accumulated a fortune in the billions. Money wasn't an issue for her;she just wanted Daniela to spoil her.


Daniela took immense joy in keeping her people happy.



Owning the auction house, she felt it appropriate to enhance the event wih a little bit of fun by joining in the bidding.


With a flourish,Daniela lifted her paddle to place a bid.


At that moment, Joyce,spotting Daniela's bid,quickly raised her paddle too, keen on a challenge.


The bidding for the diminutive jade tiger escalated from eight million to fifteen million.


Joyce faltered,her mind racing against the constraints of the budget Caiden had set for her.

 
In contrast, Daniela sat poised and assured, her manner as she bid radiating a commanding presence of autonomy and influence.



Many spectators, particularly the women, admired her tranquil yet assertive demeanor, coveting her financial independence and confidence.



Overwhelmed by envy, Joyce could barely contain herself as whispers of admiration for Daniela echoed from the socialites gathered behind her. Steeling her resolve, she raised her bidding paddle with a determined hand.



"Fifteen million, one hundred thousand!" Joyce declared,her voice tight with tension.


Daniela,poised and composed, effortlessly raised her own paddle. "Sixteen million."



"Sixteen million, one hundred thousand..."


Without missing a beat, Daniela countered smoothly,"Seventeen million."


At that moment, Joyce felt the collective gaze of the room converge upon her.


She tugged at the fabric of her dress, her thoughts whirling in turmoil.Bidding any higher would devour her entire allowance from Caiden for the next six months.	
"Ms. Holt, will you continue?" the auctioneer inquired,his smile coaxing. "This piece is truly a heart's desire.Do you wish to bid further?"



Joyce's cheeks flushed a deep shade of red.



Continue?



How could he suggest such a thing? Unlike Daniela,who wielded her own fortune with independence,Joyce was keenly aware that every dollar she spent was at the discretion of Caiden.



Joyce's heart seethed with envy, yet her expression showcased only a delicate vulnerability. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she grasped Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander, Daniela is trying to disgrace me in front of everyone."



Before Daniela could mount a defense, Lillian burst forth,her finger pointed accusingly at Joyce. "Enough!How much more slander will you hurl at Daniela? This is a respectable auction! If it's beyond your means,just own up to it. Why blame others because you didn't win? Enough with your theatrics!"


Joyce's tears cascaded down her cheeks, punctuating her sorrow with theatrical flair.



Alexander stood abruptly, his icy stare ensnaring Lillian.
As he prepared to interject, Daniela also rose, stepping in and drawing Lillian back. Her warm eyes hardened.



"Enough, Daniela!" Alexander interjected smoothly.



Despite her efforts to extinguish the old flames, his words sliced through her, painfully sharp. After all, he was the one she had cherished for so long.


Pressing her lips tightly, Daniela fought back the quiver that threatened to betray her emotions.


On the verge of speaking, she felt a shadow fall over her. A hand enclosed her wrist and pulled her back in one smooth, protective motion.



"Cut the nonsense, Mr. Bennett. Who's actually crossing the damn line here?" The words, tinged with authority, sliced through the thick silence enveloping the room. His piercing gaze roved over the gathered onlookers, finally anchoring on Alexander. "So,Daniela was once blind to your machinations, and now you presume to push her around at your whim? Cut the shit. This nonsense stops right now."



The atmosphere in the room turned icy.



Every gaze swiveled toward the speaker. It took a moment for the crowd to recognize him. Cedric Phillips, a titan of industry, renowned for his unyielding tactics and strategic genius.
Commanding every bit of the room's energy, Cedric nonetheless appeared aloof to the stares fixated on him. His eyes met Daniela's, his voice low andsteady "Don't bother fighting with pigs-they love the mud,and you'll just end up covered in their filth."


A murmur of laughter rippled through the audience,amusement flickering in their eyes as they turned their attention back to Alexander, whose reaction to Cedric's bold confrontation was keenly anticipated.
###Chapter 23 You've Crossed The Line







Alexander didn't say a word and simply pulled Joyce back into her seat.


The crowd,expecting more drama, let out a unified sigh of disappointment.


In the end, Daniela secured the jade tiger for a whopping $19 million and handed it over to Lillian as a gift.



Lillian, her face alight with glee, shot a smug look at Joyce,whose face was twisted with barely concealed fury. She then said in a loud voice, "Thanks,Daniela!"


Joyce was so enraged that veins popped from her forehead,her anger barely contained.


Daniela had once been nothing but a lovesick fool.Alexander had never wanted her. And now,just because she'd become a high-powered CEO,she thought she could act superior? 
As the auction wrapped up, Daniela lingered to chat with the event organizer.


Taking advantage of the situation, Joyce quickly lifted her phone and took a picture of Daniela. Turning to Alexander, she said, "Alexander, look at her! Daniela has no shame. First, she was flirting with Cedric, and now she's all over the organizer, who's old enough to be her father. She's making a fool of the Harper family. And don't forget-she was your wife. Just think about the damage she's doing to your reputation."


Of course, Joyce had angled the photo just right to make it look much worse than it was.



In reality, Daniela was just having a friendly chat.


As she spoke, Joyce quickly posted the photo in the Harper family group chat.


"Dad, take a look at Daniela! The organizer is practically her father's age! How shameless is she? I don't care about her reputation, but mine is at stake.I've never been so humiliated. How am I supposed to show my face in public now?"



As she had hoped, her dramatics hit their mark.



Caiden's anger flared up, and he smashed another of his precious porcelain cups.



After sending the message, Joyce looked over at Alexander.



His expression was as stoic as ever, unreadable.Joyce couldn't tell if he was angry or just indifferent. "Alexander, let's go," she said in a sugary tone, though her eyes quickly followed Daniela, who was walking to the restroom.



Just then a sneaky idea flashed through her mind.After a brief pause, she added, "Actually, Alexander,would you mind coming with me to the resroom?I'm not feeling well."



In the restroom, Daniela was in the middle of freshening up her makeup when Joyce entered.


"Well,well, Daniela. What a coincidence!"


Without even sparing her a glance, Daniela continued applying powder to her face, her voice calm and detached. "You came in here on purpose. No need to play games, my dear sister."


The last three words sliced through the air, sharp and piercing.


Daniela had no time for Joyce's dramatics-it made her stomach churn.



"Alright, yes, I followed you. But what's so special about you,Daniela? So what if you've got money now?"


Daniela stopped for a moment, a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth. She turned to Joyce,her voice calm as she corrected her. "It's not just some money. It's a lot of money. And it's the kind of money you'd never be able to earn in ten lifetimes. So go ahead and let yourself be jealous."


Joyce's fury nearly made her choke."You-"


"What about me?" Daniela cut in, her voice cold,her eyes sharp. "You still think I'm that same easy target?Well, here's a tip-don't push me, or I'll have you out of the Harper family faster than you can blink!"


Joyce's eyes filled with tears as she pointed at Daniela."How could you! Dad says I'm his daughter! You can't just kick me out! Daniela, you hate me, don't you?You're just jealous because Alexander likes me. But I'm your sister. Why would I hurt you?" ①


As she spoke, she staggered back, almost as if shoved,crashing dramatically against the restroom door.


Outside, Alexander stood leaning against the wall,a cigarette between his fingers. He observed as Joyce stumbled out of the restroom, her body collapsing onto the floor in a heap.



Joyce tilted her head back, her teary eyes wide with false innocence. She knew Alexander could see her like this, looking as pitiful as possible.


She looked up at Daniela, her voice thick with complaint. "Daniela, why are you doing this to me? I know you like Alexander, but he's my true love, too!Am I not allowed to love someone? Fine, it's all my fault. I'll kneel and beg if that's what you want!" Her voice cracked, and her body shook as if she might collapse at any second.


Daniela watched Joyce's over-the-top performance with a calm, almost entertained look on her face.



Her eyes briefly moved to the doorway, where Alexander stood silently watching.


Daniela chuckled and crossed her arms. "Go on,kneel."


Joyce froze in place, her cries suddenly trailing off.She was thrown off, unsure of how to react to Daniela's unexpected response. "What?" she stammered, staring at Daniela in shock.



Daniela tilted her head slightly, her gaze sharp. "You said you'd kneel, didn't you? So go ahead, kneel.What's the hold-up? Can't follow through? Was all that talk just for show?"



Joyce's face turned red with embarrassment, her confidence slipping away.


Alexander started to speak, but before he could say anything, Daniela's cold stare landed on him. "She said she'd kneel. You heard her, didn't you? I didn't make her say it."
Her voice was steady and unwavering. It was nothing like the gentle tone she used to have. "This is a private matter between Joyce and me. You've crossed the line, Mr. Bennett."

###Chapter 24 Joyce,Remember This Lesson!
Daniela let out a mocking laugh, her piercing eyes locked onto Alexander. "So, what now, Mr. Bennett?Will you continue to defend Joyce after all this?"


Alexander's brow furrowed deeply as he faced her.It had been merely three months since their divorce, yet here she was, confronting him with such boldness.


Did being CEO of Elite Lux make her think she was untouchable?



His features grew stormier, and he was on the verge of retorting when Daniela added sharply, "Don't test my patience. Push me one more time, and I'll make damn sure both of you pay for it."


Without waiting for his response, Daniela slammed her heel down on Joyce's foot.


Joyce gasped, a sharp pain shooting through her as her complexion turned ghostly white. Before she could let out a cry, Daniela's icy voice descended upon her. "Consider this a lesson, Joyce."


With those words, Daniela spun on her heel and strode away, leaving a trail of tension in her wake. Behind her, Joyce crumpled to the floor, clutching her foot as she sobbed uncontrollably.


She wouldn't tolerate this, not for a second. She was the Harper family's crown jewel. How could she sit back and allow Daniela to disgrace her like this? 3


She attempted to rise and confront Daniela, but Alexander intervened, holding up his hand as a signal for her to stay put.


Tears gathered in Joyce's eyes as she spun around to face him."Alexander, are you siding with Daniela now?"



With his expression unreadable, Alexander replied,"Attend to your injury first."



Yet Joyce was not prepared to drop the issue so easily.


She was not merely an addition to the Harper family through her mother. Caiden cherished her deeply.Katrina lavished her with affection. Even the Bennett family had once held her in high regard. All her life,she had enjoyed a privileged status, always a step ahead of Daniela.



The humiliation Daniela had inflicted upon her was something she could not simply ignore.


She longed to chase down Daniela, yet Alexander's indifferent, icy demeanor gave her pause. With a slight pout, Joyce lamented, "Alexander,haven't I warned you before? Daniela is nothing but a schemer. She faked the whole innocent act just to rope you into being her husband. Now, with the divorce finalized, she doesn't even bother to conceal her true nature. She's always been a heartless,calculating woman!" 2


While Alexander's hand remained on Joyce's arm, his gaze drifted in the direction Daniela had taken.


It had been only three months, but Joyce had become utterly unrecognizable.	

She carried an unshakable defiance, paired with a heart that refused to forgive.



As Daniela stepped out, she found Lillian already seated in the car, waiting. Naturally, she had heard Joyce's dramatic wailing from earlier.


As Daniela got in, Lillian glanced at her, noticing the trace of frustration on her face.



She called out, "Daniela."


Daniela snapped out of her thoughts and turned to look at Lillian. "Yes? What's wrong?"


Lillian paused, her lips parting slightly as if to choose her words carefully. "You know, the domestic sector of Elite Lux doesn't need to stay in Olisvine. This bet with the board-it's ridiculous. With your talent, you are the pillar of this company. Those old executives back at the headquarters are just setting you up to fail."



Choosing love over her role at Elite Lux, Daniela had left behind a team of ingenius yet inept technicians.These individuals, brilliant in their own right, lacked the pragmatic touch needed to steer a corporation.


Under her absence, Elite Lux had floundered with internal discord, leaving its vital members sidelined and its shares vulnerable to predatory investors. On the outside, the company maintained its grand facade,but internally, it was crumbling.



Daniela had made her return and laid down a daring challenge to the old board members of Elite Lux.



She had vowed that within three years, she would not only launch a domestic branch but also elevate its annual revenue to the legendary trillion-dollar mark.


If she were to succeed, those veteran board members agreed to resign and hand over their shares.


"They're counting on your failure. They see this as a chance to push you out and sell Elite Lux for a lucrative profit. But you don't have to prove anything.You built Elite Lux from the ground up-it's inherently yours!"

Lillian's words radiated genuine concern,yet Daniela couldn't miss the quiet tremors of fear beneath her words.


She offered a soft, reassuring smile and responded,"You're not really concerned about the company,are you? You're worried that I'll lose focus because of Alexander,right?"


Lillian couldn't mask her apprehension and admitted,"Yes, that's exactly it. You haven't been back long,and already they've thrown so many obstacles your way. It's concerning." 2


Her worries were not unfounded. Years ago, when Elite Lux was flourishing, Daniela had abandoned everything in pursuit of love, leaving her empire behind without a second thought.


Now, with her return to the public eye,there would be a slew of opportunists eager to capitalize on her regained prominence.


Moreover,if Alexander were to reappear, weaving his charming deceits and hollow vows, Lillian dreaded that Daniela might once again succumb to his allure.
###Chapter 25 No One Can Stop Her
Lillian couldn't get rid of the nagging worry about Daniela falling for Alexander again.


When Daniela fell for someone, it was like an illness -impossible to stop and completely irrational.


The fear still lingered in Lillian's mind.


She'd rather give up Elite Lux than watch Daniela go through another painful ordeal.


Daniela, sensing Lillian's worry, turned to her loyal friend, the one who'd stood by her through everything.With a gentle smile, she reassured, "Don't worry.I don't make the same mistake twice."



There was a time when she was head over heels for Alexander,hanging on to every word he said.


But that love was gone. Alexander didn't mean a thing to her anymore.







Joyce was seething with embarrassment. Not only had she fallen, but Daniela had made sure to step on her foot for good measure.


Her swollen, bruised foot throbbed with pain as Alexander helped her home. By the time they reached the door, she was already crying out.


"Mom, hurry, I'm going to die from all this bullying!"


Katrina was excitedly telling her friends all about Joyce's upcoming engagement to Alexander when she suddenly heard Joyce's cries.


Without hesitation, she rushed out. The moment she saw Joyce's swollen foot, her reaction was dramatic,as if everything was falling apart. "Caiden! Caiden!Come down here! Our baby girl is hurt."


Caiden hurried down the stairs so fast that one of his slippers fell off.


When he caught sight of Joyce's injured foot, his expression contorted with a mix of anger and concern.


"What happened?" he snapped, his voice tense.


Joyce quickly began to explain, "It was Daniela! I went to the auction with Alexander today, and as soon as she saw me, she got furious. I went to the restroom,and she followed me in. She shoved me and then stepped right on my foot. Dad, it hurts so much!"
Caiden frowned sharply. "Really? Daniela's completely losing it!"



Joyce added fuel to the fire. "Dad, I just went to the auction to apologize. I know l've been careless and hurt her, so I wanted to make it right. But she called me greedy. She accused me of wanting the three floors of the Luxor Tower. Dad, I didn't mean anything by it-I just wanted us to get along as sisters. But she got so angry and attacked me. Do you think she's mad because I asked her for something?"



Caiden's face darkened with rage. "She's gone way too far! What does she mean by 'her things' or 'your things'? It's all part of the family. If you want three floors, they should be yours! If you want five or ten,you should get them too! You're her sister, her family.How can she be so selfish and ungrateful?"


He stood there with his hands on his hips, his frustration growing. It was then that he noticed Alexander standing quietly to the side.


"Alexander, did you hear that? Daniela's totally out of line! You need to do something about her!"



Alexander stayed calm, his tone distant. "We're divorced." 



"So what if you're divorced? Everyone knows Daniela always took your word seriously. You were her husband, and even though you're no longer together,you still have a responsibility to guide her. Just look at what she's done-posting things online that brought shame to the family, and now at the auction,getting involved with the organizer. What kind of message does that send?"



Joyce kept her head lowered, but a smug smile tugged at her lips. Caiden's unshakable support was exactly what she had hoped for.


She glanced at Alexander, expecting him to back her up and stand against Daniela.


But Alexander's words crushed her hopes.


"Daniela is the boss behind the auction, not the organizer," he said flatly.



Caiden and Katrina froze, staring at him, stunned.


Alexander pressed on, "As we were leaving, the organizer told someone that Daniela, CEO of Elite Lux,owns the auction house."



His words landed like a bomb. Turning to the shocked Caiden and Katrina, Alexander added, "I've brought Joyce home safely. I'll be leaving now." 

Katrina stood frozen, taking a few seconds to process Alexander's words.

Without waiting for a reply, Alexander headed towards his car.



Katrina snapped out of her daze and hurried after him."Alexander! Ask your grandfather when he's available so our families can talk about your engagement to Joyce!"



Alexander got in his car, started the engine, and drove off into the night without saying a word.


Back inside, Caiden grabbed his phone and called a friend to check if Daniela's influence had really expanded this far.



If that were the case, then he'd have something to proudly boast about.


Meanwhile, Katrina stood by the window, her eyes following Alexander's car as it faded from view.



Joyce,still resting against her mother, glanced up at her with a puzzled look and tilted her head. "Mom,what's got your attention?"


"Joyce,how did Daniela behave towards Alexander at the auction today?" Katrina asked.


Joyce let out a dismissive snort. "She's playing hard to get now. Instead of chasing him like she used to, she's acting like she doesn't care at all."

Katrina's chest tightened at her words. "And how did Alexander react to her?"



Joyce lifted her chin, a proud smile tugging at her lips."Well, of course, he still looks down on her, just like before! Alexander only has eyes for me. Mom, just wait-once I marry into the Bennett family, Daniela will be so jealous."


Katrina helped Joyce inside. After walking for a bit,she turned her head, glancing back.


The sleek black car had already blended into the traffic, its taillights disappearing into the darkness.


Katrina murmured, "Nothing and no one will stop my daughter from finding her happiness. Not a soul."

###Chapter 26 Is She Really That Same Daniela
As Alexander was heading home, his phone vibrated.It was a call from his father.



"Hey,Dad."


"There's a concert tonight. I've given your secretary the ticket. You should go."


Alexander was caught off guard. His father had always brushed off anything that didn't help the family business, calling it a waste of time.


And now, out of nowhere, he was offering a ticket to a concert?



However, the things Alexander had once found exciting in his younger years no longer seemed to hold much appeal.


He gave a half-hearted agreement, though he had no real intention of going.


That was until Richard added, "I've just heard that Daniela will be there too. Every rich bachelor will be attending tonight. Alexander, I know you're too proud to approach Daniela, but tonight could be your perfect chance. Of course, the choice is yours. If you don't seize it, someone else surely will."



Before Alexander could say anything,Richard hung up.


Alexander gazed at the glowing city lights, his father's words echoing in his head.


As he reached the next intersection, he turned the steering wheel.






Olisvine was famous for its impressive skyline,from its opulent skyscrapers to its famnous landmarks.


However, the most distinguished of them all was its concert hall, the largest in the nation.


The concert hall drew the country's top musicians and stood as a symbol of elegance and artistry.


Daniela had planned to head home after the auction,but Lillian insisted on taking her to the concert hall.


"The maestros have been eager to meet you.You own this place, but other than skimming the year-end reports, you've completely ignored it. Don't you feel a little guilty as the boss?"


Despite Daniela's objections, Lillian managed to pull her along.
The cello had been Daniela's mother's favorite instrument. Her mother's biggest wish was for her to pursue music.



But when the family fell apart, so did that dream.


For more than ten years, Daniela had pursued Alexander relentlessly, and throughout all that time,she had never once stepped foot in the concert hall again.


Now, as she entered through its familiar doors, a rush of memories and nostalgia hit her.


At the entrance, the senior maestros stood waiting. As soon as they spotted Daniela, they bowed in unison,greeting her respectfully.


These were people who had known her since she was a child, some who had even cradled her in their arms.Now, seeing her as an adult, they couldn't help but sigh at how quickly time had flown.


After exchanging pleasantries, the maestros politely excused themselves to get ready for the performance.


The hall's director remained behind to stay with Daniela.


Waving at a young man who had been closely following them, the director introduced, "This is my grandson. He just returned from abroad. You two will have plenty to chat about. He'll be your guide for the evening while I take care of things backstage."


Daniela smiled politely and nodded. "That sounds fine."


The young man had a warm, friendly smile. When Daniela smiled at him, his face turned bright red.


Lillian chuckled, leaning in to nudge Daniela's arm.


"Knock it off," Daniela muttered under her breath.


But Lillian turned to the young man and asked loudly,"Hey, handsome, up for some fun?"


The young man's face turned even redder, but he answered sincerely, "Sure," then slowly looked up to meet Daniela's eyes.


Lillian gave his shoulder an encouraging pat. "You've got potential!"


By the time the concert started, Alexander had finally shown up.


Richard had gotten him a prime front-row seat. As soon as he stepped into the hall, all eyes were on him,and the hall felt like it shifted with the tension.


The stares weren't exactly discreet. Everyone was looking at him-the ex-husband-wondering what on earth he was doing there.


Was he here trying to win her back?



Suddenly,all the gazes turned cautious and on guard.


Alexander ignored the stares and sat down. A guy next to him pulled at his sleeve, and Alexander turned to find his friend, Keith Clayton, grinning at him.①


"Well,well, what brings you here?" Keith asked with that familiar grin of his.


Alexander glanced over at Daniela. She was sitting a few rows away,completely lost in the performance,not even noticing he was there.


It was so different from before. In the past,no matter how crowded it was, she'd always spot him right away


A weird frustration bubbled up inside him. He instinctively went to loosen his tie but stopped himself when he remembered where he was.



Keith, always the talker, wasn't too interested in the classical music. He scanned the hall, looking at all the young heirs, and couldn't help but chuckle under his breath.



He leaned in and whispered to Alexander, "Hey, did you notice? Half of Olisvine's golden boys are here tonight, and I'm willing to bet that they're all here for Daniela. I bet most of them don't even know what's happening on stage."


Keith smirked and shook his head. "Crazy, right? Back in the day, Daniela was always ignored, stuck under her stepmother's control. And now? She's a CEO.I even told her once that she wasn't good enough for you. Funny how life has a way of proving you wrong,huh?" 



He added with a grin, "But enough about that. You've got to admit, she looks amazing tonight. That gown?It's from Elite Lux, custom-made. I heard it's worth five million and still rising. She's really turning heads."


Alexander stayed silent. His gaze turned from the stage to Daniela.


Since leaving the auction, she had changed into a breathtaking gown.


The soft, tranquil shade of blue reminded him of a peaceful lake, its beauty drawing the eye of anyone nearby.


Her hair was elegantly styled in an updo, and her posture was flawless, with her long,graceful neck held high like that of a regal swan.


She sat there quietly, completely absorbed in the performance, oblivious to the chatter swirling around her.
Keith let out another laugh. "So, what do you think?Does Daniela even get the music, or is she just playing along to fit in with the fancy crowd?"


Alexander's gaze flickered back to the stage,his voice calm and distant. "She doesn't get it."


Keith grinned knowingly. "I figured as much. People with money love to act like they're all about the fine arts. It's more about looking cultured than actually understanding it. And honestly..."


Before he could finish his sentence, the performance ended, and the crowd burst into applause.


The director of the concert hall walked onto the stage,microphone in hand, his expression warm and welcoming.



"Good evening, everyone. I have the honor of being the director here, and tonight, it's my privilege to introduce a very special guest, Daniela Harper,the owner of this venue. She's been an accomplished musician since childhood, particularly with the cello.It's been many years since I've had the pleasure of hearing her play, and I must ask-are we fortunate enough to hear her perform for us tonight?"


His words rang out, leaving the audience stunned into silence.
Those who had been distracted by their phones,making calls, or thinking about leaving suddenly stopped. Some quickly tucked their phones away,while others cut off their conversations mid-sentence.A few even straightened up, shifting in their seats as
they fully focused on Daniela.


Every person turned their attention to her, disbelief and curiosity written all over their faces.


Did Daniela own this concert hall? She could play the cello? Wasn't she just here for a quick appearance?What else had she been keeping under wraps?


Even the young heirs who had been dragged here by their families settled in and looked at Daniela, their boredom giving way to curiosity.


The same thought buzzed through everyone's mind.Could Daniela-the woman everyone had written off as just a pretty face-actually play?

###Chapter 27 Could This Really Be Daniela
Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a teasing smile creeping onto his face. "Daniela can't really play,right?"


"She can't," Alexander answered coolly, his voice steady but sure.  


He glanced at his watch and adjusted it with careful precision. "You know how these things go. Daniela's in charge of Elite Lux now, and everyone wants to get on her good side. She owns this concert hall as well, SO it's only natural that her people will be showering her with compliments."


A hint of disdain flickered in his eyes. Playing the cello wasn't something one could just fake. Without at least ten years of solid practice, what could she really be capable of? It would be a joke, plain and simple.This kind of mindless flattery was totally out of place for the occasion.  



Keith laughed, clearly entertained by everything happening around him. He wasn't all that into the concert-he just loved the spectacle.


Turning to Alexander, he asked, "Looks like everyone's kissing upto Daniela these days. What about you,Alexander? Here to join in?"


Laughing, Keith slapped Alexander on the shoulder."What's it like? The girl who used to run after you is now the one you're after. Must sting a little,huh? But hey, no judgment, man. We all do what we gotta do for money and power."



Alexander's face went cold, his jaw clenched as he shook off Keith's hand.



His already icy expression grew even darker with Keith's blunt words.



When Daniela stepped onto the stage, Alexander's face stayed as cold as ever.


Most people assumed this was a performance they'd have to sit through just out of politeness.


There were quiet whispers as Daniela walked gracefully toward the stage.


She sat down in front of the cello, adjusting it with care. After testing the strings quickly, she began to play, no flashy introduction, just starting in silence.


The first note sounded-rich and full-cutting through the soft murmurs in the room, instantly quieting everyone.


The crowd, which had just moments ago been filled with quiet doubt, now sat utterly silent. Every single eye was locked on Daniela.


Bathed in the soft glow of the stage lights, shesat with an air of elegance, her posture perfect and her hands moving with effortless grace. Her long hair gleamed in the spotlight, and her calm, serene expression gave her an almost otherworldly presence.


She seemed like an angel who had descended from the heavens, exuding both peace and authority.


Her fingers danced over the strings, and the music flowed-deep, emotional, and hauntingly beautiful.The melody filled the hall, surrounding the audience and drawing them in completely.


The hall was utterly quiet, except for the sound of her cello.


The audience, spellbound, couldn't look away. All the whispers, doubts, and judgments faded. Nothing mattered now except the music and the woman behind it.



Could this really be Daniela? The same woman they had dismissed as a shallow,love-struck fool?



When the last note dissolved into silence, Daniela rose from her chair, turned to the audience and offered a graceful,deep bow. "It's been a while since I last played. I hope it wasn't too disappointing. Thank you all for listening."


The hall exploded into applause, so loud and intense that it caught her off guard for a moment.


Her lips curled into a smile, her eyes softening with warmth. With elegance, she said, "Thank you."


Keith clapped so energetically that his hands turned red. He turned to Alexander, eyes wide with excitement and disbelief. "Did you hear that? Daniela actually played the cello! And not just played it-she crushed it! Can you believe this? Alexander, how did you not know she was this talented? How could you have been such a clueless ex-husband?"-	4



Alexander's dark eyes stayed locked on the stage, his face betraying a mix of emotions he couldn't quite process.



He had genuinely never known this side of her. All this time, he had believed she was naive, obedient, and shallow-just another woman obsessed with status and appearances.



But the woman he had seen just moments ago was nothing like the person he had imagined. She had sat there with a quiet, commanding presence, her confidence shining through in every movement.



Was this really Daniela? The audience erupted into whispers that quickly grew louder.



The first to speak were the young elites, their voices full of disbelief.



"That's Daniela?"



"Whoever called her a fool-come say it again."


"I'm in love with Daniela! I'll woo her!"



"Whoa, take it easy. What makes you think you'll be the only one? Let's be fair here. Everyone's in this!"



Even the general crowd couldn't hold back their chatter.





"Hold on, isn't that the CEO of Elite Lux?"



"Her performance was amazing. I've heard so many cello pieces, but this one spoke to my heart. It was perfect."


"I recorded the whole thing and posted it online just now. My notifications are exploding-hundreds of likes and comments already."



A wave of admiration and praise surged through the concert hall, sweeping over everyone.



Keith turned to Alexander, still clapping excitedly "Hey, Alexander, if you're not planning to win her back,I'm stepping in. Daniela is too amazing to just let go!"


Alexander sat quietly, a growing irritation gnawing at him as he listened to the constant stream of praise.


After a moment, he lifted his gaze. "Amazing? I don't understand what all the excitement is about." 
###Chapter 28 Daniela Became Smarter
Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a mischievous grin creeping onto his face. "Oh really? Well, in that case, I guess I'll go after Daniela."


For reasons Alexander couldn't fully explain, his frustration-already bubbling just below the surface -flared up at Keith's words.



Meanwhile,Daniela glided off the stage,lifting the hem of her gown with effortless elegance.


Cedric stepped forward and handed her a bouquet of flowers. His usually stiff demeanor softened, and a faint, almost proud smile tugged at his lips.



"Thank you," Daniela said with a polite smile and accepted the flowers.


She hadn't played the cello in years, but being back on stage again stirred up the same lighthearted joy she had experienced as a child.



As she scanned the crowd, her eyes landed on Alexander sitting among them.



Her expression changed in an instant, as if she'd just spotted an irritating fly buzzing around her.


Alexander immediately caught her glance and, almost without thinking, straightened up, his chest expanding a little.



However, Daniela's eyes barely lingered on him,passing over him with an icy indifference, as if he were just another face in the crowd.



Alexander's lips tightened into a thin line.


So she'd become a CEO and now thought she was above him?  



As the event came to an end,Daniela stayed behind to chat with the maestros. Meanwhile, the audience began to trickle out of the hall, but many couldn't help casting lingering glances her way.


Keith gave Alexander's arm a nudge. "So, are you going to go say hi?"



Alexander stole a glance at Daniela. She stood with graceful composure, her floor-length gown flowing elegantly, the pearls in her earrings catching the light and shimmering faintly. She appeared breathtaking,drawing everyone's gaze.



Keith chuckled when he saw Alexander pause. "I see what's going on. You're too proud to make the first move. Back in the day, it was always Daniela running after you, and now you don't know what to do,huh?Plus, with so many people around, maybe she didn't even catch sight of you. Otherwise,she would come to you. Everyone knows that she only has eyes for you."


With a grin, Keith waved his hand,calling out excitedly,"Daniela! Over here!"



As soon as she heard her name, Daniela turned her head towards them.



Keith flashed a big smile and pointed at Alexander."Daniela, look who's here-Alexander came to support you tonight."


Keith's message was clear-if Alexander wasn't going to approach Daniela, then she could come to him instead.



But to their surprise, Daniela simply cast them a cold,detached look. Then, she turned back to the person she had been chatting with and resumed her conversation.



Keith opened his mouth to speak again, but before he could, a man stepped in front of Daniela,blocking his view. It was Cedric. His face was stern, and the warning in his eyes made Keith pause.


Keith blinked, hesitated, and muttered, "Okay then."


By the time Daniela finished talking with the maestros and left the concert hal, it was already late into the night.



She hadn't anticipated findng Keith and Alexander hanging around by the entrance.


As lively as ever, Keith quickly called out, "Daniela!"


Daniela looked up briefly, and Keith and Alexander started heading towards her.



Before he could even approach, Keith was already grinning, his voice overflowing with praise. "Daniela,you were incredible tonight! I had no idea you hadthis kind of skill."



Daniela's smile was brief and polite, but it didn't reach her eyes. It was obvious she wasn't interested in chatting. "Thank you," she said flatly, then turned to leave.


Realizing she was about to walk off, Keith quickly added, "By the way, Alexander watched your performance too. He thought it was amazing."


At this, Daniela stopped in her tracks. Slowly, she turned her head, and her eyes locked onto Alexander.


Keith, noticing this, quickly lowered his gaze. He couldn't help but think that Daniela still had feelings for Alexander.


However, Daniela said, "Mr. Bennett, you were unusually attentive tonight. That's a first."


The way she emphasized "that's a first" was laced with obvious sarcasm, leaving no doubt about her meaning.


The moment felt charged. Her words were a sharp reminder of the fire incident from their marriage.



Keith stood frozen, his eyes locked on Daniela as if he were seeing her in an entirely new light.


She wasn't like the one he remembered. She was sharp, composed, like she had become smarter.
###Chapter 29 We Can't Be Friends
With a scowl, Alexander turned to leave, but Keith stopped him by grabbing his arm.


Keith flashed a grin and pulled out a business card,handing it over to Daniela. "Ms. Harper, we've crossed paths before-at your wedding with Alexander. I'm one of his close friends, Keith Clayton. Just call me Keith."



Daniela might've taken the card if he hadn't brought up Alexander. But when she heard the name, she didn't bother to take it. "I'm off the clock. I don't mix business with personal time. If you need something,just talk to my secretary."



Keith's grin wavered a little, his cheerful act dropping for a second. "It's not business. I just thought we could be friends."



Lillian frowned at his words and started to step in, but Daniela held up a hand, stopping her. "I'm no longer married to Alexander. His friends won't be mine. If there's nothing else, please excuse me."



Without waiting for an answer, she turned and started walking off.
As she neared her car, Keith saw the concert hall director's grandson excitedly holding the door open for her.



Unlike the cold indifference she'd shown to both Keith and Alexander, Daniela smiled warmly at the young man."Thank you."


Under the glow of the neon lights, the young man's ears flushed bright red. "Goodbye, Ms. Harper."


Keith watched with interest as the scene unfolded, his eyes fixed on the young man. He nudged Alexander and said, "You know, Daniela's always been stunning -guys have always been drawn to her. But now, with her being the CEO of Elite Lux, she's on an entirely different level. Just look at that boy-he's all nervous and trying so hard to impress her. And she's being so sweet with him."



Alexander walked to the parking lot without saying anything.


Keith continued, "You know, Alexander, if I had realized that Daniela was completely done with you,l wouldn't have dragged you with me earlier. Do you think I came off badly? I mean, she shut me down pretty quickly back there."


As Keith kept talking, he caught something odd.Alexander's hand seemed to hesitate,gripping the car door handle a little tighter, right at the moment he mentioned Daniela being over him.


Keith blinked, his instincts kicking in. Alexander was not as unaffected by her as he was trying to make everyone believe.


Keith saw his chance and leaned in. "Alexander,women like Daniela are one of a kind, and they deserve to be treated well. She's beautiful, successful,and getting attention from all sides. If you don't make a move,someone else will. And Joyce? She's a ticking time bomb, and her mother isn't any better. If you go through with marrying her, you'll regret it every single day. Just think about it-three months ago, Daniela was going out of her way to make you happy. Even now,despite how distant she's acting, there's still a bit of warmth in her. If you just let go of your pride and apologize, I'm sure she'll forgive you. So, why keep acting like you couldn't care less?"



Alexander's face tightened, his frustration obvious. He wrenched the car door open and, before slamming it shut, he snapped, "Does everything havè to be about her now?"



The door banged shut, and his car roared to life,tearing into the night and blending into the rush of traffic.



Keith stayed behind, watching the taillights disappear. With a deep sigh, he shook his head and muttered under his breath, "If the day ever comes when she really doesn't love you anymore, you'll be left begging and pleading."  







Alexander didn't hear a thing Keith said. He sped down the road,his mind elsewhere.


When he got home, the living room lights were still on.Richard was there, clearly eager to know how things went with Daniela.


Before Alexander could even make it all the way through the door, Richard jumped in with a grin."Well?How'd it go? I heard that half of Olisvine's bachelors were at the concert hall tonight. You had a prime spot.Did Daniela notice you?"


"She did," Alexander replied flatly.


Richard's face brightened with hope. Grinning like the result was already decided, he asked, "And? Did you actually talk to her? Did you bring up the idea of getting back together?"



Alexander's expression turned cold. "No."


Richard's smile dropped, frowning."Why not?"


Alexander didn't want to get into it. "I'm tired,"he said sharply, then turned and went upstairs, ending the conversation.



Once he was in his room, he didn't rush to shower or change. He loosened his tie and dropped into a chair.


His eyes, dark and unfocused, stared at the empty room as his mind spiraled.



He couldn't stand the feeling that the world was trying to force him and Daniela back together. The thought of chasing someone who didn't care for him was something he hated.


Love had always seemed like a concept he didn't buy into.


For ten years, Daniela had pursued him-ten years of relentless loyalty.


She had been such a constant part of his life that her sudden absence now left a noticeable void. He tried to convince himself that this unease was simply the result of withdrawal.


He kept repeating the same reasoning in his mind.Their marriage had never been anything but a practical,business-driven arrangement.


It hadn't been about feelings or love.


When things clicked, they stayed.

When they didn't, they went their separate ways.



It was as simple as that.


Yet, despite all his attempts to rationalize it,Alexander couldn't shake the image of Cedric standing in front of Daniela earlier that evening. The memory stirred something strange and unsettling inside him.


He repeated in his mind-this was just withdrawal.


If he kept a dog for years, it was only natural to get attached.



And Daniela was human.


Alexander told himself that he was just not used to it.







Daniela had gotten home from the concert, only to end up drinking a pricey bottle of wine with Lillian.


Lillian spent the night ranting about Alexander.When Daniela finally woke up, her head was cloudy, and the events from the night before felt distant and hazy.①


At that moment, a gentle knock echoed at the door.The housekeeper's unsure voice came through. "Ms.Harper?"



"What is it?" Daniela mumbled, still half-dazed.
The housekeeper paused for a moment, clearly unsure,before speaking in a hesitant, nervous tone. "There's a man downstairs, claiming to be your father. He's been waiting for over an hour. He's with two women -one named Katrina and the other Joyce. They said they're your family."



Daniela blinked, the words slowly sinking in. Her gaze turned to the phone on her nightstand, now lighting up with an incoming call.


She answered the phone, put it on speaker, and walked into the bathroom to freshen up.



"Awake?" Cedric's voice came through, low and smooth.



"Hmm," Daniela murmured.



"I had some top-tier food brought in today. Care to join me for lunch?”



Daniela patted her face dry with a towel before responding, "Not today. I've got something to handle."


"What's going on?"


Daniela set the towel down and clipped her earrings on. Her tone remained calm and light as she said,"Looks like it's time to confront my family."
###Chapter 30 Empty The House

Ten minutes later, in the downstairs living room,Joyce reclined on the couch, her tone overly sweet as she bossed the housekeeper around.



"These fruits are exquisite. Pack up a box for me to take home. And the fruit platter-it's stunning. I need to know where you found it. I'll take that too. Oh, and see that little table over there? It's just perfect for late -night snacks. Fold it up for me,will you?"


While she issued her orders, Joyce drifted over to the large fish tank.



The housekeeper, visibly stressed, hurried over with a forced smile. "Ms. HHolt, these fish are a special gift from Mr. Phillips. I've heard each one is valued at over twenty thousand dollars."



Joyce's interest piqued, she glanced at Katrina, who understood her intentions immediately.



Leaning on Caiden's arm, Katrina remarked, "Just look at Daniela's lavish setup here. This tank alone must be worth a fortune. She really indulges herself, doesn't she?"
Caiden scoffed, "She doesn't know the first thing about living sensibly. Joyce, if you fancy it, we can have someone come and collect the entire tank later."


Joyce's smile widened, clearly pleased. She had to acknowledge,Daniela was not only wealthy but had an exceptional eye for style. Everythingin the house was curated with elegance. 2


Eyeing a nearby cabinet, Joyce's smile turned cunning."Dad, I'd like that cabinet as well. It would be perfect in our place." ①



The housekeeper's heart dropped. "This cabinet is another gift from Mr. Phillips. It's crafted from rare rosewood and was acquired at an auction. It's not really something we can just give away."


Katrina chuckled lightly, turning to Caiden. "Daniela may be thriving in her career, but it seems her staff doesn't quite understand. We're all family here.Why should there be such boundaries among us?"



Caiden's expression hardened as he faced the housekeeper, his voice dropping to an icy,authoritative timbre. "I'm her father.Whatever I desire,she should be willing to provide. Even if I demanded this entire building, she'd have no choice but to comply-let alone a mere cabinet."



The housekeeper bowed her head submissively. "Yes,  sir."



Emboldened by Caiden's declaration, Joyce's demeanor swelled with conceit. She swept her hand across the room, pointing at the lavish furnishings as though compiling a wish list on an extravagant shopping spree.



Turning to Caiden with a gleeful grin, she said, "Dad,I'll arrange for movers to collect these items. And while we're at it, could you convince Daniela to refurbish the 18th to 20th floors for me? I want them styled just like this."



The housekeeper's eyes bulged, her mind reeling at the audacity. These people were beyond belief.



Her eyes darted towards the staircase, hoping Daniela would appear soon.


Anxiety tightened her chest. If Daniela didn't intervene quickly, they'd empty the entire house.


Just as panic threatened to overwhelm her, a firm knock resounded through the room.


A flicker of hope sparked across the housekeeper's face, half-expecting it to be Lillian, whose gutsy demeanor might defuse the escalating situation.


However, the door swung open to reveal not Lillian,but a team of professional movers, clad in their work uniforms.



"Hello, did someone here request a moving service?"one mover inquired.


The housekeeper peeked outside, her heart sinking as she saw over ten robust men, poised as though ready to gut the house.


She waved her hands fretfully. "My employer is still resting. Could you perhaps wait a little longer? Just until-"



"Wait for what?" Before she could finish, Joyce barged past her and barked at the movers, "Come in!What are you waiting for? We've been expecting you."


The mover apologized promptly, "Sorry, ma'am. The traffic downtown was horrendous."



Joyce dismissed their excuse with an irritated wave of her hand. "Spare me the details. Just get in here." She led them into the living room, her gestures grand and commanding as she pointed out her selections."Take that. And this. Oh, and that one over there too.The fish tank-yes, the whole thing, fish included.Move it all!"



The movers examined the items carefully before providing a quote. "Since there are live animals involved,the fee will be slightly higher. If that's alright, we can begin immediately."


Joyce waved them off dismissively, her tone dripping with entitlement. "Go ahead and start. Bill the owner of the house for it later."


The movers, methodical and professional, began unpacking their equipment, ready to pack up the requested items.



The housekeeper, now frantic, stepped forward in a last-ditch effort to intervene. "No, no! This can't happen! Miss Harper still asleep. Please, at least wait until she wakes up so you can ask her first. If she consents, then fine, take what you like. But I'm just the housekeeper-I don't have the authority to let this happen. If she comes downstairs to find her house stripped bare,what explanation am I supposed to give?Please,I beg you!"



Caiden claimed to be Daniela's father,Katrina asserted herself as the stepmother, and Joyce proclaimed as the stepsister.



Confused by the family dynamics, the housekeeper felt utterly helpless.



"What did you just say?" Joyce snapped, her tone sharp and cutting as her glare bore into the housekeeper. "I said, move these things. Didn't you hear me?"
The housekeeper, though visibly trembling, planted herself in front of the fish tank, resolutely blocking their path.



Joyce's frustration reached its boiling point.Without a second thought, she raised her hand and struck the housekeeper hard across the face.



The housekeeper, a woman in her fifties, stumbled under the force of the slap. Her eyes brimmed with tears, but she stood her ground, too terrified to speak.


Joyce seized her arm roughly, shoving her aside with a dismissive sneer. Turning back to the movers, she barked, "Move it, now!" 

###Chapter 31 Even I Have to Respect Him
The movers nodded and bent down, working together to lift the massive fish tank.


At that moment, the doorbell rang again.


With a piercing look, Joyce directed her fiery gaze at the housekeeper, her voice thick with exasperation."Have you lost your hearing? Open the door, now!" ①


Tears brimming in her eyes, the housekeeper went towards the door. "Just how many more people do they intend to bring in?" she muttered to herself,frustrated.



Katrina reclined against Caiden, her fingers teasingly caressing his chest in slow, deliberate circles."Daniela's servant is just too careless. Next time, let me bring in someone more dependable to take care of her. It's the least we can do to ensure she doesn't have to deal with such incompetence."


At her words, Caiden's expression melted into one of tender affection. He gazed down at her, his admiration palpable, and tenderly pressed a kiss to her forehead.


"Katrina,your heart is just so expansive. You've woven  yourself into the fabric of this family, yet Daniela hasn't once called you 'Mom.' Still, you think only of her welfare. Truly, making you my wife was the finest decision of my life."  


Katrina's gaze fluttered downwards, a rosy blush coloring her cheeks. "I'm simply reflecting the goodness you shower upon me,honey."


Caiden, observing her demure smile, felt a surge of warmth flood his chest.


Their eyes locked, brimming with a silent, electric charge.


This was the tableau that greeted Cedric as he arrived.The house buzzed with activity, movers weaving through rooms, while the housekeeper,her cheek puffed and reddened, tear stains marking her eyes,stood at the threshold.



She edged closer to Cedric, her voice quivering."They're clearing out the house. Miss Harper is still sleeping."


Cedric's piercing gaze grew stormy, his features setting into a stern mask. Silently, he stepped inside.


The first spectacle to catch his eye was Caiden and Katrina, entwined in an intimate embrace,seemingly unaware of the world around them.

This wasn't even their house-it belonged to Daniela.Yet there they were, shamelessly engaging in flirtatious banter amidst the bustling movers. Had he not arrived when he did, one could only speculate on the extent of their indiscretions.


Cedric's eyebrows knitted together, a spark of annoyance flashing across his countenance.


The instant Joyce spotted Cedric, her expression erupted in sheer joy. Overcome with excitement,she blurted out, "Mr.Phillips!"



Cedric Phillips!


For someone like her, who seldom encountered individuals of Cedric's renowned status, the reality of meeting him was nothing short of mesmerizing.


Rooted to the spot, she could do nothing but stare at him,her eyes wide with admiration as time seemed to slow down around her.


"He's absolutely stunning," she muttered to herself in awe, the thought echoing loudly in her mind.


His appearance was striking-those sharp features,those piercing eyes, flawless in every conceivable way.


Her overt awe didn't escape Katrina's notice. Standing a few feet away, she observed her daughter's lack of  subtlety with a frown. With a pointed cough, she attempted to snap Joyce out of her reverie.


Jolted back to the present, Joyce quickly dabboed at her lips and ran her fingers through her hair to compose herself. She approached Cedric with a tentative step, offering a hand and a bashful smile."Hi there, I'm Joyce, Daniela's sister. It's a pleasure to meet you."


Cedric remained motionless, his hands tucked into his pockets, radiating a chilling aloofness. He gave Joyce a quick, indifferent look, treating her as if she were merely an inconsequential blur in his field of vision.


A wave of embarrassment washed over Joyce at his dismissive gaze, yet her fascination only grew stronger. Despite his cold dismissal, her enthusiasm for him remained undiminished.


Katrina was discreetly studying Cedric from across the room. Though their paths had never crossed before,the tales she had heard painted a vivid picture of him.


Cedric stood out dramatically-his height imposing,his features strikingly handsome, and his demeanor radiated an undeniable power that seemed to silently command respect from everyone around him.


If Joyce could marry Cedric...


Katrina turned her attention to Caiden, lightly  squeezing his hand to garner his focus. "Between Cedric and Alexander, whom do you favor more?"


Caiden grasped the essence of Katrina's inquiry immediately-she was appraising Cedric as a potential match for Joyce. He replied, "Cedric, without any doubt. Alexander might have Richard's support, but that's precisely his weak point-Richard's influence is too pervasive, and Alexander can't seem to step out from under his shadow. Cedric is a different story He's self-taught, self-made. His achievements are solely his own, which even I must commend."



He paused, considering the familial implications. "Plus,his personal life is uncomplicated-only his elderly grandmother requires his care. If Joyce marries him,she'd practically run the show,with no one to second -guess her decisions. His prowess in business is unmatched, a stark contrast to the Bennett family,who are constantly currying favor and clinching deals.There's absolutely no contest-Cedric is in a class by himself."



Katrina's eyes shimmered with excitement and anticipation. "Do you, someone of your insight,truly respect him?"



Caiden nodded affirmatively, his face breaking into a thoughtful smile. "In business, certainly. But should Joyce succeed in intertwining their fates through marriage, no matter his capabilities, Cedric will have to defer to me, regardless."
###Chapter 32 She Had No Home Long Ago
Katrina radiated excitement, practically glowing. She let go of Caiden's hand and stepped towards Joyce,positioning herself confidently before turning to address Cedric.



"Cedric Phillips, Daniela's close friend, right? I'm Daniela's stepmother. Please, feel free to call me Katrina." She extended her hand towards him,her face adorned with a polished, almost-too-perfect smile.



But Cedric didn't budge. His hands stayed buried in his pockets, his sharp eyes surveying the room with a frigid intensity. He didn't so much as glance at her offered hand.



The atmosphere tensed with Cedric's arrival. His sheer presence was enough to command the room,halting the movers mid-task.



"Starting a move this early in the morning?" Cedric asked, his lips curling into a faint, sardonic smile.



Katrina's hand hung in the air awkwardly for a moment,but her polished demeanor didn't falter. She recovered, letting out a light, breezy laugh and adopting an effortless tone. "No, not moving! Daniela  still lives here. It's just that Joyce felt some of the furniture and decorations didn't quite align with Daniela's style. We were discussing some upgrades to better suit her taste. As parents, it's only natural we want her to have the best. She lives alone, after all,and we want her to feel comfortable and well taken care of."



Katrina's ability to twist the narrative to her favor was nearly flawless.
Stating the truth-that they were pillaging the home -would paint her as selfish and cold.



But framing it as an effort to enhance Daniela's living situation made her sound thoughtful,even selfless.



She had mastered this technique over the years,crafting the image of a loving, supportive stepmother everyone admired.



The housekeeper could only stare in stunned silence,knowing the stark contrast between Katrina's words and her actions.



What was she even saying now? Just moments ago,this woman had been barking orders and laying claim to anything she fancied.



The housekeeper's anxiety surged as she glanced at Cedric, silently praying he wouldn't be fooled by Katrina's sudden change in demeanor.

Cedric remained unmoved, his expression cold and unreadable as he pulled a chair ov/er and settled into it with deliberate calm.



His sharp gaze flicked briefly towards the movers handling the fish tank.


"So, the fish tank and the fish that I gifted aren't good enough? Is that it? Are you saying my gift doesn't suit this house?"



His words cut through the room like a blade, the underlying warning impossible to miss.



Caiden sprang to his feet, his face draining of color."No! Of course not! How could we ever think that?Your gift is, naturally, the best of the best!"



He knew all too well that Cedric, despite his youth,was infamous for his ruthless business acumen.



One snap decision from him could dismantle entire empires or obliterate competitors.



He wasn't someone to provoke lightly.


Standing there with an awkward, forced smile,Caiden tried to salvage the situation. But Cedric didn't even glance at him, his attention fixed coolly on his phone.



The atmosphere in the room was suffocating. Caiden  and Katrina stood rigid, while the movers exchanged uneasy glances, unsure whether to proceed or abandon the task.



The silence stretched unbearably, thick with tension,until one of the movers hesitantly broke it. "Should we keep moving?"



The question shattered the stillness, but instead of diffusing the tension, it seemed to amplify it.


Caiden's gaze darted nervously towards Cedric,whose finger had paused mid-swipe on his phone screen.That small motion alone made Caiden's throat tighten as he swallowed hard.



"Of course,we'll leave the fish tank exactly where it is,"Katrina chimed in with a saccharine smile, desperate to defuse thesituation. "But perhaps we could take a few of the other items? Just the ones that don't quite fit the decor here?"



Her greed peeked through her polished facade, unable to suppress her true intentions.


Daniela's furniture was a testament to impeccable taste. The sofa, made of solid rosewood and adorned with buttery-soft leather cushions, far surpassed anything Katrina could boast of at home.



It was only natural that she wanted to take the best pieces back with her.
As for the fish tank and Cedric's other gifts? Those could wait. Once Cedric left, she'd return to claim them.



Her plan was already clear in her mind.


"Mr. Phillips, would that be alright?" Caiden's voice was tentative, measured with caution.

Cedric,however, didn't even lift his head. His attention stayed fixed on his phone, his finger scrolling as if oblivious to the tension around him.



He neither agreed nor refused, leaving Caiden in a painfully awkward limbo.


The oppressive silence in the room grew thicker.


Then,the faint creak of a door opening upstairs broke the stillness.



Everyone except Cedric exhaled in relief.


Daniela was finally coming downstairs.



Caiden, shaken from his uneasy trance, felt a cold sweat drench his back.


For the first time, he found himself actually eager to see his biological daughter.



"Daniela," he called out, his voice uncharacteristically soft as he watched her descend the stairs. "You're finally awake!"



His tone, unusually gentle and warm, carried the practiced air of a caring father.



Years ago, Daniela had longed for even a moment like this-for her father to speak to her with such kindness.



But Caiden's tenderness had always been reserved for Joyce.Never her.


That fragile hope had withered and died long ago,buried beneath years of neglect and indifference.


Daniela descended the stairs, her expression composed and unreadable. Her gaze drifted over the scene in the living room, pausing on the movers standing uncertainly amid the disarrayed furniture.



Their uniforms, a deep green, bore the company's slogan in bold letters.



"We bring happiness back home."


The word "home" struck Daniela with a wave of bitter irony.


She hadn't known the meaning of that word in years.


Daniela's eyes roved across the room, finally settling on Cedric, whose calm demeanor stood in stark  contrast to the tense atmosphere. Then her attention shifted to the housekeeper,her swollen, tear-streaked face speaking volumes.



Her eyes gradually hardened, a shadow darkening their depths.

###Chapter 33 Daylight Robbery


The moment Daniela descended the stairs, her icy,aloof demeanor extinguished Caiden's tentative smile.


For a fleeting second, he contemplated chastising her,yet his attention diverted to Cedric, who was firmly planted in his chair.


No longer engrossed in his phone, Cedric nonetheless seemed rooted to the spot, exhibiting no signs of departure.


Concealing his iritation, Caiden managed a polite smile and turned to Cedric. "Mr. Phillips, now that Daniela has joined us, was there something particular you wished to discuss with her? Perhaps you could have a word with her first?"


With a lazy stretch, Cedric settled deeper into his seat his voice smooth and unhurried. "We're set for lunch later. There's no need to rush. You two chat-I'll stay out of the way. When you're finished, I'll take her along."


His insinuation was unmistakable: he wasn't leaving anytime soon.

Caiden,suppressing his annoyance, shot Cedric a wary glance before facing Daniela again.


A subtle yet undeniable edge of criticism colored his voice this time.


"Unbelievable, Daniela. Getting up this late? With your pathetic work ethic, it's a joke that you're even running a business."


Daniela delayed her response, instead strolling into the kitchen and serving herself a glass of milk.


With a brief glance at Katrina and then Joyce,a smile danced on her lips.


Caiden's jaw tightened. "What's so funny?"


Dressed to perfection and carrying an air of unshakable authority, Daniela returned to the living room and settled elegantly into the cushions.


"I'm laughing because I'm dying to know-what bullshit plan are you cooking up this time?" Her tone dripped with sarcasm, a subtle smirk on her lips accentuating her clear disdain.


"Daniela!" Caiden's voice hardened, his eyes narrowing with a warning edge. "Mind your words!"

 
Unfazed, Daniela retorted, "If my memory serves me right, you were the one who publicly declared our father-daughter ties cut. It was in the newspapers,wasn't it?Perhaps you've forgotten.  It's understandable,given your lovely new wife and darling daughter are now in the picture. Don't worry-I saved a screenshot of that announcement. Would you like to see it?"



Caiden's expression tensed visibly.


Undeterred, Daniela pressed on. "Since we're nothing to each other anymore,let me ask-what twisted logic made you think bringing your pathetic family into my home was okay?"


Her gaze briefly swept over to the housekeeper and then to the movers. "You've hit my staff and started seizing my possessions. So, I must ask-what is this,if not daylight robbery?"


Stepping up,Joyce interjected sharply, "Daniela, don't twist it into something terrible! We're taking your stuff because you actually matter to us!" 2


Daniela's frosty expression didn't waver as she fixed her piercing eyes on Joyce. "Oh, really? Should I applaud you for that?"


For a moment, Joyce stumbled, her composure cracking like fragile glass.


Stepping in, Katrina coaxed, "Daniela, you're being overly harsh. I understand you're hurt because your father declared he's cutting ties with you,but consider his age-he can be rash at times. Do you truly want to cling to resentment? Bonds between father and daughter aren't so easily dissolved by a mere public statement. You've been part of the Harper family for over twenty years-don't pretend you made it all on your own. Let's not ruin family ties with needless stubbornness."



Katrina was the epitome of hypocrisy-sweet on the surface,venomous underneath.


Unaware of her duplicity, Caiden absorbed only the words that suited his narrative.



He truly thought Katrina was the peacemaker of the family.


His expression hardened further, his eyes locking on Daniela with a freezing intensity.


In his eyes, she was nothing more than a spoiled brat who didn't know how to appreciate a damn thing.


Daniela, however, was no stranger to Katrina's manipulations. She lifted her hand, signaling an end to the discussion. "Stop pretending this was all some impulsive mistake. Let's face it,Dad-you couldn't wait to cut me loose, could you?"


Caiden was obsessed with his image, and the idea of eating his words, especially with Cedric watching,was utterly humiliating.



To concede a mistake in such a scenario was unthinkable.



His expression grew darker, a storm brewing in his eyes. As he parted his lips to protest, Katrina slid gracefully into the seat next to him, her fingers lightly pressing his, and whispered, "If we upset Daniela, how will we convince her to give those floors to Joyce?She's your daughter. What's the point of holding a grudge against her? After all these years of raising her,would you really want to see all your efforts go to waste?"



Caiden's jaw tightened, a visible tremor of frustration rippling through him. "Are you suggesting I should just submit to her demands now?"



With a serene smile, Katrina embodied both innocence and empathy. "She's your daughter. Is it really that demeaning to yield a little for her? But if the thought is too bitter for you, allow me to be the peacemaker."



Rising with deliberate grace, Katrina bent forward into a deep, respectful bow. "Daniela, I accept the blame for everything that has transpired. As your stepmother,I've let you down. Please, don't punish your father for my mistakes. I see youI're upset, and I want to apologize. I'm sorry. Can we move past this and focus on what's ahead?"



Her voice, soft and pleading, was laden with feigned self-abnegation. She assumed the guise of a benevolent,loving stepmother with flawless precision.


Caiden, observing this, was overwhelmed with a rush of pride and tenderness for Katrina. His heart swelled with appreciation for her display of "kindness," and he made a silent promise to himself to provide even greater support for her and Joyce in the coming days.


How could they, so innocent and righteous, livein this dangerous world without him watching over them?

###Chapter 34 Keep Dreaming
Daniela let out a sharp,icy laugh. "So, you came here to apologize? You showed up uninvited, assaulted my staff,and then,without permission, tried to strip my house bare. Is this a new kind of apology I've yet to learn about?"



Katrina opened her mouth to respond.



Turning to the movers with a cool smile, Daniela said,"I'm sorry for all the trouble you've gone through,but nothing here is leaving. Thank you for your time."


The movers exchanged uneasy glances. One of them finally stepped forward hesitantly. "We still need to cover the transportation costs. We brought a lot of people out here, so someone needs to pay for the service."



Daniela chuckled, nodding. "Of course. That's reasonable."



Her gaze snapped to Katrina, sharp and cutting. "Go on; this one's on you."



Katrina's lips twitched as she battled the surge of anger rising within her. Forcing a tight smile, she reached into her purse, pulled out a wad of cash, and  handed over ten thousand dollars. "Thank you for your time. I apologize for this little family misunderstanding. Have a safe trip back."



The movers, now satisfied, quickly packed up their equipment and left, leaving the room quiet once again.


Katrina glanced at Caiden,her expression unreadable but loaded with intent. Her eyes spoke volumes.



The furniture could wait. She needed to secure the bigger prize.



Caiden straightened. "Luxor Tower is enormous.There's no way you need all this space, Daniela. Hand over the 18th to 20th floors to your sister. And one more thing-Joyce is running a clothing store. She wants a collaboration with Elite Lux for a joint collection. Take care of it."



Before Daniela could respond, Joyce jumped in with eager enthusiasm. "Dad, I don't know much about design. Maybe Daniela could handle that part for me?"



Caiden nodded, pleased with the suggestion."Excellent idea. Daniela, take care of it. And while you're at it, renovate the floors. I stopped by your office earlier-it's impressive. Use that as inspiration.Make it just as grand. After all, you're sisters. Now that you're successful, it's your duty to look out for her."


His tone hardened, disappointment dripping from every word. "Frankly, I shouldn't have to spell this out for you. You're so inconsiderate sometimes. I can't imagine what kind of man would even want to marry you. And if anyone does, it'll only be for your money.Daniela, this is all because your mother raised you so poorly!"



Caiden's words grew increasingly cutting, his voice rising with unchecked arrogance.



Daniela remained calm, her expression serene, as though his insults barely registered. She had long since grown accustomed to her father's harsh words.



But across the room, Cedric's eyes narrowed, a dark shadow clouding his face.



When Daniela glanced at him, she noticed the storm brewing in his expression. She offered him a faint,reassuring smile.



Turning back to Caiden, Daniela spoke evenly, her voice controlled and almost gentle. "The floors? Of course. And the renovations? Why not? You're absolutely right. Now that I've done well, it's only fair to help my sister."


The moment she said this, Caiden, Katrina,and Joyce visibly relaxed. Relief washed over their faces, quickly replaced by smug satisfaction.


Daniela was still the same meek, pliable girl, too weak  to stand up for herself.


Katrina and Joyce exchanged a fleeting look of regret,realizing they could've demanded much more.



Ten floors, perhaps even more thanthat-Daniela would've agreed without a fight.


"Good," Caiden said curtly, rising to his feet, his discomfort with Cedric's oppressive presence evident.


Straightening his jacket, he turned to Daniela with his usual commanding tone.



"Start the paperwork. Transfer those floors to Joyce.And make sure the renovations use the best materials.No cutting corners-anything less will only cause problems for her down the line."


He turned to the door, ready to leave.


"Joyce?" Daniela's voice rang out, calm yet deliberate,halting him mid-step. "Dad, what exactly are you saying? You expect me to hand over the floors to Joyce and pay for her renovations? Are you joking?"


Caiden froze, his expression darkening as his face tightened. "But you just said-"


"I said I had no issue helping my sister. But you meant Joyce?Well, that's an issue. You see, I hold blood ties in the highest regard. And Joyce? She doesn't share my mother's blood. So no, I don't see her as my sister.And you want me to hand over my property to her?"



Her smile widened, though her gaze was razor-sharp."If I did that, my mother would surely curse me from her grave for being so stupid. Do you even remember my mother, Dad? When she died, she was drenched in blood. Just last night, I thought I heard her voice.She told me she had only one daughter. When you started talking about helping a sister, for a moment, I thought maybe you and my mom had another child somewhere I didn't know about. What a pity."



Caiden's face flushed with anger, his balance faltering as he staggered slightly, his fury barely contained."Your mom and I only had you! I married your stepmother, and Joyce is your sister!"


Daniela remained unruffled, her faint smile still in place. "Oh, I see now. You mean the baggage that the woman you chose brought into the family. And now you expect me to take care of it? Keep dreaming."


"Daniela!" Caiden roared, his face turning a deep,furious red. "Watch your mouth!"


His anger boiled over, his hand flying into the air,ready to strike.

 ###Chapter 35 Joyce Saw Cedric
The slap was just about to land.


Daniela frowned, ready to react, when suddenly someone stepped in front of her.


There stood Cedric, shielding her decisively



Towering and formidable,his presence sliced through the tension, exuding an undeniable command that seemed to stabilize the chaos around him.



Daniela, perplexed yet oddly reassured, remained motionless, her eyes drifting downward to notice Cedric's other hand, balled into a firm fist at his side.


Caiden's fury escalated, his hand frozen in the air,quivering with wrath as he shot a venomous look towards Cedric. "What do you think you're doing?"



Cedric returned his gaze, his eyes cold and unwavering."And what do you think you're doing?"


Caiden's voice soared in volume, tinged with defiance."I'm disciplining my own daughter. Must you meddle in this?"

At that moment, Daniela stepped from behind Cedric,her fingers lightly grasping his sleeve. She nodded towards the security camera perched above them and spoke to Caiden.



"If you're eager to make headlines tomorrow, feel free to take a swing. But I'm curious-what do you suppose the news will declare? Will it be-Elite Lux's CEO's Estranged Father Makes a Violent Entrance,Tries to Steal from His Own Daughter? Or maybe-Disgraced Father Strikes His Own Flesh and Blood in Defense of His Second Wife? And with the recent news about that fire, Dad, don't you believe this whole ordeal would be a hot topic for the media?"



Caiden felt as if he were teetering on the brink of insanity. His entire frame trembled as a raw, anguished roar escaped him. "Daniela!"


Daniela remained upright,her smile sugary and teasing."Yes,Dad?"



Caiden sensed that if he didn't exit soon,he would just burst from unrestrained anger.


"Enough! Daniela, if you choose to be this cold, this cruel, clutching at your precious wealth, then don't bother seeking my aid when you find yourself desperate one day."



Daniela waved her hand. "Of course, Dad. Be careful as you leave."



Caiden, cheeks aflame with anger, stormed out without a backward glance.



Katrina stole a quick glance at Cedric, who remained silent,standing loyally by Daniela's side.



Katrina, ever the embodiment of a graceful stepmother when others were present, softened her voice. "Daniela, such youthful innocence. You haven't yet felt the profound burdens of parenthood. With time, when you have kids, you'll see that preserving family unity is the ultimate endeavor. Riches,celebrity,and authority-they vanish like morning mist. I dearly hope you won't live to regret today's choices."



Daniela let out a playful snort, her lipscurling into an amused smile. "The prospect of motherhood isn't on my agenda this lifetime. And trust me, if I ever ventured down that path, I wouldn't follow in Caiden's footsteps. Yes, I confess-fame and power do catch my fancy. Just a heads-up, steer clear of myfinances."


Katrina's mask of composure cracked. Realizing her soft-spoken manipulations were ineffective, her face momentarily tightened in frustration before she regained her poise. After a lingering,poignant glance at Cedric, she let out a resigned sigh, turned gracefully,and made her exit.


Daniela, arms folded in mock defiance, turned her attention to Joyce, who was still planted in the same spot, obviously torn about leaving. Daniela's eyes twinkled mischievously as she teased, "Hanging around, Joyce? Not ready to make your exit? Do you fancy yourself as royalty, perhaps expecting a grand procession?"



Joyce felt the urge to walk away from Daniela's taunts,yet hesitation kept her standing still.


Cedric was still here. Leaving now could just give this woman the perfect opportunity to steal Cedric's attention. Daniela was well-versed in the art of seduction,after all.



Furthermore, Cedric had just said he had a lunch appointment with Daniela. This could also serve as an opportune moment to deepen her connections with him. She couldn't help but imagine marrying him one day.



Joyce glanced at Cedric with renewed interest. "Mr.Phillips, are you planning to head to lunch soon?Could I perhaps accompany you?"


Joyce angled her head, giving her eyelashes a flirtatious flutter, hoping to charm.


Her lips curved into a playful pout, and she implored in a sweet, coaxing tone, "Please? Can I join you for

###Chapter 36 Things Left Unsaid

Daniela shivered, a wave of goose bumps spreading across her skin.



Cedric's forehead creased, and in a sharp, icy tone,he replied,"No."


Joyce opened her mouth to argue, but before she could, Cedric's face hardened. "I have germaphobia,"he stated plainly.


Joyce stood stock-still.Her eyes immediately began to fill withtears. What was he trying to say? Was he suggesting she was dirty?


Just as Joyce was about to speak, Daniela raised her hand and pointed to the door. "Alright, time to leave.Your parents have already gone.How about you hurry up and catch up with them?"


Joyce scowled,glaring at Daniela like her eyes could scorch her.



With an angry stomp, she marched out.


As she walked away, two tears slipped down her face -tears so raw and vulnerable they would have softened the heart of any ordinary man.


But Cedric barely reacted. His frown deepened, and his attention turned back to Daniela.


Daniela looked up, locking eyes with Cedric's intense,thoughtful gaze. She smiled. "What's thematter?"


Cedric just stared at her, saying nothing. She looked as lively and glowing as she had the day they first met,but now there was something different-something that caused a faint ache in his chest.



"It's nothing, let's go," he replied.


They had lunch at an upscale restaurant. Through the whole meal, Cedric barely spoke.


His attention never strayed from Daniela.


He peeled shrimp, cracked crabs, and even cut the salmon sashimi for her.


Daniela savored the food but couldn't shake the feeling that Cedric's quietness was unusual. Something seemed to be bothering him.


After the meal, Cedric passed Daniela a plate of fruit.Smiling,she asked,"Is something bothering you today?"


Cedric handed her a slice of juicy watermelon and answered simply, "No."
Daniela nodded, choosing not to press him further.


Then, Cedric set down the damp towel, his eyes lowering for a moment.


After a brief pause, he said, "Daniela."



She turned to him, seeing the seriousness in his eyes,and hesitated.



A heavy silence hung between them.



Eventually, Daniela broke the silence. She looked away, took another bite of the watermelon, and gave a small smile. "What's going on?"



Just as Cedric opened his mouth, Daniela set her napkin down, stood up, and flashed a casual smile. "I'm full. I'll be right back," she said, heading towards the restroom.



Cedric watched her walk away, the spark in his eyes fading with each step she took.


Daniela was surprised to see Alexander waiting for her when she came out of the restroom.



She meant to walk past him without a word, but Alexander held up his hand, stopping her.


"He likes you," he said, his voice firm and certain. He was talking about Cedric.
It seemed Alexander had caught wind of something-maybe from the half-open door or the thin walls.



"If the timing had been different," he continued,"you'd know exactly what Cedric was going to say."


Daniela let out a small laugh, though her face showed a flash of irritation.



The Harper family had already stirred enough trouble,and she wasn't in the mood to deal with Alexander now.



She stopped in the hallway, standing tall in her sleek high heels, and locked eyes with Alexander.



Her voice was flat as she asked, "So what? Mr.Bennett,why does it concern you?"


Alexander's face turned serious. "It's none of my business. But I'll tell you this-Cedric has big plans.He has a reason for coming after you."



Daniela couldn't hold back another laugh at his words Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Oh really? Cedric has an agenda? And what about you? What's your plan?What makes you think you're in a position to give me advice? What part are you playing in this? Are you saying you don't have a plan?"



Without looking at him again, Daniela spun around and walked off.



Alexander stood still, his eyes cold and full of dark intent.



Fine, he thought with a bitter edge. If she couldn't see his good intentions, then she'd face the consequences when the time came. 


When Daniela stepped back into the private room,her eyes instantly found Cedric. One glance told her he had regained his usual calm demeanor.


She smiled as she approached him. "Ready to go?lf you are,let's head back."



Cedric nodded in response.



He drove Daniela home in his car, pulling up in front of her building. She thanked him before getting out of the car.


Just as she was about to walk away, Cedric called out to her.



Daniela sighed quietly to herself before turning around slowly.


By the time she did, Cedric had already gotten out of the car.



He was standing by the car, his expression more serious than usual.


"Daniela, you're smart. You must have some idea of what I want to say. I know now isn't the right moment or the right situation to say it. So for now,just think of me as an old classmate, a friend, or whatever label works for you."


He took a deep breath, his eyes steady and sincere."I just want you to know, if you ever need help-anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out to me."



After a brief pause, he continued, "And one more thing. You're a good person, Daniela. The problem isn't you-it's them. Don't be upset because of someone who doesn't deserve you."


A cold breeze swept through the street, carrying a hint of chill.


Daniela stood motionless, her long hair flowing gently in the breeze. A faint smile graced her lips-subtle,yet captivating in its charm.


It wasn't often that Cedric-the ever-composed and calculating man,renowned for his sharp strategies and icy demeanor-opened up like this. Yet here he was,speaking so openly, his words carrying genuine emotion.



"Thank you," Daniela said, her voice warm with sincerity.


"You really don't need to thank me," Cedric said almost instantly, his gaze resting on her with a hint of uncertainty. There were so many things he wanted to say,so much he wanted to do for her, but he held back, fearing he might push too far and scare her off.Finally, he just said, "If your housekeeper decides to leave, don't worry about it. I know an excellent housekeeper who's currently looking for work. I could introduce her to you tomorrow if that works for you."



Before Daniela could say anything, Cedric quickly added, "She's already searching for a job, so honestly,you'd be doing her a favor. What do you think?"



Daniela's eyes settled on the man standing opposite her.



His chiseled features and commanding presence radiated confidence and strength. But in his eyes,there was a soft hesitation, almost a fragility, as if he was bracing himself for rejection.


Daniela offered a soft, reassuring smile. "You don't need to do that." It had only been three months since her divorce, and her focus had remained firmly on her own priorities. If it had been someone else, she likely would've dismissed them without a second thought.But this was Cedric-her old classmate, the one who had always been there for her with quiet,unwavering support. How could she bring herself to hurt him?"Lillian already mentioned she has someone lined up.I'm heading upstairs now. You should head home.Drive safely,okay?"


Rejection as an adult didn't always need to be spoken.It lived in the subtle exchanges, in the silence where words didn't need to fill the space.


Daniela was certain Cedric got the message.

###Chapter 37 A Tailor-Made Housekeeper‘
Cedric braced against the biting wind, his eyes narrowing as each gust whipped across his face.


He observed Daniela gracefully advancing towards Luxor Tower,her long gown billowing at her side. The fierce wind sculpted her figure into an image of fragile elegance,isolated against the urban backdrop.


In that moment, a sharp pang of discomfort seized Cedric's heart-an acute, undeniable twinge that demanded his attention.



Pulling his phone from his pocket, he hastily dialed a number. "Ryan, it's Cedric. I need you down here."


Ryan, who had been entrenched in his efforts to overhaul the building's security system, had been deprived of sleep for several days.


Clad in his worn hoodie, he trudged downstairs,his appearance haggard under the faint lighting, his lips pale.


"What's up, Cedric?" Ryan queried,his voice weary and raspy. Cedric's eyes remained fixed on the 25th floor,illuminated by the light in Daniela's room.


Catching Cedric's concerned look, Ryan retrieved a lollipop from his pocket, unwrapping it and placing it in his mouth. "Didn't you just see her off to her room?What's the worry now?"


Cedric replied, "She's not happy."


Ryan swiveled towards him, his expression etched with confusion."Really?"


To Ryan, understanding human emotions was a puzzle with no clear solution, endlessly complex.


Pressing his lips tightly, Cedric made a request. "I have a housekeeper to look after Daniela. Help me with the arrangement."


Ryan opened his mouth to respond, but Cedric quickly added,"She's refused me."


A crease formed on Ryan's brow. "Why?"


Cedric replied, "She told me Lillian would handle it.I need you to hack into Lillian's computer and ensure the right person is chosen. I'll take care of everything else."



Cedric envisioned a future encounter with the Harper family, where the housekeeper would not merely stand there, tear-stricken and defenseless.



The mere thought stirred a wave of discomfort within him. He knew he wouldn't findpeace until the matter was settled.



With a confident nod, Ryan replied, "Understood.Don't worry, Cedric. I'll handle it to perfection."


After exchanging a few more remarks, Ryan made his way back upstairs. Meanwhile, Cedric leaned back to gaze once more at the 25th floor, catching the moment Daniela's lights dimmed.


Daniela felt no urgency to employ a housekeeper.


Over the decade dedicated to winning Alexander's heart,she had honed her self-reliance to an art form.Her domestic prowess was unmatched, maintaining her home in impeccable order.


Alexander, ever particular about his meals, had prompted Daniela to seek culinary skills from various esteemed chefs.



Eventually, Alexander found her cooking beyond reproach.Although he was sparing with his praises, he would occasionally let slip a rare word of appreciation.


Consequently, Daniela saw no immediate need to recruit additional help. She had delegated the task to Lillian but stressed that there was no need to hurry.


After all, Joyce's disruptive antics weren't going to cease any time soon. Hiring someone too soft-spoken or gentle might only lead them to be overwhelmed by bullying.


Yet, Daniela hadn't anticipated the rapid pace at which events would unfold.



The next morning, as the sunlight peeked through her curtains, Daniela's first sight was Lillian, standing beside her bed with a wide, infectious smile. "l've found you a housekeeper!"



Daniela's eyes flickered open, a fog of sleep clouding her thoughts.



That fast?



It hadn't even been...


She cast a quick glance at the clock on her bedside table.



Not even ten hours had passed.



With a smirk, Lillian added, "I hopped online early this morning to scout for a housekeeper, and guess what?The perfect candidate was just there, waiting to be found. She's exceptional-skilled in all aspects of housework. She can whip up specialty dishes from across the globe. And that's not all-she's fluent in five languages and has a knack for childcare. Should you decide to have children one day, she's fully equipped to manage it all!"



Daniela couldn't help but be impressed; the woman sounded almost too good to be true.



Beaming with enthusiasm, Lillian added, "I've already invited her over for a trial run-she's actually waiting for us downstairs."



With a mix of curiosity and intrigue, Daniela followed Lillian down the staircase.



"Hello, Ms. Harper. My name is Josie Maynard,but please,call me Josie. I'm here to look after all your household needs. Should you have any specific requests, feel free to let me know," Josie Maynard stated with a warm, welcoming smile.


Daniela gazed at Josie-a middle-aged woman,slightly rounded with a welcoming, kind air that made her seem instantly familiar.


"Have we met before?" Daniela asked.



Josie, her hands clasped before her, maintained her gentle smile. "You can't be serious! I simply possess an ordinary face. What are the chances someone like me would ever cross paths with you?"

As the words left her lips, Josie's eyes flickered towards Daniela, her smile deepening with a subtle but undeniable reverence.



Truly, Daniela was a sight to behold. A vision, almost ethereal, that could easily captivate anyone's attention, including Cedric's.



"Miss Harper, I've prepared some sandwiches for you this morning and squeezed some fresh juice. I had to make do since my arrival was rather rushed, but I plan to shop later. Please, tell me your preferences for tomorrow's meals, and I'll ensure everythingis to your liking."


Daniela wasn't usually one for breakfast, her appetite seldom stirring in the early hours, but Josie's culinary skills were irresistible.



The sandwiches looked delicious, and the juice was fresh.



Once Daniela had finished her breakfast, Josie placed a shawl around her shoulders. "The mornings carry a bit of a chill. Don't forget to look after yourself."


With her characteristic smile beaming, Josie then seized a compact shopping cart and set off to purchase groceries.  


From the doorway, Lillian observed her departure, her  expression radiant with pride.


Josie was a remarkably considerate soul, seemingly crafted perfectly to complement Daniela's needs.
###Chapter 38 A Perfect Match
As Josie headed off, Daniela felt a strange sense of recognition, like she'd seen Josie in another time or place but couldn't quite pin it down.



After Josie was out of sight, Daniela turned to Lillian with a thoughtful look. "She's really sweet, but I have this feeling things could get messy later. When she returns, let her know-if anyone from the Harper family shows up, she needs to stay out of it. I don't want her caught up in their trouble or getting hurt."



Even though Daniela had paid the former housekeeper $10, 000 to cover medical costs,the whole incident still lingered heavily on her mind.


The idea of an elderly woman being slapped by Joyce was something she just couldn't come to terms with.



The mere thought of it left Daniela feeling uneasy and weighed down by guilt.


Lillian still couldn't erase the image of the old housekeeper's face,puffed up like a balloon when she walked out. She had cursed Joyce under her breath for what she had done. After her pointless visit to Daniela, Joyce was seething with frustration.



She stormed off to Caiden, tears streaming as she vented about how badly Daniela had treated her. But Caiden brushed her off with a careless wave. "Don't waste your time on that crazy woman. So what if she's got some money now? Do you really think she can break away from her family? Let's see if she dares to get married without me, her father, escorting her down the aisle!"  



Without her family backing her up, people would surely look down on her.


Sooner or later, she'd have to swallow her pride and come running back to him for help.



Caiden's self-assurance didn't waver. Joyce sulked and turned to Katrina, silently asking for her take on the matter.



Katrina just shook her head slightly, saying nothing.


Later, when it was just the two of them, Joyce couldn't keep her frustration bottled up. "Mom, why can't I ask him to defend me? Did you see how arrogant Daniela was yesterday? I was so mad l thought I'd explode!"



Katrina, ever calm, sat on the patio and poured herself a cup of coffee. "Honey, you're grown up now. You've got to think beyond just the moment. Do you see what I mean?"



Joyce stared at Katrina, her expression a mix of confusion and curiosity.



"Let me tell you two important things today. First,remember this: in every family, the man is the anchor.If you can win over the man in charge, the whole house will fall in line. At the moment, Caiden has no influence over Daniela. If you force him to confront her now, it'll just blow up in our faces. Be patient.When the timing is right, we'll make sure their father -daughter bond is broken beyond repair."



Joyce hung on to every word, nodding intently."And what's the second thing?" she asked curiously.


"Second, no matter how far a woman climbs in her career, she'll always find her way back to her family.Take Daniela, for instance-she looks all tough and self-reliant now, but let's not forget how she used to hang on Alexander's every word."



Joyce blinked,puzzled."And what about that?"



Katrina gave a warm smile and patted Joyce on the head. "Have you decided wwhat you really want? Is it Alexander or Cedric this time?"

Joyce's cheeks flushed pink, and she ducked her head with a shy smile. "Before, it was Alexander."



Katrina's smile deepened, understanding instantly."Your ambition is admirable, and that's a great thing.Cedric is a catch-l'd love to see him as my son-in-law. But listen, don't toss Alexander aside just yet. Life is unpredictable, and you should always keep a safety net. If things go south, you'll still have choices. Do you get what I'm saying?"


Joyce's face lit up, and she nodded eagerly.


Katrina carried on, her tone calm but decisive. "And another thing-don't waste your energy fretting over those few floors in Luxor Tower. If Daniela won't hand them over,who cares? Once you have Cedric, you'll have everything you could ever need. When you were born, I had your fortune read, remember? My love,you're fated to marry into wealth. Your life is meant to be dripping in luxury."



Joyce's spirits soared at her mother's words, and she threw her arms around Katrina. "But, Mom, what am l supposed to do? Cedric barely notices me."


Katrina smiled indulgently, tucking a stray strand of hair behind Joyce's ear. "I've kept your father under my thumb for years. All you need is the right move,and I guarantee Cedric won't be able to say no."


Katrina leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper as she shared a few secretive words.


Joyce's eyes went wide with surprise, and her cheeks turned a deep shade of pink.



Once her chat with Joyce was done, Katrina wandered into the living room and lounged against Caiden's chest.


"Caiden, I was just having a chat with Joyce. I told her that if Daniela doesn't want to hand over those floors,it's okay. At the end of the day, we're family,and it's not worth upsetting the peace over something so small."



Caiden,his eyes glued to the financial news on the TV,absentmindedly ran his hand over Katrina's cheek."You're the reasonable one. Not like that worthless brat,Daniela."



Katrina's lips curved into a smug smile, hidden from Caiden's view. Resting her hand lightly on his chest,she spoke in a soft, affectionate voice. "Joyce is a grown woman now. Don't you think it's about time we found her a suitable match? If she marries soon, she could start growing our family right away."


Caiden looked down at Katrina when he heard this.



She tilted her head a bit, her eyes shining with love and care.

Swayed by her gentle words and devoted look, Caiden pulled her closer into his embrace.



Katrina's lips curled into a slow, victorious smile.Winning over men came as naturally to her as breathing.


As Caiden leaned in, Katrina's voice broke the moment. "Cedric would be a perfect match for Joyce."


Caiden stopped in his tracks, his lips barely a breath away from hers. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 39 Rather Daniela Than Joyce
As soon as Katrina spoke Cedric's name, a chill ran down Caiden's spine, his body stiffening instinctively.


The familiar wave of dread and pressure flooded him,quickly sweeping away any thoughts or desires he'd felt just moments ago.


"Who did you just say?" Caiden's voice was full of disbelief as he stared at Katrina.



Katrina frowned, her confusion clear. "Cedric," she said again.


Caiden stared at her as if she had lost her mind."Cedric? You want him as your son-in-law? Are you kidding? Do you even know who he is?"


"What do you mean?" Katrina asked, still bewildered."Isn't he the CEO of Phillips Group? The golden bachelor, one of the brightest new stars in the business world?"



She gestured towards the TV, where Cedric's face appeared on the financial news. "See, even the news says it-he's a standout among his peers. Handsome,decisive, a real up-and-comer."

Caiden closed his eyes for a moment, trying to steady himself. "Yes, all of that's true."


Katrina smiled, her gaze expectant as she waited for his response.



"But did you know he's only 25?" Caiden asked.


Katrina blinked, her confusion deepening. "What's wrong with being 25?"



"What's wrong? He's 25 and already a powerhouse.His personal fortune is worth tens of millions. Tell me,how many 25-year-olds in this country have done that? Most of his peers, the kids from rich families, are still wasting their parents' money, racing cars, partying,and living aimlessly!"



"Exactly," Katrina exclaimed,gaining more confidence."It just proves how driven and capable he is."


Caiden slapped his forehead in frustration. "Yes, he's driven and skilled. But do you really think that's enough to make it in the ruthless business world?Cedric has no family to back him up or safety net to fall on. Everything he has, he fought hard for, enduring endless challenges. The business world is full of predators, yet he's not just surviving-he's thriving. Do you think he's someone who lets emotions affect his decisions? Joyce is sweet, but so incredibly naive. Her greatest pleasure is competing with Daniela over trivial nonsense. Do you think someone like that is cut out to be Cedric's wife? Just look at how cold he was to her yesterday. Cedric doesn't waste his time on people who lack substance or intelligence."


Katrina was stunned by Caiden's words. "What are you suggesting then? Are you saying Joyce is stupid?"


Not only did Caiden think Joyce was lacking, but he didn't think much of Katrina either.



His first wife, Daniela's mother, had been too sharp,too calculating, and it had made him feel trapped.After her death, he had intentionally chosen someone like Katrina-a woman who knew how to flatter him and lean on him completely.


His difficult relationship with Daniela? That was because she was just like her mother-too intelligent for her own good.


And now, he believed he had been right all along.


Daniela's success now was proof of how smart she truly was.



"Joyce doesn't have a chance with Cedric. Even when it comes to looks, she's no competition for Daniela.If we're truly thinking of pairing one of our daughters with Cedric, Daniela would be the better choice."



Daniela at least had the intelligence to match Cedric's ambitions.



Caiden's words were blunt, but they struck Katrina like a lightning bolt. So this was his true opinion of her and her daughter.



Katrina walked out of the room, feeling stunned and her thoughts racing. When she stepped outside,she saw Joyce standing there, tears running down her cheeks.She had heard everything.


"Sweetheart, don't cry. If your father won't help, we'll fight for our own happiness. We don't need anyone else. But don't forget about Alexander. He even left Daniela for you. He might be a good backup if things don't work out with Cedric."


Joyce,hearing this, only felt more frustrated."Really?But it seems like the Bennett family isn't as interested in me anymore. The last fewN times I saw Richard, he was distant and cold. It felt like he didn't want me to be his future daughter-in-law anymore."


Her hands tightened into fists, and her eyes burned with anger. "This is all Daniela's fault. If it weren't for her,I'd be the one Alexander is crazy about. Cedric would pay attention to me too. It's all because of that horrible woman!"

###Chapter 40 Get Your Sister Out
Joyce stepped out, and Caiden caught a glimpse of her swollen, red eyes, though he didn't utter a single word.


As soon as the door clicked shut, he whipped around to face Katrina, a frown twisting his face.


"Just look at her! She's got her emotions all over her face for everyone to see. How is she even supposed to deal with someone like Cedric? He's arrogant,cold,and ruthless. He needs someone sharp, someone who can match him. Not Joyce-she's too simple-minded.You're her mother. You should know her better than anyone. Tell her to let go of this ridiculous idea before she embarrasses herself."



Katrina felt a spark of anger flare inside her, but all she could do was let out a soft whimper in reply.


Joyce hadn't walked far. She stood still, hearing every word Caiden had said. Her face hardened with fury,and her resentment for Daniela grew even stronger.







Daniela was about to sign a contract when her phone buzzed,pulling her attention away.



"Miss Harper, there's been some trouble at the concert hall. A group of disruptive people came in,bought tickets, but didn't even bother to watch the show. Instead, they caused a scene, shouting and disturbing everyone. We were about to call the authorities, but the leader said she was your sister.We didn't want to stir things up, so we let them go."


Daniela froze, her pen hovering mid-air above the contract. "Was there any damage to the hall?"


The manager hesitated, clearly unsure how to approach it.





"Send me a list of what's broken, and I'll take care of it," Daniela added.






A few minutes later, her phone buzzed with a message detailing the damages.





It was a long list: fifty broken chairs, three damaged cellos, two ruined microphones, and six shredded music scores.


Daniela skimmed the list, only to receive another message from the hall manager. "Miss Harper, I hate to trouble you, but I checked the reservations for tonight.The same group has booked seats again. They say they're your family, and I'm not sure how to handle it." The hall manager was no rookie when it came to dealing with trouble. With his connections on both sides of the law, a rowdy crowd wouldn't usually faze him. But since they were supposedly linked to Daniela,he'd held off on taking action.



"Refund their tickets," Daniela instructed. "Close the hall for tonight. I'll take care of this myself."


"Got it," the manager replied without hesitation.



With Elite Lux freshly relocated back to the country,Daniela had been swamped with work. She'd planned to take care of the concert hall situation in a few days.


That evening, however, Daniela received another call,this time from the auction house.



"Miss Harper, Joyce Holt attended the auction today,and she made outrageous bids on almost everything.But when it came time to pay, she refused. We were on the verge of calling the police, but she claimed to be your sister. We're unsure how to proceed. What do you want us to do?"



Daniela's brow furrowed as frustration took over.Without a second thought, she replied, "Call the police."


That evening, Daniela had just gotten home and was on her way upstairs to relax when loud, angry knocking on the door broke the silence.


Josie moved towards the door to open it.


Before she had a chance to even speak, Katrina barged in, her hand held high as she charged past Josie.



"Daniela! How could you be so cruel and heartless? Is it really necessary to ruin Joyce's life like this?"


Daniela, worried her new housekeeper might get dragged into the chaos, shot Josie a quick glance,silently urging her to stay behind her. It was only then that she finally turned her attention to the uninvited visitors.



Katrina was at the front,with Caiden right behind her,and Alexander lingering at the back.


Before steppinng into the room, Caiden scanned the space, only relaxing once he was sure Daniela was alone.


He straightened up, adopting a forced air of authority."Daniela, how long do you plan to drag this out?"



Daniela's face remained impassive as her eyes scanned the group. A small, bitter laugh escaped her lips, laced with sarcasm. "So, you storm into my house,stand here in my space, and then question me about how long I'm going to keep this up? Don't you think that's a bit much?"


Katrina broke down into tears, wailing with exaggerated sorrow. "Daniela, the police called us.They said it was your people who reported Joyce.That's your sister! How could you be so heartless?"


Through her sobs, Katrina turned to Alexander."Alexander, do you see it now? Do you see how cruel Daniela is? Thank God you divorced her! Can you imagine the kind of chaos she would've caused your family if you'd stayed with her?"


Daniela spoke in a steady, measured tone, her face showing no emotion. "She showed up at the auction,placed bids on just about everything, and then refused to pay for any of it. She's the one who caused this whole situation. So tell me, how is that my problem?"


"This is your domain! So what if your sister wanted to get a few things? Isn't it just natural for sisters to share every now and then? You're being ridiculous,Daniela!Calling the cops on your own sister? Do you have any shame at all?" Katrina shot back, her voice growing louder with anger.



Daniela let out a mocking laugh. "Share a few things?Joyce didn't bid on just a few items. She went for over 20 high-end pieces. The total was $230 million.If that's what she expects from me, I simply can't do it.But since you're so willing to help, why don't you cover it? As her mother, isn't it your job to take care of her?"



Her words, a quick comeback that mirrored Katrina's,left her completely at a loss for words.


Katrina stiffened, her face flushing as she searched for something to say.


Caiden's frown deepened further. He wasn't interested in the back-and-forth or the details of who was right.


He interrupted the tension in a sharp,commanding voice. "Daniela, it's late. Enough of this! Call the police and get your sister out."


Daniela responded flatly, "I won't."


Caiden's eyes went wide with shock. "What did you say? You ungrateful little brat!"


His anger flared up, and, like usual when he couldn't win an argument, his hand shot up, poised to hit her.


Daniela had dealt with this enough times. She instinctively stepped back, bracing herself to dodge the blow.



But just before his hand could land, another hand reached out from behind her, gripping Caiden's wrist with a vice-like hold.

"Ah!" Caiden screamed, his face twisting in agony as a sharp, burning pain shot up his wrist. "Let go! Let go!Let me go!" 
###Chapter 41 A Gold Digger





Daniela was taken aback. The new housekeeper,Josie, had an unexpectedly firm hold.


In a single fluid motion, Josie yanked Daniela behind her. She placed one hand on her hip and pointed at Caiden with the other. "You call yourself a father?How can you be so unreasonable? Joyce is your daughter, but Daniela isn't? Where's your sense of logic? Joyce misbehaved, so why are you taking it out on Daniela? Look at you, always trying to play the peacemaker but doing it in the worst way possible. Is this what being a father is all about? No wonder kids are so ungrateful these days. After all, it's parents like you who create them!"



As soon as Josie began speaking, Caiden stepped back, his fists clenched tightly.


Katrina moved forward, but Josie shot her a sharp,accusing look. "And you must be the stepmother, right? You brought Joyce into the Harper family,didn't you?"


Katrina stood frozen, her gaze fixed in disbelief on Josie's pointing finger. Still in a daze, she nodded, as though she were swept away by the force of Josie's words.


"So you're actually agreeing with me? Let me set the record straight. This is the true daughter of the Harper family. And yet, you've moved into her home and act like you own the place? Who do you think you are? The Harper family fortune isn't just Caiden's to claim. It was his first wife who single-handedly kept their business thriving. Everyone knows that.Now that Daniela's mother is gone, you're here to cash in? Do you have no shame? And as if reaping the rewards wasn't enough, you have the gall to push your luck?"



Katrina had been married to Caiden for years, and in all those years, no one had ever spoken to her like that. Today, being confronted so boldly left her completely stunned and without words. 
For what felt like an eternity, she simply stood there,staring at Josie, whose imposing figure stood guard in front of Daniela.


"You're bullying Daniela like this. Aren't you scared her mother will come back to haunt you in your dreams?" Josie's voice dropped to a chilling tone as her wide eyes gleamed with a dangerous light.


Just hearing Daniela's mother's name, whose tragic death still lingered in Katrina's memory, made a cold shiver run down her back.



Without sparing them another look, Josie stormed over to the door and threw it wide open. "Out! If you don't leave immediately, I'll call the cops. Let's see how you handle the humiliation!"


Grabbing a broom, she began pushing them towards the door. By the time Lillian stepped off the elevator,she was met with the sight of Katrina's face,streaked with tears.


Alexander hesitated for a moment, and just as the door was closing, he turned back to face Daniela. "Daniela, now that you've got the upper hand,it's time to show some forgiveness. You've gone too far today." 


Daniela let out a bitter laugh. "Really? Now that things have flipped, you're all about mercy? Where was your mercy when I was in the hospital with a broken rib, wrongly accused by everyone? Back then,not a single person stood up for me."


Alexander's brow furrowed. "That's all behind us now." 


Daniela nodded in agreement. "Exactly, it's all in the past. And tonight will be just another part of that.What's the matter? Can't handle it wvhen it's turned on you? Mr. Bennett, stop being such a hypocrite."


With that, she slammed the door shut, the sound echoing through the hallway.


The three of them standing outside flinched as one,their eyes wide with disbelief as they stared at the closed door. After being thrown out of Daniela's home, Caiden had no option but to settle the bill for the auctioned items.


Tens of millions vanished in the blink of an eye.


On the drive back, Caiden's face was clouded with anger.


In the car, Joyce cried uncontrollably, her voice thick with emotion. "It's all Daniela's fault! She actually had the police called on me! Mom, you have no idea how scary it was in there. I was locked in that room all by myself. My legs won't stop shaking, and my hands are still ice cold!"


Katrina's heart shattered for her daughter.


When they arrived home, Katrina comforted Joyce and helped her to her room. Once Joyce was settled,Katrina crawled into bed, burying her face in the covers as she cried.


Caiden, on the other hand, was seething with frustration.


Daniela's mother had been a sharp businesswoman,amassing a fortune that she left behind. But now that she was gone, all that was left was her inheritance.


Caiden, on the other hand, had never been good with money-he'd lost a lot in failed investments early on and was barely managing to keep things going. If they kept spending like they were, what would they have left to live on down the road?



Dropping tens of millions today felt like a sharp blow to his chest.


In frustration, he snapped at Katrina, "Tell Joyce to stop provoking Daniela!"


Katrina stiffened, taken aback by the harshness in his voice. A moment later, she curled up tighter in the bed, burying her face in the sheets as her sobs grew louder.


"It's all my fault! Everyone always says being a stepmother is tough, and now I truly understand just how hard it is. When I married you,I promised myself I'd treat Daniela like my own daughter. I even swore l wouldn't have kids of my own just to make her happy.And now, look at me! I'm getting older, I can't have children anymore, and Daniela still treats me like I'm nothing. Did you hear what her staff said today?She called Daniela the true daughter of the Harper family and accused me of being a gold digger! What have I done to deserve this? I loved you, trusted you, and chose to marry you. I don't care about the pain l've gone through, but now my daughter, Joyce, has to suffer too. People are judging her because of me!Maybe I should just disappear!"


Caiden's heart softened the moment he heard her words. He pulled Katrina into an embrace and kissed her gently as he soothed her.


"I can't let our daughter go through this. Get Daniela to give those floors of the Luxor Tower to you. How could I ever face Joyce otherwise?" Katrina wiped her eyes, then moved closer, leaning against his chest, which lit a spark in Caiden.

He kissed her passionately, completely caught up in the intensity of the moment. "Okay, I'lI handle it.".


It was only then that Katrina used her charm, making sure Caiden was completely satisfied.


###Chapter 42 Why Did You Divorce Daniela For Joyce
Caiden rested against the headboard, a wave of regret washing over him.


He couldn't understand how Daniela had become so strong-willed and unbending.


More and more, her personality reminded him of her late mother.

Every time he laid eyes on Daniela, it felt like he was face-to-face with her mother.

The sweet, gentle girl who once followed Alexander around was nowhere to be found now.


He was aware that Katrina wouldn't let it go unless Daniela gave him the three floors of the Luxor Tower.


Caiden lit a cigarette, stepped out onto the balcony,and dialed Alexander's number.  "Hey, Alexander. Are you free tomorrow?"


Alexander, still at work, responded, "What's up?"


"There's a charity gala tomorrow night. Do you have time to attend? I'd like you to take Joyce along to help her expand her horizons."


There was a brief pause on the other end of the line before Alexander answered, "Sure."②


Just as Alexander was about to hang up, Caiden added, "You and Daniela were married. I noticed her name on the guest list for tomorrow night. Joyce is being stubborn about those floors in Luxor Tower.You remember how Daniela used to listen to you,right? Maybe you could talk to her."


Alexander paused, his grip tightening on the phone."She doesn't listen to me anymore."


Caiden chuckled softly. "She used to listen to you,didn't she? I know things were a bit rocky between you two, but let's be real-you're planning on marrying Joyce, right? That makes me your future father-in-law. We're practically family now, so how about doing me this small favor? It won't take much,just a few words, really. I'm counting on you here."


Before Alexander could get a word in, Caiden hung up the phone.


Richard, sitting in Alexander's office, sneered. "That old fox is too clever for his own good."


Alexander recalled Daniela's cold, indifferent expression from the night before. "She won't agree,"he muttered to Richard.


Richard waved it off. "Let Caiden handle it. Don't offend Daniela because of Katrina. By the way, have you heard? Daniela just got her hands on that biggest piece of land in the North District-the one nobody else dared to go after."


Alexander looked up, his eyes wide with surprise.


Richard gave a thumbs-up. "I'll give her credit. That land is a goldmine, but the seller wats full payment upfront. Everyone was eyeing it, but no one had the nerve or resources to take it on. And Daniela just swooped in and grabbed it like it was nothing.Alexander, our family's in the renovation and construction business. You're going to the gala tomorrow, right? Make sure you land the renovation contract for that property. First, it'll help rebuild a connection with Daniela. Second, it's a huge project that could bring in a fortune for us. And third, it'll relieve some of the pressure on our company next year."



Alexander was reluctant. The idea of trying to win Daniela over for money didn't sit right with him.He had tried to talk to her a few times lately,but each time, she ignored him completely.


He was proud, and begging was never on his list of things to do.


Just last night, he had tried to offer her some advice,only for her to snap at him and shut him out entirely.


Where was the Daniela who once cared for him?


Even if she was playing hard to get, this was crossing  the line.



But with his father pushing him, he figured he'd give her one last chance.



With a cold look, Alexander responded to Richard,"Fine."







The next day, Alexander stepped out in a sharp new suit that looked like it was made just for him.



When Joyce arrived, her eyes widened, and she couldn't hold back a gasp. "Wow! Alexander, you look absolutely stunning today!"


The tailored suit made a real impact. Her eyes were drawn to his broad chest, and admiration lit up her face.


In that moment, she couldn't help but think that Alexander was everything she could ever want.


As for Cedric? She decided he could stay with Daniela, that cold, toxic woman. Joyce rode with Alexander to the gala. On the way there, she leaned in and spoke softly. "Alexander,thank you for bringing me tonight. I know it's tough for you. Daniela is such a difficuIt person. To thank you for your kindness, I'm willing to marry..."


Her words trailed off suddenly as the car came to a stop at the entrance of the gala.


Her gaze landed on a man standing near the door,and her breath caught in her throat.



He was a real catch!



Her eyes lit up, practically glowing with excitement.


Cedric looked nothing like the man she remembered.


Tonight, he was a vision of sophistication in a custom-tailored dark blue suit, with a refined sapphire brooch pinned to his chest and matching gemstone cufflinks gleaming at his wrists. The entire outfit seemed made just for him, enhancing his already tall, striking figure and radiating an air of elegance and class that made him look even more impressive.


Callum was always handsome. 


Incredibly handsome.


Unlike most men, he had a royal quality about him-a natural, commanding presence that made him stand out effortlessly. Every mnove he made seemed to capture attention, as if he were the center of everything.


Whatever Joyce had planned to say to Alexander was quickly forgotten. Without saying another word, she swung open the car door, grabbed her dress,and nearly ran towards Cedric.


The driver, observing everything unfold, couldn't help but glance at Alexander and mnutter, "Sir,honestly, Joyce isn't worth you giving up Daniela for."


At least Daniela wouldn't fall for another the moment a better option came along.


She wouldn't fawn over other men. It was painfully clear what had just happened. Only moments earlier, Joyce had been hinting that she wanted to marry Alexander. But the second she saw Cedric, she completely forgot the idea and rushed towards him.



Her shallow, opportunistic nature mirrored Katrina's all too well.


Like mother, like daughter.


Alexander's voice was steady, almost indifferent."I never liked Joyce."


The driver, surprised by his response, turned to him in disbelief and asked, "Then why did you divorce Daniela for her?"

###Chapter 43 Daniela Ignored Him




"So, why'd you divorce Daniela for Joyce?" Keith,who was also at the gala, couldn't help but ask Alexander the same burning question.


Alexander's face remained icy as he scanned the room, his eyes briefly glancing over the elegant women chatting and laughing. iN a calm but distant  tone, he said, "I never meant to divorce her." 


"What?" Keith turned to face him, clearly stunned.


"It was her choice," Alexander explained. "She sent me the divorce agreement. She pushed to have everything finalized. From beginning to end, I never once brought up the idea of getting a divorce.But since that's what she wanted, I just gave her what she asked for." 


Keith stood there, stunned into silence for a moment before finally blurting out, "Wait! So you're saying you were the one who got dumped?"
The words caused Alexander's face to darken further.


Keith pressed on, "Honestly, with your temper,I'm not surprised she couldn't take it anymore."


Alexander let out a bitter snort.


He had always been this way when Daniela first met him. If she couldn't handle him now, it just meant she didn't love him enough.



The issue wasn't with him-it was Daniela. She needed to look at herself and figure out what went wrong. 


Keith seemed ready to speak again, but suddenly a commotion erupted near the entrance, capturing everyone's attention.


Alexander raised his gaze, but the crowd near the door was too thick for him to see anything.


Instead, all he could hear were excited voices echoing through the room.
"Wow! She's breathtaking!"



"Is that another limited-edition Elite Lux gown? It's absolutely stunning!"


"Daniela sure knows how to make an entrance-every time, it's something different."


"With a body like hers, who wouldn't look incredible?"


"She's got all the right curves-perfect waist, long legs! The guy who dates her is the luckiest man on earth."



"Seriously, is Alexander blind? He chose Joyce over Daniela? That's just funny!"



Alexander's expression darkened even more. In a quiet, almost bitter tone, he muttered, "How amazing could she really/be? Elite Lux couture is just..."


Before he could finish his sentence, the crowd parted, and Daniela appeared at the entrance.


Alexander's eyes went wide in disbelief.

Was that Daniela? It was the same face, but something was unmistakably different.


She was draped in an elegant, flowing gown of deep blue that clung to her curves perfectly. One shoulder was exposed, her flawless skin glowing under the soft lighting. Standing tall in dazzling crystal heels,she radiated an undeniable confidence, embodying the very essence of the evening's queen.


Daniela had always been stunning, but tonight, she was absolutely mesmerizing. Her eyes, naturally entrancing, carried a hint of allure. When she smiled,the dimples at the corners of her mouth deepened,making her all the more enchanting.


For a brief moment, it felt like the room dimmed. All the noise and color seemed to fade away,leaving only Daniela, who dominated the spotlight.


She glowed with elegance, her pearl earrings swaying delicately as she moved through the crowd with effortless grace.


Alexander's gaze followed her every step as she made her way towards him.


Keith, full of excitement, nudged Alexander's elbow and whispered with enthusiasm, "Here she comes!See? I told you she still has feelings for you.Alexander, your charm is unmatched."


Alexander kept his expression unreadable, but inside,his heart was racing in a way he hadn't felt in years.


He had already thought it over. If Daniela showed even a hint of remorse, he'd consider forgiving her.


But then, Daniela spoke. "Lillian."


That one word shattered all the hope Alexander had been clinging to.


Keith froze, momentarily taken aback, before glancing at Alexander. His face had darkened so intensely that it seemed like a storm was on the verge of erupting.


Keith couldn't hold back his laughter. "Alexander,don't tell me you thought she was coming over here for you? This is too funny!"

Keith was practically shaking with amusement. 


Alexander, who was usually so composed and confident, was now being completely disregarded by the same woman who once chased after him.



When Daniela had been obsessed with him,constantly accommodating his every whim, people mocked her for being desperate, but secretly, many envied Alexander.



He had soaked in that admiration, his confidence reaching new heights.


Now, watching him so blatantly ignored, Keith felt a sense of smug satisfaction.


Alexander, however, paid no attention to Keith's laughter. He relaxed in his chair, grabbed his phone,and started scrolling, his face blank and hard to read.


The night went on, but Daniela never once glanced in his direction, let alone made an effort to approach him. Alexander, on his part, wasn't about to go to her either.
As the gala neared its end, his pent-up anger was at a breaking point.


But with no way to release it, he simply sat there in silence until the event finally came to an end.
###Chapter 44 How Rude




Joyce couldn't keep her frustration in check any longer.


The gala was almost over, and Alexander still hadn't made a move to talk to Daniela.


Although she didn't care much for Daniela, she was very interested in the building Daniela owned.


She sat next to Alexander, her voice filled with jealousy. "Alexander, look at Daniela acting so superior, just because she has money. She's strutting around like she's the queen of the world with all those men around her."


Joyce meant to mock Daniela, but her words sounded incredibly bitter instead.


Even Keith, who was nearby, couldn't hold back a laugh. "If you had the talent, you could act just as confident."
Joyce pouted, her face flushed with anger, but the truth of his words left her momentarily speechless.Swallowing her irritation, she silently directed all the blame at Daniela for the embarrassment she felt.


Ignoring Keith, she turned to Alexander and pleaded,"When are you going to talk to Daniela? My boutique's been shut down for weeks now. The stock's going bad in storage! I'm losing a fortune.I need that prime spot to open up again."


Keith stared at Joyce in disbelief. "Are you serious?You've got the audacity to ask her for that? Forget everything else for a moment-didn't you already ruin Daniela andAlexander's wedding? And now, you're asking her for a shop space? I never realized you could be this shameless."
Joyce's face turned bright red with fury. She put her hands on her hips and shot back, "What's it to you?Get out of here!" Her voice was cutting, and she glared at Keith like she could tear him apart.


Keith rolled his eyes and stood up, shaking his head in disbelief. Before walking away, he leaned down close to Alexander and muttered, "Alexander,your taste in women is awful. You gave up Daniela for this?You've really made a huge mistake."


With that, he turned and walked off, leaving Alexander sitting there, his expression dark and full of frustration.


"Alexander," Joyce said, her voice softening as she put on a pleading look. "I know Daniela can't stand me, but I really need this space. Can you talk to her?She always listens to you. If you ask, she'll definitely say yes.Please!"


Alexander's eyes drifted to Daniela, standing off to the side, surrounded by admirers. After a long moment of hesitation, he said coldly, "Fine."


Just as the gala was wrapping up and Daniela was about to leave, a voice suddenly called out to her.


She turned around to see Alexander and Joyce approaching her.


Alexander wore a serious look, while Joyce walked with her head held high. To anyone watching, it would almost look like Daniela owed them everything.


Without a word, Alexander led Joyce forward.


Daniela stayed calm, saying nothing as she locked her eyes on them.


For some reason, the cold indifference in her expression sparked an immediate irritation in Alexander.


There was a time when Daniela had followed him around, hanging on every word, always eager to please. But now, the roles had reversed, and she couldn't even be bothered to mask her impatience with him.


Joyce, unable to stay quiet any longer, spoke up."Daniela, Alexander wants to talk to you."

Daniela stood tall with an air of grace. Even with her aloof exp ression, her beauty was impossible to ignore. She raised her hand, signaling him. "Go ahead."


Alexander's face grew even more tense.


This was the new Daniela-distant and unreachable.Her attitude was beginning to wear on him.


If she was going to act like this, he wasn't about to make things easier for her.


He definitely wasn't going to put himself out to help her with the city redevelopment project his father had spoken about.


No construction company in Olisvine could rival the Bennett family's level of expertise.


Without their involvement, the land Daniela had recently acquired would remain unused.


These thoughts only added to his irritation, and his voice became more pointed. "I need to talk to you.You choose the location."


Daniela almost burst out laughing at his words.


Was this really how he approached someone for a conversation?


Without sayinga thing, she turned and walked away,leaving Alexander and Joyce standing there,completely stunned.


"You..." Joyce couldn't hold back her frustration as Daniela's car pulled away, the exhaust fumes sweeping over them. Turning to Alexander, she demanded, "Alexander, did I just see that right? Did 1hear you correctly? You literally told Daniela you wanted to talk, and that's how she responded? She just walked away without even looking back. How could she be so rude?"
###Chapter 45 ldiot




The initial shock on Alexander's face quickly morphed into a simmering rage as he pulled himself together.

His hands curled into tight fists, and he made a vow to himself.


From now on, for the rest of his life, he would act as though Daniela didn't exist. 


Joyce was just as dumbfounded by Daniela's blatant brush-off. When they got back home, Katrina was there, standing impatiently by the door.


"So? What happened? Did Daniela agree? How many floors did she hand over?" Katrina asked, her voice brimming with anticipation.


Joyce let out an irritated sigh, shaking her head.She launched into a detailed recounting of the gala, every humiliating moment and cold dismissal included.
Katrina's face twisted in shock as she listened."What? That's her way of handling men? What an absurd strategy! I've never heard of anything so ridiculous. But based on what you're saying, it sounds like her little scheme blew up in her face.She's completely destroyed her chances with Alexander now."


Her lips curled into a smug smile as a satisfied laugh escaped her.


"Perfect. That's exactly what we need."


If the Bennett family was still aiming for a marriage alliance,Joyce would be their one and only option.


But unlike Katrina, Joyce wasn't one to scheme with such precision. After catching wind of Daniela's business meeting scheduled for later that afternoon,she thought she'd take matters into her own hands.She made plans to meet Alexander earlier, setting up what she hoped would look like an "accidental" run-in with Daniela in the lobby.


The moment Alexander caught sight of Daniela in the Joyce gave Daniela a cheerful wave, but Daniela didn't even blink in response. Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly amazed. "Unbelievable! After everything that happened yesterday, they still have the audacity to wave at you?"


Daniela's lips tightened, clearly annoyed. "What's a little pride when she wants a shop space from me?"


After all, she was all too familiar with Joyce's true nature.


Daniela paused mid-step, her sharp eyes locking onto Joyce, who was making her way over with Alexander following close behind.


Standing nearby, Lillian couldn't resist the opportunity to throw in a quick jab. "Well, well, Mr.Bennett,Ms. Holt, have you finally decided to hold a proper discussion? Or should we just cancel these meetings altogether if civility is too much to ask?"


Joyce's expression stiffened for a moment, but she plastered on a forced laugh, unwilling to let her irritation ruin her chances at the shop space.


She vowed that once she got the shop space, she would not be polite to Daniela anymore.


"Absolutely! Let's find a spot to sit and chat. My treat," Joyce said through clenched teeth. Inside,frustration churned like a storm, her forced smile stretched so thin it felt more like a grimace than genuine cheer.


Lillian couIdn't hide her amusement at Joyce's clear discomfort. "Daniela, why don't we take a seat for a bit?" she suggested, her tone dripping with playful mischief.


Daniela, ever tolerant of her friends' antics, noticed Lillian's teasing mood and gave her a slight nod."Sure," she agreed.


Joyce stretched her smile even widder, though it felt like her face might crack, and gestured for Daniela and Lillian to follow her to a table.
Once they were seated, Daniela didn't even glance at Alexander or Joyce. Instead, she pulled a contract from her bag and began skimming through it, as though they weren't even there.


Joyce's lips twitched in a barely concealed sneer.What a performance. Who was she trying to impress with that contract? As if she was drowning in work or something.


Alexander's eyes flicked towards Daniela, quickly scanning the bold title of the document in her hands:Clayton Renovation.


For a moment, his expression tightened before easing again. Clayton Renovation-so that was it.A competitor to Bennett Group, sure, but still far away from their level of expertise and legacy in the industry.


If Daniela had even a shred of common sense, she'd know the smart move was to hire Bennett Group for her project. The thought sent a wave of smug satisfaction through him.
"Go ahead, speak up," Lillian said, leaning forward with her chin resting on one hand, her playful gaze bouncing between Joyce and Alexander. "Hey, eyes this way! Why are you staring at Daniela? She's not in charge here. I'm the one running the show now."


Joyce paused, her eyes flicking back to Daniela.


Daniela's attention was fixed on the contract in her hands, her gaze lowered slightly. A ray of sunlight streamed through the window, gently illuminating her, making her already stunning looks seem even more glowing and graceful.


Joyce inhaled sharply, her chest tightening with a bitter sting.


Without looking up, Daniela spoke in a detached tone. "The decisions are Lillian's responsibility."


Joyce's eyes brightened. "Ah, I get it! Okay, I'll talk to Lillian about it then."


Lillian's expression tightened. She tapped her nails against the table with a smirk. "Is that really how you speak? Didn't anyone teach you some manners?"


Joyce's brow furrowed. "What's that supposed to mean?" Her voice was thick with annoyance.


"You came here for a favor, right? Then act like it.Show some respect. Look at this-my water glass is empty.How do you expect to have a conversation without a drink?"


Joyce stood to pour the water, but Lillian cut her off."Hold on. Are we really going to talk business over just plain water?"



Lillian raised her hand and gestured for the restaurant manager. "You remember that red wine we discussed earlier? The one worth ten million? Go ahead and open it and add it to their bill."


"What?" Joyce gasped, her eyes going wide."Ten million?" With that kind of money, she could buy a whole collection of designer handbags.


"What? Got a problem with that?" Lillian teased, her smile sly. Joyce's face flushed deep red.


"can't you afford it? That can't be right, can it? aren't you the precious daughter of the Harper family?Surely ten million is nothing for someone like you.Or maybe being 'precious' doesn't mean much after all."


It finally clicked for Joyce-Lillian was intentionally humiliating her.


The worst part was Joyce genuinely couldn't afford it. The Harper family wasn't wealthy enough to throw money around so recklessly.


Feeling powerless, she turned to Lillian, arms crossed and eyes cold, then glanced at Alexander.Her voice dropped to a soft, pleading tone."Alexander."


Alexander gave a short nod towards the manager."Go ahead."


The manager's eyes gleamed, and he hurried off to bring the wine.


Lillian clapped her hands, nodding with exaggerated 
glee. "Ah, just as I expected from Mr. Bennett. Ten million spent for the sake of love-how heartwarming!"


Alexander's expression grew even more grim.


But Joyce couldn't stop the rush of sweetness that filled her chest.


Alexander had done so much for her today, more than she could have ever imagined. She decided that if Cedric didn't treat her better, she would choose Alexander. 


A smug smile slowly spread across Joyce's face as she thought about it.


Meanwhile, Lillian couldn't help but let out a faint,mocking smile.She couldn't believe how naive Joyce was being.

###Chapter 46 Are You Making Fun Of Me
The wine was served.


Joyce extended her hand to pour Lillian some wine,but Lillian quickly covered her glass, stopping her.Joyce stared at her in confusion.


"Since you're the host, you should be drinking,"Lillian said, stretching out the sentence as she glanced at Alexander. "Or maybe Mr. Bennett will handle this for you?"


Alexander was about to reply, but Lillian interrupted with a laugh.


"This is between women. If a man steps in, things could get tricky. My family has enough people who can handle their drinks. Should I bring a few over?"


Alexander froze, his hand pausing in mid-air. The wine was on the table, and the money was already spent.


Joyce gritted her teeth, clearly irritated, but then lowered her head and downed three glasses in quick succession. "There! Happy now? Can we get to the business?"


Lillian watched her, a smirk spreading across her face. She was still seething over the fire video-just the thought of it made her blood boil.


Did Joyce actually think three glasses would fix everything? No way!


"Alright, we'll discuss business, but only when I feel like it," Lillian replied, her grin growing. "Go ahead and continue drinking."


Joyce had been protected her whole life. Her mother never let her drink, and even in situations where pushy elders insisted, it was always Daniela who stepped in to drink for her.


Now, after only three glasses, Joyce's vision was starting to blur. Her head was spinning, and her temper flared with every ounce of discomfort.Slamming her hand on the table, she snapped, "Are you making fun of me?"


Lillian crossed her arms and laughed. "Yes,I am.What are you going to do about it?"


Joyce's face turned bright red with a mix of rage and embarrassment. She tried to get up from her seat,but the alcohol had already taken control. Her legs buckled, and she stumbled back, collapsing heavily into her chair and leaning against the table for support.


Lillian scoffed dismissively before turning her attention to Alexander, subtly tilting her chin in his direction. "Mr. Bennett, it's your turn."


As she reached for her glass to pour herself wine,Daniela, still focused on the contract in her hands,extended her arm and covered Lillian's glass. "You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach."


Though her words were soft, the meaning was clear 
Lillian had a sensitive stomach when it came to alcohol. Daniela knew Lillian was teaching Joyce a lesson and wasn't actually planning to drink, so she'd allowed her to enjoy herself a bit.


However, seeing that Lillian was beginning to overdo it, Daniela decided it was time to step in.


There was no reason for her to let Lillian hurt herself for someone who didn't matter.



From Alexander's point of view, though, things looked a lot different. To him, Daniela's intervention felt familiar, as though she was looking out for him once again, just like she used to.


He recalled those times when he'd gotten so drunk that he passed out, and Daniela would drive al the way out to pick him up. She'd carefully carry him,taking one slow step after another, all the way home.


The memory brought a subtle softness to Alexander's expression. His usually sharp eyes grew gentler, a hint of tenderness appearing as he glanced at Daniela.


Daniela looked at him for a second before turning away. "No more drinking. If you've got something to say, say it now." She checked the time on her watch and added, "I've got another meeting soon, so you've got five minutes."


Alexander nodded, surprisingly cooperative this time."Joyce wants the floors in your building-the ones she mentioned earlier."



Lillian snorted derisively, clearly unimpressed.


Daniela, on the other hand, stayed completely calm and unaffected. "They've already been given to someone else."



Alexander paused for a second, clearly caught off guard."What? To whom?"


Daniela responded flatly, "Phillips Group."


Alexander's brow furrowed. "Cedric Phillips?"Daniela gave a small nod. "Yes. Anything else?"


Alexander looked at Joyce, who was drunkenly slouched in her seat, and asked, "What about the other floors?"


Daniela considered briefly before answering,"There's still one spot available. It's in the basement,right by the restroom. Are you interested?" 


Alexander's expression soured. "This is insane. The wine's here, Joyce is wasted, and all you're offering is a spot near the restroom? She's running a clothing store.Who in their right mind would want to shop next to a restroom? That's completely ridiculous!"


Daniela grabbed her contract and stood up. "Well,if that's the case, there's nothing else to talk about.That's the last available space. It's at market price-15, 000 dollars per square meter-and the lease is only for one year. If you want it again next year,you'll have to bid for it like anyone else. And Mr. Bennett,don't make such a fuss over one bottle of wine.Mentioning it is just going to make you look petty and small."
With that, she spun around and walked away.


Lillian, practically beaming with satisfaction,chuckled to herself.


After years of watching Daniela go out of her way for him, this moment brought Lillian a deep sense of enjoyment.


Alexander remained seated, his eyes following Lillian as she trailed after Daniela, even throwing her a thumbs-up in admiration.



His gaze then turned to Daniela, who was chatting with someone from Clayton Renovation.


A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.


"Sure, keep talking, Daniela. It won't change anything. Clayton Renovation doesn't have the resources for a project like this. Eventually, you'll have to come crawling back to me. Huh!"


Alexander settled the bill for the wine before driving Joyce back to her place.


 Katrina was already waiting by the door.


Caiden was out in the garden, pretending to water the plants.


As Alexander stepped out of the car with the thoroughly drunk Joyce, Katrina rushed over.When she saw her daughter's intoxicated condition, her face contorted with both shock and fury. "How on earth did she end up this drunk? It's got to be Daniela! She's never let go of her grudge against us,and now she's making Joyce pay for it!"


Alexander handed Joyce over to Katrina, his mind flashing back to when Daniela had stopped Lillian from drinking. His voice remained calm as he corrected, "It wasn't Daniela. It was someone else."


Katrina was beside herself. "Who would do this?Alexander, what about the shop? Did you manage to work things out?"


Just as she finished asking, Alexander's phone rang.He nodded and answered vaguely, "Yes." Had meant to suggest they go check the location and see if it
worked for their needs, but for some reason, he didn't go further and just left it at that one word.


The instant he said it, Katrina's face lit up with happiness.


Even Calden, who had been pretending to water the plants, dropped the act and quickly walked over.


Both of them stared at Alexander, their eyes full of expectation."Really?"

###Chapter 47 No One To Rely On




Alexander nodded, but before he could respond,Katrina leapt in with eager enthusiasm. "I knew it!Only Alexander could handle this! See? This is where you're lacking, Caiden. Look at Alexander-he genuinely cares about Joyce! Even such a difficult matter has been resolved, all thanks to him.Alexander, dealing with someone like Daniela, who never gives an inch, must be exhausting!"


Caiden chimed in, grinning broadly, "Exactly! That ungrateful brat is getting harder and harder to deal with. But you're reliable as always, Alexander. Daniela still listens to you. No matter what we say, it's useless. Joyce is lucky to have you. Alright, Joyce is drunk tonight, so we won't keep you any longer, but we'll definitely need your help again in the future.Thank you."


Katrina carefully propped up Joyce, while Caiden hurried off to fetch a cold towel, wiping Joyce's 
forehead.


Alexander stood silently at the doorway, his gaze taking in the scene.


His thoughts drifted back to a memory from years ago-when Daniela had just turned eighteen. She had drunk far too much, not for her own indulgence,but for him.


He had carried her home just like this.


Katrina, instead of showing even a shred of concern,had greeted Daniela with venomous scolding,her voice harsh as she spat out accusations of impropriety.


Caiden had been no better, hurling insults with reckless abandon, calling Daniela an "ungrateful brat."


In the end, he and Katrina had ordered the maids to drag Daniela to the bathroom so that she wouldn't stink up the sofa with that smell.


It was at that moment that Alexander realized Daniela had no one to rely on.


Perhaps it was in that very moment that his treatment of her had worsened. 


Because he understood all too well the cracks in human nature.



He knew Daniela was utterly alone-no family to support her, no safety net to catch her. She had sacrificed everything, even her dignity, to stand by him.


Alexander let out a quiet, mocking laugh.


In the end, people could only depend on themselves.No one else would ever truly prioritize their well-being.


The cold indifference Daniela had faced? He felt no regret. Not even a flicker of guilt.

Alexander lowered his gaze, turned on his heel, and walked away.


He had things to discuss with his father. If Daniela decided to negotiate a deal, he needed to determine just how steep a price they could extract from her.







By the time Joyce stirred awake, the sky had already darkened, cloaking the world in twilight.


She stomped furiously around her room, her frustration spilling out in shrill curses.


She told Caiden, "Daniela made me drink! And she even let Alexander pay for a bottle of wine worth ten million! She is nothing but a greedy, heartless leech!She has no sisterly bonds at all! Someone like her is bound to get struck by lightning one day!"


Caiden,lounging on the couch as he scrolled through the news on his phone, nodded absently. "Yes, yes,struck by lightning."


Joyce, somewhat pacified, sniffled and wiped her tears. Her indignation still simmering, she muttered bitterly, "Let me make this clear-this shop space isn't something Daniela gave me. It's something Alexander gave me! It has nothing to do with her!"


Caiden, uninterested in the finer points of her tantrum, shrugged without looking up.


As long as Joyce got what she wanted, he didn't care how the matter was resolved or who had to be involved.



Joyce didn't care either. She had claimed her prize:the 18th to 20th floors of the Luxor Tower. Tomorrow,she would make her mark.



In her mind's eye, she envisioned herself striding confidently into the Luxor Tower, her empire taking shape.


Her business would thrive beyond anyone's expectations.


And best of all, Daniela would burn with jealousy,powerless to stop her!


Joyce was over the moon with excitement.


That night, she rallied her friends and headed to a bar.


Fueled by alcohol and euphoria, Joyce climbed unsteadily onto the stage, snatching up a microphone. "Listen up, everyone! Starting tomorrow, I'll be moving into Luxor Tower's 18th floor to launch my empire! The 19th and 20th floors are mine too! Every single person here tonight is my friend, and from now on, those two floors will be our exclusive gathering spot! To celebrate, the entire bar's drinks are on me! Everything's on me tonight!"



The music surged louder as the crowd erupted into a frenzy of celebration.


That night, Joyce's extravagant gesture cleared out the bar's entire stock of alcohol.


By morning, word of her wild proclamation had spread like wildfire across Olisvine.


By morning, everyone was buzzing about Joyce, who was supposedly opening her boutique on the 18th floor of the Luxor Tower. The news spread so quickly that it even hit the trending headlines.


At that moment, Lillian and Josie were lounging on the couch, engrossed in a mobile game.


When the article popped up on Lillian's phone, she laughed so hard she nearly rolled off the cushions.


Just then, Daniela entered the room. She paused,noticing Josie rubbing Lillian's stomach, trying to help her catch her breath from laughing too much.


Daniela tilted her head, smiling with curiosity."What's so funny?"


Lillian, still gasping for air, waved her phone at Daniela, motioning for her to take a look.


Daniela took the phone and skimmed the screen,her expression shifting to one of incredulity.


Lillian asked, "Has Joyce completely lost her mind?Didn't you tell her the only available space was the basement by the restroom? How on earth did it turn into the 18th to 20th floors? And the space was not even renovated. Now she's out there announcing the grand opening is tomorrow! What's she planning to do? Host guests in the storage room? Or better yet-the restroom? I have to share this with the Elite Lux group chat. They're going to die laughing!"


She grabbed her phone, typing rapidly between giggles.


Meanwhile, Josie walked over to Daniela, gesturing towards the table where some food had been set out for her. Daniela nodded and sat down, picking up her fork.



As Josie passed behind her, she caught a glimpse of Daniela typing out a message on her phone.


Daniela was drafting a text to Caiden, reminding him to inform Joyce of the truth-that the space was the basement restroom, hadn't been renovated, and required a deposit to secure.


Daniela hit send, setting her phone down as she began eating.


When she glanced up, she noticed Josie staring at her with a concerned expression.


Daniela asked with a smile, "What's wronng?"

###Chapter 48 A Reminder





Josie's heart ached as she watched Daniela. Here was a young woman who had grown up without anyone truly caring for her, yet she had emerged so strong, so compassionate.


Caiden had forced his own daughter to fend for herself, while lavishing affection on a spoiled, self-centered brat like Joyce. It was beyond comprehension.


"Here, eat this," Josie said gently, pushing a dish closer to Daniela. "You're so young, yet you've had to bear so much already. You're truly remarkable. If your mother were here, she would be incredibly proud of you. But, my dear, a girl can't rely on herself all the time. Being strong is admirable, but it's also exhausting. I can't do much to ease your burdens,but I can cook. If there's ever anything you want to eat, just tell me. You've been staying up so late recently; you should go to bed early. Young women

need to take care of their health, especially if they want a happy future and to find the right partner someday."


Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile.


She had walked a long, solitary road, carrying her burdens without complaint. She didn't think of herself as remarkable-she had simply done what needed to be done.



But now, here was someone, a woman her mother's age, showing her genuine care. The warmth of Josie's words touched her deeply. Her smile grew as she met Josie's kind gaze. "Thank you, Josie."


Josie's face brightened, her smile wide and affectionate as she looked at Daniela.


Daniela was in her twenties-the prime of her youth-vibrant, radiant, and brimming with untapped potential.


A girl like her, with such a kind heart, deserved someone who would truly cherish her.
"Miss Harper, do you have a boyfriend?"


Daniela shook her head.


"I know a young man. He's handsome, well-mannered, and such a gentleman. Maybe I could introduce him to you sometime?"


Daniela let out a chuckle, shaking her head again."Thank you, Josie, but I'm not ready for that right now. I just got out of a marriage, and honestly,I think I'm a little afraid of the idea of marriage for now."


Josie's expression turned thoughtful, her head nodding. "You're right. Marriage is a big decision. It should never be taken lightly."


With that, Josie turned back to the kitchen. A moment later, Lillian wandered in from the living room with a chuckle. "Josie wants to set you up with someone? Who could she possibly know?"


Daniela glanced at her and replied, "Her intentions are kind. Don't make fun of her."



From the kitchen, Josie overheard their exchange.A
small smile spread across her lips.


She pulled out her phone and typed a message."Mr.Phillips, the person you chose is truly wonderful. But she said she's single right now and isn't considering a relationship at the moment."


The reply came almost instantly-a frustrated emoji,its expression a perfect representation of disappointment.






Caiden,as usual, sat glued to the television.


When his phone lit up with a notification, he didn't even spare it a glance. Without bothering to see who it was from, he lazily flipped the device over, leaving the screen facedown on the table.



Katrina complained, "Why don't you ever check your phone? What if Joyce has something important to tell you? How is she supposed to reach you if you're always ignoring your phone?"


She reached over, snatched up his phone, and
unlocked it.



It was a message from Daniela.


Katrina's expression soured in an instant.


Without even bothering to open the message, she swiped left and deleted it.


Caiden, still engrossed in his show, didn't notice a thing. His tone remained casual as he asked, "Is it Joyce?"


Katrina's lips curled into a sly smile as she scrolled to his contacts list and blocked Daniela's number entirely.


Finally satisfied, she let out a deep breath and smiled."Nope."







Daniela had wrapped up her tasks for the day.Fresh from the shower, she reached for her phone on the nightstand and glanced at the screen.


There was still no response from Caiden.
With a subtle frown, she opened her news app, only to find the same trending topic dominating the headlines. Curious, she tapped on the link, and a video loaded almost instantly.

The scene unfolded. Joyce, perched on a table at a bar, dancing with wild abandon to the pulsing beat of the music. Behind her hung a banner.


"Congratulations to Joyce Holt for Obtaining Floors 18th-20th of Luxor Tower!"


Daniela stared at the video, momentarily speechless.After a deep breath, she forwarded the video to Caiden, intending to remind him once again.


But just as she hit send, a small notification appeared on her screen, reminding her that she had been blocked.


Daniela froze for a moment, her gaze fixed on the notification.


Then, she placed the phone back on the bedside table, turned off the light, and slipped into bed.
###Chapter 49 The True Heiress




A party was full swing in the bar. The booming music vibrated through the walls.


A crowd encircled Joyce, lavishing her with praise.


"Joyce, you're incredible! Please, look out for me in the future! If you could just let me use a little corner of your studio to sell some essential oils, I'd be set for life!"


"Hey, who said you could call dibs first? Joyce, we're friends, right? Don't forget about me! You've got three whole floors. Let me open a shop on one! When I hit it big, I'll split the profits with you!"


"Truly, Joyce is something else! Just her presence outshines girls from half the wealthy families here!"


"Exactly! You guys don't even know how much Caiden cares for her. He spoils her rotten!"

"Yeah, so what if she disrupted Daniela's wedding and snagged her man? Even though Daniela heads Elite Lux now, she still has to cede those floors to you. And we're not talking about just any floors-these are premium, top-tier spots! Joyce, you're living the dream!"


With that, Joyce flashed a smug grin. "Of course. My family adores me the most. And Daniela? She's irrelevant. All of the Harper family's assets will end up with me eventually. Even the projects Daniela's pouring her heart into now-those will be mine, too.Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She's nothing compared to me!"



The crowd erupted in cheers, raising their glasses in a toast.



"A toast to Joyce! The future head of the Harper family!"


Joyce raised her glass high, her laughter booming through the room. "Cheers!"


This raucous moment was caught on video and quickly went viral online.


That night, Joyce racked up over four million dollars in charges at the bar.


When Caiden saw the credit card alert, he was astounded,leaping from his bed in disbelief.


Convinced the card had been stolen, he immediately phoned the police.


Meanwhile, Joyce was slowly coming to, groggily trying to sit up from the couch.


She felt something cold and wet beneath her and looked down-her body stiffened instantly.


A glaring red stain marred the sofa, jolting her fully awake.


In a panic, she scrambled into her skirt. As she looked up, she caught a glimpse of someone darting past the doorway.


"Stop right there!" she yelled.


But the figure was gone. Fuzzy memories from the night before flickered through her mind-she remembered clinging to a man in the dim light of the bar, kissing him, and noticing a small birthmark on the back of his neck.


Joyce rushed out of the private room, her heart pounding. Outside, her so-called friends lingered,equally disheveled and hungover.

They hadn't left. They were all hanging around,hoping to capitalize on her newfound status related to the Luxor Tower-a chance none wanted to miss.


Joyce quickly tried to compose herself and left the bar, only to find herself facing a group of police officers at the door.


Behind them, an irate Caiden and a distressed Katrina approached rapidly.
"Officer, there's been a mistake!" Caiden exclaimed,desperation in his voice. "My card must have been stolen! My daughter doesn't drink-she's never had alcohol in her life-" 


His protest halted abruptly as he caught sight of Joyce.


There she stood, disheveled and comical in appearance, with her hair a mess, eyelid stickers dangling precariously, and the family credit card dangling from her fingers.


The words froze in his throat.


Instead, his mind churned with a single thought."What a disgrace!"


Still, he forced himself to swallow the insult,holding back his simmering anger. Today was her big store opening. Four million? It was nothing.


Caiden clenched his fists tightly, the tension in his jaw betraying his struggle to maintain composure.


Katrina went to great lengths to ensure Joyce's store opening looked grand, including renting several luxury cars to form an impressive convoy to the Luxor Tower.


During the ride, she placed a reassuring hand on Caiden's chest, patting it lightly to calm him. "Honey,don't let it get to you. It's nothing to stress over. We'll earn it all back in no time. Think about it-business is all about connections. Sometimes, you have to spend a little to make friends!"



Caiden exhaled heavily, attempting to let her words soothe him. Then his gaze shifted to the back row,where two of Joyce's self-proclaimed "best friends"sat.



Their appearances were jarring.


One wore mismatched,ripped clothing that gave the impression she'd stumbled out of a haunted house.


The other sported multiple lip piercings that made Caiden wince.



These were her connections?
The two began chattering obnoxiously. "Joyce,remember last night? You promised I could have space on the 18th floor to sell my essential oils!"


Caiden squeezed his eyes shut, the dull throb of a headache starting to build.


When they finally arrived at the Luxor Tower,Caiden stepped out of the car, his irritation barely hidden.But then his eyes landed on Daniela.



She stood there, draped in an elegant Elite Lux early-spring couture outfit, radiating refinement with every movement. Though it was not yet 10 o'clock in the morning, she had already finalized a major deal. Her poised, professional smile shone as she saw her client off with a courteous goodbye.



Her assistant approached with a pile of documents,which she signed with practiced ease, her grace and composure unwavering.


Her every action exuded calm authority, the undeniable presence of someone destined to lead.
For a brief moment, Caiden straightened his posture,puffing out his chest. This was the epitome of a Harper heiress!


The shame he'd carried earlier began to ease,replaced by a faint sense of pride.


Joyce's friends got out of the car to see Daniela speaking with her client, her poise and polished demeanor shining like a flawless diamond.


"Wow! Joyce, your sister's really stepped it up. She's so classy now!"


"Of course! She's the CEO of Elite Lux. It doesn't get any classier than that!"


"No, no, no. That outfit only works because Daniela is the real deal-a genuine heiress. Put it on a fake heiress, and it'd just look tacky and completely out of place."
###Chapter 50 Did You Use Protection





At the sound of that, both Katrina and Joyce spun around, their eyes narrowing at the person who spoke.


Both of them sensed they were being singled out.


Katrina's eyes darted to Joyce, and her expression changed instantly, going from contempt to pure shock.



Katrina yanked Joyce's arm and gestured to the group behind them. "Let's use the side entrance.It's much wider and quieter."



She made sure to steer clear of Daniela.



Once they were out of sight, Katrina's patience snapped. She grabbed the hem of Joyce's skirt and tugged it harshly.


"Mom! Ouch, what are you doing?" Joyce winced, pulling back.


Katrina's voice lowered to a fierce whisper, her words dripping with fury. "What did you do last night?"


Joyce blinked in confusion. "What? Nothing! I just went out to enjoy myself."


"Enjoy, huh?" Katrina's voice shook with rage. "Did you even bother to shower? Look at your legs!"


Joyce looked down, and her expression stiffened in shock.


Katrina fumed with anger, her mind racing back to the wild group from the car, the heavy drinking, and now this. A sharp headache started to throb as she realized the gravity of the situation.


All the years of raising Joyce-wasted in an instant!


She should have intervened last night. She should have seen this coming!


"Who was it? Did you even use protection?" Katrina asked.
Joyce turned to her mother, her eyes wide with panic, her mind going blank.


Katrina removed her jacket and wrapped it around Joyce's waist, hiding the marks of last night's mistake. She leaned in, her voice dripping with fury as she whispered, "I didn't raise you to fall for someone like that. Whatever happened last night? It didn't happen. Do you hear me? Not a word of it! If J ever catch you with someone like that again, I swear I'll make you regret it!"


Joyce, visibly shaken, nodded quickly. She was too terrified to speak up.


Seeing her daughter's fearful reaction, Katrina continued, "This stays between us. No one can know.You were drunk, and so was everyone else. No one remembers anything, and you need to make sure it stays that way. If anyone asks, deny it. Got it? If anyone else hears about this, it's over. Your reputation will be shattered, and no decent family will want you."


Trembling, Joyce nodded once more, her fear evident in the way her body shook.


At last, Katrina let out a deep sigh, standing upright and briefly calming herself.


When they got back into the elevator with the others,her face remained tight with tension, and she kept murmuring sharp, cautionary words to Joyce.


Caiden, completely unaware of all this,was watching the elevator numbers climb with wide eyes. Excited,he grinned and said, "What's with all the whispering?Hurry up and get us to the top! I can't wait to see the view. It must be amazing from up there."


His face practically radiated excitement, his pride evident in the way he spoke.


Katrina, however, couldn't muster a bit of enthusiasm, no matter how hard she tried. Her lips barely curled into a smile, and the expression that appeared on her face was stiff, almost forced.


But as the scene unfolded, her mood began to lift, if only slightly-and for good reason.
Behind her, the group gasped in awe, their voices filled with wonder.


Even Caiden, usually composed and restrained,couldn't help himself and let out a genuine "Wow!"


The 18th floor was the best of the entire building. It was truly a sight to marvel at.


The view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was nothing short of spectacular, offering an uninterrupted 360-degree panorama of the sprawling city below.


The floor had already been completely remodeled,with every detail radiating luxury.


Antique vases decorated every corner, and a magnificent table, threaded with gold, took center stage in the room.


A stunning water feature greeted them at the entrance, a clear symbol of wealth and success,filling the space with an aura of prosperity.


And the real showstopper? A world-famous painting proudly showcased at the doorway.


This wasn't aplace where luxury was simply suggested-it was unmistakably present in every inch of the space.


"I recognize this painting!" Katrina cried, almost jumping with excitement. "It was auctioned off for fifty million not long ago. Can you believe that? It's pure opulence! With this hanging here, making money will be a piece of cake."


Joyce smiled brightly, a feeling of immense pride swelling in her chest. Finally, Daniela had done something that actually mattered.


At the same time, Caiden was soaking up the praise being showered on him.


Just as the moment seemed to peak, the elevator doors chimed softly and then slid open.


Cedric stepped out, dressed in a sharp, tailored suit that radiated authority and sophistication.


He and the building manager beside him appeared momentarily thrown off by the strange mix of people in front of him. The other group was just as surprised.


For a second, both groups just stood there, staring at each other in silence.


Joyce hesitated before taking a small, nervous step forward, her hands twisting nervously in front of her.Katrina gave a subtle pull on her skirt, a silent nudge of encouragement.


Taking a breath, Joyce forced a shy smile and spoke in a soft, almost teasing tone. "Mr. Phillips, are you here to congratulate me on my new office? Thank you so much for being here. It really means a lot. The space is still a work in progress, though."


Katrina couldn't have looked happier. With a proud smile, she added, "Cedric, welcome! What a wonderful surprise to have you here!"


Caiden felt his pride grow as he watched Cedric.Having him there, with all his influence and status,was like a badge of honor for Caiden, giving him a sense of validation and boosting his confidence tenfold.


At the same time, Joyce's friends were gathered at the back, staring at Cedric in awe.


"That's Cedric?" one of them whispered, her voice shaky with astonishment.


"You're talking about Cedric Phillips? The business mogul who's always in the news?"


"He's so put together, totally unlike us. He has this presence so polished, so sophisticated."


"Yeah, but isn't Cedric known for staying away from social events? Why would he come here, of all places? And on Joyce's office opening day, no less.What's happening?"


"Isn't it clear? Cedric must have a thing for Joyce! I mean, why else would he be here? Joyce is basically set for life now-landing someone like Cedric? She's hit the jackpot."


"Living the dream. But why would Cedric go for someone like Joyce? She doesn't really seem all that sharp."


That last remark wasn't as quiet as the rest-it was loud enough for everyone to catch.


The room went still. Caiden, Katrina, and Joyce turned in sync, their glares sharp and cold.


On the other hand, the building manager couldn't help but stifle a laugh.
###Chapter 51 Self-respect




From the moment Katrina's gaze fell upon Cedric,her smile was unwavering. She regarded him as an exemplary choice for a son-in-law.


Leaning towards Caiden, she murmured, "Cedric really is something else, isn't he? Look how polite and considerate he is. We haven't even officially started, and here he is, already bearing a gift."


Caiden, watching Cedric's poised and respectful manner, nodded in acknowledgment.


Katrina's grin broadened with pride. "You see,honey? This is all my doing. Had I not nurtured Joyce so well, she might have ended up like Daniela. Think about it-when we're old, who will we depend on?Certainly not Daniela."


With an eager nod, Caiden responded, "You're absolutely right. Joyce is all we've got. Daniela?She's a lost cause, utterly unreliable for the rest of her pathetic life."


Katrina felt a surge of elation, her beaming smile proof of her delight.


She advanced a few paces towards Cedric, her focus turning to the vase the building manager held.A glimmer of recognition danced in her eyes. "Hang on... Isn't that from last night's auction?"


Curiosity flickered in Katrina's eyes as she leaned toward the vase. Yet, as she approached, the manager recoiled instinctively, clutching the vase closer to his chest.


Katrina's expression hardened with irritation, but she smoothed it over with an overly sweet smile as she pivoted towards Cedric.


"Oh, Cedric! How incredibly thoughtful of you! This vase is the one from last night's auction,right?remember it fetching a million. How lavish of you! Tell me, is this splendid piece meant to celebrate Joyce's store opening? Your generosity knows no bounds!Yet, how can we justify accepting such a prized treasure?"


Despite her words, Katrina closed the distance once more, her hands seizing the vase from the flustered manager, who found himself helplessly cornered.


With the vase pressed to her chest, she flashed a radiant smile, her face glowing with a sense of triumph.


The building manager stood frozen, a look of utter disbelief painting his face as he gazed at his now-empty palms, then turned to Cedric.


Cedric's features turned stormy. His eyebrows drew together, casting his face into an icy, uninviting expression.


The manager, overwhelmed by the moment,exclaimed, "Seriously? Are you out of your mind?What on earth are you doing? This isn't just reckless -it's outright robbery!"


He was in complete shock, questioning whether this was typical behavior for women of affluent backgrounds.


But Katrina couldn't care less. To her, the vase was already hers. She believed Cedric was going to be her son-in-law. Why couldn't she take that vase.


She felt not just justified, but determined, having already selected the perfect spot for the vase-in the living room of their home. This was more than decoration; it was a declaration. Her daughter was now Cedric's cherished.


Approaching, Caiden lightly grasped Joyce's elbow,his expression full of quiet approval. "This is such a wonderful gesture. Thank you so much!"


"Thank you, Cedric," Joyce chimed in with a shy smile.


Maintaining his composure by a thread, Cedric resisted the urge to roll his eyes.


His patience wearing thin, he turned to Katrina with a cold stare. "Who gave you permission to be here?"His tone cut through the air, sharp and unforgiving.
Caiden, taken aback, blinked in confusion. After a moment, he chuckled awkwardly. "What do you mean by that? The entire floor is ours now. Actually,not just this one, but the two above it too. Daniela handed over all three floors to us."


At the mention of Daniela's name, Cedric's demeanor turned to one of solemnity, and he turned sharply to confront the building manager.


The manager, his forehead slick with sweat,hastened to clarify, "No, Mr. Phillips, their shop isn't located on this level."


Katrina, her brow furrowed in bewilderment,interjected sharply, "Our shop isn't here? Then where on earth is it supposed to be?"


Exhaling a deep, weary sigh, the building manager tapped his phone with a sense of urgency. "Jerry,come upstairs and escort them to their designated space," he instructed, before turning to Katrina with a stern gaze. "I must urge you to be careful as you exit. Every item here is a valuable antique, with each piece carrying a significant price tag."

He stepped towards Katrina, his hands extended,ready to ease the vase from her desperate grip. "Mr.Phillips, I'll ensure this vase is delivered to Ms.Harper's office."


Cedric watched the exchange, his eyes darkening as he viewed the vase. "It's already dirty," he declared,his disdain palpable.


The manager paused, his bewilderment plain on his face."Sorry.What did you say?"


Cedric offered no further explanation. "Just get rid of it," he stated dismissively.


In his eyes, anything Katrina defiled with her touch was as good as garbage, a disgrace to Daniela's name.


He entered the elevator without another word,his expression unreadable, yet his revulsion was clear.Katrina made a half-hearted attempt to reach out, to halt his departure, but the elevator doors sealed shut before she could utter a single plea.
The building manager exhaled a deep, tired sigh and ambled over to the trash can. With a resonant clang,he dumped the vase into it without a second thought.


Katrina's eyes stretched wide in shock. Casting aside any semblance of composure, she dashed to the trash can and leaned over, her arms plunging in to rescue the vase.


Cradling it protectively, she muttered in disbelief,"How could anyone toss away such a stunning vase?It's worth a fortune! Oh, no-look, there's a chip on the rim!"


Caiden and Joyce stood by, utterly mortified, their cheeks burning with embarrassment as they observed Katrina's frantic actions.



Behind them, Joyce's friends exchanged glances,their eyes wide with shock, their whispers intensifying as they struggled to mask their astonishment.



"This is utterly disgraceful."
 
"She has completely tarnished the image of every dignified lady! Can you believe Cedric refused the vase just because she handled it, and now she's scavenging it from the garbage? Did you see the desperation in her actions?"


"Truly, though, it's hardly shocking. I heard that Katrina only secured her place in the Harper family after Daniela's mother passed away. Before that,she was merely a humble villager, busying herself with pickling vegetables. It seems she employed every cunning tactic available to seduce Daniela's father."


"All that money, and she still can't shake off the pitiful aura of someone who'll grovel for scraps."


"Indeed, coming from modest means is no fault of her own. But where is her sense of pride? Has she no self-respect at all?"


"Self-respect? Please. It's doubtful Katrina even understands the concept. I heard that right after Daniela's mother died, Katrina moved in. Driven by fear of missing her chance at wealth, she disregarded how blatantly disgraceful it appeared. A woman of her sort-do you really think< she possesses any self-respect?"

###Chapter 52 Humiliation





As Jerry Oliver took the lead with the group in tow,their footsteps reverberated through the corridor,accompanied by a low murmur of whispers that filled the air with a sense of unease.②


Katrina, gripping the vase, struggled to maintain her composure. A pulsing headache exacerbated her growing irritation, yet she managed to suppress the rising storm within her.


She glanced back to check on her daughter, only to see her engaged in light-hearted conversation with a friend, seemingly oblivious to the tension around them.


With a deep breath, Katrina tightened her eyes shut,mentally coaxing herself to remain calm and not to succumb to the provocation of the youngsters'carefree disregard.


As the elevator moved down through the floors,
Caiden's previously easy smile slowly dissolved into a look of concern. A troubling premonition gnawed at him, prompting him to finally break the silence.


"Jerry, just where on earth are we headed now?"


They had exited the elevator and continued their lengthy trek.


It seemed as if they were about to leave the confines of Luxor Tower altogether.


Jerry, clutching a hefty ring of keys, was visibly annoyed. The murmurs and snickers from the group had not escaped his notice and had left him simmering with resentment.



He was keenly aware of Daniela's true character-her beauty was matched by her compassion and generosity.


She had discreetly funded his wife's surgery when they were desperate and unsupported. Whenever a crisis struck a staff member's family, she was there to offer aid. Her genuine kindness had earned her the  deep respect of everyone within Elite Lux.


Yet, here was her own family, disparaging her with a haughty air.


Jerry rolled his eyes, his voice sharp and dismissive as he retorted, "Why bombard me with questions?Just come along and all will be revealed in due time!"


His brusque tone took Caiden aback. It had been a long while since someone had addressed him with such unfiltered disdain.


"Do you not know who the hell I am?" Caiden challenged, his brow furrowed in irritation. "I'm Daniela's father-your boss's father! With a snap of my fingers, I could own this entire building!"


Jerry halted in his tracks, his grip on the keys tightening, his knuckles whitening as he fought to control his rising fury.


Caiden, seemingly unaware of the growing storm,pressed on. "Don't forget, it's my family's money keeping your ass employed."

 Katrina, quick to capitalize on the moment, chimed in sharply, "Precisely! Would you even have a job if it weren't for us? People who run their damn mouths like you don't deserve to stay employed!"


Jerry exhaled sharply, his voice laced with a mix of defiance and disbelief. "Go ahead, fire me! But I have to ask, do you actually hold the power to do so?Caiden, is it? Let me make something clear. Having you as a father is the worst curse that could've befallen Ms. Harper! Weren't you the one who declared to the world that you were severing all ties with her? And yet, now that she's found success, you suddenly claim ownership over this entire building?Why not take it further? Perhaps proclaim that the entire nation belongs to you? You're supposed to be an elder-perhaps it's time to start behaving like one and exhibit a bit of dignity!"


Katrina's face flushed a deep crimson, and she shook with fury. "How dare you speak to us in such a manner! Get your manager on the phone this instant!"

Jerry, utterly unfazed by the escalating tension,retrieved his phone and dialed his manager,putting the call on speaker. The manager's voice crackled through, tinged with irritation. "What now? What's the problem with Joyce Holt? She's already stirred up enough trouble. You know what? Forget it-if they're that much of a nuisance, just stop leasing to them. Are we really so desperate that we can't do without the rent from a basement-level unit?"


The phrase "basement-level unit" struck a nerve.


Caiden and Katrina, who had been simmering with rage only seconds before, came to a sudden halt.


Joyce's brow furrowed as her voice dripped with fury. "What the hell do you mean by that?"


Jerry folded his arms, his voice laced with a flat,impatient tone. "Areyou coming to check it out or not? If you're not interested, I can just go."


Reluctantly, the trio stifled their objections and trailed after him.

As they moved deeper, an unsettling feeling crept up on them.


Joyce edged closer to Katrina, her voice a nervous whisper. "Mom, what is this place? Why are we wandering through a parking garage?"


Katrina's face grew troubled, her anxiety palpable.


They were supposed to be shown the 18th to 20th floors, yet here they were, in the basement.


As they progressed, Caiden's prior cockiness had vanished entirely, his face clouding over with each step they took.


Suddenly, Joyce perked up, her voice slicing through the tension. "Mom, look! There are shops over there!"


Their gazes collectively turned to where Joyce directed, and sure enough, a series of storefronts came into view.



Joyce gestured towards a shop in the middle. "If it's a spot like that, I could definitely see us there."

However, Katrina's response was less than enthusiastic. Her experience of the opulent upper levels had set a high bar that this basement level couldn't meet.


Disdainfully, she waved a dismissive hand, her nose wrinkling at the pervasive, musty odor that filled the air.


Undeterred, Jerry maintained his brisk pace, guiding them deeper into the busier part of the basement.They navigated a corner and halted abruptly at the end of the corridor.


Joyce looked around, bewildered. "Seriously? You brought us to a damn restroom? We don't need to use it!"


Jerry pointed to a dimly lit area near the bathroom and announced, "Over there is the space for your shop." He then proceeded to unlock the door.


Once opened, the room was engulfed in darkness, an eerie silence pervading the air. Joyce paused,reluctant, before finally using her phone's flashlight
to pierce the gloom.


The sight that greeted her elicited a shriek of terror."Mom! It's full of rats!"


Chaos exploded, their screams and yells bouncing off the waIls of the tight hallway.


Jerry, unimpressed, merely rolled his eyes. "This area was once used for storing restroom supplies. It's been out of use for quite some time, hence the dust and, unfortunately, the current residents. The space is roughly 100 square meters, priced at $11,000 per square meter. That's the final offer, and you'll have to handle any renovations yourself. Make your decision today, or it's no longer available."


They were left dumbfounded, struggling to comprehend his proposition.


Katrina's forced smile faded as she turned to Caiden,her expression one of sheer outrage. "Don't you see it? Daniela's doing this on purpose to make us look like fools, isn't she?"


She broke down, tears streaming down her face, her hands covering her eyes as she sobbed uncontrollably.


Joyce's friends had discreetly vanished, leaving only a few behind who observed the unfolding drama with a mix of amusement and disbelief.


Joyce's lips trembled as she clutched Caiden's arm,her tear-filled eyes wide with despair. "Dad, I've never been so humiliated in my life! How can l possibly face my friends after this? Daniela set the whole thing up. She's obsessed with tearing me down and making me a joke!"


Around them, some bystanders discreetly extracted their phones to capture the family's distress,quickly taking pictures before vanishing into the crowd.


Jerry, apparently oblivious to the unfolding drama,picked up an incoming call. He spoke in a booming voice, not bothering to lower his tone, ensuring that Caiden and Katrina caught every word.


"Hello? Yes, I'm terribly sorry about the holdup.
understand we agreed to reserve the space next to the restroom for your cleaning supplies store, but there's been a bit of a scene here. You know how Ms.Harper is always kind-hearted. She insisted we let them have a look first. But I wouldn't worry-they're notoriously fussy. Give me half an hour.If they pass on it, I'll ring you straight back and we can finalize the paperwork. Alright, appreciate your patience."


After ending the call, Jerry swiveled back to face the group, his voice edged with impatience. "Are you interested in the space or not? If you're not,there are plenty of others waiting in line for it."


Joyce, her face streaked with tears, looked imploringly at Caiden and Katrina.


The air hung heavy for a brief moment before Joyce's emotions spilled over in a heart-wrenching wail.

###Chapter 53 I'm On Board




Joyce was crying uncontrollably. Katrina, unable to bear seeing her daughter like this, felt as though her heart was breaking into pieces.


Without caring about her pride, she dropped to the floor,her body trembling.


Throwing her head back, she let out a loud, heart-wrenching wail.

"Caiden, after all these years of marriage, do you have any idea how many people have laughed at me behind my back? How many have pointed fingers and whispered about me? I put up with all of it-because l love you! I loved you so deeply that I endured the pain. You have no idea how proud I once was. But for you, I surrendered it all-my pride, my dignity, my sense of self-worth. You said that if I married you,you would take care of everything outside the home,while I would be in charge of everything inside. And I trusted you. Throughout the years, I've treated Daniela like my own daughter. I gave her more love and attention than I ever gave Joyce! Tell me,how many stepmothers would sacrifice so much for their stepchild? When I decided to marry you, everyone told me it would bring nothing but trouble, that being a stepmother would be nothing but heartache. But l turned a deaf ear to them, all because I love you. And what about Joyce? Hasn't she treated you well? From the moment she became part of this family, she called you 'Dad.! She's always been respectful and kind to you, year after year! And Daniela? Has she ever called me 'Mom' even once? Not a single time!I let it slide, convincing myself it wasn't important. But today,Daniela crossed the line! She humiliated both Joyce and me in front of everyone. I'm too old to endure this kind of shame. I feel like I might as well just disappear!"

She tilted her head back dramatically, as though she intended to smash it against the vase she was holding in her hands.


Just before she could act, she shot a meaningful glance at Joyce. Without hesitation, Joyce flung herself against a nearby pillar, wailing dramatically. "I might as well die too!"


Caiden, visibly shaken by the drama, stormed out in frustration. He grabbed a phone from a passerby, his mind racing with anger. Once the call connected, his voice thundered through the receiver. "Daniela! If you want to avoid your father dropping dead in your posh building today, you better get down here now! You've got five minutes!"


Meanwhile, Daniela had just put pen to paper on a long-term deal for an incredibly lucrative contract.


Her mood was cool and composed, unaffected by the chaos unfolding below.


Once the call ended, she opened the message she had sent to Caiden the day before.


Just as she was about to head downstairs, Cedric arrived at her office. She asked him to wait a little while inside.
However, her secretary, arriving late, carelessly mentioned something about Katrina and Caiden being downstairs. Without wasting a second,Cedric turned and quickly took another elevator, heading straight for the basement.


Lillian, ever close behind, followed Daniela every step of the way.


As the elevator descended, the chaotic scene in the basement came into view. Katrina was seated on the floor, crying uncontrollably, while Joyce clung to a pillar, her sobs just as theatrical.


Caiden stood nearby, hands firmly on his hips, his head lowered as though he were fighting to keep his fury in check.


The sharp click of Daniela's heels on the floor immediately caught Caiden's attention. His gaze shot up, his cold, furious eyes locking onto her face.


That face-so eerily similar to the one that had tormented him for years. The face of the woman who had once made him feel insignificant and weak.
His chest swelled with rage. Without a second thought, he stormed towards her and slapped her in the face.


The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the entire basement, bouncing off the cold walls.


Everything stopped.


The chatter of shopkeepers, the footsteps of passersby, and the hum of the crowd all vanished as people froze, their attention now drawn to the sudden noise.


Lillian stood rooted to the spot, her eyes wide with shock, unable to process what had just happened.


Cedric, stepping out of the elevator just as the slap echoed, felt a tightness in his chest. Without thinking, he sprang into action and rushed towards the scene.


In the heavy silence that followed, one person remained composed. It was Daniela.


She stood firm, her eyes steady and unwavering.Her hands had initially balled into fists, but she slowly relaxed them, choosing calm over reaction.


The sound of hurried footsteps echoed behind her,and before Daniela could fully grasp the situation,she was enveloped in a warm embrace.


For a brief moment, the burden in her chest lightened. She looked up, her eyes catching the man's collarbone, his strong Adam's apple, and the familiar scent of his cologne.


The scent stirred something in her, as if she had smelled it before. Yet, she couldn't quite place where.


"Daniela! You ungrateful bitch! You're just as cruel as your mother!"


Regaining her composure, Daniela pulled away from the embrace. Noticing it was Cedric, she whispered quietly,"Thank you."


She then turned to face Caiden-the man who claimed to be her father.

His face contorted with fury, his hand shaking as he pointed an accusatory finger at her.


"I always wanted you to be nothing like your mother.I dreamed of you being obedient and compassionate.I imagined you as gentle, kind, and pure-not corrupted by the murky manipulations of the business world. When you were after Alexander, you were so innocent, so soft, like a helpless little lamb!How did you turn into someone so heartless, so driven by nothing but greed and power?"


He pointed fiercely at Katrina. "This is your mother!"His finger then swept over to Joyce. "And this is your sister! And yet, you've turned on both of them! Yes,you're the CEO of Elite Lux now, but does that mean you have the right to crush your family's dignity?To disgrace us in front of the world? Daniela! Do you have any idea how much you've hurt them?"


Daniela stood there, silent, her eyes fixed on the man before her-the man who had just slapped her, right in front of everyone.


She longed to ask him if he realized the pain he had caused her, if she was unworthy of his affection and care, or if he only valued the manipulated, lesser version of her from before.


These questions had haunted her ever since her mother's death, since Katrina brought Joyce into the Harper family and took control, and since the countless meals Daniela spent with the servants while her father enjoyed his dinners with his new family.


She had asked herself time and again. Was she not also a Harper?


But today, Daniela didn't ask-not because she couldn't, but because she didn't want to.


The slap had already spoken volumes.


Asking would only deepen her humiliation.


Besides, she had grown accustomed to living without her father's affection or care and standing alone,bearing the weight of blame and criticism.


Fine, if this was her fate, then so be it.
She lifted her chin, standing tall. Her cheek burned,swollen and red from the slap, but her stance was unshaken, and her movements flowed with elegance.


Daniela met Caiden's gaze, her voice steady and frosty. "I never said the 18th to 20th floors were for Joyce. From the start, I told Alexander it was the basement level. I even informed you about this yesterday. If things got out of hand, it's because you allowed it to happen. Why didn't you ask Joyce why she made those bold claims before checking the facts? Why didn't you question Katrina for not teaching her daughter to be self-aware? My money doesn't come easily, so why should I give away valuable real estate? You've always shown favoritism.I've spent so many years trying to earn your approval, trying to be the daughter you wanted-obedient,well-behaved.But now..."



She paused, her eyes bloodshot and filled with a mixture of deep sorrow and overwhelming fatigue.


Caiden's stomach twisted. He couldn't understand why, but an unfamiliar dread crept over him, a sensation he hadn't felt in years. It reminded him of the time Daniela's mother had almost rejected him-the time when he feared losing the only chance to improve his life.


His voice wavered as he asked, "What now?"


Daniela's lips curled into a fragile smile. Her usual radiant beauty now seemed shattered. "Now I realize you're no different from Alexander. No matter what 1do, no matter how much I give, I'll never get the one thing I truly want from you. And if that's the reality,then I don't see why I should keep making the effort.You wanted to sever ties with me. Fine. I'm on board.Starting today,immediately."


She straightened, her posture resolute. "For me, this is a matter of finality. I'lI have my lawyers prepare the documents and send them over. After that, there's no need for us to meet again."


She held Caiden's gaze for a brief moment before turning and walking away without saying another word.
###Chapter 54 Confident





Caiden's irritation simmered just beneath the surface, growing with each step Daniela took away from him.


Unable to contain his frustration, he bellowed, "You think you can just cut ties with me? I'll make damn sure that doesn't happen!"


Daniela had turned from a nondescript girl to a golden goose. Severing ties with her was unthinkable, an option only conceivable if he were six feet under.



Katrina jumped to her feet, worried Caiden would act on impulse and actually cut ties with Daniela.


"You're absolutely right, Caiden! She doesn't get to walk away from us like we're nothing! She's stuck being your daughter, and that means when we're old,she has to take care of us!"
Standing up with fiery determination, Joyce exclaimed, "Exactly!"


Overhearing the conversation, Cedric balled his hands into fists, the knuckles whitening as he struggled to restrain his mounting anger.


Meanwhile, Jerry, who had been quietly observing the chaos, rolled his eyes in exasperation.He moved briskly towards the door, locking it with a definitive,echoing click.


Katrina, noticing his actions, seized his arm urgently."What the hell are you doing locking that? We're not done here!"



Jerry paused, taking a deep breath as he fought to maintain his calm. "Are you serious? Do you even grasp the gravity of your actions? You slapped Ms.Harper in her own building! And yet, you dare to ask about running a shop? Can you even hear yourself talk?"

His expression contorted with rage, and for a fleeting second, it seemed like he was ready to break someone's jaw.


Jerry's devotion to Daniela was unwavering. During his family's darkest times, Daniela had been his beacon of support, and he vowed to remain indebted to her forever.


Witnessing someone as kind-hearted as Daniela endure a public humiliation at the hands of her own father was more than he could bear.


Jerry's rage simmered beneath the surface.


The issue wasn't that the elderly were deteriorating into malevolence. Rather, it was the wicked who aged without mending their ways.


Seething with anger, Jerry marched away from the scene. Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her gaze fixed on the locked door of the shop.


Despite being tucked away in the basement, the space was far superior to any other she could have dreamt of securing.


Joyce pulled at her mother's sleeve and murmured,
"Mom, maybe this place isn't all that bad?"


Katrina, still visibly distraught and mortified by the day's events, felt a pang of bitterness towards Caiden. She had never imagined he would lose his composure and strike Daniela.

When he was supposed to act, he held back. And when it was better to stay quiet, he ran his mouth like an idiot and ruined it all.


The words slipped from her lips before she realized it.


Caiden whirled around, his expression a mix of shock and disbelief. "What did you just say? After all this mess, you're pointing the finger at me? Do you even get who I was risking everything for?"


With that, he turned around and stormed away, not once glancing back.


Katrina, jolted back to reality by her own blunder,stood frozen, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. Beside her, Joyce shifted uncomfortably, her eyes darting between the closed shop door and Caiden's receding figure.


Memories of her lost virginity flooded back, and she suddenly burst into tears.


The news that the CEO of Elite Luix had been publicly humiliated was rapidly spreading across social media.



The moment Alexander exited the meeting, the scandal's details began to unravel before him.



He slammed the contract down on the table with a resounding thud and dialed Katrina's number.



The phone barely rang before she answered, her voice laced with accusation. "Alexander! How could you let this happen? You never mentioned that Daniela's offer was just for the basement spot! Now look at the mess you've caused. Caiden actually hit Daniela, right there in front of everyone, and now she's refusing to let us lease any space at all. What are we supposed to do now?"
Alexander opened his mouth to protest, but Katrina crushed his attempt, her words slicing through him like a blade. "I don't give a damn how you fix it,but you better clean up this disaster for us."


Stunned into silence, Alexander could only listen.


No sooner had Katrina ended the call than Joyce's name flashed on his screen. Her voice, shaky and tear-streaked, filled his ear. "Alexander, please,you have to convince Daniela to reconsider. I'll take the basement if that's what it takes. Just make sure everything is crystal clear next time, okay? My dad's absolutely furious. Just fix this and let me know when it's done. I really have to go."


Without waiting for a response, she disconnected the call, leaving Alexander grappling with the chaos that unfolded.


Alexander shut his eyes, his chilling presence sending shivers down his secretary's spine.


At that moment, his phone buzzed-a call from Richard. "I've heard Daniela has been in close contact with Clayton Renovation recently. Take advantage of her recent ordeal with that slap to dig for information. We can't afford to let this lucrative opportunity slip through our fingers."


The project was worth billions, and Richard's concern was palpable, especially since Daniela's team had yet to reach out to Bennett Group for a collaboration.



"You should invite Daniela over for dinner," Richard urged, convinced they needed to act rather than wait passively. "She's a young woman, and after today's events, she's undoubtedly shaken. A comforting visit from you, a few compassionate words-she might just be moved. And with the residual affection she harbors for you, who knows? Sparks might fly again.Alexander, stop messing around and get serious about it. Let's arrange a family dinner tonight. I've had my disagreements with Daniela, but this evening is an ideal moment to mend fences. Whether it's forging a business alliance or considering a union,both parties stand to gain."
Richard's words were so meticulously/ crafted that even Alexander's secretary sensed the deliberate nature of his manipulation.


When the call was disconnected, the secretary turned to Alexander. "This time, it might be harder than you think."


Alexander shot a dismissive glance at his secretary and responded with a cold snort, "Perhaps for others, but not when Daniela is involved.I know I can handle her."



Richard's ongoing disputes with Daniela were hardly a secret. He had previously belittled her, consistently ridiculing her capabilities and dismissing her as inconsequential with his sharp, disdainful comments.


However, Richard's current strategy involved winning her over with displays of warmth and apparent sincerity. Daniela had always yearned for the familial bonds and affection that had eluded her during her upbringing, and Richard's wvell-rehearsed charm and courteous demeanor were likely to thaw her resolve.
Turning back to his secretary, Alexander commanded, "Fetch the navy-blue suit from my wardrobe."


It was Daniela's favorite suit on him, yet he had deliberately shunned wearing it before.


Likely, it had been neglected and gathering dust in his closet for some time now.
###Chapter 55 I No Longer Have A Father

Daniela had been slapped by her father.


The entire staff at Elite Lux was very angry.


Daniela, however, quietly went to her office, sat in her chair, and stared at a video.


The video showed Joyce at a bar, standing on a table with a glass in her hand. Her carefree and bold attitude was on full display as she loudly announced to the crowd, "Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She's nothing compared to me!"



Daniela's hand shook ever so slightly as she clutched 
her phone.


So, this was the truth.Growing up, she always had this nagging feeling that her father didn't love her.


When her mother was alive, he made an effort to pretend.


Once her mother died, he completely distanced himself, and Daniela naively believed it was because he was drowning in grief over her death.


Yet, before her mother's funeral had even ended, he had already remarried.


Daniela was left stunned and utterly confused.


She tried to rationalize it in every way she could.Maybe he needed someone to help him cope, or perhaps he was so lost in missing her mother that he couldn't express it. After all, love didn't always have to be spoken; maybe he carried it silently.


She knew her father was still young, and it wasn't entirely fair to expect him to live alone for the rest of his life.

 But everything changed on one blistering afternoon when the central air conditioning broke down,jolting her awake from the suffocating heat.


Wanting to find out if there was a power outage, she stepped out of her room.


But as soon as she entered the living room, she froze in her tracks.


There, in the middle of the room, was Katrina.She was wearing her mother's clothes, sitting on Caiden's lap. The sound of their labored breathing filled the room, like an unbearable echo.


She overheard Caiden telling Katrina, "Katrina,I love you and only you. That awful woman is finally gone.She used her money to control me, but what man would tolerate being treated like a servant? All she ever did was earn money-she was useless for anything else. A woman who can't even make a man happy...What kind of woman is that? Katrina, it's only after meeting you that I've learned what it feels like to be a real man. You are the wife I've chosen to spend my life with."
It was a scorching summer day, and as Daniela stood at the top of the stairs, everything in her life seemed to fall apart.


She saw them in the living room, locked in a sweaty embrace, their faces flushed and dazed. Without a second thought, she ran to her room, leaned over the toilet, and retched uncontrollably.


To everyone else, Caidenappeared to be the ideal husband and a loving father.


No one could have imagined that behind his respectable front hid a heart so twisted and depraved it was impossible to see.


Lost in her thoughts, Daniela didn't notice when the office door creaked open.



Joyce's harsh words-"He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he's reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed"-played on an endless loop in her mind.



She clung to every word like a punishment, as though engraving Caiden's cruelty into her memory,hurting herself over and over.


Then, a hand took the phone from her fingers.


Daniela blinked, snapping out of her daze, looking up in confusion.


Before she could process what was happening,someone knelt down in front of her, wrapping her in a comforting embrace.


Cedric's steady, low voice filled the quiet room.


"Daniela! You're not alone. Don't be scared. I'll always be by your side."


In that instant, Daniela let her guard down,surrendering her strength as she leaned into his shoulder.


She wasn't one to cry.


Since that summer, she hadn't shed a tear.


Caiden hitting her wasn't new; she never cried.


But now, as Cedric held her close, his voice trembling more than hers, whispering that she didn't need to be afraid, her eyes began to fill.


It felt like walking alone for ages down a dark,desolate path. She could pretend it didn't hurt,and saying it aloud seemed unnecessary. Yet, the moment someone stood up for her, the floodgates opened, and the emotions she'd buried for so long spilled out uncontrollably.


Cedric's heart broke into pieces. The woman he had cherished for so many years cried quietly against his shoulder.His chest tightened with so much pain that it felt like he couldn't breathe.



The night gradually settled in.


Daniela stared into the darkened sky and murmured,"Cedric, from this moment on, I no longer have a father."
###Chapter 56 Just Try lt




Cedric's heart clenched with pain.


Daniela rested against his shoulder, her exhaustion finally overcoming her as she drifted into a deep sleep.


Cedric carefully lifted her into the office's lounge.Outside, Lillian, sensing the quiet that had settled in,hesitated before quietly peeking through the door.


Her voice was soft and cautious as she asked, "ls she doing any better?"


Cedric gently tucked a blanket around Daniela before quietly stepping out of the room.


As soon as they were outside the office, Lillian couldn't contain her anger any longer and exploded in the hallway.


"I'll kill Caiden! I'll make him pay! What kind of monster does that? He's her father! How could he hurt her like that? And now these rumors online,saying she's not Caiden's daughter? Otherwise,why would he treat her like this? I want answers too,damn it!"


As she trailed behind Cedric, she couldn't hold back her frustration and shot him a barrage of questions."Where are you going?"


With a grim look, Cedric didn't respond and made his way upstairs.


Once there, he asked Josie for some ice cubes,then wrapped them carefully in a towel before heading back downstairs.



Lillian slowly picked up on the dangerous vibe coming from Cedric.


It hit her in that moment. While her words about killing Caiden were just heated talk, Cedric was a man of quiet action.


He stepped into Daniela's lounge, carefully pressing the ice against her swollen cheek.


His brow tightened in sympathy, as though he were the one who had been hurt.


Lillian stood there and was about to speak when the secretary quietly entered the room.


He took a quick look at Daniela, who was asleep,before turning his attention to Lillian. "Alexander Bennett wants to discuss something with Ms.Harper."


Lillian furrowed her brow in response. What could that bastard possibly want to talk about now, of all times? Was he trying to take advantage of Daniela's vulnerability?


Seething, Lillian turned and snapped, "Did he say what he wants?"


The secretary noticed Cedric's stern expression and hesitated, unsure if speaking would provoke a harsh glare from him.


He paused,trying to gather his thoughts. Cedric, sensing the delay, turned his head sharply and demanded, "What does he want to discuss?"


The secretary stuttered, "He said...he came to settle Joyce's store rent, and then..."


Before the secretary could continue, a sudden chill swept through the air, affecting both Lillian and him.


As they pieced it together, Cedric had already stormed out.



His departing figure exuded a chilling, threatening energy, like someone consumed by rage.


Alexander was taken aback as Cedric appeared from Daniela's office.


Cedric advanced, his expression dark and full of menace."What do you want?"


Alexander hesitated and briefly looked towards Daniela's office, but Cedric moved to block his line of sight.


"I have some matters to discuss with Daniela. Didn't the secretary inform you?"


Cedric's voice was icy. "She's not available right now."



Despite his many grievances and doubts, Alexander hesitated under Cedric's intense stare. "Then I'll wait for her."


Cedric's eyes narrowed as he spoke, his tone laden with authority. "She isn't meeting with anyone today."


Alexander was aware of why she was unavailable and responded calmly, "I understand. That's why my father has invited her to dinner at our house today.I'll wait outside until she's free." He glanced at the time and added, "There's still two hours left in the workday,so no need to rush."


Cedric's secretary knew that in these situations,Cedric typically didn't say much. But today, things were different.


In a low, commanding tone, Cedric repeated,"I told you, Daniela isn't seeing anyone today!"
Alexander's expression tightened, and he squared his shoulders, meeting Cedric's gaze with a defiant stance. "Do you think Daniela is your property?How can you make decisions for her without even consulting her? Sure, you might have influence now,but that doesn't mean everyone has to bow to your will. Daniela deserves the freedom to make her own choices. And just so you know, I'm not here with any ulterior motives. I'm just trying to offer some kindness. Her family dynamics aren't great, so I'm doing what I can to help. I'llpay for Joyce's rent.Daniela's upset, and I've even had my family prepare a meal for her. What's wrong with that?"



His words rang with a sense of self-righteousness.


Just as Lillian was about to respond, a flash of cold fury crossed Cedric's face, followed by the sharp crack of a fist striking something hard. The impact was deafening.


Alexander stumbled backward, losing his balance before crashing to the floor in a clumsy heap. 
The entire room stood frozen in shock.


Even Alexander seemed dazed by what had just happened. Wiping blood from the corner of his mouth, he rose to his feet, preparing to confront Cedric.


At that moment, Ryan stepped out of the elevator,deliberately tripping Alexander, sending him crashing to the floor again, this time face down.


Determined, Alexander tried to get up once more,but Cedric quickly stepped in front of Ryan, blocking his path.


With a pointed finger aimed at Alexander, Cedric growled, "Try it, and you'll regret it!"


Alexander's hand curled into a tight fist at his side,his fury evident.
###Chapter 57 Do Whatever It Takes





Alexander hesitated and didn't dare to take another step.


He knew all too well that his family's businesses were deeply tied to Phillips Group.


Acting on impulse might feel satisfying in the moment, but the consequences would be disastrous.How could he face his family afterward?


Alexander wiped the blood from his lips with the back of his hand, his face flushed with humiliation.Without saying another word, he began to walk away.


Just as he made his first move, Cedric's icy voice rang out, stopping him in his tracks. "Wait."


Alexander spun around, his expression cold.


Cedric's gaze locked onto him, and his voice was sharp. "Earlier, you questioned whether Daniela was my property and why I had any say in her life. Let me set you straight. Daniela is not my property. But from this moment on, anyone who dares to harm her will have to answer to me first. Don't even thnk about dragging the Harper family back into her life. I couldn't care less who they are-every one of them will deal with me. And as for you-don't come here acting like you suddenly care about her.You had your chance when she was your wife. Now? It's too late for any of that."


Cedric tilted his head, his eyes briefly turning upward to the security camera overhead. Without breaking his intense stare, he turned to Ryan and gave a firm command. "Upload the footage to every platform and make it the hottest topic everywhere. I want the world to hear this. Daniela has someone who cares for her, someone who will fight for her. From now on,she'll have the life she deserves. Every tear she sheds will be one of happiness, not from putting up with scum like this."



As soon as he finished speaking, Ryan and the rest of the group erupted into applause.
Alexander's expression contorted in embarrassment as he turned and hobbled off.


That evening, social media went wild. The servers nearly crashed from the overwhelming surge of traffic.


The leading headline, clear and direct, declared,"Daniela Has Someone Who Cares About Her!"


Those words were enough to set off a worldwide storm, accumulating billions of views and a flood of comments.


"This could be right out of a romance novel. His protectiveness is off the charts-total CEO-in-love energy."


"Did Cedric just declare his love for Daniela to the world? This has to be a confession, right? Please tell me I'm not imagining tis!"


"Don't try to tell me this is just a 'friendship' thing-l won't buy it!"


"This has to be love! OMG, I'm melting. I believe in love again because of this!"


"I'm in tears. Daniela's been through so much, but now, finally, she has someone by her side. Cedric and Daniela are my new favorite couple!"


"Daniela truly deserves this. Her father never loved her, her mother passed away, her ex-husband was cruel, and her stepsister stabbed her in the back,but now she has Cedric. Every ounce of suffering she endured brought her to this point. It was all worth it!"


"Wasn't Cedric supposed to be the 'cold,untouchable CEO'? The 'stone-faced, allergic-to-women' type? Seems like he was just waiting for Daniela all along!"


"OMG, where is Daniela? Why hasn't she said anything yet? I need some updates now!"


As the comments flooded in, the hashtag took over every platform.


Yet,Daniela stayed quiet and offered no reply.


Meanwhile, the Bennett family became the target of public mockery, their reputation being dragged through the dirt.


Richard spent the whole night compulsively checking the second trending topic.


"Alexander Takes a Hit and Does Nothing?"


The comments were harsh, ripping into both Alexander and the Bennett family.


"Ugh, this guy is revolting! Alexander, was it? What does the Bennett family even do? Whatever it is, I'm done with them for good!"


"What a joke! Daniela literally told him the shop was on basement level one. But instead of clearing things up with Joyce, this spineless guy let the whole misunderstanding blow up. Now Daniela's been slapped, cut off from her family, and here comes Alexander, acting like some big shot, offering to pay for Joyce's shop rent. Where was this 'generosity'when it actually counted?"


"I watched the surveillance footage and almost lost my lunch. Alexander, are you seriously this shameless? You completely overlooked Daniela when she was just a regular woman. But now that she's the CEO of Elite Lux, you're suddenly crawling out of the woodwork? And offering to take her to dinner? What,you think she needs your charity?"


"Oh my God, check this out-I just found a clip where Richard straight up says Daniela wasn't 'good enough' to marry into the Bennett family. And he said it in public! Richard's been dismissing her for years,acting like she'd only ever be some pretty, useless trophy wife!"


"It all makes sense now. Elite Lux just bought the largest plot of land in the Northern District to develop a commercial center. The Bennetts are in construction and renovation. Now they're clearly desperate to collaborate with her That's why they're back, offering dinner invites!"


Underneath all these furious comments, one word kept popping up, bold and loud. "Scumbag!"

 
Richard stood by the tall windows in his study, his back straight, fists tightly clenched behind him.


He took a deep breath,trying to steady the growing storm of anger inside him.


He spun around to face Alexander, his tone hard and unforgiving. "I don't care what it takes. You will fix your relationship with Daniela. You'll make sure we secure that partnership with Phillips Group. Do you understand? The North District project is vital,and we can't afford to lose it! And what's going on with those trending topics? They've been live for hours,making this family look like fools! Are you so incompetent that you can't even get them taken down?"1


Alexander closed his eyes briefly. "I've tried.The trending topics were pinned by a hacker. Even the admins can't take them down."



The sharp sound of a slap rang out through the room.


"Idiot!" Richard spat. "You better listen carefully. Do whatever it takes. Meet with Daniela. Clean up this mess. Lock in that partnership."
###Chapter 58 Not A Single Word




Alexander clenched his jaw, his face clouded with frustration. "Got it."


As he stepped out of the house, he checked his phone. There was nothing-no calls, no messages from the Harper family.


Not a single word of reassurance.


It felt as though they hadn't noticed the storm brewing.


But Alexander knew better. The trending topics were everywhere, the entire city was calling him a scumbag-there was no way the Harper family hadn't seen it.


He'd tried to help Joyce, even offering to cover her shop rent, and this was how things turned out. He'd been publicly humiliated, made to look like a fool,and yet, the Harper family hadn't said a word. Not a single person came to his defense.


All those warm, loving "Alexander" greetings they used to throw his way? They were nothing but empty words.


The realization hit him hard, and a cold,uncomfortable feeling settled deep in his chest.


He looked at his secretary. "Get me information on what Daniela's been up to lately. I need to meet with her."


The secretary gave a nod. "Got it, sir."


Meanwhile, Caiden sat in the living room, unruffled,while Joyce cried loudly beside him.


"It's all my fault! Alexander only got tangled in this because of me!" Joyce wailed. "He was helping me with that shop, and now everyone's attacking him.Dad, you have to get Harper Group's PR team to step in and help him. They're destroying him online!"


Caiden kept watering his plants, his face showing no emotion. "Is that so?" he muttered without looking up.


"Yes!" Joyce's frustration spiked. "Dad, haven't you seen what's trending?"


Caiden didn't even glance up. He casually snipped away at a leaf with his pruning scissors, taking his time, completely unbothered. The truth was, he couldn't care less. He was Daniela's father, and nothing could change that, no matter what was happening around him. And honestly, he wasn't keen on jumping into the chaos. Some people online had already started calling him a "terrible father." If he spoke up to defend Alexander now, wouldn't that only open the door for even more criticism?


Caiden sighed deeply, then finally turned to face Joyce."Getting roasted online happens to everyone.Alexander's still young. A bit of criticism won't kill him."


Joyce's frustration boiled over. "Dad! You're just scared, aren't you? Scared of Daniela! Scared of what people are saying online!" Caiden's eyes shot towards her, but Joyce wasn't backing down. "And I bet you're scared of Cedric too,right?"


For a brief moment, something flashed in Caiden's eyes, but he quickly hid it behind a stoic expression.However, Joyce didn't miss it, and with a sharp gesture, she pointed at him. "I knew it! You're afraid of Cedric!"


Caiden let out a small sigh, pursing his lips as he stood there for a mnoment. "Yeah, I'm scared. Now what? Who isn't terrified of Cedric in Olisvine? If Alexander wasn't afraid, why didn't he fight back when Cedric hit him? And now you wvant me, with my old, fragile body, to step in and fight for him? You should be ashamed!"


Caiden dismissed her with a wave, clearly fed up with her complaining.


As he turned back to his plants, a strange thought slowly crept into his mind.


Daniela had never been like this. She never cried for hours or threw tantrums. In fact, she reminded him so much of her mother-strong, unshakable, like wild grass that stood firm even in the harshest storms.



Caiden stopped, his pruning scissors frozen in mid-air.


Maybe he had overstepped with that slap. It had been more forceful than he had meant it to be.


Katrina had been sitting nearby, watching the whole thing unfold. That morning, Bennett Group's stock had taken a dive, trading was halted, and the online boycott showed no sign of slowing down.


She blinked, her mind working. She noticed the brief flicker of regret in Caiden's eyes and made up her mind.



Slowly walking towards him, she spoke in a calm,reassuring voice. "Caiden, that slap was a bit too much."


Caiden turned to look at her, a mix of annoyance and regret on his face. "You're right. Why didn't you step in and stop me?"


He sighed deeply, massaging the back of his neck."I'm not even sure if Daniela will really go through with cutting ties. She's running Elite Lux now,and if she turns her back on us, it'll be a huge loss for me!"


Katrina nodded with understanding. "Exactly! And Jerry's the one to blame. He kept fueling the fire,making everything worse. If it hadn't been for him, it wouldn't have escalated so badly. You know how Daniela lost her mother young, and I've always treated her like my own. Seeing you hit her yesterday really hurt. Let's not make this worse. How about we go over today, bring her a gift, and apologize? At the end of the day, we're family. There's no need to let other people see us fighting and give them something to talk about."


Caiden paused, his brow furrowing in thought. "But I'm her father. If I apologize, won't everyone laugh at me? It'll be a disaster if people find out."


Katrina gave him a comforting smile. "Not at all.People will look at you and think, 'Wow, Mr. Harper is such a loving parent-so forgiving, so kind-hearted,not holding any grudges against his daughter.'"


Caiden's scowl eased just a bit.


Sensing she was getting through to him,Katrina pressed on, a playful edge to her voice. "Daniela has always been so understanding. If she doesn't forgive us, I'll get down on my knees and beg her for it."


Caiden's eyes widened, his voice turning sharp and cold once more. "She wouldn't dare! Who does she think she is? Just us showing up to apologize is already a huge honor to her! If she expects anything more, she's completely out of her mind. You know what? Forget the apology. We'll just send a fruit basket instead. That should be more than enough.It's just Daniela-we're not dealing with royalty here!"



As he spoke, his anger bubbled up, spilling over into muttered curses.



A faint smile crossed Katrina's lips, pleased that she had guided him exactly where she wanted.
Joyce, who had been silently watching the entire exchange, stared wide-eyed. Then, she gave Katrina a thumbs-up.



That was impressive!


Daniela sank into a deep slumber, yet peace seemed out of reach.



Her dreams pulled her back to that unforgettable summer afternoon.


She was just five years old, her small hands tightly gripping a doll. The sun blazed overhead, and the thick summer heat filled the air. The sharp sound of something heavy crashing to the ground rang out behind her.


Daniela, still holding her doll, turned around in curiosity. As she glanced over her shoulder, her gaze locked onto the horrifying sight of her mother's lifeless body. Blood was streaming from her mother's eyes, and her form lay twisted on the ground.


The sunlight reflected off the fresh blood, turning the ground a bright shade of red. It spead out like a strange,unsettling field of roses.


Daniela remained still, silent, unable to comprehend.Medics arrived, followed by the police.


She remembered Caiden sitting nearby, histears flowing as he played the part of the heartbroken husband. Then the rain began to fall, soaking the pavement. The blood mingled with the water,spreading out like roses in full bloom, only this time with a violent, unsettling force.


Her mother was gone, without so much as a word,not even a note or a farewell.


For years, Daniela had been tormented by that day.Why had her mother jumped?


Why? Why had she left nothing behind?


Was it because she was just as unworthy in her mother's eyes as she had always been in Caiden's?
###Chapter 59 Heartache





Tears slipped quietly down Daniela's face,her eyes shut tightly against whatever torment was chasing her in her dreams.



Cedric stood motionless beside the bed, his brows knit together in concern.


Josie walked in, looked over at Daniela, then turned to Cedric. "It looks like Ms. Harper is having a nightmare."


Cedric froze, his body tense, a sudden wave of shock rushing through him. He turned to Josie, his voice cutting through the air like ice. "What did you just say?"


"It never crossed my mind before, but now l've come to understand that Ms. Harper has a habit of sleepwalking. It doesn't follow any predictable pattern, but it always occurs in enclosed areas. One night, her bedroom door was left slightly open. I woke up and found her just sitting there in the dark living room. I tried calling her name, but she didn't even flinch, so I decided to sit down with her. After nearly an hour, she got up, walked back to her room,and lay down like nothing had happened. I followed behind, just to be sure everything was fine,but she showed no signs of being aware during the entire ordeal. The following morning, I brought it up, but she had no memory of having sleepwalked the night before. She said it's been a thing since she was just five years old. She told me, 'If you ever see me sleepwalking, don't freak out. Just make sure the doors and windows are locked. I usually stop when l bump into something.' I asked her if she'd ever gone to a doctor about it, but she just laughed and brushed it off. She mentioned that her childhood had been chaotic, and even her mother knew about it but didn't bother doing anything. Eventually, she just learned to deal with it and didn't think much of it anymore."


Josie paused for a moment, then spoke again."Afterwards, I made it a habit to check on her. Some nights, I'd wake up and feel the need to look in.There was one night I heard her crying softly. It was faint and restrained, as though she was trying to keep it hidden. When I looked in, she was still asleep.But she was crying. It was gut-wrenching to witness."


She shifted her gaze from Daniela to Cedric."The same thing is happening again."


Cedric's hands curled into tight fists, and his entire frame was shaking uncontrollably.


Caiden had known all along, but he had turned a blind eye.


She had cried so painfully in her sleep before, just like she was now.


Her words struck him like a punch to the gut, each syllable driving the blade of guilt further into his chest. It felt like his chest might cave in fromn the sheer intensity of his feelings, his breathing ragged,as though he was drowning in it all.

Noticing his pain, Josie offered quiet reassurance. "Maybe it's just the aftermath of yesterday. Facing such cold treatment from her own family-it's more than anyone should endure. But things will improve.She's awvay from the Harpers now. She has Elite Lux,and, most importantly, she has you. Give it time, and she'll heal.Her future will shine."


She then slipped out of the room.


Lillian shifted slightly at the faint sound of the door closing. She opened her eyes briefly, glanced at Daniela, still sleeping soundly, and sank back into the couch. It wasn't long before her light snores resumed.



Cedric's focus turned back to Daniela. He observed the way the crease in her brow, which had been so tense moments earlier, was beginning to relax.


The gentle rhythm of Lillian's snores seemed to calm her, as if a quiet part of her mind registered Lillian's comforting presence.


Cedric hesitated for a second, then grabbed his phone and dialed his friend, Shaun Rodney. "Hey,
Shaun, quick question-do you know how someone can make themselves snore?"


Shaun asked, "What's this about? Did yourgirlfriend say you snore? But didn't you have that sleep test done ages ago? You're not even a snorer!"


"I'm aware I don't snore. But I want to figure out how to do it. Any suggestions?"


"Is this some kind of snoring kink? Does your girlfriend actually like snoring? Look, I'm a doctor, not some snore expert. Oh, and by the way, you were trending yesterday. Is this about Daniela? Is she the one who's into snoring?"


Cedric didn't waste time reading the rest. He exited the chat, opened his browser, and typed "how to snore" into the search bar. Just as he was about to press enter, a quiet knock came from the door.His secretary stepped in carefully, sparing a quick look at Daniela, who was still sound asleep in the bed,before speaking in a hushed tone. "Mr. Phillips, the Harpers have arrived."


Cedric's expression darkened, and he got to his feet.


The secretary paused, her discomfort clearly showing. "There's a group of reporters with them.After what happened yesterday, it looks like they're trying to do damage control, saying they came to apologize. Katrina's really laying it on thick-crying her eyes out, tears and snot all over the place. If Ms.Harper doesn't make an appearance, the media might twist it to make her look haughty or ungrateful.Elite Lux is still patching up its reputation domestically. Sir, it might be best toask Ms. Harper how she wants to deal with this."



It was clear Caiden and his group were aiming to put on a show.


A misstep in handling this could spiral into a public relations nightmare.


Earlier that morning, the Bennett family's stock had hit rock bottom, erasing tens of millions in value.During a media interview, Richard's face betrayed his growing anger and disappointment.

The secretary, ever the careful observer, could feel the gravity of the moment hanging over them.


He stole a quick glance at Cedric, who was not officially part of Daniela's life yet.


When Daniela's eyes fluttered open, the first thing she noticed was Cedric's slightly exasperated expression. Under his eyes, there was a trace of weariness,like he hadn't gotten much rest.


She propped herself up on one elbow and flashed him a small smile. "You're not heading to work today?"


She didn't bother questioning his presence.


Cedric's stern look eased a bit."Iam."


Daniela glanced at the clock on the wall, raising an eyebrow in surprise. "You're running late. It's already past nine."


"Hmm," Cedric replied with indifference.


Daniela didn't think much of his short reply and went to the bathroom to freshen up. A few minutes later,she came out and saw Cedric still sitting inthe chair.


After a brief pause, she asked, "Would you like to have breakfast with me?"


Without a second thought, Cedric said,"Sure."


Daniela stared at him, surprised. "I didn't mean it-1was just being polite."


Unbothered, Cedric shrugged and replied, "Perfect.I'm starving. Let's eat."
###Chapter 60 His Protection





Daniela's lips curved into a smile, and she was nearly out the door when the secretary darted forward, his gesture filled with urgency as though he was bursting to speak-only for Cedric's icy glare to silence him instantly.


He dropped his gaze and clamped his lips shut without a word.



Cedric turned to Daniela, his demeanor composed yet assertive. "Forget everything else; breakfast first."



At the dining table, Cedric and Daniela had breakfast silently. Nearby, the secretary lingered, his expression contorted with worry and indecision.


Shifting her gaze between Cedric and the secretary,Daniela probed, "Is there something I should know?"


The secretary glanced at Cedric, his eyes pleading 
for permission to disclose.


It wasn't until Daniela placed her utensils down that the secretary gathered enough courage to speak,his words spilling out in a hurried flood. "Ms. Harper,your father, along with Katrina, Joyce, and reporters from eight media companies, are waiting downstairs.They are adamant about meeting with you."



As this news settled, Daniela's smile waned ever so slightly. She reached for a napkin, dabbing at her lips thoughtfully, then turned to Cedric with a mischievous grin. "Is this what's been troubling you all morning? You really do care too much. Rest assured,I can handle them."


A barely audible hum rippled through Cedric's throat.


As the elevator carried them downwards, Daniela assumed Cedric would make his way back to his office.



The first floor lobby was swarming with reporters,while the manager struggled valiantly to impose some semblance of order. Cedric took a decisive step forward. His countenance was shadowy and intense, mnirroring the ominous clouds of a gathering storm, and the loud hubbub promptly hushed to a whispoer.


Even the Harper family appeared to diminish in his imposing presence. Heads dipped. The murmur of voices tapered off.


Cedric remained utterly wordless. The quiet he held spoke volumes on its own.


Poised protectively close to Daniela, with his hands relaxed in his pockets, his gaze sharply swept the crowd. His eyes, icy and penetrating, sliced through the crowd, challenging anyone bold enough to hold his stare.



His silent stance broadcast a stark warning-challenge her, and face the consequences.


Although Cedric's commitment to safeguard Daniela was public knowledge, witnessing his assertive protection firsthand was quite the spectacle.

It radiated a fierce protectiveness laced with unshakable dominance-unyielding and dangerous.


A palpable tension choked the air, causing everyone in his line of sight to gulp with apprehension.


Caiden felt a surge of panic. When the hell would Cedric stop clinging to Daniela like a damn parasite?His constant vigilance over her was throwing a wrench into their plans.


Katrina stepped back too. She was all too familiar with Cedric's persona-an untouchable tyrant with an ego to match, and absolutely no room for compromise.


Cedric stood his ground, a picture of tranquility yet undeniably commanding, his gaze downcast, his face a mask of inscrutability.


The dark circles under his eyes hinted at a lack of sleep, lending a sharpness to his features. Breaking the tense quiet, he finally spoke. "You've got something to say? Well, I'm right here-spit it out already."
His voice was smooth, almost deceptively soft, as if he were consciously tempering his words to keep the peace. Yet, beneath his calm exterior, signs of fatigue and underlying irritation were palpable,straining the nerves of everyone present.


The group opposite him paused, their anxious glances flickering from one face to another,none daring to break the silence.


Feeling the tension build, Katrina leaned closer to Caiden and discreetly nudged his arm, her gesture a silent plea for him to speak up.


Caiden cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Phillips, I noticed that today is Monday, and the financial news mentioned you're to finalize next year's contract with one of the world's top multinational corporations.You..."


What he really meant to ask-but couldn't muster the boldness to state outright-was if Cedric was supposed to be on his way already.


Instead, he framed it as an evasive, roundabout inquiry, hoping Cedric would pick up on the subtle cue. "You're not on a tight schedule, by any chance?"



Cedric, with his hands placed in the pockets of his sharp, tailored black suit, slightly tilted his head. His consistent choice of dark attire only served to deepen the formidable aura that clung to him.


Even the slightest flicker of a smirk was enough to snuff out any semblance of defiance.


When he finally spoke, his voice was deep and coarse, cutting through the thick air. "Your concern is noted,Mr.Harper."


His answer was concise-courteous, yet noncommittal.



Caiden suppressed his irritation, not daring to contest.



The air in the room thickened with tension, the silence so heavy that it felt almost suffocating.Eventually, Daniela shattered the quiet, addressing Cedric in a poised yet assertive tone. "Everything's fine here. If you've got other matters to deal with,don't worry about this-l've got it covered."


Cedric drew his hands from his pockets, his voice now soft and soothing, contrasting sharply with his earlier domineering presence.


"No rush. The signing has been rescheduled for later this afternoon."


Caiden, Katrina, and the assembled reporters all inhaled sharply in shock.


This meeting was no ordinary affair-it was a crucial discussion about an international contract worth billions of dollars. And Cedric had rescheduled it as if it were a mere inconvenience.



That very morning, a throng of media representatives and top-tier executives had converged outside the Phillips Group headquarters, all eager to witness the landmark signing of this colossal agreement. Yet now, Cedric had postponed it.
His boldness left everyone present utterly dumbfounded. Amid their astonishment, it became glaringly clear. Daniela held a place in his life so vital,no one could ever hope to fill it.


The gravity of this insight rendered the crowd deathly quiet, with nobody daring to break the silence.



"What seems to be the issue? Is it really that difficult to speak up?" Cedric grasped a chair, scraping it across the floor with a grating sound, and took a seat near the security station. Propping his chin on his hand, he leaned forward with a challenging look."Look, I'm merely here as an observer. Proceed and engage with the CEO of Elite Lux. Act as if I'm not even here."



Silence enveloped the lobby once more.


He wanted them to ignore his presence? The notion seemed absurd.


The icy, piercing sharpness of his stare was palpable.

Unless they suddenly went blind, ignoring Cedric's overbearing presence was completely out of the question.
###Chapter 61 Sweetheart


The reporters exchanged uneasy looks, unsure whether they should stay or leave the scene.

Even Caiden, who had come in with confidence, now seemed eager to leave.

But Katrina wasn't ready to let it go. She subtly tugged at Caiden's sleeve.

She'd dropped nearly twenty thousand to bring these reporters in. If they left now, it would be a total waste of all that money.

Besides, they hadn't yet accomplished what they came for.

Katrina leaned in and whispered to Caiden, "Do you want to fix things with Daniela or not?"

Caiden bit his lip, clearly wanting to say something, but after catching a glimpse of Cedric's expression,he held back.

"Daniela, I shouldn't have slapped you yesterday. I'm here to apologize. Katrina and I got up early today and made this soup just for you. Eat it, and let's put everything behind us. Yesterday was a mistake. Please don't hold it against me."

The reporters behind him were snapping photos, capturing every word and every exaggerated gesture.

Katrina smiled warmly. Rather than passing the insulated lunchbox to the secretary behind Daniela,she opened it herself.

The rich scent of soup filled the air, and the reporters began snapping shots of it.

"Come on, darling, just take one little sip, and we can forget all about what happened. Take a look around-there's a whole crowd here watching us. Even though you're the CEO of Elite Lux now, it wouldn't hurt to show a bit of respect to your dad. And as for those things you said yesterday about cutting ties, those shouldn't be said again. Do you have any idea how much it hurt your father? He sighed all night. Look at him; he's even got a white hair now, all thanks to the stress."
  Her words depicted Caiden as a caring, regretful father who deeply regretted losing his temper and slapping his daughter.

Caiden didn't hesitate to jump in, his voice dripping with self-importance. "Daniela, listen to me-you have to realize that everything I do is for your benefit. You're my daughter. If I don't look out for you, who else will? When you mentioned cutting ties yesterday, do you even understand how deeply that cut me?"

He stared at Daniela's unfeeling, distant expression, then quickly shut his eyes for a moment, cursing her silently in his mind.

He reached out to her, his insincere smile growing wider as he spoke. "Come here, sweetheart.Did I hurt you too much yesterday? Let me check."

Daniela took a step back. That look-intense and unforgiving-made a knot form in Caiden's gut.

It was a look he recognized instantly. The same one her mother had given him years ago.

Cold. Unforgiving. Relentless. A headache. Just like her late mother.

Caiden knew Daniela wouldn't fall for threats or compliments. But did it really matter? With all the reporters here,what could she do?

He'd already pretended to regret his actions. If Daniela dared to challenge him, the next day's headlines would be shouting, "Daniela Harper: The Ungrateful Daughter."

Once that label stuck, not even the top PR team at Elite Lux would be able to fix her reputation.

Reputation was the core of any business. No one would back a company led by a CEO accused of being cold-hearted toward her own family.

A surge of triumph rushed through Caiden. Being her father gave him the upper hand.

He straightened his jacket, his chest puffing out with newfound confidence.

And Cedric? Who cared? He was just another man. Sure, Cedric might scare some people, but not Caiden.
Cedric wasn't invincible, and today's little showdown made that crystal clear.
A self-satisfied grin crept across Caiden's face.

Katrina, noticing his smug expression, gave his arm a gentle tug, a reminder to tone it down. Caiden quickly wiped the smugness off his face and replaced it with a mask of warmth and concern. He turned back to Daniela and said, "Sweetheart, can you just forgive me?"

Daniela stood motionless, her cold, unflinching stare locked on Caiden.

It was the first time Caiden had used that word in years, not since she was five.

Sweetheart.

For years, she had convinced herself that she wasn't worthy-like she hadn't done enough to deserve his love.

She believed that if she worked harder, achieved more, and made herself irreplaceable, maybe, just maybe,she would finally hear him say "sweetheart."

She had waited for that word endlessly. Even when she topped her class, it never came.

When she skipped grades and joined the elite gifted program, still nothing.

And when she passed her exams at fifteen, becoming the youngest doctoral candidate in her field, it remained absent.

She had finally accepted that, no matter what she achieved, she would never hear that word come from her father, not in this lifetime.

And now, there it was. Caiden, with a forced grin, had finally said it.

The irony was almost too much to bear.

A bitter laugh escaped Daniela.

Caiden's eyes gleamed as he turned to the reporters, beaming while pointing at Daniela. "See? She's smiling. That means she's forgiven me," he said, his focus entirely on how the reporters would see him.

Katrina's face lit up, spotting her chance. "Sweetheart, you're right-your father and I messed up yesterday.
We shouldn't have put that pressure on you. The mix-up is all our fault. Joyce shouldn't have acted like that."

But Joyce couldn't stay silent and whined in objection, "Mom!"

Ignoring Joyce's outburst, Katrina kept her calm and overly sweet demeanor, turning back to Daniela. "You know, Joyce really looks up to you, Daniela. You've been her role model. But, you know how she is. She struggles with everything, poor thing. At her age, still staying at home, it's been such a concern for all of us."

Joyce stared at Katrina, her mouth hanging open, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

Even Caiden furrowed his brow, confused by Katrina's sudden criticism of Joyce.

But Daniela saw through it. Katrina wasn't just throwing Joyce under the bus-this was the beginning of her real request.

And, as expected, Katrina didn't waste any time before unveiling her true agenda.

"We're still family, right? And as family, we're supposed tohelp one another. Joyce is young and has a lot to learn.Why not take her under your wing? Let her join you at Elite Lux, help her gain some hands-on experience. She looks up to you so much, Daniela, and has always admired everything you've built with Elite Lux.Just offer her a director's role. It's no big deal-just a way for her to dip her toes in the water. I promise you, she'll give it her all."

At this, Joyce's face lit up instantly. The pout and the anger from before vanished in an instant. In their place, her lips curved into a smug, victorious smile as she looked at Daniela.

She was already imagining all the perks that came with such an impressive title.

Yes,she thought, tossing aside the idea of running a tinyclothing store-becoming a director at Elite Lux?Now that was real prestige and allure.

She was determined to become a director at Elite Lux.

Caiden was just as thrilled by Katrina's suggestion. Her plan was pure genius. If Joyce could figure out how to earn money like Daniela, he wouldn't have to worry about relying on Daniela's generosity as he aged. Joyce could support the family just as easily.

Grinning with excitement, Caiden quickly turned to Daniela and added, "Yes, exactly. Just give her a director's role."
###Chapter 62 Counterattack


Katrina was worried Daniela might decline. Her voice grew louder. "It's merely a director position, Daniela!You're now the CEO of Elite Lux, powerful and established. Are you truly reluctant to bestow such a minor role upon your own sister? Or could it be that you're worried Joyce might eclipse you?"

Daniela's lips twisted into a subtle smirk, her poise undisturbed. "Worried? Hardly."

Katrina's eyes sparkled with unexpected hope. Lately, she had become accustomed to encountering nothing but roadblocks and hadn't anticipated Daniela's apparent willingness to cooperate, especially in the presence of the press.

Beside Daniela, her secretary's brow furrowed, her gaze shifting between her boss and the eager journalists, poised to intervene.

However, Daniela continued, "A director position? It's hardly a big deal. I've only just come back to the country, and while I'm still laying my groundwork here, if my family insists on putting someone in the company, I'll graciously accept. After all, whether they share my blood or not, how could I possibly refuse?"

As her words hung in the air, Katrina's smile stiffened on her lips. The underlying sarcasm lacing Daniela's remarks did not go unnoticed, piercing her with its intended sting.

Keeping her poised and gracious air intact, Daniela carried on. "Elite Lux has been a bastion of meritocracy from the start-that's well understood. But now, my stepmother wants to dismantle years of our foundational values with her shallow speeches. Often, they talk about the challenges of being a stepmother,yet they seldom mention the trials of being a stepdaughter."

At these words, Katrina's complexion grew noticeably lighter.

Turning her attention to Joyce with a slight tilt of her head, indicating genuine curiosity, Daniela asked,"Joyce, could you share your educational background with us?"

Without hesitation,Joyce replied, "I left school before finishing high school."
Daniela regarded her with a reflective expression, her voice tinged with courteous sarcasm. "A high school dropout,then."

She lightly tapped her chin, pretending to mull over the information. "That indeed suggests a unique set of skills. I'll have to consider carefully how we might utilize your talents."

Suddenly, a look of revelation crossed her face as she turned her eyes towards Caiden.

"Dad," she called out with exaggerated sweetness.

The overly affectionate term caused Caiden to tense visibly. "Yes?"

"Could Harper Group possibly make room for Joyce? She is your daughter, cherished deeply. Surely,elevating her to the role of president wouldn't be too difficult, would it? In fact, placing her merely as a director in my company might not even do justice to her remarkablecapabilities."

Daniela's words had barely finished resonating when soft laughter began to fill the lobby.

Turning, she caught Cedric trying to suppress his amusement.

With a mock sternness, Daniela admonished him.. Phillips, I'd appreciate it if you could keep up that dignified demeanor of yours."

Cedric shrugged with a sly grin. "Alright, I wwill."

The unusual rapport between them caught everyone off guard.Yet, Daniela was not one to let the moment slide without comment. She turned to Caiden and remarked in a humble tone, "Dad, I've always known I'm not the brightest-certainly not enough to gain your approval. Yesterday, you were so upset that you struck me. Truth be told, I was as restless as you were last night. After much reflection, I've realized something crucial:with my modest abilities, I'm simply not suited to take over Harper Group. So please, don't burden yourself with thoughts of having another child with my stepmother. Just give the reins to Joyce. She truly is your pride and joy. As for me, I'll bow out gracefully. I have no intention of vying for the family's legacy any longer."

The reporters marveled at her generosity.
Daniela lowered her head slightly, exhaling a deep sigh. "That slap really put things into perspective for me.I wouldn't dream of contending for anything anymore."

Her declaration ignited a surge of outrage among the reporters. The crowd was outraged. What twisted father would drive his daughter to turn her back on her birthright?

As Caiden and Katrina stood there, their shock was palpable.

Caiden's face twisted into a scowl as he shot back, "No way! Joyce can't possibly run Harper Group!"

Daniela retorted, "Dad, aren't you a bit old to cling to power? It's somewhat unbecoming, don't you think?"

Her words struck hard, and all eyes darted towards Caiden.

Even Joyce joined in, her voice tinged with a hopeful whine. "Come on, Dad, give me another shot at the company!"

In a moment of frustration, Caiden sharply tugged his hand away from Joyce's grip. His patience fractured like brittle glass.

With fury in his voice, he bellowed, "How dare you even suggest that? I entrusted you with the finance department, and you squandered over a million! When I moved you to marketing, you drove away a key client-one we've maintained for more than a decade! And in public relations, you ended up entangled with some junior intern! What more can I possibly trust you with? Each moment you spend at Harper Group only hastens our downfall!"

Daniela was all too familiar with what had transpired.

Katrina, ever the strategist, had long been persuading Caiden to allow Joyce to"ather experience"at the company, secretly dreading that Harper Group might someday fall into Daniela's more capable hands.

And the outcome? In less than a week, Joyce had cost the company over ten million.

Ever since the incident, Caiden had been steeped in unease. He found it impossible to include Joyce in any client interactions at the company. During one unfortunate meeting, she inadvertently caused a staggering loss of over five million dollars.
At a dinner gathering, she mistakenly addressed Mr. Bradley as "Mr. Chavez," and thenconfused the real Mr. Chavez with their competitor, Mr. Norris. That epic fail spread like wildfire in Olisvine, making them the butt of every joke for an entire year.

Consequently, Caiden felt compelled to confine Joyce at home, pampering her like a cherished but sheltered princess, safely away from the business's operations.

The tale was that the client involved in that fateful meeting still harbored resentment. Despite Caiden's efforts to mend fences by sending several cases of exquisite wine, the relationship remained strained.

To Katrina, this mess was the kind of shame that refused to die, always gnawing at her.

Recently, following a flopped deal to secure a new shop location, Katrina decided to make her daughter a director in Daniela's company. And Caiden was more than willing to cooperate. After all, they clearly thought Daniela was stupid enough to accept Joyce.

Daniela remained unruffled, casually dropping a remark before receding into the background, her eyes observing the ensuing tumult.

Joyce latched onto Caiden's armn, her voice laced with sharp impatience. "Dad! Did you hear that? Daniela just renounced her claimto Harper Group! It should be mine now! You won't be around forever,you know!"

Even Katrina, usually so composed, was caught off guard by the bluntness of the statement.

Reporters leaped into action, their pens dancing across notepads, cameras capturing every moment.

Surrounded and overwhelmed, Caiden struggled to navigate the relentless flood of inquiries. Joyce continued to cling to his arm, her pleas tinged with desperation. Katrina, gripped by fear that Daniela might reconsider her decision and stake a claim, added her voice to the growing clamor.

Meanwhile,Daniela had retreated to the fringes of the chaos.

She stood apart, her expression cool and distant, silently observing the spectacle unfold.
###Chapter 63 A Legally Binding Termination


Caiden had reached his breaking point.

With a thunderous shout, he barked, "Enough!" Both Joyce and Katrina recoiled instinctively, taken aback by the sudden outburst.

The reporters, however, remained unfazed. One of them pressed further, "Mr. Harper, are you genuinely considering Joyce as your successor in the future?"

Caiden rubbed his forehead, trying to ease the pounding ache in his head. But then, from the corner of his eye, he noticed Katrina's piercing gaze locked onto him. A cold shiver ran through him.

In her eyes, Caiden saw the same ambition and greed-cold, sharp, and relentless-that he had once seen in Daniela's late mother. That familiar, haunting look had tortured him for years, like a recurring nightmare.

And now, that very gaze was back, this time in the eyes of the woman he loved most.

Caiden felt overwhelmed, his mind struggling to process it. He blinked fast, hoping to shake the image from his mind. When he looked back, Katrina had already dropped her eyes, tears running down her cheeks, her face filled with sorrow and grief.

With a shaky exhale, Caiden tried to convince himself it was just a figment of his imagination.

He forced himself to regain focus, straightening up as he turned to face the reporters. "This is a private family matter. We appreciate your interest, but this isn't the right time or place. Please leave. Thank you."

Realizing they weren't going to get anything further, the reporters began to disperse, given that Katrina had secretly bribed them.

In no time, the atmosphere grew quiet.

Caiden remained at the center of the lobby, his face clouded with frustration. He was seething inside-today, Daniela had made a mockery of him, embarrassed him in front of everyone, and he couldn't stand it.
He spoke sharply, his tone icy. "Daniela, just answer me one thing. Will you allow your sister to work at Elite Lux or not?"

Without missing a beat, Katrina chimed in, "It's not just any position, of course. We're talking about a director's role; something that reflects her status."

Caiden slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. He was about to light it when he felt Cedric's cold stare fix on him. The weight of Cedric's gaze made his hand hesitate. With a sigh, he begrudgingly tucked the cigarette back into his pocket.

Holding back his frustration, Caiden managed a smile and turned to Cedric. "Mr. Phillips, this is a private family issue. You're a busy man, I'm sure you..."

He made a subtle gesture, signaling Cedric to take his leave.

But Cedric leaned back, exuding an air of easy defiance. "Oh, don't worry about me. I've got all the time in the world. Go on, pretend I'm not even here."

Caiden felt his eye twitch involuntarily. He thought about redirectingthe conversation elsewhere, but before he could offer the idea, Daniela interjected, "I'm extremely busy. If you have something to say, say it here."

Feeling cornered, Caiden bit back his growing irritation. He had no choice but to proceed. "Joyce is your sister.You're the CEO of Elite Lux, with numerous positions at your disposal. Surely, it wouldn't be hard to find her a place-a director's role, nothing too extreme."

Daniela locked eyes with the man in front of her.

Once,she had seen him as her father, the one person closest to her, the one she had trusted without question.

But now, as she looked at him, anger had faded, leaving behind something much deeper.

When disappointment cuts that deep, it consumes all other feelings.

Daniela spoke quietly, as if offering Caiden, and herself, one last chance to hold on to whatever was left of their family bond.
"I can set up a position for Joyce within thecompany. In her department, she'll have full authority.Once I make a promise, I always keep it. You don't have to worry."

As she finished, her secretary moved forward, but Daniela raised her hand, signaling that she had everything handled.

The secretary hesitated, glancing quickly at Cedric, who was still sitting nearby. His calm eyes were fixed on Daniela, his face showing quiet trust and solid support.

Across from her, both Katrina and Caiden wore expressions of visible excitement.

The idea of Joyce, once just a shopkeeper, now rising to a position of power within Elite Lux, was something they had never even dared to imagine. It was a win they were eager to celebrate.

Moreover, with Joyce under Daniela's wing, if anything went wrong with her down the line, they'd have someone to answer for it.

Maybe Joyce could pick up some useful skills, or even better,"borrow" some of Elite Lux's trade secrets.Perhaps starting her own company one day wouldn't be such an unrealistic goal after all.

At the very least, she would have some stability, and if any problems arose, they could always point the finger at Daniela.

Caiden's grin stretched even wider, his relief clear as day. He couldn't hide his satisfaction.

"But I do have one condition," Daniela said slowly, her tone calm and even as she locked eyes with the three greedy smiles staring back at her.

Caiden and Katrina were absolutely thrilled.

"Of course, go ahead and tell us what it is," Caiden said, practically bouncing with excitement.

Katrina quickly added, "As long as it'snot too much to ask, we'll agree to it. Daniela, at last, you're doing something that truly matters for this family!"

Daniela spoke slowly, making sure each word hit with precision. "I want to officially cut ties with Caiden."
Caiden froze, his smile faltering as his face hardened with disbelief.

Daniela pressed on, "And not just in name. I want a complete, legally binding termination of this relationship."

As she said this, she raised her hand, signaling for her legal team to take action.

One of them stepped forward, holding out a set of documents that had clearly been prepared in advance."Sign these, and then have Joyce deliver them to me. Once everything's in order, her position at Elite Lux will be confirmed without delay."
###Chapter 64 From This Day Forward


Caiden received the documents, his expression unreadable as he took hold of them.

He thumbed through the documents. Daniela's request was simple: she sought to cut all ties with the Harper family.Beyond that, she demanded nothing.

It wasn't exactly a shock. Considering the robust financial status of Elite Lux, Daniela likely had little interest in the modest assets of Harper Group.

Yet, Caiden fell into a brief silence. He looked at Daniela, then at the lobby around them.

Signing the documents meant severing every link to Daniela for good.

In his twilight years, as life faded away, Daniela would bear no obligation towards him.

Was this the correct path to choose?

Katrina's thoughts churned silently. No matter Daniela's achievements, she was not her flesh and blood.Introducing her own daughter to the ranks of Elite Lux seemed the more crucial strategy.

Katrina faced Daniela, her eyes narrowed with suspicion, and declared, "We'll sign, but mark my words. If you fire Joyce right after, don't expect to get away unscathed!"

Daniela responded with unruffled serenity, "Joyce is welcome to remain at Elite Lux as long as she wishes."

Relief washed over Katrina at these words.

Turning to Caiden, she spoke with unwavering certainty. "This deal is absolutely worth every bit of it! Or are you still under the illusion that Daniela will look after you in your old age? Just look at her-she's eager to sever all ties! Do you genuinely believe she still regards you as a father? Consider the cunning it takes to ascend to CEO of Elite Lux. Do you honestly think she's a straightforward person? Stick with her if you want,but as soon as Elite Lux solidifies, she'll focus all her energy on tearing you apart. Don't say I didn't warn you. This deal represents the best scenario for us! Joyce is far too naive right now. Daniela should step in and provide the mentorship she needs to grow. When it's timne, Joyce will return to Harper Group and propel it to new heights."

Katrina shot a'meaningful look at Cedric, then continued, "There's no denying that Joyce has a crush on Cedric. Given the Harper family's prestige, she wouldn't stand a chance to even meet someone of his caliber. Yet, by staying close to Daniela, she's around him daily. Consider this-hasn't Alexander already shown a preference for our daughter? Once Cedric truly sees what Daniela is like, he'll inevitably be drawn to Joyce, just as Alexander was. When that happens, imagine Cedric as your son-in-law. What concerns could you possibly have as you grow older?"

Her words were meticulously chosen, each one striking precisely where intended.

Caiden cast a glance towards Daniela, his face unreadable for a long moment.

Daniela, for her part, remained poised, her expression serene yet detached. In that moment, it dawned on Caiden that Katrina's insights were spot-on.

Daniela, with her aloof and steadfast demeanor, could not be depended upon in the way they needed.

"Very well," he declared, his tone decisive.

Daniela's eyelids fluttered closed momentarily, concealing whatever emotions might have surfaced.She then observed as Caiden extracted a pen from his suit pocket and leaned forward to inscribe his name meticulously on the documents.

As he concluded his remarks, Caiden straightened his posture and gazed into her eyes. "Honestly, Daniela,you ought to have grasped these truths by yourself. Yet, since the bond of father and daughter no longer binds us, allow me to offer you some final guidance. A woman should not be overly assertive. The ideal role for a woman is to remain at home, supporting her husband and nurturing her children. You were on the right track when you pursued Alexander-submissive, gentle, and aware of your role. However, you failed to keep him, didn't you? That fault lies with you. You should ponder on where you went astray. As a daughter, you're a complete disappointment. What good are all your fancy degrees and titles if you can't even manage basic decency or a shred of kindness? You've consistently failed to endear yourself to others, and that is your most profound failure. When Joyce enters your company, observe carefully how she conducts herself. In this matter, you should emulate her-she surpasses you in every conceivable way. And let me reiterate, from this point forward, your fate is no longer linked to the Harper family. You're entirely on your own. Should you ever marry, do not seek us out-you'll have no familial support to rely on. These documents, this severance -you pushed for it. Thus, do not return in tears seeking reconciliation. And regarding the Harper family's wealth-your mother and I accumulated it together. You are correct in one regard: you have no right to it.Thankfully, you had the sense to recognize this. From here on out, you are on your own. That is all I wish to impart to you."

As Caiden spoke, his eyes were icy and detached, reflecting nothing but self-serving intentions.

Daniela stood motionless, absorbing the scene unfolding before her. Every word uttered, every gesture made, was indelibly imprinted in her mind, stark and inescapable.

Her eyes brimmed with tears, yet she staunchly held them back.

A subtle smile flickered across her lips as she finally addressed Caiden. "Well then, I appreciate your words."

She had anticipated a moment of hesitation from him.

She had hoped he might deliberate a bit longer, given Elite Lux's staggering achievements.

But that was not to be.

In his eyes, regardless of her accomplishments, she remained dispensable.

Daniela gathered the folds of her flowing gown and bowed slightly.

Raising her head, she gazed up at Caiden-mirroring the way she once looked up to him as a child, filled with awe and longing. Now, however, her eyes were stripped of that naivety.

Then, she declared, "Henceforth, be it in life or death, in joy or in grief, I am no longer of your concern."
###Chapter 65 Anxious


With poise, Daniela pushed herself upright, her every motion a display of unwavering grace. Caiden was momentarily caught in a wave of emotions-tinges of regret and guilt intermingling subtly.

It dawned on him with surprising clarity that Daniela was no longer a child.

While Caiden stood there, lost in his reverie, Josie approached with her ever-alert senses. The aroma of soup drifting from the thermos caught her attention.

Her eyes expanded in alarm, and with a swift motion, she yanked Daniela back a few steps, casting a disbelieving stare at Caiden. "Is that rosemary in the soup?" she demanded.

Caiden was rooted to the spot, baffled and unprepared. The soup was a simple task left to the housekeeper.Yet,the potent scent of herbs lingering in the air hinted strongly at the presence of rosemary.

Josie's expression darkened, her tone laced with fury as she confronted him. "Are you kidding me? She's allergic to rosemary. Even a small taste could cover her in rashes. How can you call yourself her father when you don't even remember such a critical detail about your daughter?"

Under Josie's piercing gaze, fragments of forgotten memories began to resurface in Caiden's mind.

There was a faint echo of truth in her words-Daniela's allergy to rosemary. The memory had faded over the years,blurred and distant.

By the time Caiden's gaze lifted to seek out Daniela, it was too late. Guided by Cedric, she was already vanishing into the elevator, her figure a mere shadow behind the closing doors.

Meanwhile, Katrina reveled in her triumph. A satisfied grin spread across her face as she leaned in close to Joyce, her voice a jubilant whisper. "The Harper family's wealth is practically in our grasp now. And that's not all-you've secured the director position at Elite Lux! This outcome surpasses even my wildest dreams!"

Katrina quickly ushered Caiden and Joyce towards the exit, fearful that Daniela might reconsider her decision. In the lobby, Richard and Alexander had quietly observed the unfolding drama.

Richard turned to Alexander. "Caiden's a complete moron. Other than Katrina, the Harper family's a bunch of brainless idiots. If you were to marry Joyce, you'd have Katrina-and consequently, the entire Harper fortune-right where you want them. And Daniela? Should she prove too challenging, I wouldn't object to Joyce as my daughter-in-law."

Alexander clenched his jaw, his tone resolute. "Marrying Joyce has never crossed my mind."

Richard clapped Alexander on the shoulder with a knowing nod. "Then brace yourself, you've got a tough road ahead. Daniela isn't easily fooled; she's a cut above the rest of her family. You won't manipulate her as easily as the others."

Silence hung between them, yet a spark of determination ignited in Alexander's gaze.

Daniela's obsession with him wasn't exactly a secret. He figured it was only a matter of time before she came crawling back.

Whether it was to touch on personal subjects or to discuss their joint venture on the North District project, it was inevitable. Given that Bennett Group was a titan in Olisvine's redevelopment sector, Daniela couldn't possibly progress without HIS involvement.

When the time came, Alexander knew he wouldn't have to exert much effort. A mere hint of interest in reigniting their connection would suffice. Daniela would be desperate enough to fall for it.

There was an effortless assurance in his posture whenever he thought of Daniela.

He couldn't quite pinpoint why, but he was convinced of her enduring fondness for him.

As Alexander waited, his expression the very picture of calm certainty, his secretary found himself torn between comprehension and confusion.

It was clear why Alexander felt confident-Daniela had once been wrapped around his little finger.

Her tendency to go out of her way for him had made a deep impression on all who had seen it, not least the secretary himself. Yet,there was a puzzling element to this calm.

The North District project was on the cusp of its inauguration. How could Alexander afford to remain so tranquil? Did he not fear another firm might swoop in and clinch the deal first?

Days ticked by-one, then another.

Suddenly, Richard's urgent, furious call broke the serenity of Alexander's office. "Alexander, where the hell are you right now?" The sharpness in his voice sliced through the calm, sending a shiver through the room.

Alexander was deeply engrossed in reviewing a minor project proposal. "What seems to be the problem?"he asked.

"Where on earth are you? Are you aware that Daniela is on the brink of seáling a deal with Clayton Renovationtoday? You've constantly boasted about your rapport with Daniela, your unwavering certainty that she'd choose your side. So, what's going on? How have we ended up in this debacle?" Richard's voice burst through the line, seething with fury.

Gripping the phone, Alexander felt a chill as color drained from his face. Moments stretched on as he struggled to muster a reply.

After a tense pause, he sputtered, "Wait, Dad, are you really sure about this? Couldn't it just be a misunderstanding?"

The thought of Daniela partnering with another company gnawed at him.

Fueled by a mix of shock and betrayal, Alexander's calm shattered. How dared she?

The moment the CEO of Clayton Renovation stepped into Harper Group with a contract, Alexander stormed into Daniela's office, all formalities forgotten.O

Daniela was poring over the development plans with her design team assembled around her.

The words "Clayton Renovation" were elegantly scribbled on the small blackboard behind her in a script that Alexander recognized instantly as hers.

With his chest heaving and his tie hanging crookedly, Alexander stared at Daniela with disbelief and seething anger. "Are you really going to collaborate with Clayton Renovation?"

Taken aback by his sudden entrance and the harshness of his tone, Daniela, still clutching her pen,responded almost reflexively, "Yes."

The pain in Alexander's eyes intensified as he fixed his stareon her. "Daniela! How long are you going to keep this up? Do you really think these cheap tactics will capture my attention?"@

Everyone else, including Daniela, was visibly shocked.

Lillian propped herself against the table, her lips curling into a smirk. "What's this? Trying out for the role of our office clown?"

However, Alexander seemed oblivious to the light-hearted jab or the others in the room. His stare was fixed intensely on Daniela, his voice sharp and unyielding as he commanded, "Get out, all of you. This is between me and Daniela."

Before anyone could muster a reply, the elevator dinged open, revealing the CEO of Clayton Renovation.

With the multi-billion dollar contract on the verge of being sealed, he was wary of any disruption, especially from Alexander.

Waldo Clayton, the CEO, stepped through the crowd, his expression marked by clear annoyance.Bennett, this is not how we conduct business. The deal is almost done. Do you think it's appropriate to storm in and interrupt like this? Is professional decorum just a joke to you now?"

Unperturbed, Alexander brushed off Waldo's hand and moved a step closer to Daniela, his determination undeterred. "I need to speak with you. Alone." 

###Chapter 66 Toilet Director


Daniela straightened her posture, her eyes calm yet piercing as she spoke to Alexander. "Mr. Bennett,please remember, you're at the branch of Elite Lux, not Bennett Group."

His expression turned grim, the sting of betrayal burning in his glare.

However, Daniela let out a soft chuckle. "Really, Mr. Bennett, gazing at me like that won't change the situation. I'm all about my career these days-men just aren't worth the hassle. Nice try, but your looks won't faze me or get the outcome you're dreaming of."

Her teasing tone elicited chuckles from the others.

Her tone turned icy as she added, "If there's something pressing you need to discuss, I would suggest making an appointment through my secretary. We handle sensitive business here, and your presence as an outsider is a bit disconcerting."

Daniela's demeanor towards Alexander was meticulously neutral.

There was a time when she had been deeply, hopelessly in love with him, chasing him with relentless passion.

But those days had faded into the past. She had loved fervently, yet she was no longer hesitant to acknowledge that ###Chapter was closed.

Now, she offered him nothing but professional civility.

She even empathized that Alexander might need time to come to terms with her newfound detachment.After all, adjusting to the absence of her once unwavering affection could be jarring for him.

But then, Alexander's expression hardened, his eyes turning frosty. With a curt nod, he stated firmly,"Daniela! If this is how you're going to carry on, consider this conversation over. You think I'd ever want you back? Pathetic. You've let me down in every way!"
Alexander shot her a cold glare before turning on his heel and storming out like she wasn't worth his time.

The room plunged into a profound silence, the air thick with tension.

Several moments later, Daniela blinked, her mind snapping back from the shock. She massaged her temples, let out a deep sigh, and steeled herself to begin the meeting.

Suddenly, the office door banged open with such force that it echoed throughout the space.

Daniela shut her eyes momentarily, a reminder flashing through her mind about enhancing the office security.

"I'm going to kill you, Daniela!" Joyce bellowed as she burst into the room, brandishing a toilet brush like a weapon.

Her hair was in disarray, and she appeared as if she'd just emerged from a trench, dirt and all. A troupe of flustered security guards trailed behind her.

"Ms. Harper," the administrative manager gasped, catching up and panting heavily. "I'm so sorry. I did everything I could to stop her, but she wouldn't hear it. She just didn't care."

Brushing past the guards, Joyce stormed up to Daniela,her face flushed with rage. "Daniela! You assigned me to toilet cleaning duty!"

Daniela lifted her eyes, her expression serene. "Is something wrong?"

"You told Mom and Dad you'd appoint me as a director at Elite Lux!" Joyce's voice teetered on the edge of hysteria.

This day was meant to mark her grand entrance as a director at Elite Lux. She had proudly shared the news far and wide, even promising her friends snapshots of her new office.

Yet, instead of an executive suite, the administrative staff presented her with a toilet brush. They escorted her to a neglected nook by the basement bathrooms and gestured to a rickety stool-her so-called office.

The indignity of it all was overwhelming. With a dismissive gesture, Daniela signaled the security and administrative manager to exit the room.

Once they were alone, Daniela reclined in her chair, the picture of control. Her lips curled into a smirk as she stared Joyce down. "Have I ever outright denied you the director's position?"

Joyce's makeup was a smeared mess, and next to Daniela's calm elegance, she looked like a frantic wreck-bordering on unhinged.

She shook her head. "No, you haven't."

Daniela's gaze remained unwavering, her tone even. "And indeed, you are a director. No one has stated otherwise."

Joyce's face twisted with rage as she barked, "A 'toilet director'? Screw you, Daniela! I'm not your joke! Are the restrooms in Elite Lux decked out in gold or what? Why on earth would they need a director for that? You must be joking with me!"

Reclining slightly in her chair, Daniela answered calmly, "Believe it or not, even the headquarters of Elite Lux appoint directors to oversee restroom facilities. The choice to accept the position is yours alone."

A flicker of uncertainty crossed Joyce's face. "The headquarters have toilet directors too?"

Daniela affirmed with a nod, "Indeed, they do."

Curiosity piqued, Joyce continued, "Are there any other kinds of director roles available? I really don't want to be known as a toilet director. It sounds absurd."

"Toilet director? That's your term, not ours. We certainly don't call it that."

Joyce's eyes narrowed as her voice lost a bit of its edge. "Fine. If that's not it, then what do you call it?"

Daniela replied, "We refer to it as the 'Director of Comfort.'"

The title resonated with a certain prestige, casting a dignified air around it.

Joyce seemed to come to terms with the situation. Daniela added, "Now you're officially a director at Elite Lux. Think about it; it's quite a leap from selling clothes on the street, isn't it?" Joyce glared briefly before storming off without another word.

With her out of the way, Waldo sprawled the contract across the table and asked skeptically,"|there really a 'Director of Comfort' at the headquarters?"

Lillian, clutching her sides from laughing so hard, confirmed eagerly. "Absolutely! It's an honorary title we bestow upon family members who pitch in with the cleaning duties. It's our way of showing respect!"

In essence, Daniela had been merely playing with Joyce's expectations.

Moments later, Cedric strolled into the room. He spotted Daniela at her desk, her head tilted slightly, a subtle smile gracing her lips.

His usually rigid demeanor gave way to a brief, unexpected glimmer of amusement.

Lillian grinned and quipped playfully, "Mr. Phillips, who could possibly call you cold and aloof? I'm seeing more and more smiles from you lately."

All eyes drew to Cedric's unexpectedly cheerful demeanor.

Strikingly, Daniela hadn't repeated her usual security concerns today. There was no, "We need to enhance security. How can we just let anyone wander in?"

With the room bathed in a lighter tone and the air filled with ease, everyone's laughter mingled, casting glances of admiration and respect towards Daniela.
###Chapter 67 Why Should I Apologize


Alexander's fury burned like a wildfire, untamed and fierce.

He marched out of the Luxor Tower, his footsteps echoing as he passed a group of security guards huddled near the entrance for a briefing.

The security chief spoke firmly. "Starting now, we'll inspect every ID of anyone coming into the building.Higher-ups' orders-too many unauthorized people have been slipping through. Stay sharp, everyone!"

A crisp and unanimous "Yes, sir!" rang out, reverberating through the entrance.

Following close behind, Alexander's secretary leaned in cautiously and murmured, "Mr. Bennett, do you think this new rule is aimed at us?"

Alexander let out a derisive snort. Block him from entering? Demand his ID for access? Had Daniela completely forgotten who he was? She wouldn't have the nerve to block his path.

Still simmering with rage, Alexander walked away, his jaw clenched tightly in aggravation. Inwardly, he resolved that unless Daniela dropped to her knees and begged for his forgiveness, he wouldn't even spare her a glance.

Observing Alexander's thunderous expression, the secretary hesitated briefly before saying,,about Elite Lux's deal with Clayton Renovation... They're close to finalizing the contract. Your father's been pressing me about your progress with Ms.Harper.How should I respond?"

After a slight pause, he added, "Maybe easing your approach could help, sir. I don't believe Ms. Harper is completely indifferent to you."

Alexander spun around, his piercing gaze fixing on the secretary. "Are you saying she still loves me?"

The secretary blinked, visibly startled by the sudden question. Wait, was that really the point he was trying to make? Under Alexander's unrelenting stare, the secretary lowered his head and replied, "Yes, sir. I think Ms. Harper still holds feelings for you. Otherwise, with such a major project, she would have at least opened it for public bidding. Opting straight for Clayton Renovation without competition-it does feel a bit sudden."

Alexander nodded in agreement. "Exactly! You understand. Daniela is just pulling a stunt to grab my attention. She hasn't moved on from our marriage, and this is her way of retaliating against me."

The secretary was at a loss for words. He couldn't decide whether to laugh or question Alexander's logic.

With a newfound determination, Alexander walked into the Bennett Group building. Once in his office, he placed a call to the appropriate department and, with measured precision, lodged a complaint against Clayton Renovation for alleged fire safety infractions.

Alexander ended the call and leaned back, a smug smile spreading across his face as satisfaction settled in.

His actions would compel Clayton Renovation to launch internal safety reviews, a procedure guaranteed to drag on for at least half a year. Daniela's project was on a tight deadline-she couldn't afford such a setback.

Only Bennett Group had the resources and know-how to handle a project of this magnitude.

Sinking into his chair, Alexander basked in his triumph. He was convinced that Daniela was cornered. Sooner or later, she'd have no choice but to come to him, pleading for assistance.

That evening, a charity gala was the highlight of the city.

As Alexander walked in, Keith was already mingling.

Seeing him, Keith strolled over with a playful grin, givinghim a thumbs-up. "Nice work! I heard Daniela was about to finalize the deal with Clayton Renovation today, but you threw a wrench in it?"

Alexander gripped his wine glass firmly, his expression stormy, as if the world owed him something.

Keith let out a chuckle and glanced across the room at Daniela.

She wore a white gown that hugged her waist. Keith, unable to resist, extended his hand and spread his fingers, picturing how easily her waist would fit within them. "What do you think you're doing?" Alexander muttered, his gaze seething as he shot a glare at Keith.

Keith nervously licked his lips, clearly embarrassed to be caught in the act.

"Take it easy, Alexander. I'm just saying, Daniela's a reaI knockout. No surprise you can't seem to forget her."

Alexander snorted in disbelief. "Me? Can't forget her? That's ridiculous!"

Keith tapped his glass against Alexander's. "Come on, stop fooling around. If you didn't care, would you be going this far? Reporting Clayton Renovation, pulling strings to get a deal with Daniela's company-that's some serious effort, my friend."

Alexander stiffened, his glare as cold as ice. "You think I'm doing all this for Daniela? Don't be absurd. Do you even remember who we're talking about? She used to trail after me like a lost puppy, begging for my attention. She even hand-washed my underwear in the freezing winter. And now you think I'm the one running after her? Unbelievable."

As Alexander continued his heated speech, Keith's attention seemed to drift. His eyes briefly darted over Alexander's shoulder, and his face flushed a deep shade of red.

Alexander's gaze followed Keith's. Standing behind him was Daniela.

Joyce had overheard their conversation about Daniela and, without missing a beat, tugged Daniela over just in time to hear Alexander's harsh words.

Joyce's face brightened with smug satisfaction. Any lingering resentment from the "toilet director" incident had melted away, replaced by pure joy. She lifted her chin with arrogance, sneering at Daniela."See that,Daniela? What good is your success in business if Alexander still doesn't want you?"

Daniela stood there, cradling a wine glass. For the briefest of moments, a subtle shadow of sadness flickered across her features, almost as if a forgotten memory had surfaced. But in the blink of an eye,it vanished, replaced by a smile that was as smooth and practiced as ever. "Oh really/? Well, Mr. Bennett is clearly out of my league. I wouldn't dare aim so high."

With that, she spun on her heel and walked off. Watching her leave, Joyce felt triumphant. She slipped into the seat Keith had left and started ranting to Alexander, whining about how Daniela had mistreated her by making her the toilet director.

As Joyce continued her chatter, Alexander's expression grew colder. His frosty demeanor made her hesitate. After a moment, she excused herself and left.

Keith returned to his seat beside Alexander and let out a deep sigh. "You know, Alexander, that was a bit harsh. No matter what Daniela did before, it was because she cared about you. The world has already used her feelings against her. But for you, someone she once cared about, to pile on? That's low. And she's a woman-women tend to be more sensitive. Maybe you should think about apologizing to her."

Alexander clenched his wine glass, his eyes locked on Daniela, who was now across the room laughing with Cedric.

"Apologize? For what? I just spoke the truth. No matter how successful she gets, she can't stop people from saying what's true, can she?"
###Chapter 68 Alexander's Blind Confidence


Keith's sigh was heavy with exasperation as he shook his head. "Stay stubborn if that's what you want. Let's see how long that pride of yours lasts when reality hits."

As the gala drew to a close, Alexander couldn't help but monitor Daniela's every move. His car followed hers, maintaining a discreet distance.

Inside Daniela's vehicle, her driver peered into the rearview mirror and noted, "Ms. Harper, there's a car that's been tailing us since you got in."

Daniela turned her head slightly, her piercing eyes quickly recognizing the familiar car-it was Alexander's.

Relaxing into her seat, she instructed in a steady voice, "Just ignore it."

The two cars wove through the city streets in a quiet pursuit, finally coming to a halt outside the imposing Luxor Tower.

Just as Daniela stepped out, Alexander intercepted her.

She raised her weary eyes to meet his gaze. Despite the fatigue weighing on her, she remained poised. "Mr.Bennett,do you need something from me?"

He tailed her car relentlessly, shadowing her all the way to the office building.

"You and Cedric are not right for each other," he declared bluntly.

Raising an eyebrow, Daniela responded, "Don't you have more important things to attend to?"

His lips pressed into a thin line as his eyes widened slightly, struggling to mask his disbelief.

Daniela pressed on, her tone dripping with challenge. "Or have you really become so unoccupied that you stoop to meddling in your ex-wife's affairs? Haven't you ever heard the saying, 'The best kind of ex is one you never hear from again'?"
Alexander's face grew stern, his jaw clenching with quiet intensity.

The thought of her laughter mingling with Cedric's ignited a sharp, unbidden irritation within him.

"Alright then. If you insist on being stubborn, just remember not to come crying to me when things go wrong. Don't say I didn't warn you."

Daniela dismissed his remark with a nonchalant wave of her hand. She attempted to brush past him,but Alexander extended his arm, barring her way.

"Was there something more?"

"Yes," he replied tersely, his tone cutting through the chill air.

Daniela paused, giving him a fleeting look."Go ahead."

Initially, Alexander had resolved to let Daniela seek him out. Yet, a nagging unease twisted in his gut.

Daniela had a knack for poor decisions, and if she aligned herself with another company instead of the Bennett Group, it would inevitably drag him into yet another conflict.

After a moment of deliberation, he opted to confront the issue directly. "I've got a deal you might find interesting."

He fixed his gaze on her, her features bathed in the ethereal moonlight. His fingers tightened into a fist,then he consciously relaxed, striving to smooth his expression.

As he spoke again, his voice softened into a husky whisper, carrying a hint of intimacy. "This isn't the right spot for this conversation. Let's head up to your apartment."

Daniela eyed Alexander with a mixture of confusion and caution, taking a deliberate step back. "I don't think that would be appropriate."

A shadow of frustration quickly passed over Alexander's face, his annoyance clearly rising to the surface."Why do you find it inappropriate with me, yet it seems okay when it's Cedric? Daniela, don't you understand? For a woman, being loyal-showing devotion to one man-is paramount."
The night breeze played with Daniela's hair, adding a dramatic flair as she faced him, her features sculpted with both shock and disdain. "Are you suggesting that I should keep chasing you around?"

A flicker of regret passed through Alexander's eyes. He brought a fist to his mouth, disguising a cough.
"What I mean is that you shouldn't be so fickle."

Daniela remained silent, observing him closely. Once upon a time, this clumsy, awkward aspect of Alexander might have amused her, even seemed charming-as if she were glimpsing a part of him that remained hidden from everyone else.

Those pathetic days were dead and buried. Daniela wasn't that reckless fool anymore.

Daniela turned to leave, but not before casting a parting shot over her shoulder. "It's late, and frankly, you being here reeks of desperation. As for your so-called proposition, partnerships require integrity-something I'm not sure you understand. There's no common ground between Elite Lux's principles and those of Bennett Group. If you're here to discuss the North District project, save your breath-I'm not interested."

Daniela's rejection was absolute, leaving no room for argument or delusion.

Alexander was left motionless, shock rendering him silent.

It took a few moments beforehis secretary approached, piercing the heavy silence. "Mr. Bennett, Ms.Harper has already gone inside. Perhaps we should also leave?"

Alexander stared in disbelief where Daniela had vanished, struggling to pull himself together.

He turned to his secretary, his voice tinged with confusion. "What did she mean by that?"②

The secretary bowed his head slightly, his words measured. "Ms. Harper was indicating that the North District project will proceed without Bennett Group's involvement."

Alexander blinked, his thoughts scrambling to catch up.

If Bennett Group wasn't her choice, then who did she turn to?

Clayton Renovation was out of the picture. In the entire city of Olisvine, no other firm possessed the resources or expertise needed for such a massive endeavor. It had to be him.

Alexander let out a cold, biting laugh that echoed in the frosty air. "She's got to be bluffing."
###Chapter 69 A Chance


Cedric had initially intended to drive Daniela home.

Work, however, demanded his attention, and he stayed behind. When he finally wrapped up, a text from Ryan awaited him.

It was a simple text.

"You're too slow."

Exiting a meeting, Cedric saw the message and replied with a question mark.

His secretary was updating him on office affairs at the time.

By the fourth point, the secretary noticed Cedric's unusual inattentiveness-his typically diligent boss was distracted by his phone.

Pausing, the secretary doubted Cedric's focus and skipped an item on the list. Without looking up, Cedric pointed out, "You skipped one."

Taken aback, the secretary apologized and readied to proceed, but Cedric, phone in hand, stood abruptly.

The secretary, accustomed to Cedric's steady presence, noted a rare unease in his demeanor.

Cedric appeared restless, bordering onanxious.

Such descriptors were foreign when it came to Cedric.

The secretary halted, anticipating Cedric's next move.

Yet, Cedric dismissed him with a gesture. As the door shut, the secretary overheard Cedric's low query into the phone. "Ryan, what exactly are you implying?"

On the other end, Ryan, weary from a night without sleep, was perched on a rooftop, nursing a drink. "They mean exactly what you think. I just spotted Alexander's car tailing Daniela home. Cedric, what on earth are you up to? It's been forever, and you still haven't told her how you feel. Are you frightened or what?"

The secretary, poised to knock, halted abruptly. Frightened? Who? Cedric? That couldn't be!

Then, Cedric said, "A bit."

The secretary's mouth hung open in shock.

Ryan, caught off guard, pressed, "Cedric, what scares you? You have it all-wealth, looks. What's there to fear? I just can't wrap my head around it."

Cedric slumped into his chair, his head lowered, his tone somber. "You don't get it."

Ryan was flabbergasted. "I don't get it? Or is it you who's missing the point?"

Cedric exhaled deeply. "She told me she's not ready for a relationship. Being away from her makes me restless, but getting too close... I worry it might push her away. I'm walking on eggshells here. You don't understand her like I do. Push too hard, and she'll close off entirely."①

Ryan burst into laughter. "Who would have imagined? The great Cedric Phillips, now so cautious and humble."

Cedric appeared unfazed by the comment, shifting the topic. "What was Alexander's business with Daniela?"

Ryan snorted dismissively, "What do you think? He wants her cooperation. He's angling for that North District project, but the way he clung to her in the footage-it looked off. Just a heads-up, Cedric. You should keep an eye out."

Cedric's expression hardened, his response resolute. "Understood."

The following morning, Cedric postponed an early appointment to visit Daniela for breakfast.

Daniela descended the stairs to find Cedric contemplatively resting his chin on his hand at the dining table.

She eyed him curiously, then whispered to Josie, "What's wth him today?"

Josie shrugged, clearly bemused. "Beats me. He arrived early, took a seat, and hasn't uttered a single word."

Daniela laughed, then shouted for Lillian to come down. Lillian appeared, yawning and complaining about her late night, her appetite absent.

As Daniela settled at the table, Cedric preemptively served her some side dishes.

She ate in measured silence, Cedric attentively topping up her plate with each bite she took.

Daniela smiled, her amusement nearly breaking through her poised demeanor as she continued to eat quietly.

After finishing, Daniela dabbed her mouth with a napkin, then faced Cedric.

Cedric, visibly uncomfortable underher scrutiny, looked away and muttered, "What?"

Daniela smiled, probing, "You don't usually come over early to play host. Anything you're trying to say?"

Cedric cleared his throat awkwardly. "Not at all."

Daniela gave a slight nod. "Alright then, I'm off."

At Daniela's suggestion of departure, Cedric quickly shed his guise of indifference, blurting out, "Wait!"

Daniela chuckled and resumed her seat.

Cedric propped his chin on his hand, gazing earnestly at her. "Let's have a conversation."

Daniela settled comfortably. "Alright,let's talk."

Cedric began tentatively, "This year's economy hasn't been kind."

Daniela met his gaze. "True, yet Phillips Group has just secured a significant deal. You're managing'to expand, even amidst these challenges."

Cedric paused briefly, then confessed, "However, collecting payments has been particularly tough lately."

Daniela nodded, her expression reflective. "That's understandable. Yet, your company maintains robust cash flow. It's one of the few not dependent on borrowing."
Elite Lux was the other exception.

Cedric exhaled heavily. "It's a tough season for business. Big deals are scarce, and the competition is fierce.My team is under so much pressure, they're turning to liquor to cope with the demands of networking."

Daniela tilted her head, intuiting his implication, yet she simply smiled and began to respond, "True,however-"

"Don't 'however' me," Cedric cut in, raising his hand. "If we continue this line of discussion..."

He'd find himself without a leg to stand on.

Resolving to be forthright, he stated, "I'm considering cuting corners. Phillips Group also specializes in architectural and renovation ventures. Why didn't Elite Lux consider us for the North District project? You shouldn't treat me differently just because we were classmates."

Cedric maintained eye contact, his tone softening. "I'm just asking for a fair chance."
###Chapter 70 Cedric Dared


Cedric's voice carried a gentle undertone as he spoke.

Even Josie, engrossed in her kitchen tasks, paused to glance over at him. She let out a soft chuckle and silently cheered for him.

A surge of nervousness washed over Cedric immediately after his words left his mouth. He found himself unable to look Daniela in the eye.

His hand clenched around his fork, the grip so tight that his knuckles whitened.

Daniela remained silent for a long moment, a palpable tension hanging heavily in the air, muting all other sounds.

Cedric moistened his lips and his voice was a whisper when he spoke again. "Phillips Group stands at the forefront of the renovation sector. If you give me the chance to lead this project, I assure you it will be executed exquisitely."

The silence stretched on, during which Cedric had an epiphany. Daniela was offering him a way out, an opportunity to preserve his dignity with grace.

Yet, Cedric rejected her silent offer of mercy.

He was beyond caring about appearances or pride at this point.

All he desired, the only thing he yearned for, was a straightforward response from Daniela.

"I sincerely want to partner with Elite Lux on this project. It means more to me than any previous venture."

Daniela had yet to respond.

Consequently, Cedric also lapsed into silence.

In the kitchen, the soup simmered quietly on the stove. Daniela pursed her lips, wrestling with her thoughts uncertain of her next words.

It took a lengthy pause before she could speak, her tone serene yet laden with weight.

"I've always been the kind of person who dedicates their entire being to someone else. Entrusting all my hopes to one individual never gave me any stability-it always felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to crumble.Cedric, you're wonderful, truly. However, that's precisely why I can't entrust this project to you."

With those words, she rose, opened the door, and departed for her job.

Cedric remained frozen at the table, lost in his contemplation. Josie peeked from the kitchen, observed his still form, and sighed softly.

The day's sunlight was gentle, casting mellow, golden hues throughout the room. Cedric's hands were tightly clasped, his lips drawn into a narrow line, as if navigating through a labyrinth of thoughts.

Josie approached, bearing a bowl of the warm soup, and placed it before him, hoping to lift his spirits."Daniela actually-"

Cedric cut her off. "Your son is in the renovation business, isn't he?"

Josie nodded. "Yes, he does. You were the one who recommended it, right? You mentioned he should explore renovation projects. He's been excelling lately! Just last month, he secured a contract worth over a hundred thousand dollars. He was so excited that he didn't sleep all night."

Her lips curved into a warm, affectionate smile as she reminisced about her son's enthusiasm.

However, she paused when she noticed Cedric smiling as well.

A shiver of unease trickled down her spine. "Please don't smile like that. It's unsettling."

"Josie, would you want your son to be even happier?" Cedric asked, his tone smooth.

Without a moment's pause, Josie answered, "Of course, but there's a limit to-"

Before she could even finish her sentence, Cedric jumped in. "That's settled, then."

Meanwhile,Tyler Maynard was visibly stunned as he stared at the tender document in his hands. "Two, two... Two billion and five hundred million for a project? Are you serious about this?" His eyes were wide with disbelief as he gestured wildly. "Mr. Phillips, you must be kidding! Two million, maybe, but two billion? That's absolutely insane!"

Cedric spoke with composed assurance. "Relax. I'll personally oversee this project for you. All the profits will be yours. Just one thing-this must remain completely under wraps."

Days later, an unexpected player made a splash in the Olisvine renovation scene, stirring the waters of the business community and unnerving the industry's heavyweights.

The word was out. This newcomer had confidently presented a partnership offer to the prestigious Harper Group.

The revelation sent shockwaves through the Bennett family, prompting a frenzied search for clues about the enigmatic company's owner. Despite their extensive efforts, Tyler appeared to have sprung from thin air,with not a single breadcrumb leading back to a prior business footprint.

Daniela, too, had her eye on this curious new entity.

She tasked Ryan with some sleuthing, and he reported back, coolly providing the details Cedric had shared.

"I've done a thorough check. The company's solid-decent folks, no sketchy background."

Daniela perused the documents briefly, then looked up at him, her eyes reflecting a mix of intrigue and suspicion. "Do you know them personally?"

"Family..." Ryan stopped for a moment, then added, "Kind of, yeah."

Daniela reclined in her chair, placing the folder on the desk. "Family? In that case, you'll oversee the initial contracts and the vetting process. If everything checks out, you're cleared to seal the deal."

Ryan was well aware of Daniela's readiness to assist those tied to her team.

Mentioning "family" was enough to convince her.

Provided the company met the standard criteria, the agreement was practically guaranteed-bypassing the usual competitive bidding. With that, Ryan gave a nod and exited the office.

The moment he was out the door, he fired off a short message to Cedric. "OK."

Lillian,walking by, caught sight of this and emitted a soft whistle. "Wow. You really have Cedric's back, don't you? Stepping up for him like this?"

Ryan, a lollipop tucked in his cheek, shot back, "Could you erect a business empire in mere days for someone who has already rejected you?"

Reconstructing a billion-dollar renovation business required more than just capital. It demanded a vast network of labor, resources, and connections to kickstart operations.

Then,after laying the foundation, significant investment of actual, hard-earned cash was essential.

In an era marked by capricious and hurried attitudes, who else would commit so thoroughly?

Cedric was one who dared.
###Chapter 71 The Building


Cedric refrained from using the company's funds.

Instead, he invested his own savings into the project.

Tyler, staring at the long string of zeros in the company's balance, felt the immense burden of his role.

He blinked, overwhelmed, and queried, "You do realize I'm the legal representative of this company, right?"

Cedric, momentarily cheered by Ryan's approving text, gave Tyler a brief glance and responded distractedly,"Hmm?"

Tyler's worry deepened. "As the legal representative, this money is technically under my stewardship too.Are you comfortable entrusting me with such a substantial amount?"

The potential for misdeeds loomed large; with the access he had, embezzlement was a terrifying possibility.

This was no small sum; it was in the billions!

And that was aside from the vast sums already tied upo in the business. Funds were swirling through accounts like a torrential river.

The recent costs for entertainment and hospitality alone surpassed anything Tyler had ever encountered in his life.

To Tyler,the financial maneuvers seemed sheer madness.

Yet Cedric, ever composed, simply stated, "It's all worth it."

Turning to look at Cedric, Tyler observed the slight dark circles under his eyes. Even Cedric, seemingly unbreakable, bore the scars of his ambitions. No one, not even he, could dodge the demands of hard labor.

Tyler silently pledged to himself-he would uphold Cedric's trust. He would not fail him. Among all possible choices, Cedric had chosen him.

"Rest assured, I won't misuse a penny of the company's funds!"

Cedric offered a faint smile and dismissed him with a wave. "This company only needs to tackle one significant project. If you're driven, use this opportunity to carve out your own path. Should you have any queries, I or my secretary are at your disposal."

With that,Cedric exited, eager to meet his team on the construction site to discuss the initial design concepts.

He envisioned erecting a building on the North District land that would captivate and inspire for centuries,and his entire vision was dedicated to Daniela.

Cedric collected his hard hat and made his way to the site.

As the design plans were revealed, the team was struck mute.

"Mr.Phillips..."

Several team members exchanged wary glances, uncertain whether to voice their thoughts.

"Go on," Cedric urged.

The lead designer stepped up, hesitating. "Earlier, you specified using only the finest materials and hiring top-tier engineers, with directors overseeing everything personally. So what budget are we working with for all this?"

His question came tentatively.

Though not a finance guru, he could rough out the costs for the materials and labor as specified by Cedric.

Given Cedric's standards, the project's expenses were projected to exceed 2.5 billion.

How could such expenditure yield a profit?

It seemed far more probable they'd face a substantial financial hit.

Wasn't the primary goal of a business to generate profit?

What was the rationale otherwise?

The team was baffled by Cedric's strategy. Day in, day out, he was on-site, meticulously managing every phase of construction. His expensive black suit was perpetually dust-laden. From laying the foundations to the final touches, Cedric was involved in every detail.

It became a common sight at Phillips Group: the chief secretary donning a hard hat, yelling updates to Cedric amidst the roar of drills and machinery.

On one occasion, Lillian and Ryan chanced upon the site.

Witnessing the commotion, Lillian couldn't resist commenting with a thumbs-up, "Since Cedric can't capture Daniela's heart, he's channeling all that passion into her business ventures. It's absolutely wild!"



Alexander had just landed from a business trip.

At the airport, he checked his phone repeatedly.

After realizing Daniela hadn't reached out, he scoffed, "She's really keeping her cool."

His secretary, nearby, ventured cautiously, "Might it be that she's not just 'keeping her cool'? Perhaps she's moved on to better prospects?"

Alexander let out a scornful laugh, oozing confidence with each word. "Better prospects? Daniela? Sure,she's skilled in her field. But for a venture this large? She'd never risk it with someone who's not up to par.She's too savvy for that."

Alexander got into his car.

As his secretary began to speak, Alexander's phone interrupted with a ring.

It was Caiden, inviting him over for dinner.

Without hesitation, Alexander directed the driver to Caiden's place.

Joyce, learning of Alexander's impending visit, immediately arranged for a professional makeup artist.

She selected a breathtaking dress, identical to one Daniela had once worn.

The dress was exorbitantly priced, but Joyce felt it justified.

She had pondered her future-running a business wasn't for her. Marrying well and enjoying a luxurious life seemed far superior, infinitely preferable to Daniela's relentless, work-driven existence.

Her mother's advice resonated with her."Awoman should not overexert herself. Stay tender, stay gentle,and life will reward you."

Cedric hadn't reached out to her in a long time. Clearly, he wasn't destined to marry someone of her caliber,a true heiress from a prestigious family. Alexander, however, remained a viable option.

Previously, Alexander had jilted Daniela at the altar for her sake, a testament to his unwavering commitment.

Joyce reflected on this with satisfaction. Sharing her thoughts with Caiden, she found him receptive.

Caiden nodded understandingly, promising to subtly mention it to Alexander at dinner.

They agreed it would be ideal for Alexander and Joyce to hold their engagement ceremony before the New Year.

As Alexander's car traversed the North District bridge, he looked out the window.

Suddenly,his expression changed dramatically. The calm indifference gave way to sharp indignation.

He leaned forward abruptly, pressing against the window, pointing angrily at the imposing building ahead."What the hell is that?"
###Chapter 72 Mistaken


The secretary remained silent for an extended period.

Alexander snapped his head around, his tone icy. "Speak up! Have you lost your voice, or what?"

The secretary recoiled slightly. "It's Ms. Harper's project. Construction has already begun."

"What?" Alexander's face twisted in astonishment. "What did you just say?"

How was this conceivable?

How had the project slipped through his fingers?

That land was Daniela's lure, the means by which she had kept him ensnared. How had she relinquished it so soon?

Alexander shook with rage, his body quivering. He gripped the car window tightly, his voice a chilling whisper."Who?"

Who had snatched away the opportunity that was rightfully his?

Who indeed?

The secretary faltered. "It was Tyler Maynard. He secured it just before your trip."

Alexander's gaze sharpened menacingly. His command to the driver was a growl. "Head to Elite Lux.Immediately."

The driver complied without delay, accelerating the vehicle.

The car surged ahead, rainwater from the recent showers splashing wildly as they sped away.



Daniela and Lillian were just returning from lunch when a car barrelled towards them.

The vehicle skidded to a stop directly in front of them, causing Lillian to instinctively step back.

Shielding Lillian, Daniela squinted against the bright light, her expression turning steely and cold.

Alexander then emerged from the car, his aura tempestuous, charged with a palpable fury. His glare bore the old disdain he often directed at her.

"Daniela, why?" His voice broke with anger, his usual composure shattered.

He strode up to her and seized her hand, his dark eyes drilling into hers. "Why?"

Daniela attempted to withdraw her hand, but his grip was too strong. Ceasing her struggle, she faced his anger with an icy calm. "Why what?"

Lillian moved to intervene, but was blocked by Alexander's secretary.

As she reached for her phone, it was snatched from her grasp before she could call for assistance.

Daniela's face hardened further, her eyes chillingly sharp as she demanded, "What do you want?"

Alexander faltered, taken aback.

He had witnessed Daniela's many moods-her joy, her warmth, her intense passion.

Resentment, hesitance, perseverance.

A gamut of emotions.

But this-this unyielding coldness was something utterly foreign.

The disappointment in her eyes was palpable, leaving Alexander momentarily stunned. Daniela seized this chance to slip her hand from his grip.

Regaining his composure, Alexander snapped, "Daniela, there must be a limit to your obstinacy! Do you grasp the implications of diverting the North District project to someone else? This could jeopardize Bennett Group's standing in Olisvine! Did you consider any of this?"

Daniela gazed at him, a flicker of amusement crossing her face at his absurd accusations. "And why should "It concerns me deeply. I lead Bennett Group. Losing such a critical deal-do you understand the repercussions for me? My reputation with my father, the board, our employees-what will they think?Daniela, why must you act so impulsively? Do you think such antics will make me return to you? You're only driving me further away!"

He glared fiercely, spitting out, "You don't even know how to love someone!"

Daniela laughed-a sharp, bitter sound. If she had once resigned herself to Alexander's demeanor, now that resignation crumbled into clear, sharp hatred.

"I don't know how to love someone? Alexander, you question my capacity to love? For a decade,I stood by your side and shielded you. I thought our shared childhoods without mothers made us kin. I pitied you.I supported you. When you were a kid making messes, who cleaned up after you? As a wayward teen, who pulled you back from the brink? When gangsters cornered you in a bar, who was the one who broke a bottle and fought to rescue you? And during your early struggles at work, who endured sleepless nights alongside you? And now, Alexander, you dare to accuse me of not knowing how to love you?"

Her laughter turned more sardonic, her eyes reddening with a mix of rage and sorrow. "You know,Alexander? I'm beginning to wonder if the person who helped me out of my depression years ago was really you."

Inflamed with anger, Alexander couldn't help but react to Daniela's mention of her past struggles.Impulsively, he shot back, "Who saved you? What depression?"

As soon as the words escaped him, the atmosphere turned icy. Daniela stared at him, utterly shocked."What did you just say?"

Alexander averted his gaze, his eyes dodging hers, his mouth set in a firm line, and he remained silent.

Daniela's eyes narrowed as she studied Alexander intently.

When she was only five, she experienced the profound loss of her mother. Shortly after her mother's death,Katrina entered her life, along with Joyce.
On a particularly hot summer day, Daniela witnessed Katrina and Caiden in a compromising embrace on the sofa.

Tears rolled down her cheeks in silence. As Katrina caught her gaze, her eyes sharp and challenging,Daniela felt a deep chill.

That moment cast a long shadow over her childhood, ushering her into a deep depression.

Following that day, Daniela withdrew into herself, stopping her speech entirely. Her family, preoccupied,failed to notice, leaving her alone in her silent, isolating despair.

One afternoon, she discovered a sketchbook hidden within a tree near the swing set.

The first page featured a drawing of her, depicted with a bright, almost heavenly smile.

Overwhelmed with emotion and suspecting a cruel joke, Daniela ripped the drawing to shreds and discarded the sketchbook back into the tree hollow.

The following day, she found the sketchbook once more placed in the tree, as if it had been patiently waiting for her return.

She opened the sketchbook again to find a new drawing of herself, captured with the same warm smile as before.

In a surge of anger, she tore the page into shreds.

Yet, on the third day, the sketchbook was there again.

And on the fourth, it returned once more.

This pattern persisted for three long months.

Initially, Daniela's fury was palpable, but gradually, she became desensitized, her resistance waning.

Eventually, she started to engage with the sketchbook, using it as an outlet for her pent-up emotions by sketching her own frustrations and sorrows onto its pages.

It was a three-month journey.

After those months, Daniela posed a question within its pages. "Who are you?"

The following day, the sketchbook was back in its usual spot, but this time it contained a sketch of a boy's profile, distinguished by a small, nearly hidden beauty mark near his eye.

Through their shared drawings, they arranged a meeting.

The next day, Daniela spent the entire day at the swing set, waiting, but no one appeared.

Summer faded into fall.

Fall gave way to the chill of winter.

Daniela maintained her vigil for a full year.

A year later, she began to speak again and returned to her studies.

The sketch of the boy's face became her treasured keepsake, securely stored in a safe in her room.

On her first day back at school, a new student joined the class.

The boy confidently swung open the classroom door, stepping in. He stood there, bathed in the gentle morning sunlight, exuding a poised and polished presence.

"Hello, everyone. I'm Alexander Bennett."
###Chapter 73 Repay


Once, Daniela had asked Alexander about it. "Are you the boy from those sketches?"

Alexander's lips tightened, and he responded dismissively, "Why dredge up the past now?"

To Daniela, his evasion felt like a tacit admission. If it were false, surely Alexander's forthright nature would have spurred a direct denial.

Yet, over time, she harbored doubts.

The boy from her past, who had filled that sketchbook with kindness and warmth, seemed entirely unlike Alexander, who was often detached and aloof. How could they be the same person?

She struggled to reconcile the two images.

Eventually, she ceased trying to piece it together, but occasionally, her eyes would drift to the barely noticeable spot near Alexander's eye where a mole had once been.

Alexander had once explained he had it removed because it made him look less masculine.

She had accepted his reasoning without question.

How could Alexander, with his pride and arrogance, fabricate such a tale?

Yet, now, as his dismissive words echoed, her old uncertainties reawakened.

"Are you really the boy I made that promise to beneath the tree hollow all those years ago?" she asked, her voice tinged with a hint of skepticism.

Already frustrated by his recent business setback, Alexander grew more irritated. "What are you implying?Do you believe I deceived you? Do you see me as someone who would lie about something so insignificant?" he retorted sharply.

His eyes narrowed, his voice sharpening defensively. "Daniela, I've always wondered-if I hadn't been that boy, would your treatment of me have been the same? Is your kindness just because of a few childhood drawings and three months of memories? Are you saying that all our shared experiences, all these years together, mean less than those brief moments?"

Alexander's gaze was piercing, challenging her to respond. "Tell me! Without those three months,would you have cared as much? Would you have been so patient? Would you have supported me as I built my business, or made me scarves to keep me warm?"

"No." Daniela's answer was prompt, her tone resolute and clear.

The word hit Alexander like a physical blow.

"Without those three months, I wouldn't have endured, wouldn't have cared as deeply as I did all these years."

She understood her own suffering and the neglect she'd felt.

Only a profound reason could have sustained her through such hardship.

For Daniela, it was the belief that the boy from her past was the kind, gentle soul she had once connected with.

Alexander scoffed bitterly, stepping back with a wild, nearly deranged smile. "Incredible, Daniela! You really exceed yourself! Now, you say whatever you please, huh?"

Daniela remained composed, her demeanor untouched by his sarcasm.

Alexander's tone became taunting. "So, what now? Continue being kind to me! Hand over the North District project! What happened to all those sentiments from your childhood? Have you forgotten them?"

He glared at her, his eyes aflame with intensity. "Didn't you claim I pulled you from your darkest days as a child? Didn't you vow to repay that debt? Very well, secure the North District project contract for me! Hand it over, and we'll call it square from here on out!"

Daniela remained motionless, a chill enveloping her heart, ice spreading through her veins. She gazed at Alexander, her eyes wide with disbelief.
This marked the second time she had been overwhelmed by her emotions since her return-her earlier turmoil had come when she cut ties with her father, Caiden.

And now, this moment.

She locked eyes with Alexander and demanded,"What did you just say?"

Alexander, now visibly more composed, suppressed the surge of irritation and turmoil within. "If you truly want us to settle all debts, then bring me the contract for the North District project. Otherwise, Daniela, you will forever be in my debt."

###Chapter 74 Contagious


Alexander's face darkened.

Daniela's words seemed to hit him hard, as though she had just wiped away all the effort and care she had shown him over the years.

So all her affection had been directed at the boy she believed he was.

All this time, she had been striving to please someone who wasn't truly him.

Alexander squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to push back the irritation swelling inside him. But it was pointless. The feeling tightened around his chest, choking him, making it almost impossible to think clearly.

"Daniela! You've got two days. Think it over. When you're ready, come to Bennett Group with your answer."

Alexander shot her a cold, hard stare, taking in her stunned, unmoving face before turning away without a word.

Daniela stood frozen, fighting to hold herself together. But Alexander's words kept ringing in her ears,shattering her composure. Her body started to shake.

Ten years.

How many decades did a person truly get in a lifetime?

For ten long years, she had loved Alexander completely, admired him, stood by him, and given up so much for him.

And now, he wanted her to hand over the North District project as a mere trade.

Was this really about the project?

To Alexander, their childhood bond was nothing more than another deal.

Daniela felt empty, the weight of it all crashing down. What had she been clinging to all this time? Her love, her loyalty, all the compromises she'd made-they meant nothing.

It was just a bitter joke at her expense.

Her body shook with a force she couldn't control. She struggled to stay upright, leaning forward with her hands braced on her thighs, desperate to regain some balance.

"Daniela!" Lillian's voice cut through the air as she rushed towards Daniela, security guards on her heels.But by the time they reached the entrance, Alexander was nowhere to be found.

Lillian came to an abrupt stop.

She'd never seen Daniela like this, not even when Daniela had ended things with Alexander.

Daniela stood in the soft glow of the morning, her legs slightly bent, hands pressing into her thighs for support. Her usual upright, strong posture had vanished, leaving her slumped and fragile.

She was trembling, not from fear, but from pure, unbridled rage.

Lillian's voice was quiet, hesitant. "Daniela?"

Daniela didn't face her. Instead, she lifted one hand from her knee, her voice rough and quiet as she said,"I'm fine. You can leave. I just need some time to pull myself together."

Lillian paused, uncertain, but then nodded for the security guards to go.

She stayed at the building's entrance, her gaze remained locked on Daniela.

It was the usual morning rush, with employees coming and going. As they spotted Daniela, many of them instinctively slowed, ready to offer a greeting. But before they could speak, Lillian subtly shook her head,signaling them to move on.

In an instant, the usually lively entrance fell into an unexpected silence.

Only when Daniela finally managed to straighten up did Lillian hurry over. She took Daniela's arm, her voice low and filled with concern. "Are you okay?"

Just as Daniela was about to nod, beads of sweat clungto her pale face, finally slipping down her skin. She spun around and hurried towards the restroom, barely making it before she was seized by a violent wave of nausea.

Inside the restroom, Joyce stood in front of the mirror, applying her lipstick.

The sound of someone rushing in caught her attention, and she glanced up just in time to see Daniela stumble towards a stall, Lillian hot on her heels.

When Lillian called out, "Daniela," Joyce couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement crossing her face.

She leaned casually against the doorframe, listening to the sounds of retching from the stall. "Daniela,throwing up this much so early? Don't tell me you're pregnant."

Lillian spun around, fury flashing in her eyes as she hissed,"Shut up!"

Joyce let out a soft laugh, clearly unfazed by the frustration in Lillian's voice. "Honestly, Daniela, even though you're no longer part of the Harper family and we're not sisters anymore, I feel like I should remind you of something. As women, we know that our first experiences are important. Sure, maybe you're used to being reckless, but now that you're leading Elite Lux, shouldn't you be more careful with your reputation?After all, you wouldn't want to bring shame to the company,right? But then again, I can see where you're coming from. Someone like you, always so cold and distant--it's no surprise you're all alone. Men probably steer clear of you, don't they? Unlike me, of course. I'm sweet, obedient, and gentle. Men can't get enough of me. Cedric, Alexander-men of real class, they're all at my feet. Tell me, Daniela, what do you think Dad would say if he knew you were fooling around with men before marriage? What if he found out you were pregnant and unmarried? Don't you think he'd regret not cutting ties with you sooner? You've always been a disappointment to the Harper family. And if word got out that you were pregnant out of wedlock, do you really think any wealthy family would want you?"

It was obvious that Joyce had been utterly bored in the restroom, trapped with no one to talk to all day.

So,when the chance to taunt Daniela came up, she wasn't about to let it pass her by.

Her constant jabbering filled the space, and gradually, the emotions choking Daniela's chest began to dull.

She straightened up, hit the flush button, and pushed open the stall door. Joyce gasped dramatically, "Daniela! What's with that pale face? Are you really pregnant?"

She leaned in, curiosity practically dripping from her tone. "So, who's the father of the baby?"

Daniela stopped herself from slapping her and instead signaled for Lillian to come over and help her out of the restroom.

Joyce didn't stop. "Daniela, you don't even know who the father is?" Her face contorted into a cruel grin."Ugh, Daniela! With all the deals the company's been landing lately, don't tell me you've been using your body to seal them? Seriously, you're disgusting! You don't even know who the father of your child is? But really, that's how it works, isn't it? Nobody owns up to, you know, transactions like that. Even if you get pregnant, it's always the woman left to deal with it. Poor thing! A child growing up fatherless, raised in a home without love-it's only going to turn out as messed up as you are! Let me give you some.."O

Suddenly, a slap cracked through the air, sharp and final, silencing Joyce mid-sentence.

For a moment, everything went quiet. Daniela exhaled deeply, feeling a wave of satisfaction. Sometimes,actions spokelouder than words.

With Lillian's support, she made her way out of the restroom.

Joyce stood frozen for a moment, stunned. She then hurried after Daniela, ready to shout at her retreating form, when, out of nowhere, a wave of nausea washed over her.

Her stomach twisted in a sickening churn.

She stumbled back to the toilet, bent over it, gagging and dry heaving.

Gripping the edge of the toilet, Joyce muttered under her breath, "Damn Daniela! Pregnancy isn't contagious, is it?"
###Chapter 75 He Could Endure Anything


Joyce exited the restroom, meticulously retouching her makeup.

Just as she finished, her phone vibrated with a text from Katrina. "Don't forget tonight's family dinner."

Joyce typed back,"Got it."

Another message quickly pinged. "You haven't been fooling around, have you? Remember, we can't have a repeat of last time! I've invited Richard and Alexander for tonight's dinner. I plan to talk about your engagement to Alexander."

Joyce's eyes sparkled with excitement. She was on the brink of becoming Alexander's wife.

Overwhelmed with elation, Joyce didn't wait for the workday to conclude. She grabbed her purse and left the office early.

Her heels clicked decisively against the floor as she made her way to the upscale salon upstairs.

At the salon, Joyce splurged on an exclusive annual membership card costing $500, 000, insisted on receiving the premier service they offered.

Joyce was in high spirits. Daniela's setback had already made her day sweeter, and now, the prospect of her imminent engagement to Alexander filled her with a sense of triumph.

As she lay on the treatment bed, fantasizing about her upcoming luxurious life, a jasmine aroma wafted into the room.

Normally, Joyce adored this fragrance. Yet today, as soon as it hit her senses, she sat up abruptly, her hand over her mouth, feeling queasy. Grabbing a glass of water, she gulped it down, attempting to quell the sudden nausea.

"What the hell is happening?" she whispered to herself, her frustration evident. "Pregnancy can't be contagious, can it? I need to keep my distance from Daniela!"
After her spa session, Joyce headed for the elevator. As the doors slid open, a brisk breeze swept through the lobby.

A man entered, covered in grime and still sporting a hard hat.Joyce's expression twisted into a scowl of disdain.Wheeling around, she was ready to chastise the man for his disarray. However, her rebuke froze on her lips when she recognized him.

"Cedric? What on earth happened to you?" She observed his condition-his clothing was caked with dirt and his face lined with sweat, as though he had come from a construction site.

The sight of him, so unkempt and incongruent with the setting, filled her with embarrassment. In her mind,she compared Cedric's ruggedness to Alexander's polished demeanor, and any residual affection she might have felt for Cedric evaporated.①

Without sparing him another look, Joyce straightened herself and walked briskly away.

Meanwhile, Cedric headed to the 25th floor.

Lillian was stationed outside the CEO's office, peering through the slightly open door.

Upon the sound of the elevator's arrival, she turned and saw Cedric, his appearance marked by toil and dust.She realized immediately that he hadn't bothered to clean up after leaving the construction site.

"Why did you come here like this?" she asked in a low voice.

Cedric glanced through the door's narrow crack. The office was quiet, empty of any activity.

"She's on the couch, asleep. Don't wake her," Lillian murmured, nodding towards the interior.

Those close to Daniela understood that she often sought refuge in sleep when troubled.

As a child, neglected and alone, she had learned to soothe her emotions through slumber-a coping mechanism that persisted into her adult life.

Cedric nodded in acknowledgment, catching his breath."Alright."

"How's everything at the site?" Cedric responded simply, "It's fine."

Lillian suggested, "You should really have someone else oversee the site. Can you manage shuttling back and forth like this? I heard your secretary even set up an office there. Cedric, you need to delegate. You can't keep going at this pace. It's too much. With all that's happening at Phillips Group, how can you handle it all?"

Managing a multibillion-dollar project was a colossal task, fraught with endless challenges.

For Cedric, the CEO, to personally monitor the site seemed to Lillian an unnecessary strain.

The construction environment was harsh, filled with dust, hardly suitable for someone of Cedric's stature.

Yet Cedric, his gaze still fixed on the office door, dismissed her concern with a gesture. "She's asleep. Go find a blanket and cover her."

Lillian shook her head. "That's not going to work. She's always on alert, even in sleep. If I touch her, she'll wake up right away."

The office windows were ajar, letting in a breeze that had cooled the room significantly.

Cedric frowned. "We can't have her catching cold. Get a blanket."

Lillian nodded and hurried off to fetch one.

Taking the blanket from Lillian, Cedric quietly pushed open the office door with careful steps.

He approached Daniela, crouching beside her and gently unfolding the blanket.

As he covered her,Daniela stirred slightly.

Her eyes, large and clouded with sleep, fluttered open, her voice soft and husky. "Cedric?"

Hearing his name from her lips momentarily disrupted his calm. He adjusted the blanket around her more snugly and whispered, "Go back to sleep." And she drifted off once more.

A pang of emotion tightened Cedric's chest. His eyes dwelled on the subtle redness beneath her eyes, emotions brewing inside him-a mix of heartache,tenderness, and a fierce protectiveness. He harbored a deep-seated urge to confront Alexander, to make him pay.

But he hesitated. Was Alexander still a fixture in her heart? If she still held feelings for him, then he would restrain himself.

Cedric remained crouched beside her, watching over her slumber. He waited until her breathing deepened,indicating she was fully at peace, before he quietly stood and exited the office.

Outside, Lillian exhaled deeply and muttered with evident disdain, "Alexander is such a scumbag!"

Cedric's face showed nothing, his features set in an impassive mask. His hands, however, betrayed his inner conflict, clenching and unclenching at his sides as he fought to keep his emotions in check.

###Chapter 76 All He Wanted


After a protracted silence, just as Lillian believed Cedric was on the verge of leaving, he broke the quiet unexpectedly.

"What did Alexander say? Do you know?"

Lillian wished he hadn't asked.

The mention of the topic seemed to ignite a fire within her.

Her face flushed with anger as she erupted. "That scumbag! Completely shameless! I've never encountered someone so vile!"

Cedric remained silent, maintaining a composed demeanor as he absorbed her tirade.

Once she had let off steam, Lillian elaborated, "Alexander insists that if Daniela wants to break things off completely, she needs to hand over the North District renovation contract as a trade! Can you believe it?The contract with Tyler is already signed, construction has started! Daniela has devoted years of love to him,supported him through thick and thin, even ended her first marriage for him! And now, he demands this contract as the price for their separation? Are we just supposed to comply? Who does he think he is-a king?"

Cedric's hands tensed, opening and closing as he fought the urge to react more strongly.

After a moment's pause, he asked in a level tone, "Does she really want to cut ties with him?"

Lillian answered without hesitation, "Absolutely! What's the point in prolonging this?"

Her quick response made Cedric pause, considering the potential impulsiveness of her answer. Gathering his thoughts, he proposed, "Do me a favor. Check on that. If she truly wishes to end things with him, I'll handle it."

Lillian looked at him, bewildered. "What are you suggesting? You mean to say you'd let go of the North District contract? Cedric, I might not know every detail, but I do know the enormous effort you've invested in that project. Over 500 design revisions! Are you really considering giving it up to Alexander?"

"No," Cedric stated resolutely. "I won't hand it over. There's another way to handle this. Alexander is only after profit, right? I've just secured a deal for a new international airline route. I'll offer that to him instead."

Lillian was visibly shocked.

An international airline route was a major asset, a lucrative investment that could generate immense profits over decades.

"That's far too generous for Alexander!" she protested, her voice tight with disbelief.

Cedric looked down at the calluses on his hands, his face composed, masking the storm of emotions within.In a steady voice, he affirmed, "I believe it's worthit."

He was prepared to sacrifice anything to extricate Alexander from Daniela's life.

He needed the construction rights for the North District building.

Articulating this, Cedric felt the full weight of his resolve.

He simply wanted Daniela, the girl from his childhood memories, to have a joyful, serene life.

He envisioned her living in a space he crafted, a place where her laughter would echo, free from any burdens.

For that dream, he was ready to relinquish anything.

Observing Cedric's determined gaze, Lillian gave a resigned nod. "Okay, I'll talk to her."

But Cedric had more instructions. "Just find out if she truly wants to sever ties. If she does, I'll take care' of the details. And don't let her know."

Lillian looked puzzled. "You're going to all this trouble and you don't want her to know? What do you gain from this?"

Cedric dismissed her concerns wwith a wave and went back to the construction site.
What did he stand to gain?

For Cedric, it was all about securing Daniela's happiness and peace.

He was resolute, prepared to do whatever it took.

As he headed back, his mind churned with anxiety. He was plagued by the fear that Daniela might not truly wish to cut ties, and the possibility that Alexander might reject the proposal.

His secretary, riding alongside him, voiced his disbelief bitterly. "Alexander won't turn this down. Do you realize the value of this deal? It could set the Bennett family up for generations! You've invested so mnuch into this airline-think of the contacts you've used, the countless meetings over drinks to secure it. And you're just going to give it away?"

Cedric's eyes stayed glued to the landscape fleeting past the car window.

To him, the airline route was more than just a business venture. He had conceived it amidst learning of Daniela's divorce, even naming it "Daniela Line."

It was intended for her-a way to offer escape and discovery if she ever felt adrift post-divorce.He dreamed of showing her the world, a gesture to help her shed her sorrows.

Unbeknownst to Daniela, Cedric had meticulously crafted countless plans for her, detailed and carefullylaid out, yet he had always hesitated to reveal them.

It wasn't solely insecurity. It was also fear.

Daniela was so admirable, so impeccable, that he often felt unworthy of her.

Cedric chuckled mirthlessly. In the presence of the woman he loved, he felt like a coward.

He returned to his refuge at the construction site, immersing himself in work, all the while eagerly awaitng a response from Lillian.

Elsewhere,Joyce had already arrived early at the hotel for the family dinner.

Sitting at the table, her anticipation radiating from her, she eagerly pulled out her phone and texted Alexander. "Alexander, are you on your way yet?"
###Chapter 77 Relatives


After a considerable delay,Alexander's response finally arrived. "On my way."

Joyce's excitement was palpable. She spun around to face Katrina, her eyes sparkling as she brandished her phone triumphantly. "Mom, Alexander's almost here!"

Katrina's smile was warm, filled with tender affection. She reached out, gently smoothing back a loose curl from Joyce's face. "You're about to become his wife, darling. It's time to put away childish things. How are things at Elite Lux?"

Joyce managed a nod, though her eyes darted away, betraying her nerves.going really well."

Unaware of Joyce's discomfort, Katrina pressed on. "Daniela really threw me for a loop this time, appointing you as a director. Forge strong bonds with your team, and when the time is right, invite them to join Harper Group. With that caliber of talent, our company could rival Elite Lux in no time!"

Joyce offered another nod, this one tinged with guilt.

She was keenly aware of her own qualifications-or lack thereof. Director? The title meant nothing to her.

So what if she was the toilet director? The paycheck was hefty, the duties were a breeze, and the grunt work stayed firmly with the team below her.

Sure, the job title wasn't exactly glamorous, but to outsiders, she was a director. As Daniela had pointed out,holding the title of director at Elite Lux carried a certain cachet. It didn't matter which department she oversaw. What really counted were the sizeable paycheck and the glittering prestige that came with the role.

When Joyce shared the news with her circle of friends, envy was the unanimous response.

Truth be told, the position was ideal-lacking in stress and devoid of any rigorous mental strain.

It was a welcome change from the high-pressure sectors of finance, marketing, or risk control that Caiden had previously thrust upon her.

 Why would she bother mastering those fields? She was destined to marry into the rich. She wasn't crafted for the grind; she was fashioned for a life draped in luxury and ease.

The gathering wasn't extensive, with the Harper family consisting only of the families of Caiden's siblings.

These people werelavishing Joyce with compliments, buoyed by Caiden's evident partiality towards her and Katrina.

"Joyce,you're truly remarkable! A director at Elite Lux and soon to be the wife of the CEO at Bennett Group.You're all set for life!"

"Absolutely! Andit's no surprise, considering who her mother is. She's every bit as intelligent and stunning as Katrina."

"Joyce, during my last trip to Elite Lux to catch up with Daniela, I didn't spot her anywhere. However, I did notice you lounging by the restroom, snacking. It was during working hours, wasn't it? Shouldn't you have been busy working?"

Joyce halted mid-reach across the table, her fingers poised in the air, as if frozen. After a tense moment,she managed a strained chuckle and replied, "Oh, that? My tasks for the day were all wrapped up, so I was just taking a little breather. Plus, at Elite Lux, nobody really has the nerve to question my schedule."

Laughter cascaded through the room, and several relatives nodded and gave Joyce approving thumbs-ups.

"You've really outdone yourself, Caiden-such a clever and accomplished daughter! Speaking of which, why isn't Daniela here tonight?"

The reality of severing ties with Daniela to secure Joyce's position was a secret Caiden had kept close to his chest;he lacked the courage to divulge it to the family.

"She's tied up with work," Katrina interjected, her face lighting up with a practiced smile that masked the underlying tension.

Wyatt Harper,Caiden's brother, saw an opportunity in the prestige and power of Elite Lux, especially now that his daughter had completed her college education. "Caiden, seeing as Daniela managed to secure a role for Joyce, perhaps she could also find a spot for my daughter? It doesn't need to be something high- level-just a managerial role would suffice."

Before Caiden could respond, Ronald Harper, Caiden's another brother, eagerly jumped into the conversation. "And while you're making arrangements, Caiden, maybe Daniela could also help find positions for my son and daughter-in-law?"(

A young couple at the table sprang to their feet, their smiles a blend of warmth and formality. "Thank you,Uncle!" they chimed in, their eyes alight as they addressed Caiden.

Despite their rare appearances at family events-often excusing themselves due to hectic schedules-here they were, punctually seated and instantly transforming the once sparse dinner into a bustling affair.

Ronald, flashing a grin at Caiden, boasted with a touch of pride, "Caiden, you're well aware of how capable they are. One's already mastered the role of a department head, and the other excels as an executive assistant. I suggest you have Daniela consider my son for managing a branch office and appoint my daughter-in-law as her assistant. For a pivotal role like executive assistant, it's prudent to keep it within the family. My daughter-in-law is not only efficient but also exceedingly dependable-she would significantly ease Daniela's burdens."

As Ronald concluded his proposition, a chorus of glasses clinked in a toast to Caiden, accompanied by broad, approving smiles.

Caiden exchanged a glance with Katrina, who returned a cordial, rehearsed smile and was just about to reply when Ronald interjected, "Caiden, your children have certainly carved out impressive paths for themselves, but we must support one another. It's only when the entire family prospers that we truly embody strength. You shouldn't monopolize the success, leaving the younger ones to fend for themselves."

Wyatt immediately joined in, topping off Caiden's drink with a hearty splash and turning a chastising look to Ronald. "Ronald, what are you implying? Caiden has always been our guardian angel. He's the first to spot any opportunity and make sure it's offered to us!"

In Ronald's and Wyatt's view, if Caiden could extend his generosity to Joyce, who wasn't even his own flesh and blood, how could he possibly overlook his own siblings and their children?

They didn't see it as a favor-it was an expectation, plain and simple. Caiden was supposed to manage it all,

as if it were his duty, without them saying a word.

The mere fact that they had to voice their needs already felt like a favor to him.

Moreover, hadn't their families extended their help to Caiden in times past? He was indebted to them. This was merely settling scores.

Caiden gulped down his drink, the sharp liquor searing his throat. With a heavy exhale, he conceded, "Sure."

Instantly, smiles blossomed on the faces around the table.

However, Joyce, seated next to Katrina, pulled gently at her sleeve. "Mom, dealing with Daniela won't be easy these days. She won't go along with this!"

After all, these relatives had never shown Daniela any kindness.

And now they expected her to secure jobs for their children? Daniela was no longer someone to be trifled with.

Katrina appeared unfazed by this. She decided to let them manage Daniela on their own.

The only thing that mattered to her was ensuring Joyce's engagement to Alexander was secured.

Turning Joyce into Alexander's wife-that was the ultimate goal, the one thing that truly mattered.
###Chapter 78 Is Joyce Pregnant


"Hey, Joyce, life must be good to you lately, huh? Looks like you've put on a few pounds." Ronald, seated across from Joyce, made the remark offhandedly.

Katrina turned to her daughter at his words. How much weight could Joyce have really gained?

Katrina subtly lifted her hand and pinched her daughter's arm, feeling the unexpected softness. "What's going on?" she inquired in a subdued tone.

Joyce,looking somewhat bothered, responded, "I don't know! l've just been really hungry all the time." As she spoke, she reached for a side dish.

Katrina's brow furrowed, about to comment, when the door to their private room burst open.

Richard and Alexander entered, smiling as they presented a thoughtfully wrapped gift to Katrina. "Sorry for the delay, Mr. and Mrs.Harper. Traffic was a nightmare," Richard apologized.

Katrina eyed Alexander, who seemed disengaged, more interested in his phone than the event.

Katrina beamed, encouraging Alexander to sit next to Joyce and addressing Richard warmly, "Oh, please,there's no need for formalities here. You can call my husband Caiden and me Katrina. Let's keep it relaxed."

Katrina was skilled at smoothing over any awkwardness, her words weaving a sense of unity and ease.

Her approach made it clear to all present; this gathering was more than a mere family dinner. It was a strategic move to cement an alliance between the two families.

This contrasted sharply with Daniela and Alexander's hastily arranged wedding, which had lacked a formal introduction to family members.

Now,with Alexander present, they nodded in approval.

He was mature and composed-a perfect match for Joyce.

"Alexander, I'm Joyce's second uncle, Wyatt. Over there is her third uncle, Ronald. We haven't had much interaction before, but from now on, let's keep in touch. We're family, after all." With a swift motion, Wyatt finished his drink in one gulp.

As he set down his empty glass, he noted that Alexander had only sipped his water.

His expression darkened momentarily, but he quickly masked it with a smile as he refilled his glass. "So,Alexander, I hear your business is flourishing. You're in the renovation industry, correct?"

Wyatt, who also owned a small renovation company, made a modest living with orders just in the hundreds of thousands annually. "Should you have any upcoming projects, consider involving me." He clapped the young man sitting next to him on the shoulder. "This is my son. He's green but eager.It would mean a great deal if he could shadow you and learn from the best. What do you think?"

Wyatt had done his homework before the dinner, aware of Alexander's significant status in the industry.Securing a position for his son under Alexander could potentially elevate their family's standing in the fiercely competitive local business environment.

Alexander stayed silent during Wyatt's proposal, prompting Katrina to intervene. "Let's focus on the meal,everyone.Alexander, don't worry about drinking. Make yourself at home, relax and enjoy the food."

Despite Wyatt's attempts to steer the conversation back to business, Katrina smoothly redirected each time.

Finally,Wyatt slammed his glass onto the table, chuckling scornfully. He realized that while Daniela, not being Katrina's bioogical daughter, could be subjected to familial pressures without much concern from Katrina, Alexander was a different story.

Alexander represented a direct benefit to Katrina, and she would not allow any encroachments on what she considered her personal asset.

Wyatt rolled his eyes at this.

Katrina remained unfazed. In her view, only she was entitled to reap benefits from her daughter or her prospective son-in-law.

As the meal progressed, a plate of steamed fish was served.

The fish, cooked to perfection without a drop of wwater, was tender and flavorful, a dish Joyce always relished.

Katrina slid the dish towards Joyce with a warm smnile, then turned to engage Richard. "Richard, when we first met, we were both in our early thirties. Now here we are, our children grown, time slipping by. It's remarkable how fast the years go, isn't it?"

Richard recognized Katrina's tactic immediately.

Everyone at the table understood.

Katrina was subtly setting the stage to steer the conversation towards Joyce and Alexander's impending union.

Richard offered a polite smile in return. "Yes, indeed, time does fly."

Earlier, en route to the dinner, Richard had discussed the situation with Alexander. He viewed Daniela as a coveted match currently beyond reach. For the moment, maintaining stability with Joyce was prudent.

By neither accepting nor dismissing the proposal outright, he could delay decisions until Daniela's intentions became clearer.

Shoud she show signs of a change of heart, a reunion might still be feasible. If not, Joyce would serve as an adequate alternative.

Feeling it was the right moment, Katrina began to extol Joyce's virtues enthusiastically. "Joyce is a wonderful girl. She's charming and unlike some young women who flounder at the sight of a suitor. No,Joyce has always shown exemplary discipline. She embodies the grace of a genuine lady, groomed to be the ideal spouse for a distinguished family. The man who marries her will indeed be fortunate. And you-"

"Urgh!" Joyce interrupted with a sudden gag, cutting Katrina off mid-sentence.

Katrina fixed her with a stern look. Now? At this critical moment while she was lavishing praise?

Joyce sat there, her face ashen, overwhelmed by the strong scent of the fish that she normally loved. Now,

it was repulsive, the smell invading her senses, triggering waves of nausea that coursed through her.

She pushed the plate away and muttered, "Please, go on."

Katrina's irritation was palpable as her eyes narrowed, but she quickly masked it with a forced smile,turning back to Richard. "Now, where was I? Oh yes, Joyce's character is impeccable. She's truly a wonderful-"

"Urgh!" Joyce gagged again, cutting Katrina off a second time.

Katrina's expression turned stormy with frustration. "Remove that fish!" she commanded the waiter sharply,her annoyance spilling over onto the staff.

When she faced Richard again, her expression had reset to one of calm and control, as if the previous outbursts had never occurred.

Richard couldn't help but be struck by her ability to maintain poise. Despite the awkward interruptions, she appeared utterly unruffled.

Internally, he cringed, feeling a secondhand embarrassment for her situation.
###Chapter 79 Maybe She's Really Pregnant


"Richard, I appreciate your time, so I'll get right to the point. You see, after Alexander and Daniela's marriage -which, frankly, was less than ideal-they ended their union just days after the ceremony," Katrina explained, her smile unwavering. "I admit, some of the blame falls on Caiden and me. We failed to guide Daniela appropriately. Her temperament really isn't cut out for domestic life. We could see Alexander and Joyce are a match made in heaven. Their chemistry is undeniable, and frankly, I'm quite fond of Alexander.I'll be blunt since everyone's here. Alexander is the perfect fit for my daughter, and I'm not settling for less.Richard, wouldn't it make sense to let him and Joyce be together?"

Richard was visibly stunned by her frank approach. He thought Katrina would wait for him to bring up the topic, but she mentioned it herself.

As the eyes of everyone around the table bore into him, he felt the weight of the moment.

Undeterred by Richard's silence, Katrina continued, "Of course, our approval isn't enough;your blessing is essential. But I know you have the foresight to look beyond our family's superficial prestige. Take Daniela,for instance. Despite her wealth, what does it truly amount to without her family's support? Does she even have anyone left to lean on? Any parents? Wealth is fleeting, and Daniela's fiery spirit hardly makes her manageable. Even during her time with Alexander, she maintained her distance. Did Alexander ever truly get close to Daniela?"

Richard pivoted, catching sight of Alexander's furrowed brow.

Katrina's laughter held a sly undertone as she teased, "No hand-holding, no kissing-what sort of romance is this? Merely Platonic? Despite her strong feelings for Alexander, she never wavered from her beliefs.There was a time when she had nothing to her name. Now, as the head of Elite Lux, she commands respect from hundreds of employees. Do you think she'd bother listening to you? Bennett Group's performance this year isn't even a third of what Elite Lux has achieved. In a family, the main earner often holds the reins. Had Alexander remained with Daniela, he certainly wouldn't be the one making decisions today."

Katrina's eyes flickered with triumph as she observed Richard's hardened gaze and pressed on. "However, Joyce is a different story. She's been nothing but sweet and endearing since her youth, maturing gracefully like fine wine." Her stare intensified as she spoke.

Richard was on the verge of responding when Katrina leaned forward to fillhis glass once more.

"My daughter now stands as the sole heiress to the Harper famil. You grasp the weight of that, don't you?Unlike Daniela, Joyce isn't idly waiting. Should today pass without a resolution, we will seek alternatives. As the heiress to the Harper family, she'll have no difficulty securing a match."

With a gentle smile and a look of sly confidence, Katrina's expression was enigmatic.

Richard was stuck in a tricky situation with no easy way out.

Katrina was keenly aware that Daniela's burgeoning success might tempt the Bennett family to mend fences.

Could she simply stand by and watch Daniela's and Alexander's lives remain intertwined?

Resolved, Katrina had determined that should the Bennett family spurn this chance, she would seek alternatives.

She was resolute: Joyce's golden years would never be sacriiced for a worthless, unfaithful fool.

Richard raised his glass to his lips, savoring a brief sip before attempting to set it down, only to find Katrina proffering her glassright in front of him.

With an unwavering smile, she suggested, "Shall we toast to new beginnings?"

Richard perceived Katrina's gesture as a call to take a stand.

The allure of the advantages Daniela offered was strong, yet thoughts of Joyce lingered...

Casting a sidelong glance at Alexander, who was absorbed in his phone and detached from the unfolding drama,Richard exhaled a resigned sigh, his fingers poised to clink glasses with Katrina.

But just as their glasses were about to meet, a disruptive retching noise halted the moment.

Katrina's gaze followed the near-touch of their glasses, thwarted unexpectedly. Richard placed his glass back on the table.

"Joyce, is everything alright?" he inquired, his tone laced with worry.

Joyce had been straining to tolerate the discomfort, yet the pervasive fishy odor overwhelmed her senses.

She flapped her hand in front of her face, her complexion ashen, and suddenly shoved her chair back,bolting towards the restroom of the secluded dining area.

A loud,gut-wrenching retch echoed from within.

An awkward hush descended over the room.

The continuous sound of gagging stripped the appetite from everyone present.

Katrina's brow creased in concern. "What could she have eaten to react like this? What's happening?Everyone, please, keep eating." She stood, attempting to smooth over the disruption.

Across the table, Ronald's wife leaned closer to him and murmured,"Why is Joyce so violently ill? Could she be pregnant?"

No sooner had she voiced the thought than a chilling silence fell over the room.

Oblivious to the sudden focus on her, she went on, "When I was expecting my first, the morning sickness was dreadful. Didn't Joyce mention the fish smelled particularly strong today? Though she's usually fond of it. If she's turned against it, perhaps she is indeed pregnant."

The speculative whispers triggered a vivid memory among the Harper family members.

Katrina had once remarked with absolute certainty, "Joyce is the epitome of innocence, never so much as held hands with anyone. She's never dated anyone at all."
###Chapter 80 Are You Pregnant


Richard's face became a mask of complexity.

Katrina slammed her hand down on the table, pointing furiously at Ronald's wife across from her. "What absurdity is this? How dare you suggest such a thing? Joyce doesn't even have a boyfriend. How could she possibly be pregnant? She has given her whole heart to Alexander. She's one of a kind!"

Katrina felt sure that everything was aligning perfectly. But then, an unexpected twist threw her plans into disarray.How could she contain her anger?

She scowled, gearing up to press her agenda with Richard, when he suddenly stood.

With a courteous smile, Richard addressed Katrina. "Given that Joyce seems unwell, perhaps it's best we cut this dinner short. Katrina, I appreciate your sentiments, but these matters should really be left to the younger ones to decide. There's no need to rush. Indeed, a young woman's best years are valuable, and careful consideration is essential. Should there truly be a suitable match for Joyce, we would wholeheartedly give our blessings."

Katrina was stunned. She scrambled for words to defend Joyce, but Richard had already turned to Alexander, signaling their departure. "Alexander, let's head out."

As Katrina and Caiden saw them off, Katrina hurried to clarify to Richard. "Please understand. Joyce ate something cold earlier, which upset her stomach. Please, forgive this misunderstanding. You're absolutely right-finding true love is essential, and I firmly believe Alexander is perfect for Joyce. Now that Daniela is out of the picture, nothing should stand in their way!"

Keeping pace with Richard's strides, Katrina struggled in her high heels.

Richard paused only to offer a parting word before climbing into his car.

"Katrina, I've taken in everything you've said. The young people indeed seem well-suited, but if Joyce is indeed feeling unwell, perhaps a doctor's visit would be prudent, just to rule out any concerns. Only then can we all truly rest easy,don't you agree?"

Katrina fully grasped the weight of Richard's parting words.

For the Harper and Bennett families to successfully unite, Joyce couldn't be pregnant.

Katrina and Caiden maintained their smiles as they bid Richard and Alexander farewell.

However, as soon as their car disappeared from view, Katrina's suppressed fury resurfaced. She stormed back into the private dining room and struck Ronald's wife across the face. "You fool! What rubbish are you spouting? Just because you've had a child, you think you know better?"

Ronald's wife heId her cheek, her voice meek. "I was merely making conversation. I never imagined Richard would take it to heart.Besides, if Joyce isn't pregnant, it's merely a jest. Why such a harsh reaction?"

Katrina found herself gasping for air, overwhelmed by frustration.

Someone else interjected, "Exactly, if Joyce isn't really pregnant, what's the harm in the comment? Why the outrage?"

Ronald, humiliated by the public spectacle, challenged Katrina. "You're overstepping, Katrina! Remember,before you married Caiden, you were just a street vendor. Now you lord over us as if you've always been above us. Control your daughter better! I'm convinced Joyce is pregnant. She's unmarried and bringing disgrace upon our family. Like mother, like daughter! You're no better than Caiden's first wife. Joyce is far worse than Daniela ever was."

The comparison to Daniela's mother infuriated Katrina more than anything else. She pointed furiously towards the exit. "Get out! All of you, get out now!"

Ronald protected his wife, his sneer cutting through the tension.this your party, or does it belong to the Harpers? Who are you to order us around? If you're so confident, have Caiden disown us!"

Katrina closed he eyes, overwhelmed by the chaos.

Joyce reappeared from the restroom looking worse for wear. She felt dizzy and her elegant dress was ruined, damp and clinging awkwardly. Her hair was unkempt, adding to her disheveled appearance. "Mom, where's Alexander?"

By then, the room had emptied, the relatives having departed in a wave of moral outrage. Katrina, left with the aftermath,'slammed her hand on the table in frustration.

All her meticulous arrangements had come to nothing.

Observing Joyce's changed appearance and considering her recent nausea, Caiden suggested, "She's gained some weight and her stomach's upset. We should probably take her to the hospital for a checkup."

Caiden's naivety was almost legendary. While everyone else understood the underlying tension, he alone took Katrina's word at face value, believing Joyce had merely eaten something disagreeable.

On the drive home, Caiden sat upfront, the picture of oblivious contentment. Katrina, meanwhile, was a storm of thought in the back seat,her mind whirling with plans.

Once home, while Caiden retired upstairs, Katrina detained Joyce in the living room, fixing her with an intense,scrutinizing stare.

Slowly, emphasizing each word, she demanded,"Are you pregnant?"
###Chapter 81 She' Extraordinary
Joyce pursed her lips and gave a silent nod.



Katrina briefly closed her eyes, letting out a long,slow breath.



Joyce clutched her mother's hand, her voice shaky."Mom, the doctor said if I go through with the abortion, I may never be able to have children again."


Katrina paused, taking a moment to think over her words.



"After tonight, the Bennett family will be watching your every move. You'll have to find someone else to marry," Katrina said, fixing Joyce with a firm look.



Joyce's eyes grew wide with confusion."What? Who would I marry?"


Her mind flickered back to that night at the bar-everything was a blur through the haze of alcohol.


Nothing had been clear to her in that fog of drunkenness.



The only thing she could remember was waking up the next morning, catching a glimpse of someone slipping out the door. She vaguely recalled a mole on the back of his neck, but everything else was a blur.

"Alexander's off the table," Katrina muttered under her breath. "You need someone stable, someone reliable. In all of Olisvine, Cedric is your best bet."



Joyce hesitated, biting her lip nervously. "But would he even say yes? He barely even talks to me."


The weight of her situation was sinking in. Pregnant,unmarried, and no clue who the father was-if people found out, she'd become the subject of ridicule.



Katrina looked at her daughter's panicked, bewildered expression and let out a deep, resigned sigh.


"If Cedric refuses, we'll find someone else willing to marry into our family. That way, your father and I can ensure you're taken care of."



Joyce rested her chin in her hand, pondering it."Then I'll go with Cedric. Life's too long to waste on someone I can't even tolerate."


She knew that anyone desperate enough to marry into their family probably wouldn't be much of a prize.


Joyce had always been pampered, putting her own comfort above everything else.



Katrina stared at her daughter in silence for a moment,completely at a loss for words.


After a long pause, she sighed again, her voice soft."Let mne handle it."
 
 As they drove home, Richard glanced over at Alexander and asked, "Joyce is pregnant, it seems.What's your take on that?"


He couldn't stomach the idea of losing the Harper family's fortune.


Joyce,with her impulsive, naive nature, was easy to manipulate.



As Katrina had warned, trying to control Daniela the way they controlled Joyce was futile. Daniela was not someone they could bend to their will-not now,not ever.



Alexander stayed silent, his eyes glued to his phone.


Richard leaned back in the back seat, his voice calm and detached. "Honestly, whether there's a child or not, it doesn't really matter to me. You don't love her,after all. Just treat it like taking in a stray animal-don't let it complicate things. As for who you choose to be with outside of this marriage, that's entirely up to you. I won't get in your way."


He glanced at Alexander. "So? What do you say?"


Alexander, clearly uninterested, didn't look up from his phone as he answered,"Whatever you say."


He had long given up any hopes or expectations for marriage.

Whether it was Daniela or Joyce-it was just exchanging one face for another.


To him, there was no real difference.



That was how he had always seen it.



Now, as he sat there, loosening his tie,he convinced himself that nothing had changed.


If Alexander outright rejected it, Richard would push even harder. But when Alexander agreed without hesitation, Richard hesitated.



"Give it two weeks," Richard said after a beat. "If nothing comes of you and Daniela by then, youcan marry Joyce."


The pregnancy didn't matter. Joyce's family would make up for it.


In Richard's view, it was hardly a bad deal.


What happened between Alexander and Joyce after the marriage? That wasn't his concern.


With that thought, Richard looked out the window, his mind wandering in its own direction.







Once he had sent Lillian to gauge Daniela's feelings,

Cedric didn't look away from his phone, his focus locked on the screen.



For the first time ever, a hint of fear flickered within him.



He paced restlessly across the familiar construction site,where he was known to everyone.



Catching sight of the site supervisor passing by,Cedric called out, "Marco, got a smoke?"


Marco Pittman, a no-nonsense guy, grinned as he dug into his pocket. "Well, well, I didn't expect you to ask for a smoke," he remarked with his thick accent,pulling out a cigarette and offering it to Cedric.


The workers regularly offered Cedric cigarettes,but he always declined. Most people thought he didn't smoke.



And yet, here he was now, sitting down on the ground with a cigarette in hand.


Still wearing his hard hat, he leaned back, staring up at the skyscraper towering before him, its sharp edges cutting into the sky.


With a satisfied smile, Marco said, "This year's shaping up nicely. We'll have something to celebrate come the New Year."
Cedric stayed quiet, lost in his thoughts. Marco turned to him, grinning. "Mr. Phillips, you're young,but you've got the work ethic." He flashed a big thumbs-up, then added, "Not many guys like you these days-down-to -earth and dependable."


Cedric gave a faint smile, the cigarette still smoldering between his fingers, not yet touched.



"But honestly, with your status as a CEO, what are you doing out here? I saw your name in the financial news.You're handling deals worth billions. So what brings you to the site?" Marco asked curiously.



Cedric's smile lingered as he tilted his head back, his gaze fixed on the towering structure before him. A glimmer of a smile flickered in his eyes,as though he could already see Daniela stepping into the building -radiant,confident,and completely untouched by the wind or rain.



"I don't have anyone behind me. Everything I've built,I did it step by step, with hard work and setbacks.I've been reckless before and spent lavishly on sports cars and mansions. Had it all, but none of it felt meaningful." His crisp white shirt was streaked with dirt, but it didn't seem to bother him.



There was such honesty in Cedric's voice; it didn't come across as boasting. It felt more raw, more sincere.
The cigarette burned down to the filter in his hand,but he hadn't taken a single drag. He snuffed it out on the ground and said, "But this project I'm working on,this one feels meaningful."


In the warmth of the morning sun, Cedric shared something personal with someone he barely knew.


Marco laughed, giving Cedric a hearty slap on the back. "You remind me of myself when I was chasing after my wife years ago. So, who's the lucky girl?"



He scratched his head, thinking it might be someone from the site. "But that doesn't make sense. With your looks and status, why would you go through all this?"



Cedric let out a soft chuckle. "She's beyond amazing She's so extraordinary that just thinking about her feels almost wrong."



Marco let out a low whistle, teasing, "Sounds like you're chasing an angel straight from the heavens!"


At that moment, Cedric's phone buzzed, the notification pulling his attention away.
###Chapter 82 We Are Her Family Too
Cedric lowered his head and checked the message.


Lillian replied, "Daniela said Alexander could go to hell!"



In an instant, Cedric's face lit up with a broad grin.


He leapt to his feet, his mood visibly lifting. Marco,who had been observing him closely, caught the sudden shift. Just seconds before, Cedric had been restless. Now, he radiated a surge of determination and vitality.



Marco raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "What's up?"


Cedric stretched,his joints popping satisfyingly. "Time to take on the world for my princess!"



Marco couldn't help but smile at Cedric's enthusiasm,which was downright contagious.


As Cedric dashed toward the construction site, Marco shouted after him, "Don't forget to send me an invite to your wedding with her!"



Cedric's laughter boomed across the bustling site,full of life and promise. "Deal!"


In the midst of the chaos, Cedric's assistant maneuvered around heaps of steel and concrete, his arms laden with documents.



He was baffled at how Cedric seemed so much more content here, amid the disarray of the construction site, than in the tranquility of his plush office. 2







At Elite Lux



Lillian collapsed onto Daniela's desk with a dramatic flair, her chin propped on her folded arms. "Are you seriously going to just brush off Alexander like that?"


Daniela glanced up from the paperwork in her hand,one eyebrow arching in skepticism. "Do you honestly think I've lost my senses?"



She had zero interest in rehashing old grievances with Alexander or considering the North District project as some sort of compensation for bygone favors.



What could he possibly do if she refused? Take legal action?



Lillian asked, "So, what about the past? The sketches and all that... Are you really ready to dismiss it all?"
During Daniela's previous, infatuation-laden phase,Lillian had been genuinely alarmed, dreading that Daniela might surrender the North District project to Alexander out of some residual affection. Such a decision would crush Cedric.



To Lillian's relief, Daniela seemed more rational and detached than ever.



With a nonchalant shrug, Daniela dismissed the concerns. "Forget about it. Anyway, we've got to visit the North District site this afternoon. I need to oversee the progress myself. It's going to be Elite Lux's flagship domestic branch, so it has to be flawless."



Lillian opened her mouth to reply when suddenly, the sharp ring of the secretary's call interrupted them.



"Miss Harper, two gentlemen asserting they're your uncles have arrived. One calls himself Ronald, the other Wyatt. In the brief ten minutes since their arrival, they've managed to clear out the snack tray in the lounge. Actually, they've shoved snacks into their pockets."



Daniela's brow furrowed in annoyance. "Inform them I'm tied up in a meeting. I'm unavailable today."


These individuals were no different from Caiden-cut from the same cloth.

Back when her mother was still alive, they had whispered harshly about her, branding her as domineering and manipulative, and they didn't hesitate to spread those tales to anyone outside the family circle.



After her mother's death, not one of them had bothered to show up at her funeral.


Yet when Katrina had married into the family, they had draped over her, calling her "sister-in-law" with a cloying sweetness that was almost repulsive.



Over the years, Daniela had distanced herself from these relatives and had no desire to bridge that gap now.



Her priorities lay elsewhere-signing more contracts and boosting the company's bottom line was far more appealing.


Once Daniela ended the call, the secretary stepped into the lounge, wearing a practiced, polite smile. "I'm terribly sorry, but Miss Harper is currently engaged in a meeting and will be occupied for the remainder of the day. Unfortunately, she won't be able to meet with you."


Ronald's brow furrowed as he turned to Wyatt, his tone laced with disbelief. "Seriously? What the hell is her problem? We're her damn uncles, for crying out

loud!"



Wyatt rose to his feet, his voice firm as he addressed the assistant. "Pass this along to Daniela: because of her, we've severed ties with Katrina. We're backing Daniela now. She needs to come down and see us."



The assistant kept a courteous smile plastered on her face."I'll convey your message, gentlemen, but as l mentioned earlier, Miss Harper is engaged in a meeting and really can't spare any time today."



Wyatt's expression darkened and turned to Ronald."What do we do now? Are we really just going to walk out like this?"



Ronald leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper,tinged with urgency. "Walk out? Are you out of your mind? Katrina is no help with the jobs at Elite Lux. If we don't talk to Daniela, we're going to end up jobless and destitute! We stay right here, even if it takes all day. If she won't talk here in the lounge, we'll confront her in the parking lot. Daniela managed to secure a position for Joyce. Why the fuck can't she do the same for us? Aren't we her family too?"

###Chapter 83 A Shameless Family
Standing in the parking lot, Wyatt scowled, his irritation clear. "Why am I the one dealing with Daniela's mood swings? It's your wife who couldn't keep her mouth shut and upset Katrina. How's that my problem?"


Ronald turned,his disbelief evident. "Not your problem?Are you kidding me? Do you think Katrina's a fool?She's as stuck-up as they come, always putting Joyce on a pedestal. Do you really believe she'd go out of her way to ask Daniela to help you? Keep dreaming.Just wait and watch!"



Wyatt let out a heavy sigh,his frustration matching Ronald's. With so many mouths to feed at home,being jobless wasn't an option. They'd be drowning in bills. If things weren't so dire, he wouldn't have stooped to asking Daniela for a favor.


"Ronald, do you really think Daniela will help us after all the crap we've said about her and her mother?"Wyatt asked.



"Why wouldn't she?" Ronald scoffed, his bulky frame shaking with disdain. "If Joyce can land a cushy job, why not us? We're her uncles! And if she refuses, I'll cause a media uproar. She's a CEO-her reputation matters. She'll have no choice but to give us something. If Joyce can become a director, we deserve nothing less than a top role, maybe even a CEO gig!" ②


Wyatt's face lit up, a glimmer of hope flickering in his eyes.


Daniela had stayed at work late that evening. The moment she stepped out of the elevator,she noticed two familiar faces waiting near the entrance.



The underground parking garage was nearly empty,the silence broken only by the soft echo of her heels."Do you need something?" she asked and instinctively stepped back into the elevator.

Before she could close the doors, Ronald's hand shot out,holding them open.


"What's with the hesitation, Daniela? It's just us-family. We stopped by your office earlier, but you were tied up. Thought we'd catch you here since it's on your way out," Ronald said with an overly cheerful grin, keeping the doors from shutting.


Wyatt chimed in, nodding eagerly. "Long day, huh,Daniela? You must be exhausted." Reaching into his pocket, he produced some snacks he'd pocketed from the waiting room earlier. "Here, have a bite."


Daniela gave a faint smile, already calculating her limited options. At this hour, help wasn't exactly on standby. With steady composure, she stepped out of the elevator and asked, "Alright, what do you want?"


Ronald trailed behind as Daniela walked to her car.The moment their eyes fell on her limited-edition luxury vehicle, the two brothers exchanged wide-eyed looks of disbelief.


A car worth millions, and she treated it like just another ride? The extravagance floored them. ②



Spotting the opulence, Ronald's hopes of securing a job grew even stronger.


Smiling slyly, he said,"Alright, Daniela, let's cut to the chase. You got Joyce a job, didn't you? Well,we're family too. Isn't it only fair you help us out as well?"


Daniela didn't even break her stride at his words. She was already standing beside her car. For a moment,she stayed silent.


Wyatt added eagerly, "Exactly, we're family! You can't just favor Joyce. Don't forget when..."


He fumbled, trying to recall some past favor they'd done for Daniela, but his mind came up empty. The awkward silence only made his embarrassment worse.
Ronald gave Wyatt an exasperated look and shoved him aside. Turning to Daniela, he said, "Listen, Daniela,when you were a kid, we were the ones looking out for you. Don't let money make you forget your family.One day, when you're in trouble, it's us you'll need,isn't it?"


Daniela's eyes dropped for a moment.


Family?Really?



She remembered when her mother had jumped off that building. The doctor had asked for help with the stretcher, but these two didn't lift a finger.


In the end, it was a stranger who stepped in to help.



The years hadn't dulled the memory of their cold,disdainful expressions. They were burned into her mind.


That was the moment when she felt utterly powerless,surrounded by her so-called family. Ronald had whispered cruelly, "Why would she commit suicide?Did she cheat on her husband?"



Wyatt had sneered. "Who knows? Always flaunting her fancy clothes and acting so important. Who knows how many men she's been involved with?" 


And now, here they were,claiming to be "family."
Ronald, noticing her silence, decided to play tough.He scowled and said, "Daniela, let me make this clear-we're not here to beg. If Joyce gets something,we expect the same. If not, we'll make sure everyone knows how you turned your back on your family.Elite Lux just made its big return, and you wouldn't want bad press, would you? I know how much people like you value their imnage."


Ronald was always full of big talk. He'd spent a few years as a mid-level manager before running his mouth and getting fired. In his mind, his argument made perfect sense.	


Wyatt,as usual,just nodded in agreement.
###Chapter 84 A Slice Of The Pie

Ronald's fists were balled up, his eyes burning with fury. Every muscle in his body was coiled tight, as though he was seconds away from charging at anyone who dared provoke him.



Daniela stood poised and unbothered, a soft smile playing on her lips.


She was dressed in a stunning white gown from Elite Lux's latest collection. The dress hugged her tall,elegant frame, the perfect tailoring emphasizing her every curve, while pearls dangled from her ears,highlighting her glowing complexion with understated elegance.



Ronald and Wyatt gritted their teeth, doing everything they could to force Daniela into a corner.



At the sight of approaching security, Ronald's gaze turned cold as he leaned closer to Daniela, his voice low and menacing. "We're at rock bottom, Daniela,and we've got nothing to fear from someone with so much to lose. My debts are stacking up, my family's out of work, and we're barely scraping by. If you don't give me an answer today, it's simple: either you'll be six feet under, or I'll climb tothe top of the building and end it all! Blood will spill in front of your precious tower, and then let's see how well your business runs after that!"



He knew how to make a threat feel real.



Daniela nearly applauded his dramatic performance.



Lillian, who had just entered, shot them a disapproving look.



She was about to snap when Daniela held up a hand to stop her. Turning slightly, Daniela winked at her and said in a teasing, yet firm tone, "These are my uncles,Lillian.Show a little respect."



Lillian blinked, momentarily taken aback, but quickly understood the cue. With a quiet "okay," she stepped back,folding her arms across her chest.


When Daniela faced Ronald and Wyatt again, her demeanor became more sincere.



Ronald and Wyatt were momentarily caught off guard,but their smirks quickly resurfaced.


Internally, Ronald couldn't contain his satisfaction. No matter how successful Daniela was, he knew she was still beneath him.



His chest swelled with pride, certain that he had the 
upper hand.


Wyatt watched Ronald with admiration, clearly impressed by what he thought were top-tier negotiation tactics.


"I always knew you were sharp. Smarter than Katrina and Joyce, for sure. Now, let's cut to the chase.What role can you get us?"


Ronald misread Daniela's calmness as a sign of defeat,his confidence growing.



His whole attitude screamed victory, as if the battle was already over.


Behind Daniela,Lillian couldn't hide her contempt. She rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. They were the ones begging. How could they be so clueless about their own situation?



Daniela stayed as composed as always, her voice polite yet unwavering. "I've always recognized your potential. You just need to find the right opportunities.Otherwise,you would have been in roles like manager,president, or even chairman by now."


Even Ronald, who usually exuded arrogance,was momentarily taken aback. But as her words resonated,he found himself agreeing. "Exactly! It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that no one's ever truly recognized our potential."
Wyatt, in contrast, was overcome with emotion.His eyes welled up as he looked at Daniela. "That's what family does! We understand each other. You've always seen what we're capable of."


Daniela gave a slight nod, her smile unshaken. course."



Ronald wasn't completely sold, though. Narrowing his eyes,he asked, "What about the salary?"


Daniela raised a finger. "Your annual salary? It's this much."



Wyatt hesitated, his voice uncertain. "Ten thousand?"It didn't seem like a lot.



Daniela's smile widened. "One million."



Ronald's mouth fell open. "What? One million?"



The jobs they had been barely scraping by with only brought in fifty or sixty thousand a year. Yet, Daniela was offering a million right away.


Ronald nodded eagerly, his face lighting up with greed."Deal! We'll start work tomorrow. One million it is!"


Wyatt, just as thrilled, nodded enthusiastically,his mind racing at the thought of such a massive paycheck.

A million!



"Work, you said? I'm afraid that's not going to happen."While they were still basking in the excitement of their imagined victory, Daniela smoothly opened the car door and motioned for Lillian to get in.



Ronald's smile wavered as he watched her settle into the car. His brow furrowed, and his voice turned serious. "What do you mean? Are you messing with us?"


"Of course not. You just said it yourself. I should arrange jobs for my family."



Ronald gave a quick nod. "Correct."



Daniela's face grew serious. "Family comes first for me. Look at Joyce, for example. She's utterly useless,and she can't do a single thing. Yet, I still offered her this much."



She held up a finger again.



Ronald's eyes widened, thinking Daniela was talking about one million for Joyce.



Daniela's voice softened, pretending to feel regret,her long lashes fluttering downward. "But after Joyce joined Elite Lux, Caiden cut all ties with me as his daughter. Ronald's and Wyatt's eyes went wide in shock.


Daniela continued, "So we're no longer family. And because of that, I can't justify helping you or arranging jobs for you. I just don't get why Katrina had to do this.I had already agreed to let Joyce join the company,but still, she made Caiden sever ties with me. As for me, I'm okay. I've got enough money, plenty of people around, and more than enough friends. But you two, and the rest of the family... Without that connection, there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied."



Starting the car with a careful look of regret, she went on, "I suppose the next time we meet, it wouldn't be right for me to call you 'uncles' anymore. Anyway, I'll be on my way now. Take care."


With that, Daniela revved the engine, and the car sped away,leaving behind only a cloud of exhaust.


Ronald's and Wyatt's expressions contorted with fury.



"That damn Katrina!" Wyatt hissed, his voice tight with anger as he ground his teeth. "She shoved her daughter into the spotlight and left us in the dust!"



Ronald,barely able to contain his rage, struck the wall with his fist. "Katrina, you played us dirty! Don't expect us to just sit back and take it!"

###Chapter 85 Turning Down Money Like That
Lillian leaned back in the passenger seat, her laughter so uncontrollable that she had to clutch her stomach to keep from doubling over.


"They're unbelievable! How can they be that clueless?But, Daniela, that was pure genius! You flipped everything onto them so smoothly."



Daniela gave a small smile, keeping her focus on the road. "I'll let them deal with their own mess."



If not for the endless complications, Daniela would've changed her last name by now.



Lillian couldn't stop giggling. But as time passed, her laughter slowly faded away. She looked out the window. "Where are we headed?"


Daniela answered, "I've got some free time, so l figured I'd stop by North District to check on the progress. It's been hectic lately, and you and Ryan have been doing most of the heavy lifting. You both deserve a break."



At this, Lillian froze. She quickly grabbed her phone to text Cedric, but there was no response. Meanwhile, Daniela parked the car with ease and unbuckled her seatbelt. She noticed Lillian fidgeting uncomfortably beside her. "What's going on with you?"she asked, a little confused.



Lillian stumbled over her words.



The moment Daniela stepped out of the car,she instantly knew what was going on.


Beneath the skeletal structure of a half-built high-rise,a man in a hard hat was giving orders to workers adjusting ropes high above.


"Pull tighter! That's it! Don't worry, I've got an eye on things from down here."



From the sound of his voice, Daniela knew exactly who it was.



The man stood with his back to her, completely oblivious to Daniela's presence as she watched from a distance.



His white shirt was marked with yellow stains, and one of his pant legs was rolled up to his knee. His leather shoes were stuck deep in the thick mud.


The width of his shoulders made Daniela pause briefly,her mind wandering. Lillian, who had been standing beside her, quietly broke the stillness. "Daniela?" she whispered.



"How long has this been happening?" Daniela asked,without looking away from Cedric.



Lillian hesitated, aware there was no way to hide it anymore.



Before Lillian could speak, Daniela stated, "So Cedric is the one backing Tyler's company."



It wasn't a question, but a statement.



Lillian shifted uneasily and rubbed her hands together."Yeah," she confessed.



Daniela's hand, resting at her side, clenched into a fist.



She remained still for a while. But just before Cedric could turn and see her, she turned and slid back into the car.



"You should've told me earlier," she said, gripping the steering wheel tightly.



"Cedric didn't want us to tell you. He didn't want to be a burden."



"Honestly, he wasn't wrong," Daniela replied with a sigh. "It does feel like a burden." She really hated being in a position where she owed someone a favor -especially when she wasn't sure if she could ever return the kindness.



The very idea unsettled her. Daniela had been burned before,her heart broken by love.



She knew better than anyone how deeply disappointment could wound a person, how it could tear them apart. She didn't want Cedric to go through that same kind of pain.



Back at the office, Daniela asked Ryan for the budget report.



Numbers were her forte. It didn't take her long-just over an hour-and she had gone through the numbers,recalculating everything.



By the time Cedric rushed into the office, she had already set her pen down.



He was still in the same dirt-streaked clothes from earlier, panting as if he'd sprinted all the way there.


The office was dimly lit, with only the desk lamp casting a soft glow. Daniela lifted her eyes to find Cedric standing in the doorway, his shadow stretching long across the floor from the hallway lights behind him.



He stepped inside, quickly rolling down the sleeves he'd pushed up earlier, clearly trying to gather himself. He paused in front of her desk, his voice steady but urgent. "I can explain."


As he spoke, Cedric's gaze drifted to the scattered papers on her desk, each one covered with columns of handwritten numbers.



His eyes narrowed as he recognized them immediately -the actual figures from the project's accounts.


They were nothing like the ones Ryan had handed in earlier.



"Listen, as for the building materials, most of them come from Phillips Group. Since we're old classmates,I've been giving you factory rates. I'm still making a profit,so it's fair," Cedric stated, adjusting his posture just a bit. Despite his reputation as a tough, no-nonsense business tycoon, he suddenly seemed uncertain,almost regretful.


Daniela didn't respond. She didn't even bother taking off the anti-fatigue glasses resting on her nose. Her quiet, steady gaze seemed to weigh heavily on him,and he shifted uncomfortably under it.


"Construction can be tricky," he quickly added,his voice now a bit more shaky. "I've been in this industry long enough to know how it works, Daniela. Some parts need top-notch materials, while others don't.I've made sure to balance things out to keep costs down. Believe me, the profit here is more than fair."


Still silent, Daniela watched him. Cedric began to fidget,wiping the sweat forming on his forehead.


She took off her glasses, grabbed a tissue from the desk, and handed it over to him. Cedric accepted it,using it to wipe his forehead.



She gave him a slight, almost tired smile. "The more you talk, the more it feels like you're just trying to come off as innocent."



His eyes widened in surprise. "What? No! That's not true!"



His voice dropped, carrying a note of grievance, as if the accusation stung him deeply.


Daniela rested her chin on her hand and motioned for him to take a seat across from her.



After he sat down, she pushed a sheet of paper towards him. "This is the payment schedule from here on out."



Cedric didn't even spare a glance at the paper, quickly blurting out, "That's not needed."



Daniela interlaced her fingers on the desk and looked him in the eye. "Then I'll just cancel the contract."

She grabbed her calculator, tapping it with a small frown. "Let me figure out what I owe you for the penalties."


Cedric went still, a chill creeping in. No matter how sharp he was in business, Daniela always had a way of trapping him completely.


"Fine. Let me at least offer you a discount."


"Seriously, you don't need to do this."


Just then, Ryan stepped into the room, catching the moment. It wasn't exactly common to see someone turning down money like that.
###Chapter 86 Are You Seeing Cedric
Daniela meticulously calculated the final settlement figures and presented Cedric with an impressive 80%profit margin.


She further sweetened the deal by reserving five expansive floors in the upcoming skyscraper for Phillips Group's office space.



Cedric, fervently punching numbers into his calculator,abruptly realized his oversight-his good fortune had inadvertently come at her expense.


As he stepped out of the building, a veil of frustration shadowed his expression.



Numbers were her playground, and his skills simply couldn't match her extraordinary intellect.



Lillian couldn't hold back her frustration any longer."Honestly, Cedric, you're acting like a total coward!What's got you so terrified?"



Ryan observed the exchange with keen interest, his arms folded tightly against his chest.



Lillian continued, "Just open up to her! Admit you're smitten. You're clearly putting in the effort; so what's holding you back? See how she takes it! Or are you really just going to hide behind this 'just friends'facade?"



Cedric's frustration reached its peak. "I want to confess,I really do. But every time I approach her, her piercing gaze and her unyielding grasp of the data intimidate me. I'm used to the rough and tumble of construction sites, not the sharp world of numbers.Each time I try to speak, her incisive stare cuts me off.What can I do?"



Lillian exhaled sharply, frustration evident in her voice."Cedric, I can't believe how shy you become around her!"



Once Cedric had departed, Lillian shook her head disapprovingly. Ryan, tilting his head and wearing a mischievous grin, inquired, "Didn't you have reservations about Cedric before? You used to say he was too aloof."


"Yes, and my feelings haven't changed," Lillian retorted, her tone a mix of irritation and resignation.Daniela was a survivor of a troubled past. She wore a smile like a mask, yet beneath it, she was distant and detached,her childhood wounds far too deep for any wealth to mend.And Cedric? He had plunged into the corporate world on his own, adept at unmasking the true intentions of those around him. Could someone

like that truly possess warmth?


The notion of two such detached souls together seemed doomed. Rather than warming each other,they were likely to pull each other further into the cold. How could they possibly make a good match?


Lillian sighed, her voice softening. "But watching Cedric act so humble, I can't help but feel a pang of pity for him."


Despite this, Cedric behaved as though he had the upper hand.



Such foolishness!



Once her reflection ended, Lillian questioned Ryan,"Why do you back Cedric so fiercely? Has he promised you something?"


Ryan drew his sweatshirt's hood over his head,casting his features into shadow. "No."



"Then why...?"


"Because, on the day Daniela married, I saw him cry."


Stunned,Lillian fell silent.



Without another word, Ryan turned and walked away.


Lillian stood against the sharp, biting wind, her mind reeling from the unexpected sight of Cedric-a normally composed man-visibly crying.







Alexander was waiting for Daniela's reply.



At breakfast, Richard had maintained his composure."Today,you need to ask Daniela whether she'll give you the contract, or if she intends to remain indebted to you. Should she choose the latter, suggest remarriage."



Alexander bowed his head, his turbulent emotions now quelled. "But the person Daniela cherished from her childhood wasn't..."



"Wasn't who? It was you! Daniela has harbored feelings for you for many years. Does the truth even matter at this point? Feelings are the most deceiving of all. Don't let them lead you astray. Confront Daniela today. If she refuses, then marrying Joyce isn't such a terrible fallback."



Although Richard always put the company first, he secretly believed that Daniela's affection for Alexander wasn't just a relic of the past.


Her sentimental heart hadn't been hardened by their separation.



She surely still held Alexander in high esteem. As long as she harbored love for him in her heart,there was hope that all could be mended.



Alexander avoided Elite Lux; he had no desire to have his true intentions discovered by Daniela.



With the knowledge that Daniela was due at a social function that evening, he cleverly picked the same restaurant to dine in, setting the stage for an inadvertent encounter.



The construction team was already at the restaurant when Daniela walked in, her arrival leaving them momentarily speechless, captivated by her commanding aura.


At the toast, Cedric presented her with a glass of juice and clinked his glass against hers.



With a conspiratorial grin, he leaned towards the foreman and whispered, "Let's keep the evening light for her; alcohol tends to cloud her bright spirit." His voice dripped with an overt protective charm.



It was common knowledge among the construction team that Cedric's involvement in thei project was deeply tied to Daniela.


With genuine smiles, the workers toasted. "Ms. Harper,we'll give it our all! You can rely on us!"

As the president of a powerful and expansive company,Daniela graciously invited them to a lavish dinner.Her warm smile and effortless charm filled the room, though she knew full well that she couldn't prevent Cedric from visiting the site. This dinner was her subtle way of paving the path for him to earn the trust and camaraderie of the workers.



Marco Pittman, the foreman, observed their interactions,his expression one of content satisfaction.


The evening concluded with everyone feeling uplifted and jovial.



Daniela approached the counter to settle the bill,only to discover that Cedric had preemptively taken care of it. She then excused herself to the restroom,unaware that she was about to encounter Alexander upon her return.



Alexander's eyes were cold as he fixed his gaze on Daniela. "Are you seeing Cedric now?"



Daniela, completely sober, washed her hands before replying, "Mr. Bennett, is there something you require?"


Alexander's tone hardened as he pressed on. "I asked you a question! Are you and Cedric seeing each other now?"



He understood Daniela's character deeply. Unless her heart was engaged, she wouldn't have a meal with a construction team to be near Cedric.



"No," Daniela responded truthfully.



"Then what are your intentions?"



Maintaining her composure, Daniela replied calmly,"Regarding what exactly?"



"Concerning your feelings," Alexander stated,his stare penetrating. "About us."
###Chapter 87 You Are Not That Boy
Daniela kept her calm. "I've moved on."



Alexander narrowed his eyes. "What's that supposed to mean?"



Daniela responded simply,"Exactly what it sounds like."



Alexander gave a slight nod. "And what about you and Cedric?"



Daniela's tone was icy. "That's none of your concern."


"How could it not matter? You're my ex-wife! It's my responsibility to evaluate the men you pick!" Even Alexander realized how absurd he sounded.



Daniela, unfazed, said calmly, "I'm perfectly capable of handling it myself."



Alexander nodded again. "Fine, let's move on. As per our last conversation, you're handing over the North District deal to settle some old childhood debt?"



Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile at his remark.Slowly raising her eyes to meet his, she said, "You and I both know if you were truly that boy from back then."

Alexander's face froze, the words striking him harder than he expected. A wave of mortification washed over him, leaving him utterly speechless.



He stood there, rooted in place, struggling to muster a response. It felt like an eternity before he finally managed to lift his gaze.



That single, fleeting glance was all Daniela needed.



Until now,she had her doubts, but in this moment,she knew for sure.



Daniela's smile turned cold, almost mocking."Alexander, you've really let me down."


Her eyes were slightly red as she spoke, but it wasn't because of Alexander. It was the weight of the unwavering commitment she had poured into everything over the past ten years, the years that now felt as if they had been erased in an instant.


Without another word, Daniela turned and began walking away.



Alexander stayed rooted in place, his eyes locked on her retreating figure, watching her slowly fade into the distance.



Just as her figure was about to disappear, panic surged through him. He yelled desperately, "Daniela! Stop being so difficult! You're just making excuses to hold on to that North District contract. I am the boy from ten years ago. I helped you out of your depression,and you owe me for the rest of your life!"


Alexander's words rang out, but Daniela simply kept walking,unbothered.



Struck by her indifference, Alexander took a few staggered steps back.



His fists tightened, the pressure of panic flooding his chest. The realization hit him like a jolt-he was terrified that Daniela might never come back, that he had already lost her for good.


Everything he'd hidden-his lies, his motives-were now exposed to her.


She regarded him coldly, as though he were nothing more than a fool.



Pride coursed through Alexander's veins, and he couldn't bear to accept the humiliation.



He turned and stumbled off, unable to face the truth any longer.


Meanwhile, Cedric,waiting in the private room,finally emerged after a while. He caught the tail end of Alexander's shouting, but the creak of the door behind him drowned out the rest of the words.

Cedric couldn't make out what Alexander had been yelling.


From the bits he could hear, it sounded like it had something to do with events from a decade ago.



Just then, Daniela walked in, and he asked, "Was Alexander here? What was all that shouting about?"


Daniela opened the door to the private room, her voice calm. "Don't mind him. He's just being his usual over-the-top self."



If there had been even the faintest trace of feeling for Alexander before, it was gone now.


She couldn't bring herself to remember the time wasted on him over the past ten years. She was too sharp to get lost in the past; she understood the importance of moving forward, of never looking back.



Back at home, Richard was already in high spirits,celebrating.



This was how things had always gone.


No matter how ridiculous Alexander's requests were,Daniela would always cave in.



This time, it was just a contract-hardly a challenge for Daniela to refuse. The idea of Daniela becoming his daughter-in-law again brought Richard a great sense of satisfaction.



Once Daniela remarried Alexander, Elite Lux would be completely under his control. She would stay at home,raising kids and supporting her husband, while Alexander would take over Elite Lux gradually. By the time she noticed, Elite Lux would already be entirely in the hands of the Bennett family.



At that point, who could compete with Bennett Group in the entire country?


Richard had been eagerly awaiting this moment for so long.


He chuckled to himself, but his laughter was cut short when the front door suddenly swung open, and Alexander stepped inside.



Still smiling, Richard looked at him and asked, "When are you heading to Elite Lux to sign the contract?"


Alexander, frustrated, yanked at his tie as he explained what had happened.



Richard's brow furrowed as he quickly asked, "After you yelled all that,how did Daniela react?"



Alexander's eyes dropped, his mind still racing with confusion and panic. "She ignored me. I'm not event Boy sure if she heard me."


Daniela had changed so much.


In the past, her emotions were always clear,easy for him to read. Now, he couldn't even tell what she was feeling,let alone her thoughts.


Richard squinted, his voice low. "Then she's still unsure.I'll figure something out."


Alexander's grip tightened as he replayed the image of Daniela in the corridor over and over, feeling helpless to change anything.


She must have seen right through him.Otherwise,why would she be so distant and cold? 2



Richard took a long drag from his cigarette before turning to Alexander. "The secret spot in the tree Daniela talked about... Was it at the Harper family's villa?"



Alexander gave a brief nod.


Richard fell silent for a moment, then spoke. "Since that's where everything happened, there might still be clues there. Daniela's room could have some traces left. No one else is competing for the role of the boy from that year, so if you say the right things, you can win her over!" Even if Alexander couldn't convince her, at least she wouldn't completely reject him.



Alexander needed to act quickly and remarry her before Daniela realized everything.



After remarriage, everything would be much simpler.Her assets would become Alexander's, and the Bennett family could take control.


Having made up his mind, Richard quickly reached out to Katrina, telling her that he wanted to pay them a visit.



Katrina, excited by the unexpected news, assumed Richard was coming to talk about the marriage between Alexander and Joyce.



She was thrilled by the thought of it and eagerly opened the door, ready to welcome the Bennett family with open arms.

###Chapter 88 Caiden's Sudden Enlightenment 
Joyce shifted uncomfortably on the couch. "Mom,why do you think Alexander will come?"


With a knowing chuckle, Katrina replied, "HHe probably got rejected by Daniela. Do you really think the Bennett family hasn't considered all their options? At the end of the day, they're eyeing our fortune."



A knot of unease tightened in Joyce's chest. She harbored fears that Alexander might scorn her, and beyond that, she was troubled by the thought that he might not treat her child with kindness.



It wasn't until Katrina reassured her the Harper family's fortune would be in her child's name and she'd take care of the child herself that Joyce's tension eased slightly.



Caiden furrowed his brow upon hearing that.



The thought of taking care of a child was the furthest thing from his mind.



He had no interest in a life cluttered with the chaos of diapers and nursery rhymes.

Yet, he kept his feelings to himself for the moment.



Glancing over at Joyce's belly, Caiden realized this child wasn't connected to him by blood. Was he about to endow his vast fortune on someone who wasn't even his own kin? 4



Joyce living in his house and using his money was one thing. He couldn't take his wealth with him beyond the grave. But the thought of leaving it all to an outsider sent a chill down his spine. The child did not share his blood.



The more Caiden dwelled on this fact, the deeper his discomfort grew.


And if Joyce ever married, her allegiance would inevitably pivot to her husband's family, relegating him,her stepfather, to an ever more peripheral role in her life.



Something about the situation just didn't sit right with him,no matter how he pondered it.



He trudged towards the garden, his mood somber, and called back to Katrina that he was off to pick up Richard and Alexander.



Katrina, oblivious to the storm brewing in Caiden's mind, brightly reassured Joyce. "See how eager your father is to embrace a grandchild someday. Don't worry, Joyce. Everything in this house belongs to you and your child-no one can claim it otherwise."



Caiden's pace faltered as he stepped outside. For an inexplicable reason, he glanced back over his shoulder.



In the living room, illuminated by the bright lights,Katrina's face was heavily made up, her eyes alight with pride and her smile wide with a hint of smug superiority.



Memories flooded back to Caiden unexpectedly,recalling the summer Katrina first became a part of the Harper family.



He had come home to retrieve some documents during lunchtime.



He saw Daniela perched at the top of the stairs while Joyce,seated at the grand dining table with a bib tied neatly around her neck, declared insistently, "I want egg custard!"



The maid flashed a smile and suggested, "You've had a lot of egg custard today. Perhaps you'd prefer some fish instead?"



Joyce's mood soured instantly. She ripped off her bib and began to wail loudly.



Katrina shot the maid a fierce look and defiantly carried the whole plate of egg custards to Joyce, who devoured them with enthusiasm.



At that moment, Caiden hadn't really been paying attention.



It was just a bowl of egg custard, after all. Yet now,as he reminisced about the incident, he remembered seeing Daniela, whose plate bore nothing but a few scant leaves of vegetables.



During that time, Daniela had shed her baby fat at an alarming rate. But he had failed to take note.



Looking back, the maid's reserved expression,Katrina's self-satisfied smirk, and Daniela's silent acceptance all seemed to underscore Daniela's unhappiness.


That year, Daniela was merely five years old. Yet, in the face of such inequity, she did not weep or make a fuss.



Reflecting on it, Caiden couldn't fathom why the image of Daniela's small hands clutching a plate larger than her face now struck him so profoundly.



A torrent of feelings overwhelmed Caiden.



In the garden, the gardeners were conversing.



"Alexander Bennett is on their way. Seems like he's here to propose an engagement to Joyce."



"She's expecting, and he still pursues her?"



"For the affluent, money can buy almost anything,can't it? Moreover, since Daniela has severed her ties with her family, all properties in this home will soon be Joyce's. The Bennett family is shrewd in their dealings.They clearly recognize the advantage in this arrangement."



"In my opinion, everyone's adept at making calculations-everyone except Caiden. Daniela is his flesh and blood, his own daughter. How could he possibly disown her? She's both talented and compassionate. Should he ever face adversity, she would undoubtedly come to his aid. But is it wise to depend on someone as selfish as Joyce?"



"That's right! She doesn't even know who the father is.In any other family, she'd be nothing but a filthy scandal."



"Daniela would never find herself in such a disgraceful situation. There's a saying that a leopard doesn't change its spots, and there's some truth to it.Consider Joyce, wwho's lived in this home for years,yet remains as unrefined and impulsive as ever. Who knows where she got those traits? Anyone marrying her would surely be after her wealth." "I simply can't fathom Caiden's thought process. Why is he so lavish with his fortune on outsiders? Once he passes,how will he justify his actions to his first wife?What will he say when she inquires about the severe treatment of their daughter all these years?"



"Truly, while men may wander, it baffles me that Caiden takes his commitment to Joyce so seriously,given she's not even his own blood. What did the late his first wife see in him?"



The servants continued their hushed discussions.



Caiden watched the servants, his expression unreadable.



Usually,they lauded him for his genuine kindness,even towards his adopted daughter, filling him with pride.



Yet unbeknownst to him, behind his back, they considered him a gullible fool.

###Chapter 89 Caiden's Sudden Enlightenment
Caiden's life had flipped upside down in an instant.



For the first time, he sat down with a grave expression,mulling over the stark contrasts between Daniela and Joyce.



His thoughts consumed him so deeply that he failed to notice the Bennett family's car rolling through the gate.



It was only when Katrina's voice echoed in the garden that Caiden snapped out of his reverie, rising from his chair with a start.



As he made his way into the house,memories of the day he had cut ties with Daniela flooded back-the day she had knelt before him.



If it were Joyce, would she have made this choice?


Would she bid him farewell with a gesture of gratitude as her parting act?



Absolutely not-she wasn't the type to do that



For Joyce, her own well-being always took precedence over anything or anyone else.


At the dinner table, Katrina, wreathed in guilt, flashed sheepish, apologetic smiles at Richard and Alexander,while Caiden watched Joyce closely.


Joyce seemed preoccupied with herself, fussing and failing to see the bigger picture.She had potential for so much more, yet she seemed to settle for less.


During this tense moment, Katrina shot Caiden a significant look, silently prompting him to speak up.


"Alexander, please, have peace of mind. As long as you marry Joyce, everything from the Harper family will be yours and Joyce's, considering she's our only child. Isn't that right,Caiden?"


In that instant, Caiden acutely sensed the possibility that Joyce's lack of foresight might actualy drain his personal resources to rectify her blunders.



All the wealth of the Harper family had been painstakingly accumulated by Daniela's mother, and while he had reaped the benefits, the idea of redistributing it, as suggested in hushed tones by the servants, was contrary to Daniela's mother's wishes-and certainly not in line with Daniela's expectations.


Faced with the prospect of Joyce neglecting him in his later years, Caiden wondered desperately whom he could depend on. His thoughts whirled in confusion as the eyes of everyone at the dinner table turned to him.



Richard, ever the opportunist, flashed a concerned yet calculating smile and probed, "Caiden, is everything alright? You seem a bit off."


His presence was not just social; he was there to secure a promise from the Harper family and to unearth the childhood sketches Daniela had created with that boy from years ago. His gaze, filled with faux concern, subtly urged Caiden for answers.



Katrina initially beamed a smile, which soon dissolved into a look of puzzlement. "Caiden, didn't you mention you intended for everything to be left to Joyce and her future spouse? Wasn't that your plan?"


Caiden smiled and took a sip of his wine. "Richard, you must try this wine; it's exceptional."



At his response, Richard raised his eyebrow in surprise.



Katrina's face stiffened, her smile vanishing as she reined in her brewing irritation, her features settling into a frosty mask.


Joyce tugged on Caiden's sleeve, her expression fraught with anxiety. When she could no longer contain her impatience, she leaned in and whispered urgently,"Dad,why did you suddenly change the topic? Richard was only asking for your opinion. Just make it clear that the Harper family's assets are mine. Who else would you consider?"



She stated this as though it were the most natural conclusion, completely ignoring Daniela's existence.



Previously, Caiden hadn't given much thought to her dismissive attitude. However, this time, it stirred a sense of discomfort within him.



Both women, living under his roof and spending his money,seemed to constantly belittle and undermine his daughter.



A sharp glint flashed in Caiden's eyes, noticeable enough to make Katrina frown.



She leaned closer and hissed, "Caiden! What's gotten into you?"



Caiden merely shrugged off her concern with a scoff and took another sip of his drink, ignoring her question.



Richard, sensing the unresolved tension, chose not to press the matter.


After dinner, he suggested that Alexander and Joyce might want to retire upstairs to see the study,while he himself strolled into the garden to make a discreet phone call.
This maneuver tactfully gave Caiden and Katrina the opportunity they needed to have a private conversation.



The moment they were alone, Katrina's restraint shattered.



"What is the meaning of this, Caiden? Why didn't you say a damn thing just now? The Bennett family's finalizing everything, and all you did was sit there with your mouth shut like an idiot. What is it-can't bear to part with the family fortune? Or is it that you don't think my daughter deserves it? Let me guess-you're questioning if Joyce is even yours now?"



Overcome with emotion, Katrina hid her face in her hands, her body sinking to the floor as sobs racked her frame. "You heartless man! I gave up the chance to have children with you because I didn't want Daniela to suffer. Now that my childbearing years are gone, you've got the audacity to hold grudges?Caiden, you're nothing but a cruel, selfish asshole!"


In a sudden surge of fury, Katrina struck Caiden across the face.



The slap echoed sharply, powerful enough to leave Caiden reeling in shock.



Upstairs, the atmosphere was starkly different.Alexander, with just a handful of gentle words, convinced Joyce to let him see Daniela's room.



There, amidst the quiet and dust, he discovered a sketchbook. Flipping it open, he found the last message the boy had scribbled for her.



"Let's meet tomorrow."

###Chapter 90 What He Offered Now Meant Nothi...
For some inexplicable reason, the childlike handwriting on the paper struck a chord of familiarity within Alexander.



It felt hauntingly familiar, as if he had encountered it somewhere in the past, yet he couldn't pinpoint exactly where.



As Joyce watched Alexander prepare to leave, a wistful sigh escaped her lips. "When are you going to marry me?"



Preoccupied, Alexander merely climbed into the car,leaving her question hanging unanswered in the chilly air.



From his vantage point next to the car, Richard caught sight of Joyce's reddened eyes. He offered a sympathetic comment. "Go back inside. Don't worry.This will sort itself out soon enough."



Yet, inwardly, he harbored a deep aversion towards Joyce.He thought her utterly foolish, behaving like a petulant child. Did she really believe the universe orbited around her whims?

Inside the car, Richard asked, "Did you manage to get the sketchbook?"



Alexander nodded absentmindedly.



Richard's disdain for Joyce only deepened.



Her lack of prudence was astonishing.



She had let Alexander into Daniela's room without hesitation and allowed him to take whatever he wished without batting an eye. Could she really be so ridiculously naive?



Letting her into the Bennett family was as good as inviting burglars to raid their treasures.



With a frown, Richard sighed deeply. After a moment,he turned back to Alexander, decisiveness in his voice."Hand over the sketchbook. There's no need for you to seek out Daniela. I'll take care of it."



Alexander was still preoccupied with the handwriting,racking his brain to recall where he had last seen it,but the memory remained elusive.







With that, the Bennett family pulled away, their car disappearing into the distance.



No assurances came from Caiden; his silence said it all.



Katrina's cries echoed through the living room, her shoulders trembling with emotion.



With frustration evident, Caiden called the driver,who immediately came to pick him up.


Just as Caiden stepped into the waiting car, Katrina's voice cut through the air from behind. "Where are you going?"


Paying no mind to Katrina, Caiden waved the driver forward, urging him to start the car and drive off.


Glancing at the rearview mirror, the driver inquired,"Where are we headed, sir?"



After a brief pause, Caiden muttered, "Elite Lux."



The driver nodded subtly, pressed the accelerator,and the car sped off.



As they reached Elite Lux, droplets began to speckle the ground.



Fresh from a banquet, Daniela emerged in a flowing silver-white gown that accentuated her elegance.


A security guard offered her a tissue. With a warm,genuine smile, she accepted, murmuring, "Thank you Her smile reflected a deep, genuine warmth reminiscent of her mother.



A wave of regret washed over Caiden. Realizing his shortcomings as a father over the years, he impulsively swung the car door open and called out,"Daniela."



Daniela, adorned with long earrings that delicately grazed her cheeks, turned to find Caiden under the somber, drizzly sky.



Daniela hesitated briefly before stepping out, her tone calm and courteous. "Do you need something, Mr.Harper?"



Caiden gazed at her intently, the realization dawning on him that the little girl who once perched on the stairs munching on her meals had blossomed into a poised young woman.


His words came at last, but a slight quiver betrayed his composure. "I remember Katrina used to laugh about how you'd never sit at the table, preferring the stairs instead.Was she right?"



The evening air wasn't particularly brisk, yet Caiden's words whisked Daniela back to a childhood tinged with solitude. Her smile dimmed a touch as she murmured,"| don't remember."

 In those days, she'd been overlooked, invisible. And now,she was unwilling to entertain belated regrets.



By holding on to her grudge, she risked being seen as utterly void of compassion.



Upstairs, Josie had prepared a steaming pot of soup,and the ringing of a phone call pierced the quiet night.


After disconnecting, Daniela maintained her composure and nodded towards Caiden, her voice steady. "The past is behind us. I'm fortunate now to have people who care about me. Mr. Harper, goodbye."


With those words, Daniela pivoted and strode away.



In that instant, a profound melancholy enveloped Caiden. He watched her receding figure, yearning to call after her, yet she vanished into the distance,beyond reach.



His attempts at reconciliation now seemed futile to Daniela.



As the rain began to fall, the driver unfurled an umbrella over Caiden, who asked in a hushed tone,"Does she still harbor resentment towards me?"



The driver, a thoughtful man in his fifties, replied cautiously, "Ms. Harper is compassionate by nature.She might be hurt, but at the end of the day, you're

her father. Blood ties are enduring, a connection that's difficult to sever."



He paused, choosing his next words carefully. "In some families, emotions aren't always laid bare immediately, particularly if they wish to avoid stirring up conflict."



Caiden regarded the driver with a hint of curiosity.



Tilting the umbrella against the wind, the driver spoke with quiet conviction. "You see, when someone joins a new family, they tend to tread lightly and avoid stirring trouble. Yet, when they're among their own family, they're more inclined to express their true thoughts. Do you know the reason?"



Taking a thoughtful pause, he went on, "It's because with one's own family, there's a greater latitude for openness. With in-laws or outsiders, however, people are more guarded."



He looked over at Caiden, adding,"The same principle applies to your family, Mr. Harper. Observe carefully,and over time, you'll discern Daniela's and Joyce's genuine selves. You've ascended the ranks through sheer effort, assuming others have endured similar trials.Yet,human nature is fickle. Ultimately, everyone prioritizes their own interests."



The driver, having served under Daniela's mother for many years, had witnessed much and was unafraid to share his insights.



Throughout the ride home, Caiden was deep in reflection.



Katrina lingered in the living room,awaiting his return.Upon his entry, she offered him a towel.


As Caiden made his way upstairs, Katrina glanced at the driver with a hint of unease. "Where did he go?"



With a calm demeanor, the driver responded, "He went to his office, reviewed some documents, then returned."



Katrina exhaled in relief.



She had suspected he might have developed a sudden sense of duty and set off in search of Daniela.



It turned out her fears were unfounded.

###Chapter 91 The Death Of Daniela's Mother
Katrina had just stepped out of the shower and was lying on the bed,plotting her next strategy.



Her choice of attire, a revealing dress, shimmered with an alluring charm in the dim light.


She was especially enthusiastic tonight. As soon as Caiden entered the room, she embraced him and started kissing him.



However, Caiden's interest seemed to wane, his responses sluggish and detached.



Driven by the lure of the family fortune that dangled within reach, Katrina intensified her efforts.



Outside, the storm unleashed its fury, mirroring the tumult inside.



Once their encounter concluded, Katrina, breathless and flushed, nestled against Caiden's chest and murmured, "Honey, what's wrong today? You're not quite yourself."



Caiden, unfazed,reached for a cigarette and lit it, the silence thickening with the rising smoke. Katrina held her breath,watching him, and once the cigarette was spent, she attempted to recapture his attention,her seductive dress clinging to her contours.



"Honey, it seems Alexander is gearing up to propose to Joyce formally," she ventured, trying to gauge his reaction.



Caiden, drawing another cigarette, responded with cold indifference,"Alright."


Smoke wreathed around his face, quickly shrouding his expression.



Clearing of her throat, Katrina sought to reclaim Caiden's attention.



In the past, such a signal would compel him to discard his cigarette and draw her close, enveloping her in his arms.



Now, however, Caiden appeared deaf to her cue. A flicker of anguish shadowed Katrina's gaze, deepening ominously before she quickly veiled it with a radiant smile, masking her true feelings. She had crucial motives today and needed Caiden on her side.


Rather than protest, she pressed herself against him,her fingers sketching tender patterns against his chest."Honey, consider the benefits after Joyce marries Alexander. Given the Bennett family's flourishing status, Joyce would thrive as one of them."

 Caiden, wrapped in his own silence, gave no response as he continued to puff on his cigarette.


Katrina continued "Joyce is already pregnant. The Bennett family probably wants to seal the deal because she's the only daughter, and our family's wealth is a big safety net for her. But for some reason,Richard didn't mention it today. It seems he's waiting for our promise. What I'm getting at is..."



Katrina paused strategically, her eyes locking onto Caiden's with intentional gravity. "What I'm getting at is that ultimately, the family fortune will belong to Joyce. We're doing this for her future, aren't we? So,why not transfer your assets to her now?" 1



Caiden lingered in silence, a thin trail of smoke curling from his cigarette.



Katrina arched up and planted a kiss on Caiden's lips."Besides, everything's been arranged,right? We won't have any more children. We might as well let Joyce solidify her standing in the Bennett family. Once Joyce is married, my only job will be to attend to you."



Her voice was tender, filled with the assumption that Caiden would concur. However, he remained eerily silent.



Katrina nudged his arm, her voice laced with concern."Honey, what's on your mind?"

Caiden murmured, "I need some time to think it over."


Katrina's brows knit together in a sudden scowl, a flash of revulsion darting across her features unseen by Caiden.



When she lifted her gaze again, her expression had morphed into one of wary calculation. "Certainly,take your time to consider. I know Joyce holds a special place in your heart, and you always prioritize her needs. But, honey, we need a swift decision. Our daughter's condition grows more apparent by the day,and if she bears a child out of wedlock and it becomes public, it would tarnish our family's reputation, don't you agree?"



Caiden's reply came as flat as before. "Indeed."



Katrina's displeasure deepened, puzzled by Caiden's unusual detachment.



She had been gearing up for this moment all year.



After dedicating over a decade to serving Caiden, she was at the brink of claiming the family fortune, and errors were not an option now.



She was poised to press further, but Caiden abruptly snuffed out his cigarette and stood.



Katrina watched his retreating figure heading towards the bathroom, her expression hardening into a frosty glare.



What exactly was happening?


Caiden was unusually aloof, his demeanor casting a shadow over the evening.



As Katrina pondered his changed attitude, her seldom -used backup phone tucked away in a drawer buzzed urgently. Casting a cautious glance towards the bathroom, she retrieved the phone and stepped out onto the balcony.



"Mom,why on earth are you calling so late?"



The first time Katrina had encountered Brylee Harper,Daniela's mother, she had spun a tragic tale of being the sole survivor of her family, desperately seeking refuge. She had implored Brylee to take her in as a maid,claiming she had nowhere else to turn.



That deception had carried on for over a decade.



Even Caiden didn't know Katrina's mother was still alive.



"Send me some money; I lost again at poker!"



"Didn't I just hand you five hundred thousand? Mom,try to keep some for yourself."

"Just do it quickly! And since Joyce is pregnant, take good care of her."



Katrina responded with a subdued, "Yeah."



"What's the matter? You seem off. Isn't it said that you have Caiden completely captivated? What could possibly be troubling you?"


Katrina turned to check if anyone was behind her,finding herself alone.



She whispered, "I've noticed something off about Caiden today. Normally, he's quick to agree with anything I say. But earlier, when I suggested he should pass the fortune to Joyce, he paused-a first.Why have | devoted the last decade to that old man?Clearly, it's for the money. Why else would I endure,always smiling and bending over backwards?"2



Katrina gazed into the deepening night sky,her mind racing as a sudden thought struck her.


With a gasp of realization, she cried out, "Mom,could he possibly know about Brylee's death..."



"Ridiculous!" her mother yelled through the phone,cutting sharply through Katrina's spiraling thoughts."Brylee took her own life by jumping off that building.We will not discuss this again."

Katrina,subdued, nodded her head in agreement. "Yes,you're right. I'm just being foolish."



No sooner had she uttered the words than the door behind her emitted a haunting creak. Swiveling abruptly, Katrina's face hardened.



Her glare, caught in the ghostly glow of the moonlight,carried a silent threat.


She ended the call with a snap and called out to the door, "Who's there?"

###Chapter 92 Suspicion



"Who's out there?" Katrina's voice was sharp and controlled,slicing through the stillness like a blade.



She didn't hesitate and moved towards the door quickly.


Outside, the space was completely deserted. Not a single soul was there in sight.


Katrina stopped in her tracks, her keen eyes darting through the shadows. Out of nowhere, a sudden gust of wind swept past.



The door creaked, nudging softly against the frame,the sound startlingly loud in the quiet of the night.


Her expression didn't waver,radiating an icy calm that hinted at an underlying menace.



Turning back into the villa, she closed the balcony door firmly. Holding the spare phone in her grip, she began descending the stairs.



The master bedroom was eerily silent, the only sound coming from running water in the bathroom. Katrina's eyes flicked to the floor-the white tiles were pristine and bone-dry. She approached the bathroom door, gave it a light knock, and leaned in to listen, her ear resting against the cool wood.



"Sweetheart?" she called out.



No reply.



Whatever fleeting relief she'd felt earlier evaporated,replaced by a tightening unease curling in her chest.



She made her way to the table and picked up a fruit knife. With the blade firmly in hand, she returned to the bathroom door.



"Caiden,sweetheart? Are you in there?"



She called his name several times, but the only response was the persistent hiss of water flowing behind the door.



Katrina's fingers curled tightly around the doorknob,her other hand gripping the knife with an unyielding hold.



The blade was sharp-sharp enough to pierce a chest and sever an artery, causing instant death.



She knew this. She had done it before.



Even after all this time, the exact location of the heart remained seared into her mind, as though permanently etched like a blueprint. Taking a deep breath, she firmed her hold on the doorknob before shoving the door open with determined force.



Inside, Caiden lay relaxed in the bathtub, lazily scrolling through his phone. Startled by Katrina's sudden entrance, he lifted his gaze, his expression a mix of surprise and confusion. "What's going on? I'm just taking a bath."



Katrina hid the knife behind her back. "I've been calling you. Why didn't you respond?"



Glancing briefly at her, Caiden returned his attention to the screen. "I'm playing chess on my phone. Didn't hear a thing."



Katrina forced a nervous laugh. "I thought something had happened, like you slipped or worse. You gave me quite a scare! At your age, you've got to be more cautious, sweetheart. Don't stay in too long,okay?Come out soon."



Caiden didn't bother responding, his focus already absorbed by the game on his phone. Katrina lingered in the doorway, silently observing his relaxed profile.



Thoughts raced through her mind as she deliberated.Maybe this was the moment-she could step forward and end it right now. Just then, a knock broke the tension. The dangerous glint in Katrina's eyes disappeared in an instant. She left the room, returning the fruit knife to its usual place. Only after that did she turn the handle and open the door. She shot the housekeeper a sharp glare, her tone curt as she asked, "What now?"



The housekeeper faltered briefly before replying,"Ronald and Wyatt have arrived. They've brought some members of the Harper family with them."



Katrina's expression darkened into a deep frown.Returning to the room, she stated flatly,"Ronald and Wyatt are downstairs."



Without lifting his eyes from the screen, Caiden dismissed her words. "You deal with it. It's probably about jobs again. What can those fools even manage,anyway?"



Katrina's gaze lowered as she studied Caiden's indifferent profile. Her voice was calm but probing as she asked, "Did you go up to the rooftop earlier?"



Still focused on his game, he replied in a distracted tone, "Why would I go up there? I'm occupied here.Don't disturb me."



The tension in Katrina's chest finally started to subside,and a subtle smile crept onto her lips. "Alright. You focus on your game. I'll take care of it. I'll just tell them  to talk to Daniela. Those penniless relatives of ours are more trouble than they're worth. Hiring them would only invite chaos into the company."


Running a company meant one golden rule: never mix family with business.


If they succeeded, they'd demand praise. If they failed,you couldn't even call them out.



It wvas a headache waiting to happen.



Caiden had always avoided hiring family, preferring to steer clear of unnecessary complications.



This approach pleased Katrina immensely.



To her, the Harper family's fortune was meant solely for Joyce. Letting these relatives into the business was like laying landmines-ready to go off and block Joyce's path when her time came to take the reins.


Handing this mess over to Daniela felt ideal. Daniela wasn't her child, so Katrina had no reservations about complicating her life.



Katrina took her time, slipping into a cozy outfit and carefully rubbing hand cream onto her skin. Only then did she make her way downstairs, her steps unhurried and composed.



Downstairs, Ronald paced restlessly, his frustration  evident. "When is Katrina coming down? Does she think she can stay upstairs forever? If she won't come,then call Caiden down instead!"



The housekeeper responded courteously, "Mr. Harper is still in the bath, and Mrs. Harper oversees all family matters here. I ask for your patience."



Ronald glanced at his watch, his expression darkening."It's been over thirty minutes! How much longer do we have to sit here?"



The housekeeper, busy pouring drinks for the guests,seemed visibly uneasy.



Turning to his family, Ronald vented furiously. "Look at this! Do you see how full of herself she is? Katrina was nothing more than a housekeeper here once! She wormed her way into Caiden's bed while his first wife was too preoccupied to notice. Back in the day,a shameless woman like her would've had everyone pointing fingers. And now? She struts around as if she owns the place! She's the one calling the shots in the Harper family business while we, the real Harpers, are left out in the cold, unable to even secure jobs in our own company. And that's not the end of it. After shoving her own daughter into Daniela's company,she destroyed that connection by persuading Caiden to sever ties with Daniela entirely. Who does that? WVhat kind of woman operates like this? Why is she still even a part of this family?"

Desperation crept into Ronald's tone as he turned to the elderly woman on the sofa. "Mom, you have to step in. If you don't, she'll trample all over Wyatt and me!"



Despite her years,Peyton Harper remained sharp and perceptive.


She gave a decisive nod and addressed the housekeeper. "Go upstairs and tell Caiden his mother is here. Get him down at once! I kept quiet when Daniela was disrespected in this family, but now she's the CEO of Elie Lux, worth billions! And Caiden severed ties with her? Has he lost his senses?"



The housekeeper nodded obediently and started up the stairs to summon him.



As the housekeeper neared the stairs, Katrina appeared at the top, her face hard with cold disdain as she made her way down.



Ronald jabbed a finger at her, his voice rising. "Daniela told me she wanted to offer Wyatt and me top jobs -million-dollar salaries! And you destroyed it! Katrina,if you don't find us similar positions in Harper Group,this won't end here!"



Standing beside him, Wyatt tightened his fists and chimed in, "Exactly! You better do what we say!"Behind them, the rest of the Harper family nodded and murmured their support.
###Chapter 93 Peyton Returned
Katrina heard their words and responded with a mocking laugh, causing both Ronald and Wyatt to shift uncomfortably.



"What's so funny?" they demanded angrily.



Katrina crossed her arms, her attitude suddenly shifting from the meek persona she had put on for Caiden.With a biting smirk, she shot a cold look at Ronald and Wyatt.



"You two? Really? Like you're even close to deserving that. A million-dollar salary? Please, do you actually think that's ever going to happen? I get it, you're broke. Fine. But I've got more important things to focus on right now. Want money? Here, take this handout and stop whining."



Ronald's expression soured, his eyes narrowing."Katrina! Who do you think you're insulting? A handout from you? Don't make me laugh. You're nothing but a gold digger who wormed her way into my brother's bed. What do you have to be so smug about? Let me make it clear-if you don't make things right and compensate us for our losses today, I won't  just let this go."



If there was one thing Katrina couldn't stand, it was when people brought up her past.



She had worked her way up by playing the sympathy card, starting as a maid under Brylee before setting her sights on Caiden. The affair had been a scandal at the time,whispered about behind closed doors.


But after she gained power, she made sure to replace all the household staff, making sure no one would ever bring it up again-until now.


These two idiots had crossed the line.



"Leslie! Get them out of here!" Katrina's anger flared,her voice rising. "Forget the money! I wouldn't even give them a single hair from my head!"



"Katrina, you've got some nerve!" A sudden, stinging slap landed across her cheek, making Katrina gasp.



Her hand shot up to her face as she turned around,only to find Peyton standing right in front of her."Peyton? What are you doing here?"



Peyton squinted, her gaze sharp and unforgiving. She hadn't uttered a single word up until this point and quietly watched everything unfold.



Over the years, this daughter-in-law had become  increasingly bold and disrespectful. Peyton hadn't taken Ronald's and Wyatt's complaints seriously when they first called. Katrina's sweet words and docile nature had been nothing more than a carefully crafted act.



"Get Caiden down here!" Peyton commanded sharply.



Katrina pressed her lips together, her left cheek now swollen from the slap.



Inside,she cursed whoever had thought it was a good idea to bring Peyton back from the countryside.



With a forced smile, she said, "Didn't you mention you weren't used to city life? What brings you here today?"



As she spoke, she cursed Peyton in her mind.



Peyton remained seated, her posture rigid and unyielding. "Bring Caiden down here."



When Caiden walked in, he offered a quiet "Mom" in greeting before settling into a seat close by.



Katrina was sent upstairs, out of earshot.



Peyton's voice dropped to a chilling tone as she turned to him. "So, you've cut ties with Daniela, have you?"



Caiden,perched on a small stool, gave a brief nod. "Yes."



"She's your own daughter. Your flesh and blood. Have you completely lost your sense, Caiden?"



Lately, he'd been hearing this so much that it hardly registered anymore.



Caiden glanced up at the stairs and saw Katrina watching from above. He was about to say something but thought better of it and kept quiet.



"Regardless of anything,Daniela is your firstborn.How could you be so cruel? She's always had a gentle heart. If you hadn't pushed her to her limits, she wouldn't have pulled away. Even now, she's still considering ways to help her uncles find employment.Her heart is in the right place, Caiden. I'm telling you,it's time to bring Daniela back into this family!"



Caiden paused, glancing at the stairs again.



As expected, Katrina hurried down the stairs. "That's out of the question! Caiden's decision to cut ties with Daniela was officially approved!"



Katrina was in a panic. Alexander was ready to marry Joyce. Once Joyce took over the Harper family's fortune,Katrina wouldn't need Caiden anymore. With the Bennett family's support, there was nothing Joyce couldn't do. She'd already imagined a future where Alexander ruled Harper Group,with Joyce-her daughter-giving her the power she needed.



She was done being subservient. She was eagerly anticipating the day when Caiden would be the one waiting on her, not the other way around.



But now,Peyton wanted to bring Daniela back into the picture? That could mess everything up.



Peyton's gaze sharpened as she glared at Katrina."I don't care about legal papers. Daniela is still part of this family, whether you like it or not. Without my approval and a proper family meeting,she stays. The wealth you have now is because of Brylee. I kept quiet when you remarried, but I won't sit back and let outsiders take advantage of my granddaughter!"



To Peyton, the only thing that truly mattered was bloodline. How could Joyce possibly inherit the Harper family legacy? Absolutely not!


Caiden hung his head, not daring to protest. "Mom,please don't get upset. You're right. We'll do whatever you say."



Peyton's anger eased just a little.



However, Katrina suddenly lifted her head in pure shock. "Caiden! What exactly do you mean by that?"
Ronald quickly stepped in. "What's he talking about?Can't you see? Mom's here, and in this family, her word is law. Are you really going to defy her? Or are you trying to take down the whole Harper family just to help your daughter?"



It was a grave accusation, and Katrina knew she couldn't risk making things worse before securing the assets she needed.



Peyton shot Katrina a smug smile before focusing back on Caiden. "I'm not leaving. I'll stay here until this is sorted and Daniela is back where she belongs.Only then will I go back to the countryside."


Wyatt and Ronald were quick to assist Peyton, eager to settle her into the guest room.



To them, Daniela's return wasn't just about family-it also meant that their promised salaries would finally be within reach again.


All this time, Katrina had been holding on tightly to control,leaving them with nothing as a result.


On that very day, Peyton, Ronald, Wyatt, and their families-at least twenty people in total-moved into the house.

###Chapter 94 An Invitation



The Harper family's children played in the yard, their raucous laughter and chatter echoing loudly,shattering the tranquility and denying Katrina any semblance of rest.


Leaning against Caiden's chest, Katrina sought comfort. "Honey,what did your mother mean by that?After all these years of marriage, why am I still an outsider in her eyes? Is it because I never bore you a child? I made that choice so Daniela could bask in a mother's love, sacrificing my desires for hers. And now,am I to blame for that?"



Her voice cracked under the weight of her emotions,her sobs painting a picture of profound despair.



Caiden rested his arm lightly on her shoulder. "She's my mother, Katrina. You shouldn't take her words to heart."



Katrina's scowl darkened as she crossed her arms tighty. "And what am I to do now? How do I even begin to explain this to Alexander and Richard.Joyce's pregnancy will soon be visible to all." She sat up abruptly, wiping away her tears.



"Honey, let your mother think what she wantS. I've  weathered much for the love of you, and I'll bear this too.But not Joyce-she doesn't deserve this agony.Here's what we'll do. Tomorrow, I'll pick out a cafe.You get the lawyer there. We'll transfer the company shares and your personal assets into Joyce's name.After that,I'll meet with the Bennett family and secure her engagement to Alexander. Once we've got everything locked down, any objections your mother has will be meaningless by then. What do you think about that?"



Katrina's eyes shimmered with eager anticipation, her gaze fixed on Caiden as she hoped for an affirmative response.



However, Caiden remained engrossed in his mobile game, his head bowed, seemingly oblivious to her anxiety.



After a pause, he responded without looking up, "That won't work out. The moment my mom finds out,she'll lose it completely. She can't stand people scheming behind her back."



Katrina's face fell, and her fingers curled into tight fists, betraying her frustration.



Noticing her tension, Caiden glanced up briefly, his voice calm and unhurried. "But seriously, what's the hurry? Is it really necessary for Joyce to marry Alexander right now? As long as I'm behind her, she has the freedom to marry whoever she chooses.Why stir up unnecessary drama? If you provoke my mother and it affects her health, it'll become the talk of the town. And trust me, I'd be the subject of ridicule."



He shrugged, a sly smirk tugging at thecorner of his mouth. "Not that public opinion bothers me. I can handle abit of slander, but it would crush me to hear them speak ill of you. Let's hold off for now. Just focus on keeping my mom happy. If she's content,she'll approve anything you propose. Getting the assets into Joyce's name won't be a problem-it's all in the family anyway."



Katrina was on the verge of speaking out when Caiden silenced her, guiding her towards the door. "Enough of this, Katrina. Stop being so stubborn. My mother is here and you've barely said a word to her. How do you expect her to warm up to you? Go and spend some time with her."



Caiden brushed her off with a few words and went back to his game.



With a sigh of resignation, Katrina headed to Peyton's room,determined to make a good impression on her mother-in-law.She diligently massaged Peyton's legs,kneaded her shoulders, and even fetched a basin of water for her to soak her feet.



However, before Katrina could shift the conversation towards her grievances about Daniela, Peyton interrupted with a yawn, declaring her exhaustion and her desire to retire for the night.



Frustrated, Katrina retreated to her own room, only to discover Caiden already deep in sleep.



Fuming wwith irritation, she stepped onto the balcony,her fingers trembling as she dialed Richard's number.



Richard,always pragmatic, wasted no time in cutting to the chase. He stated that Joyce had to be officially declared the heiress to the Harper family fortune before any wedding plans could proceed. Why would the Bennett family invest in raising another man's child that Joyce was carrying if she wasn't acknowledged as the heiress?



The conversation left Katrina even more agitated.Just then, Joyce entered the room, visibly distressed."Mom,why won't Dad transfer the family assets to me?Is he still thinking about fixing things with Daniela?"



"He's not," Katrina declared with unwavering certainty."Your father holds my opinions in the highest regard.He's merely acting the part of the devoted son now because that old hag is around. Do you forget? She opposed our marriage initially, yet here l am."



Joyce's anxiety seemed to dissipate at Katrina's assertive words. Later, she attempted to contact Alexander before retiring for the night, but received no response.



...


The following morning, the Harper family household was engulfed in chaos.



Katrina felt completely swamped, rushing around in a frenzy to tackle the endless demands of the day.


In the midst of this turmoil, Peyton took Caiden aside into the garden. "You need to take Daniela back to our family."


Caiden, unexpectedly compliant, simply nodded."Alright."





Smirking with satisfaction at his obedience, Peyton gave him a firm pat on the shoulder and inquired about Daniela's company address.



Standing before the towering Elite Lux building,Peyton craned her neck, awestruck by the architectural magnificence.



She turned to Ronald, who was standing next to her,and questioned with a hint of disbelief, "Is this really Daniela's company?"



Ronald flashed a triumphant grin as he nodded."Without a doubt! Your granddaughter has made an outstanding mark in her field. Can you believe it?She's sitting at the very top as the wealthiest in the world! I've heard her clothing line sells for outrageous amounts, hundreds of thousands each."



Peyton's expression illuminated with pleasure.


Ronald assisted her toward the building's grand entrance. However, as they neared, a security guard stepped in front of them, blocking their way.



Ronald's smile faltered, his brow creasing with coldness. Despite this, the guard addressed them in a respectful yet firm tone. "Ms. Harper is currently overseas at our main office. She won't return for another two weeks."



Unfazed, Peyton maintained her cheerful demeanor,nodding appreciatively to the guard. With Ronald's arm for support, she turned and made her way back to the car. As they departed, Peyton cast a final glance at the building. A surge of pride swelled within her.


Once they had left, Lillian emerged from her discreet spot and approached the guard. "There's no need to inform Ms. Harper about today's visit. Let's pretend it never occurred. If they show up again, just let them know that she isn't available to see them."



The guard gave a firm nod in acknowledgment."Understood."
At that moment, Daniela's phone lit up with a call from Richard. "Daniela, are you free today? I'd like to take you out for a meal."



Daniela's brow furrowed in suspicion.



Richard, known for neither his kindness nor his empathy, had never extended such an invitation before. Her mind flashed back to the days she had devotedly followed Alexander, seeking his favor,only to be met with Richard's scathing mockery.



She vividly remembered him belittling her in front of an audience, sneeringly branding her as "merely Alexander's slave."



And now, here he was, reaching out as if none of that had happened.



"Daniela, what's the matter? You seem quiet. Have you forgotten my voice?" Richard chimed in, his tone overly cheerful. "I'm already at your office building.It's lunchtime, and believe it or not, we've never actually shared a meal, just the two of us. And don't worry, Alexander won't be joining us. Come on, I was once your father-in-law.Would you really deny an old man a bit of company?"



Realizing that Richard wouldn't take no for an answer and would likely persist if she declined, Daniela accepted reluctantly. "Alright."

###Chapter 95 The Sketchbook
Lunch was arranged at a cozy restaurant sitting right in front of Daniela's company building.



As she entered, she found Richard already comfortably settled at a table, awaiting her presence.



Daniela's expression softened into a courteous smile as she took her seat.



Richard greeted her with a warm smile. "It's been too long, hasn't it? You seem slimmer."


His voice carried a light, familiar tone,the sort that old friends might use to reconnect after years apart.



Richard had this innate ability to foster a cozy, inviting ambiance effortlessly.



Daniela cut straight to the chase. "So, what do you need from me?"



The interaction, though polite, retained a certain cool formality.



Richard gestured to the staff, signaling that they were ready for their meal. While Daniela focused on her food, Richard kept up his affable facade, his smile never wavering. "You really stand out, Daniela. Bred  from such a noble family, your elegance and decorum are beyond reproach. Compared to you, Joyce is barely even in the same league."



Daniela offered no response, merely selecting a piece of sushi and continuing her meal.



Richard continued, "In the past, I may have been unkind to you. Please, let's put that behind us. Things have been overwhelming for me, and I know I let my frustrations slip out unfairly. I hope you can let it go,Daniela."



From a tender age, Daniela had been her mother's shadow at stately gatherings. While her recollections of those formative years were vague, her proficiency in managing such affairs had become second nature.


Offering him a polite smile, she responded, "You've a lot on your plate, yet you found time to invite me to lunch.I really appreciate the invitation."



Her reply was courteous but reserved, skillfully dodging Richard's attempt at reconciliation. His smile wavered for a moment.



"No need to be so formal," he suggested with a semblance of warmth. "After all, we are family. I've watched you grow alongside Alexander, almost as if you were my own. There's no need for such formality between us."
Observing Daniela's reluctance to engage further,Richard changed his approach once more. "I know you've been tied up, but how about joining us for dinner at our place next time? With Alexander around,it would be wonderful to reconnect."



Daniela continued to focus on her meal, maintaining her poised demeanor and refined movements.



"Daniela, I've asked for your time today for a couple of important reasons. First off, I owe you an apology.Alexander relayed to me what he said to you earlier.I've given him a piece of my mind-truly, it's absurd to dredge up childhood stories in business dealings. It's complete nonsense! Please, don't dwell on it. He wasn't in his right mind. I assure you, he wvill apologize to you face-to-face.I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive him."



After a brief silence, he added, "The second matter l needed to address is this." He reached behind him and retrieved a sketchbook. For a moment, Daniela thought it was her own, but she soon realized the difference. Her own sketchbook bore an illustration of a little boy on its cover, whereas this one depicted a little girl.



Richard opened the sketchbook and began turning the pages. "Over the years, Alexander has never stopped thinking about you. After he gave you that first sketchbook, he crafted this one as its counterpart. See here-he's preserved it all this time." 2



Daniela froze, her hand pausing mid-air.



Carefully flipping through the pages, Richard stopped at the final one and pulled out a neatly folded note.On the note were the words, "I want to see you."



A wave of emotions overtook Daniela. She quietly put her fork down and extended her hand to take the sketchbook.



Without uttering a word, she scrutinized the pages meticulously,her face betraying no emotion.



Meanwhile, Richard observed her with keen interest,his face momentarily clouded by a flicker of apprehension. He had someone reconstruct the sketchbook to mirror the one Daniela once cherished,yet, devoid of any artistic insight, he remained uncertain if it perfectly captured every intricate detail.


After the meal, Richard courteously walked Daniela to the grand entrance of the Elite Lux building.



His smile was soft and reassuring as he remarked,"Daniela, you're aware of how reserved Alexander can be. However, beneath that quiet exterior, you've always held a special place in his heart. His dealings with Joyce are mnerely a formality-she is, after all, a Harper, and he had little choice. But the bond you and Alexander share? That's genuine,isn't it?"



Beneath the grand building, Daniela stood, ethereal in her bespoke white gown.



She gave a faint nod, her voice tinged with a hint of sorrow as she responded, "Yet, there is something real between Alexander and Joyce too. I think it's best if I step back."



Richard's lips twitched nervously before he leaned forward, his tone earnest. "No, that's not the case at all! What Alexander feels for you-that's true love!"



Daniela's head tilted slightly, her earrings moving gracefully. "Let's not linger on this topic. It belongs to the past. Richard, I appreciate your kindness in sharing the sketchbook with me today. I must leave now."



She spun around without awaiting his reply and strode determinedly into the building.



Richard, who had appeared nervous just a heartbeat ago,now flashed a victorious smile.



He eagerly retrieved his phone and dialed Alexander's number. "It's done," he announced with glee. "I'm convinced Daniela still harbors feelings for you.Forget Joyce! Don't let Daniela misinterpret things any further!"



In stark contrast to the grandeur of the Elite Lux, the Harper family's wealth seemed trivial, mere loose change.


On the other end of the call, Alexander's voice was laced with skepticism. Richard's assurances seemed overly optimistic.


"Are you sure about that?"



Previously, Daniela had only shown contempt for him,consistently keeping her distance as if he were contagious-not the behavior of someone secretly smitten.



"Absolutely!" Richard was practically vibrating with anticipation. He then cast an admiring glance at the majestic building, his smile broadening at the prospect of it someday falling under his control. "Daniela still has feelings for you. She's only been distant because of the divorce. Now, as CEO of Elite Lux,she has her reputation to consider. But mark my words, play your cards right,and Elite Lux could be in your grasp before you know it. Let me arrange a delightful dinner.Daniela will come by, and as the wine flows, you two can reconnect and see where the night takes you.Daniela's always been a sucker for romance. Reignite that old flame, and she'll be walking down the aisle with you again in no time!"



Alexander absorbed this silently, finally offering a low,noncommittal grunt of "Mm." Yet, Richard detected a hint of satisfaction in his tone.



After Richard hung up, his phone buzzed with an incoming call. This time, it was Katrina on the line. He promptly pressed the decline button without a second thought.



Daniela entered the elevator, finding Lillian already inside, awaiting her. "You're not actually considering giving Alexander another chance, are you?"



"Absolutely not," Daniela responded with composure.



"Then what was all that about just now?"



"Merely messing around with him. They think I'm the idiot, strutting around with their pathetic charades,hoping I'll fall for their garbage. I've known that sketchbook inside out for over a decade-l spotted the discrepancies immediately. They think I'm stupid enough to buy this bullshit? I'll make them regret ever trying to screw with me!"



Daniela admitted to her own stupidity back then-letting herself get swept up in ridiculous fairy tale fantasies about love.



Alexander was never the man she had imagined him to be. Yet, he persistently resurfaced,wielding the same old manipulative tactics, aiming to exploit her once more.
Every damn time, he tried his shameless crap, thinking she would just let him take everything and walk away unscathed.



Such individuals were nothing more than the leeches of society. And leeches deserved nothing less than to be obliterated underfoot.
###Chapter 96 You Broke Them Up
After Peyton's visit to Daniela's company, she had become utterly insufferable. She couldn't go a minute without bragging about her "most accomplished granddaughter."


At every meal, without fail, she would point to a dish on the table and announce to everyone, "This is Daniela's favorite. You should all have more of it-maybe it'll make you as clever as she is."


Katrina forced herself to swallow both her food and the simmering rage building inside her.


"Katrina!" Peyton suddenly slammed her fork down onto the table, her sharp eyes locking onto her. "Have you lost all sense of manners? What's with that expression? I'm still here, aren't I? Or do you think you're the one in charge now?"



Then, Peyton shifted her gaze to Joyce, who was sitting at the head of the table. "And you-sitting at the main seat in front of us all? Like mother, like daughter! We gave you a roof over your head and even let Caiden, that clueless fool, marry your mother.If it weren't for us, what kind of life would you have?
How dare you push my true granddaughter out of this house!"



Turning to the housekeeper, she barked, "Daniela's room used to be in the center. Whatever it takes, that room needs to be restored by tomorrow. The best room in this house belongs to her!"


Unable to keep quiet, Katrina shot back, "Absolutely not! That room has the best sunlight, the warmest and brightest spot in the house. Daniela's current room is cold and drafty at night. Joyce can't even stand it."


Peyton slapped her hand on the table and stood up,her eyes flashing with fury. "So, the best room should go to your child? What about Daniela, my true granddaughter? Is she supposed to live in some filthy room?"



Katrina quickly protested, "That's not what I meant!"



As she spoke, she leaned into Caiden's arms,tears falling. "I know your mother has always seen me as less because I haven't had a child with your blood.I can accept that, but why bring Joyce into it? If I'm such a failure, maybe I should just disappear!"



Watching Katrina cry, Joyce's eyes welled with tears,and she began to sob too.



"Alright, let it go. Mom's getting old. Don't argue with her," Caiden muttered in his usual indifferent way. Katrina had heard this excuse so often that it grated on her nerves. Just as she was about to lose it, a servant entered and announced, "Alexander is here."


As soon as Katrina heard the name, her eyes lit up with excitement.



For days, she'd felt anxious. Richard hadn't returned her calls, and she feared things were getting out of hand. But with Alexander standing there before her,her hope surged. "What a surprise, Alexander! What brings you here today?"



Alexander wrapped the sketchbook in a black plastic bag and handed it to Katrina. "I borrowed this from Joyce a few days ago. It was taken from Daniela's room. Can you return it for me?"


Katrina beamed,eager to do Alexander a favor.course."



She considered inviting Alexander in for a meal,hoping to give him and Joyce a chance to connect.But the memory of Peyton's scowl held her back.



As Alexander was about to leave, he couldn't help but glance over his shoulder. His eyes landed on Katrina,who tossed the bag into the trash can.


The bag hit the bottom with a loud clang, and just like that, the trash can was full to the top. She then called over to a servant. "Replace the garbage bag and take it out."



The servant quickly crouched to change the bag as the door clicked shut behind Alexander.



After taking in the scene, he walked off.



To him, the sketchbook had done its job and was now nothing more than a burden. Since Daniela still harbored feelings for him, keeping it around seemed pointless.



He couldn't let Daniela still hold feelings for another man-even if that man was nothing more than a memory,a boy from the past.



If Daniela was going to have a future with him, she had to sever all tieswith her past. It wouldn't be hard-after all, they were just a few childish sketches,worth nothing at all.


As he thought about Richard's plan to have Daniela over for dinner in a few days, a slow smile tugged at the corners of his lips.



A flicker of anticipation stirred within him-something he didn't often allow himself to feel.



Daniela might not have the most exciting personality,but there was no denying her beauty. If she could  settle down and be the kind of wife and mother he envisioned,he thought their marriage might just work after all. 



With that thought in mind, Alexander pushed the gas pedal, and his car shot off down the road.


Meanwhile, Peyton waited for the doors to shut completely before looking at Caiden. "Was that Alexander just now?"



Caiden remained silent, but Ronald, always ready to cause a stir, spoke up. "Yes, that's Alexander.The one who married Daniela and then divorced her. And if I'm right..."



He paused for effect, then grinned as he continued,"It's all because of Joyce, isn't it? She made a scene at their wedding and ruined a perfectly good marriage."



Wyatt nodded eagerly, jumping into the conversation."Oh, that was all over the news. Mom, I still have the video of the fire on my phone. Your precious granddaughter nearly died in it."


He pulled out his phone, found the video, and passed it to Peyton.
###Chapter 97 Alexander And Peyton's Meeting
As Peyton watched the video, her expression darkened with each moment that passed.



Abruptly, she slammed her palm against the table,rising to her feet.


She jabbed a finger towards Katrina, her voice sharp as she accused her. "You scheming little pest!"


She then spun to face Caiden, her eyes ablaze with indignation. "Look at the sort of people you've let into our family. What have they turned your daughter into?On such a crucial day, they dared to behave like this and yet they lounge comfortably in our villa! You've clearly let these two rascals get away with too much.It's no wonder Daniela felt compelled to flee from this place after enduring such torment. Caiden, you really are beyond belief!"



As Peyton unleashed her tirade, Katrina attempted to muster a tearful display of innocence.



However, before she could begin her act, Peyton cut her off sharply, and when Katrina resorted to a dramatic threat to end her own life, Peyton coldly addressed Caiden. "If she's serious, then so be it!
Nonetheless,my granddaughter's marriage couldn't be delayed. Fetch Alexander immediately!"



Katrina's eyes shot open in alarm. "Peyton, what are you implying? Alexander belongs to Joyce now! Why summon him here? Are you seriously implying that Daniela and Alexander should try to spark things up again?"



Peyton swiveled her head back, her voice steady and resolute. "And why not? Marriage should be based on mutual affection. If Alexander retains his feelings and wishes to reunite with Daniela, I see no fault in exploring that possibility!"



The words hit her like a slap, and all Katrina could think about was how satisfyingit would feel to shut Peyton up permanently. 3



She turned to Caiden, her eyes brimming with tears,seeking some solace or support. Yet Caiden,absorbed in his phone and utterly detached, simply shrugged."Mom isn't wrong. Joyce was at fault back then.Haven't you always trusted the Bennett family? It wouldn't hurt to have Alexander come over and discuss things. Marriage does require agreement from both parties, after all. You wouldn't want Joyce to end up miserable, would you?"



His words rang with a veneer of reason and righteousness. Katrina's gaze lingered on Caiden, now riddled with doubt and suspicion. "Honey..." She positioned herself beside him, her tone tinged with concern. "Have you been dealing with something lately?"



Caiden barely glanced up from his game. "Hmm?"



"I haven't forgotten how you were once all for Alexander and Joyce, claiming they were perfect for each other, like it was written in the stars."



It had been days since she heard Caiden refer to Daniela as a disgrace.



"Really?" Caiden's response was nonchalant. "I still believe they're suited for each other. But with Mom here now, it seems wise to go along with her wishes."



Katrina had never considered Caiden particularly devoted or dutiful.


In her younger days, Peyton had been a forceful personality with little time to spare for nurturing her children. Despite outward appearances of closeness,Katrina sensed the children's affections were superficial at best.



She was keenly aware of the emotional distance.



Lately, Katrina had even grown suspicious of Caiden's frequent use of his phone, fearing he might be entangled in an affair.



However, her investigations revealed that Caiden's most significant phone expense was not clandestine meetings but online chess games. 2



Ultimately, it was Caiden who arranged for Alexander to visit, ostensibly for Peyton.


As Alexander was about to enter, Katrina clasped his hand urgently. Her expression was anything but serene as she implored, "Alexander, my mother-in-law is inside. Just respond to her questions, and remember,there's no need to be nervous or speak without thinking,alright?"



Pulling his hand gently from her grasp, Alexander responded with a measured coolness, "Understood."


Feeling the absence of his hand, Katrina experienced a pang of emptiness.



Upon his entry, Peyton greeted him with uncharacteristic warmth. "Alexander!"



Taking a seat, Alexander acknowledged her with a nod."It's good to see you, Mrs. Harper."
###Chapter 98 Hands Off The Harper Family's Fortune
Peyton, her face etched with deep lines of age,suddenly beamed a wide smile. "Alexander, you see, l invited you here because I want to know if you still harbor any feelings for Daniela."



Alexander caught a glimpse of Katrina, who was covertly signaling him with winks.



Richard had vaguely mentioned some urgent business over the phone. However,Alexander was completely unprepared for such a direct personal query.



Caiden strode into the room with a platter with fruits,which he placed on the center table, casting a meaningful glance at Alexander.


"Nothing deeper to it. We're simply asking," Caiden remarked, extending an apple towards Alexander.



Without a word, Alexander kept his thoughts to himself.



Impatience crept into Peyton's tone. "Speak, won't you? Without your words, how am I to assist you?"


Peyton,always charmed by the unpolished honesty of country people, found herself quite taken with Alexander.



Her expression softened into a gentle, encouraging smile. "Is it shyness that holds your tongue? Well then,let me pose it this way. If life hadn't thrown that unexpected twist, and you and Daniela were still married, do you reckon life would have been good with her?"



Alexander took a deep breath, weighing her question with a serious gaze. "Yes, I believe it would have been.Daniela was the one who initiated our divorce."



This was indeed the reality of their situation.


He had never once entertained the notion of divorce after marrying Daniela.



While Daniela lacked ambition, her compliance was a trait he found to be adequately pleasing.


Had it not been for her stubbornness, their lives would not have unfolded as they did.



With a chuckle, Peyton asked Alexander once more,"So, if I managed to reunite you two, would you be open to that idea?"



Katrina, who had been biting her tongue until now,burst out, "Peyton, that's out of line. Alexander is destined to marry Joyce. We've settled on that-he's my son-in-law."


Ignoring Katrina's protests, Peyton	grasped Alexander's hand with a sincere expression."Alexander, what do you say? If you're willing, I'll make it work."



Reflecting on his father's recent conversation with Daniela, Alexander hesitated momentarily before responding to Peyton, "I don't think she'd want to marry me anymore."


At his admission, Peyton slapped her thigh. Caiden's face softened.



"Don't fret over it. I'll take care of everything. Daniela isn't foolish; who else would she choose over a catch like you? Yes, she's quick-tempered, but overlook that for now. Just sit tight and wait for my update-I'll speak to her, and soon you'll be on your way to making her your bride again. Trust me, I'll sort this out flawlessly."



Alexander had previously crossed paths with Peyton.She consistently preferred the company of boys to girls. In her perspective, Daniela was scarcely noteworthy.



Alexander had frequently caught Peyton openly disparaging Daniela as a pointless expense, voicing her criticism loudly and without any hesitation.  His trust in Peyton's remarks was thin.


Raising his eyes, he noticed Caiden offering a surprisingly affectionate smile.



In a soft and reassuring voice, Caiden comforted him."Mom assured us she'd take care of everything. Just head home and stay tuned for updates. Remember,Joyce was the one who acted out of turn and shook up your marriage. If you're still harboring feelings for Daniela, it's only right that you receive some form of fairness."



Acknowledging the advice, Alexander stood up decisively. "I'll go and talk it over with my father."


Caught off guard,Katrina remained motionless nearby,her eyes wide as she watched the two men conclude their business just like that.



Not a single word was said about Joyce.



Burning with indignation, Katrina nearly sprinted after Alexander, but Caiden grabbed her arm, stopping her.



She whirled around, her eyes cold as she faced Caiden."What are you suggesting?"


Feigning naivety, Caiden explained,"The timing is off.Joyce is pregnant, and marrying into the Bennett family under these conditions would only lead to disdain. You'd have to promise a hefty dowry. The Bennett family isn't known for being gullible. If the dowry seems insufficient,would they even consider it?"



Katrina's expression turned from shock to sheer disbelief. Gazing intensely at Caiden, she challenged him. "Caiden! What exactly are you implying? Didn't we settle on a plan earlier? All the Harper family's wealth is going to Joyce! Are you seriously thinking of not keeping your word?"



Before Caiden could muster a reply, Peyton exclaimed,"What did you just say? Joyce is pregnant? And the baby isn't Alexander's? You plan to bestow the entire Harper family's fortune as Joyce's dowry?"


Peyton's reaction was fierce. "Katrina, over my dead body will you touch a dime of the Harper family's assets!"



Katrina felt like she was on the verge of losing her mind.



For years,she had weathered countless difficulties,all for the sake of Caiden. 2



Wasn't it all for a share of the Harper family's fortune?
2

Was all her dedication to be disregarded with a mere word from Caiden, demanding she forfeit her claim?That was utterly unthinkable. Suddenly, the entire house plunged into turmoil.







Back at the company, Daniela felt a sense of unease creeping over her.


Richard had shown up with a sketchbook similar to hers, suggesting they knew about the original one.


She swept the papers off her desk and informed Lillian,"I need to return to the Harper family."


"Okay." Lillian turned around, only to discover that Daniela had vanished without a trace.
###Chapter 99 Leeches



The Harper family's doorbell chimed unexpectedly.


Caiden was taken aback to find Daniela on the doorstep. "Daniela, you're back already?" he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice.


The bustling noise from inside the house ceased instantly at his words.


Peyton appeared in the doorway, excitement etched on his face,with Ronald and Wyatt trailing behind him.


"Daniela, you've returned from abroad! How marvelous to see you, and look at you, more stunning than ever!" Peyton burst out, his smile spreading from ear to ear. "Please, come in-this is your home.Why stop at the doorstep? Come on in,I've got fantastic news you need to hear!"


Before Peyton could elaborate further, Daniela cut in,her voice steady yet filled with urgency. "I apologize for interrupting, but there's a sketchbook I left in my old room. It's quite personal to me, and I need to get it back."



Her frustration was palpable; she was annoyed with herself for overlooking such a vital item amidst the recent upheavals.


At first, Daniela had assumed the figure from her past was Alexander. Having resolved to sever connections with him, she had dismissed the importance of the sketchbook.



However, upon realizing her mistake-that it wasn't him-she recognized the profound significance of the sketchbook.



Whether or not she would ever reconnect with that individual, the sketchbook had been her refuge during bleak moments. It was an essential emotional lifeline,and she was determined not to forsake it.



Peyton attempted to usher Daniela through the doorway,yet Daniela briskly shrugged her off.


"Would it be too much trouble for you to retrieve it for me?" Daniela asked Caiden, her voice carrying a frosty note.


Caiden's response came quickly, accompanied by a fervent nod. "Certainly. I'll go fetch it right away."


Katrina,who had been observing from a short distance,squinted her eyes in suspicion, scrutinizing Caiden's apparent zeal.


Something about his demeanor seemed decidedly peculiar. With a purposeful stride, Caiden ascended the stairs.


Meanwhile, Peyton, unfazed by the slight rejection,offered Daniela a reassuring smile. "Daniela, don't hesitate. Remember, you'll always belong with the Harper family. One day, all of this will be yours."


Daniela remained indifferent to the allure of the Harper family's fortune.


Elite Lux's three-month revenue was so staggering that they could have bought the Harper family outright.


Disinterested in their trivial disputes, she stood at the doorway, waiting for Caiden to return with her sketchbook.



Peyton chuckled. "You've really taken after your mother-stubborn to the core. However, a young woman like yourself can't afford to be this way forever. There comes a time when you must learn to lean on others. Believe me, life gets a lot easier when you're not trying to juggle everything on your own.I recently met Alexander. He's quite tall, strikingly handsome,and moves with an air of confidence. Word is, their family business is flourishing. Should you choose to join their family, they might even lend their expertise in managing your company. Here's a bit of advice-there's no need for a woman to prove she's overly capable. At times, it's wiser to let others take the lead. Consider your mother-she toiled relentlessly, but to what end? After her passing, all her hard-earned gains simply lined the pockets of those who hardly deserved it. You should delegate more. Let the men in the family handle some things.Speaking of which,your uncles are not only skilled but they're family too. Cutting ties with Caiden doesn't change who you are-you're still family. So,about helping your uncles with their jobs-you'll do it,won't you? With your success, it's the perfect time to step up and help. Ronald's managed to buy a new home,though he's still struggling with the mortgage."


Ronald's eyes sparkled with a mix of gratitude and urgency. "Exactly, Mom! We're still stuck with over two million in debt to deal with!"


"And Wyatt. You haven't purchased a car yet, have you?"



Wyatt quickly responded, "That's correct, Mom. But I've set my sights on a limited-edition supercar-priced just a bit over ten million!"



Ronald beamed with anticipation, exclaiming, "Mom,I'd like one too! My car's practically falling apart. And you know, our little house just isn't big enough for us anymore. Daniela, if you could get us another one,that'd be absolutely incredible!"


Peyton nodded with approval. "Absolutely. With Daniela raking in the cash these days, it's only fair she lends a hand to her family. Daniela,you really should take care of your nieces' and nephews' school fees as well."



Ronald chimed in, "Mom, the kids have been dreaming of studying at an international school."


Peyton quickly concurred, "Yes,definitely!"


Ronald cast a cautious glance towards Daniela and whispered, "But keep in mind, it's costly-millions per year. And if they go overseas for college, we're talking over ten million for each child."



The family had five children to consider.


A fund of seventy to eighty million wouldn't be amiss -it took a fortune to provide the finest for one's children.



Ronald's thoughts drifted towards the ambitious.



Peyton, steadfast in her resolve, proclaimed, "Yes,that wilI do!" She then turned to Ronald's wife, adding,"You're fortunate to have Daniela's support. With such great opportunities, don't hold back. Expand the Harper family-Daniela can handle it!"
###Chapter 100 The Sketchbook Was Lost
Peyton's authoritative tone rang out, making Ronald and Wyatt grin like fools as she piled on ridiculous demands for Daniela. 



Inside, Ronald's child was practically leaping with excitement. "I'm going abroad!"


Katrina observed from a distance.



Daniela stood poised at the doorway, waiting for Caiden's return with the sketchbook.



Noticing Daniela's quiet demeanor, Peyton frowned slightly and pressed her lips together in mild annoyance. "Daniela, you're awfully quiet. What's the matter? You're not having second thoughts,are you?Remember, you're a Harper. A little expense shouldn't make you bat an eyelid."



But Daniela remained silent,her expression unchanged.



Peyton's frustration grew, and she bit her lip, feeling a twinge of guilt for her past harshness towards Daniela. "Alexander is willing to remarry you. Can't you manage a smile for that?" At these words, Daniela struggled to contain her emotions. "To begin with, I never sought your intervention.Furthermore, I've severed all ties with the Bennett family, so kindly refrain from involving yourself."


Katrina, who had been listening, nearly burst into laughter.



Irritated by the exchange, Peyton's face darkened,and she abruptly slapped Daniela's hand.


The slap was sharp enough to leave Daniela's hand visibly reddened.


Daniela barely flinched, her eyes remaining locked on the staircase,ignoring the sting on her hand.



Caiden was yet to make an appearance.



From the corridor, his voice resounded, calling out,"Josie! Could you help me look for Daniela's sketchbook? It seems to have vanished."



To everyone in the family, it was clear that the sketchbook was Daniela's most treasured item.



The absence of it sent a wave of anxiety crashing over Caiden.



Josie hastened upstairs and embarked on an extended search.


Peyton craned her neck, her voice laced with concern."What's happening? Why is this taking so long?"


Unable to contain her frustration any longer, Daniela stormed inside. A throng of curious onlookers trailed behind her, all cramming into her tiny room.


A mere ten minutes later, every corner of Daniela's room had been upended.


"Where could it be?" Daniela demanded,her tone icy and her expression steely.


Caiden, not giving up, turned to Josie once more."Any idea where it is?"


Josie, overwhelmed and close to tears, admitted, "I honestly don't know. Mrs. Harper told me Ms. Harper should tidy her own room, so I steer clear of it.Besides, it's quite stuffy in here-no windows, no sunlight. It's usually deserted."


Caiden's brow furrowed in response. Trying to reassure Daniela, he said, "Don't worry. Josie hasn't touched anything in here, so it's bound to be somewhere around. We don't have many visitors, so it surely hasn't been misplaced."



Upon hearing that, Daniela halted mid-motion, her eyes narrowing as she fixed a piercing gaze on Katrina.
"Why are you staring at me like that? I..." Katrina suddenly remembered the black plastic bag Alexander had delivered just days prior. She had carelessly tossed it into the overflowing trash bin, commanding Josie to dispose of it.


A flicker of panic flashed through Katrina's eyes, a detail Daniela didn't miss.



"Where is it now?" Daniela demanded, her expression stern and unyielding.


Peyton grabbed Katrina by the arm and pressed,her voice laced with frustration. "Where the hell is it?"


Unfamiliar with the upper floors, Peyton was oblivious to the fact that Daniela had been relegated to such a modest room.



In the grandeur of such a vast villa, it was astonishing that Daniela resided in a mere storage room.



Katrina exchanged a helpless glance with Caiden, her eyes begging for assistance.


Caiden asked, "Where is it?"


Katrina's response was hesitant, her words tumbling out awkwardly. "That day, Alexander brought it here,encased in a worn-out garbage bag. When I felt it, it was stiff, like thick cardboard. So I tossed it into the  cash can."



Turning abruptly towards Josie, Katrina rebuked her sharply. "Josie! How could you let this happen? I threw out something important, and you didn't even care to check? What's wrong with you?"



Josie was caught off-guard.



Katrina whirled to face Caiden, her unease palpable."Alexander's at fault too. How could he be so careless with something that mattered so much? At the very least, he could have packaged it properly. And really,what interest does a CEO like Alexander have in Daniela's sketchbook? If he hadn't taken it in the first place, I wouldn't have dismissed it as trash so thoughtlessly."


Daniela stood nearby, her fists balled in silent fury,her gaze fixated on Katrina. She glanced towards the door,noticing the lock that had long been weak, and her eyes darkened with a deep, unsettling shadow.


Worried about facing Peyton's reprimand, Katrina hastily grabbed her phone and called Alexander.


"Alexander, was the black garbage bag you brought over last time the one with Daniela's sketchbook in it?"



Alexander, interrupted during a meeting, took a moment to confirm. "Yes, that was it."
"Why on earth didn't you specify? I assumed you had brought actual garbage, so I threw it out. Now Daniela has returned and is looking for it. Can't you tell how this mess is making me look bad?"



Seated in the conference room,Alexander hesitated before instructing Katrina, "Please pass the phone to Daniela."
###Chapter 101 Something's Off With Caiden
Katrina passed the phone to Daniela, and she accepted it.


"Daniela, I admit it's my mistake," Alexander explained,his tone casual and distant, as if the issue didn't matter much to him. "That sketchbook was worn out,and frankly, it wasn't worth much. I'l have a better one sent to you soon."



After a brief pause, he spoke again, clearly thinking the matter was settled. "A few days ago, my dad mentioned he visited you. He suggested I invite you for a meal. When would be a good time? Let's call it my way of saying sorry. How does that sound?"



A heavy silence filled the room. Everyone's gaze was fixed on Daniela.



The coldness in her posture, the way her hand tightened at her side-it was clear she was fuming,a storm of emotions brewing under her still exterior,though she remained silent.



Caiden bit his lip, stepping closer to console her."Daniela, I understand how important that sketchbook was to you.I..." "Fine." Daniela's unexpected reply interrupted him,her voice steady but surprising. She gave a slight smile and spoke into the phone. "Let's meet at Elite Lux."



She ended the calI without another word.



Katrina,watching her closely, scoffed loudly."Oh,so now you're playing hard to get, huh? All that nonsense about how precious that sketchbook was to you-what a joke. The truth is, you were just looking for any excuse to get close to Alexander again, weren't you?Don't try to fool anyone, Daniela. You're still the same pathetic girl, desperate to follow Alexander around like some eager little puppy, hoping for his attention."



Katrina's words were laced with venom. "If this was your plan all along, why bother with all the drama?Daniela,you disgust me."



Daniela casually threw the phone into Katrina's arms,her gaze unblinking. She leaned in closer, her voice low enough for only the two of them to hear. "You're right about one thing. I came here just to disgust you After the meal with Alexander, do you honestly think your plan to marry Joyce into the Bennett family is still going to succeed?"



Katrina's expression darkened.



Daniela let out a soft, unsettling laugh, the kind that didn't resemble the sweet girl everyone was familiar with.



"Katrina, I couldn't care less about what you've done before. But this time, you've gone too far. Don't worry,I won't deal with you. I'll let you stay alive long enough to watch what happens to Joyce."



With that, Daniela turned and walked away,leaving Katrina standing there in stunned silence. Her hands clenched intofists, and her voice trembled with fury as she shouted after her, "How dare you! Daniela,how dare you!"



Her words echoed in the stillness, but Daniela didn't so much as spare a glance. Without hesitation, she slid into her exclusive, limited-edition car and sped off.



As Peyton descended the stairs, her gaze wandered toward Joyce's room.



The room was a perfect blend of princess-like elegance,filled with sunlight. It was spacious and airy,with floor-to-ceiling windows that opened up to a verdant greenbelt. Fresh air streamed in, rejuvenating anyone who entered.



Peyton snapped her head towards Caiden, shooting him a cold look. "Caiden, you really went all out raising someone else's daughter!"



Ronald and Wyatt, on the other hand,were only concerned with one thing. "Mom, do you think Daniela will keep her word? When do you think she'll make it happen?"



After all, it was about a future of endless wealth and luxury.



Peyton's wrinkled face twisted into a displeased frown."Didn't you notice the way she was acting today? She was in a terrible mood. Just give her some time.I'll take some fruit and visit her at work. Did you see? She didn't even argue with a single thing I said earlier.Trust me, she's wealthy now, and you're her uncles. Do you really think she'd hold back from helping you?”



Ronald and Wyatt visibly relaxed, their tense expressions softening with relief.



But Katrina wasn't as easily comforted.



She turned to Caiden, her voice edged with concern."Caiden, what do you think Daniela meant by what she said? Is she trying to destroy Alexander and Joyce's relationship? She is, isn't she?"



Caiden remained composed, his tone steady. "You're reading too much into it. Daniela isn't like that."



"Not like that? She said it herself! She told me exactly what she was planning. And the way she looked at me -her eyes were cold, full of calculation,ruthless!Daniela is Brylee's daughter! She's got that same blood running through her veins. With a mother like  Brylee, how could Daniela possibly be anything but trouble?"



Katrina's anxiety grew stronger as she continued,"You have to understand, Caiden. Daniela really said it. She promised she wouldn't touch me, but then she made it clear she wants me to witness Joyce's destruction firsthand. She's planning to ruin our daughter!"



"That's impossible. Daniela is my daughter too. She wouldn't harm Joyce," Caiden responded flatly.



Katrina collapsed into tears. She cursed Peyton,Caiden, and Daniela even more fiercely.



Annoyed, Caiden snatched his phone and retreated to the guest room.



Katrina went to the balcony with a cigarette dangling between her fingers. "Mom, I'm telling you, there's something really off about Caiden lately. He's not acting like himself at all."
###Chapter 102 Was This Really Daniela

In the past, no matter what Katrina asked of him,Caiden would always obey without question.



He never dared to oppose her, always going along with her wishes.



He showered her with affection, treating her as if she were precious beyond measure.



She had free rein over the finances, spending as she pleased, and he never once raised an objection. His attitude towards Daniela had always been one of contempt.



Today,however,when Caiden saw Daniela, there was no trace of his usual irritation, but rather a subtle,restrained joy.



That wasn't like him at all. Something definitely wasn't right.



Katrina's mother replied, "Caiden's always been like this for years.Why are you acting so surprised? You're just being too impatient. Besides, you've had the upper hand with Daniela for so long. How could she suddenly flip the script? Don't worry. You still hold the power over him."



Katrina hung up the phone. Her eyes lingered on the city lights outside as she murmured to herself, "Looks like Daniela won't be as easy to handle from now on."







As the secretary arrived at the construction site,Cedric was deep in conversation on the phone.



Not wanting to interrupt, the secretary quietly moved past him. As he did, Claude Vazquez scrunched his nose in distaste. "Benny, what's that awful smell on you?"



Benny Salazar let out a laugh. "The company bought a landfill to turn into a cemetery. I was just there."



Claude gestured towards the object in Benny's hand."Do you paint?"



Benny looked down at the sketchbook in his hand, a slight frown forming. "This? How did I end up with this?; I found it in the trash. It was so hot; I just used it to cool myself off."



As he spoke, he made a move to toss it away, but when he saw Cedric finishing his call nearby, he quickly grabbed some documents from his bag and s shoved the sketchbook inside.
That night, the whole Olisvine landfill was scoured from top to bottom.


Lillian, her clothes covered in dirt, spoke with frustration. "I couldn't find it."


Daniela's eyes were like ice, filled with a cold fury.She stood motionless in the landfill for what felt like an eternity, not a word escaping her lips.



As the first light of dawn began to break, she let out a heavy sigh,exhaustion weighing her down. "Let's go."


When she returned, she took a long, much-needed shower before collapsing into bed for a deep sleep.


Later,when Alexander came looking for her, he found Daniela standing on the balcony with her attention focused on sketching the sunset.



Today, she wasn't dressed in her usual formal attire,but instead, she wore simple, comfortable home clothes.



The spacious balcony had a slight chill to the air, and Alexander stood silently behind her.



He wasn't one for art, never quite able to grasp its depths, but he sure knew how to appreciate a woman.


Daniela was dressed in a pristine white floral top that  shimmered softly in the fading sunlight. Her long hair,softly curled, rested elegantly over her shoulders,swaying gently with each movement she made.



He muttered something quietly. Daniela, however,remained silent, absorbed in her work.



The warm glow of the sunset bathed her face in a golden light, casting an almost ethereal glow on her features.



Alexander found himself momentarily mesmerized by the scene before him.



It wasn't until Daniela set her brush down that he slowly snapped back to reality. 



"That's a beautiful painting," Alexander remarked,his voice filled with genuine admiration.



Daniela dropped the brush into the tray, then walked to the bathroom to wash her hands. Afterward, she poured herself a glass of water, the quiet moments stretching on.



She took a sip, then finally turned her gaze to him.



He was the man she had loved deeply for so long, the one she had once thought was everything to her.



Now, as she regarded him, there was no longer the adoration or reverence that once filled her eyes.  Instead, she saw him as just another man, ordinary and flawed.



She had lost the urge to explore him.



With a small gesture, she indicated the chair acrosS from her. "Please, take a seat."



Taking a seat, Alexander apologized. "I'm truly sorry about the sketchbook." Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a brand-new sketchbook and extended it towards her. "I hope this can make up for it."



Alexander, assuming that a gift would win her over,believed she would appreciate and cherish it as a token of his apology.



He convinced himself that Daniela's earlier visit to the Harper family, where she had asked about the old sketchbook,was merely an excuse to get closer to him,as Katrina had suggested.



However, as he observed Daniela's expression, the indifference in her eyes pierced him.



All he saw was a cold, distant look, devoid of the warmth he once relied on.



"You don't like it? If it's not to your taste, tell me what kind you prefer, and I'll have someone find it for you." The humility in Alexander's voice was a rare shift,revealing his desire to make amends. Daniela, of course, understood his intentions. A faint smile tugged at her lips, but she didn't even look his way. "It's fine. I don't paint much these days, so it really doesn't matter."



Alexander gave a nod. "I understand. Your company's doing well now, so l imagine time's harder to come by.But once someone steps in to help share the load,things will be much easier." 3



Daniela, without a word, lowered her gaze and continued cutting her steak, her focus entirely on the plate in front of her.



A flicker of frustration crossed Alexander's face.



He wasn't accustomed to being shut out by Daniela.Just as he opened his mouth to speak again, Daniela had already set down her knife and fork. "I'm done.Are you?"



Alexander looked down at his untouched steak and,standing up, replied, "I'm not hungry."



Daniela nodded, her voice soft but firm. "I'm tired. I won't be seeing you out."



She then walked to the living room, silently organizing the sketches on the balcony, her face unreadable,her eyes entirely distant from him. Alexander had no choice but to follow the silent cue and leave.



Just as the door was about to click shut, a soft sound of footsteps caught his attention. He spun around,his curiosity piqued.



To his surprise, it was Daniela, who had just been in the living room moments earlier. She walked to the dining table, picked up the sketchbook he had just handed her, and without a second thought, tossed it into the trash can.



For a moment, Alexander stood frozen, staring at her in disbelief. Daniela met his gaze briefly, her eyes cool and distant.



Under the harsh light, her eyes seemed bright yet completely indifferent, her aloofness sharp. She glanced at him for a fleeting second before turning away slowly



He stood there, watching her retreat upstairs, her movements deliberate and final.



The door closed behind her, and Alexander remained,standing in place, lost in thought.



He couldn't understand it. But in that moment, an unsettling sense of cold dread  washed over him.



Was this really Daniela?
###Chapter 103 | Suspect Daniela Doesn't Like Me...
Alexander stepped out of Daniela's residence to find Richard waiting expectantly by the car.



Richard had taken it upon himself to drive Alexander today,his motives clear.



Given Daniela's soaring influence, Richard was desperate to win her good graces.



The thought of anyone else gaining her favor was unbearable to him.



"How did things go?" Richard pressed, flashing a sly grin. "Was it a candlelit dinner or a lavish meal? Did Daniela invite you to stay overnight? Remember my advice, Alexander. Don't be too quick to please her.You need to keep her intrigued. First, secure the lucrative North District project, then aim for the company shares, and finally, make her desperate to marry you. Then, she won't be able to leave you anymore. And Elite Lux will be firmly in your hands.You're playing your cards right; you really are my son!"Richard's voice swelled with pride. 



"Dad, I didn't have dinner," Alexander interjected, his tone flat. 
Richard's smile vanished, replaced by a look of utter disbelief. "What did you just say?"



Holding Richard's bewildered gaze, Alexander replied,"I didn't eat a thing. She had her meal alone and then told me to leave."



Richard, flustered, waved his hand in dismissal."That can't be right! Daniela would starve herself before neglecting you like that. Have you done something to upset her?"



Alexander shook his head with a slow, deliberate motion. He recalled how Daniela had disdainfully tossed his sketchbook into the trash can. Her expression was cold, calculating, distant, and eerie. 



"I suspect Daniela doesn't like me anymore,"Alexander murmured, releasing a weary sigh.



Richard, however, remained unconvinced. "How can you say that? Why did she invite you to dinner if she didn't even like you? If she truly didn't give a damn,she wouldn't even take your calls. And let's face it,you wouldn't have lingered up there if she didn't show some interest.Sometimes,you need to coax a woman." He pointed to the grand sign adorning the building and continued, "With all this wealth at stake, even if Daniela doesn't harbor feelings for you now, you must sway her to marry you. Don't worry. I know charming  women isn't your strong suit, so I've assembled some tools to help you win her heart!"



With that, he took Alexander back to the company.



The moment they emerged from the car, Alexander's eyes widened at the sight of a dozen employees lined up at the entrance.



They chimed together in a well-rehearsed chorus."Good evening!"



Once inside, Richard ushered Alexander towards the CEO's office.



With a gentle push, he swung open the door to an office adorned with an array of photos featuring Daniela.



Across from the desk, a large blackboard dominated the room, covered in extensive analyses of Daniela's preferences, personality, and the traits she found appealing in a partner.


"I've brought in a relationship strategist specifically for your pursuit. They've dissected every facet of Daniela's life to maximize your chances of captivating her heart." 2



As Richard elaborated on the strategy, his phone buzzed-Katrina was calling. He excused himself with a reassuring pat on Alexander's shoulder, whispering, "The Bennett family's future rests on your shoulders now."



With those parting words, he stepped into the corridor.



"Katrina, Alexander is currently committed to his professional responsibilities and is not considering any romantic entanglements. You'll need to look elsewhere for a father for your daughter's child,"Richard stated flatly.



Katrina's eyes widened in disbelief as she demanded,"What do you mean by that? I thought we had an agreement. Why this sudden change? Richard, are you worried that Caiden might exclude Joyce from his will?You're overthinking this, really. Joyce is the sole heiress of the Harper family.Who else is there but her?Yes, she slipped up, got pregnant out of wedlock,but I assure you, she's severed all ties with that man! If you have any further conditions, let's dscuss them openly."



Richard held his phone at arm's length, his expression one of scorn. "While Joyce is your treasure,Alexander remains my pride. He will not shoulder the burden of raising another's child. Should this scandal come to light, the blame would fall squarely on my shoulders,as if I traded my son's future for your fortune. No wealth is worth that compromise." Katrina,frantic,attempted to salvage the conversation."But no one need ever learn of Joyce's child..."



However, her words were cut short by the harsh beep of the call ending.



A storm of fury surged through Katrina, overtaking her completely.



Staring down the phone, her face twisted in rage, she spat, "Daniela, you fucking bitch! You've ruined my plans, and I'll make damn sure you regret it!"



Daniela had never imagined that her offhand remarks would cause the Bennett family to reconsider their relationship with Katrina.



At breakfast, Katrina had come to cause a scene.



Daniela was seated in the dining room, observing Katrina,who looked wild and frantic, her hair a mess.



Ronald, Wyatt, and a few others restrained Katrina.



Then, Peyton, unable to contain her frustration any longer,slapped Katrina hard, sending her crumpling to the ground in a flood of tears.



"Are you all ganging up on me now? Caiden! You have to intervene! Will you just stand there and let me be tormented?" Katrina cried out. From her position on the floor, she pointed accusingly at Daniela through the floor-to-ceiling window."And look at your ex-wife's daughter, taking pleasure in my distress! Can you see this? Whose side are you on,Caiden?"
###Chapter 104 | Don't Settle For Cast-Offs
Daniela was anticipating Caiden's eruption into the fray.



Yet, Caiden cast a brief glance at Daniela, who was observing the commotion with her chin resting on her hand, and addressed Katrina with unexpected composure. "What the hell is wrong with you? Get off the ground and stop embarrassing yourself like a goddamn idiot!"



Daniela, her expression icy and detached, overheard every word clearly.



Off to the side, Lillian leaned towards Ryan and murmured, "Caiden's behavioris peculiar today, isn'tit?"



Peering towards Daniela, Ryan nodded and whispered back, "Ever since that sketchbook disappeared,Daniela has been in a foul temper. She doesn't give a damn about anyone else."



Realization dawned on Katrina that her theatrics were futile.Daniela was merely a spectator to her disgrace,entirely uninvolved and unresponsive. Leaving now would just make her a loser walking away with empty hands.She picked herself up, yanked Caiden aside, and wpedher tears away forcefully, "Caiden! Cut the crap andtell me what the hell is your problem? Daniela ruinedmy daughter's marriage, it's her or me today! Youneed to confront her and demand justice for us!"
Without a word, Caiden remained still, giving nothingаwаy
Katrina's voice escalated, tears streaming anew, "Fine!If you won't defend me, we might as well divorce!We'll split everything, Half for you, half for me. Wththat, the Bennett family will certainly welcome mydaughter with open arms!"
Caiden froze for a moment, stunned that Katrine hedthe nerve to stake a claim on half his wealth,
His eyes widened in surprise, and as he gaped at herKatrina's voice softened a touch, "Don't give me tha!look, and let's not revisit how the Harper family'sfortune was eamed by Bree, I'm your wife nowCaiden, What belongs to you also belongs to me. l'mnot picking a fight, but Daniela's gone too far!"
Joyce's belly was visibly growing day by day
If Alexander wouldn't mary her, was her fate to bewth a man once maried?
The mere idea sent a shiver down her spine, Observing the resolve in Katrina's expression, Caiden conceded,"Fine."



Katrina exhaled a quiet breath of relief, reassured by her belief that Caiden wouldn't leave her-not when no one else could match her unwavering support for him.



She leaned in slightly, her tone laced with reassurance."Honey, don't worry. I won't cause a scene. I'll simply ask her about it, and if Daniela isn't involved, I'll apologize."



Caiden barely looked up, his voice devoid of emotion."Sure."



With that, Katrina turned on her heel and marched back to the building, her steps echoing with resolve and a touch of defiance.



"Daniela! Come out! We need to talk!"



Daniela emerged, her presence icy. "What is it?"



Katrina's eyes blazed with fury as she snapped,"Was it you who wrecked Alexander and Joyce's marriage?"



Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she pressed on."Tell me,did you?"



As she spoke, Katrina raised her hand in a threatening  gesture, but before it could strike, Daniela looked up sharply, her intense eyes locking with Katrina's in a silent challenge.



Katrina's heart fluttered unexpectedly, causing her raised hand to pause mid-air before retreating to her side.



"What bullshit are you even saying?" Daniela's lips twisted into a subtle smile, her eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and challenge as she faced Katrina."Give me a break. You're throwing out accusations like a fool. Show me some proof or get lost."


"What proof is necessary when it's clear as day it was you? Why else would the Bennett family go back on their word? They were committed to the wedding just after New Year's! Is this your way of getting back at us?"



Daniela nodded, her expression thoughtful yet mocking. "Interesting theory. So, tell me, what am l supposedly avenging? What kind of shit do you think I care enough about to get revenge for?"



"You..." Katrina faltered, her eyes darting nervously."You were once married to Alexander, and Joyce has already apologized for that incident at the fire. What more do you want from her? Daniela,let bygones be bygones!"



Daniela's smile turned frosty, her tone dripping with  sarcasm. "Let bygones be bygones? So, you beg for mercy when you screw up, but when it's someone else's tum, you never let them live it down. Real classy of you, Katrina. And let me make one thing clear-if you're so desperate, feel free to scoop up the trash l toss out, but leave my name out of your pathetic games. I don't deal with leftovers. Oh, and one more thing. Your family really does have a thing for scraps,don't they? Just because Joyce is desperate enough to hang on to Alexander doesn't mean I give a damn.Do me a favor and keep your filthy drama to yourself -I can't stomach that disgusting crap."



Joyce felt those words like a punch to the gut,knocking the air right out of her.


The insult didn't just wound Joyce; it deeply affected Katrina and Caiden as well.



Everyone present was taken aback.



This was a side of Daniela they had never witnessed before.



Daniela, esteemed for her principled conduct and seldom seen engaging in disputes, had always appeared aloof, often ignoring petty squabbles and dismissive of the gossip swirled around her.


Yet, no one had ever seen her display such vehement anger. Without a moment's pause, Daniela whipped out her phone and dialed Alexander's number, right there in front of the entire Harper family and an increasingly curious circle of bystanders. She then activated the speakerphone.



Since their divorce, Daniela had never once reached out to Alexander first.



The sudden call took him by surprise, and his voice,tinged with unexpected warmth, didn't go unnoticed by Katrina, who watched with a frosty glare.



"Hello,Daniela."
###Chapter 105 You Caused This
Daniela's voice sliced through the air like a shard of ice, chilling Ryan and Lillian to their core. It was as if she harbored a murderous intent.



"Alexander, I have you on speakerphone. The Harpers are present. I need a direct answer. Have you been engaged to Joyce or not?"



"Absolutely not. I assure you, I have never been engaged to Joyce."



Daniela turned her piercing gaze to Katrina, whose face had bloomed a fiery red. She told Alexander,"Your family made this mess, so clean it up yourselves!If you told Joyce you'd marry her, then stop pestering me."



Alexander's voice, tinged with panic, cut through the tension. "I promise you, there's no truth to that! Have they been causing you trouble? I'll have my father sort this out immediately."  



After that, Daniela ended the call.



A mere ten minutes later, Richard arrived, his anxiety palpable. He approached Katrina, his voice laden with worry. "What's the commotion about? We're all reasonable folks here: why stir up such a scene?"



Richard, adept at gauging the mood, sensed Daniela's seething anger. Misinterpreting it as indignation over a rumored engagement between Alexander and Joyce,a smug satisfaction flickered across his face.



Seizing what he believed to be a chance at redemption, Richard donned a sincere smile and turned to Daniela. "Daniela, I admit, I mishandled things. I'll make sure Alexander apologizes to you personally.Just leave everything to me, okay?"



Next, he faced Katrina, his voice now laced with contempt. "Katrina, what you're doing is utterly unacceptable. Stop spreading your lies. Everyone here is well aware of Alexander's integrity. He truly is the finest young man anyone could know. However, his goodness doesn't give you the right to push your wayward daughter at him."



Katrina wanted to say something, but Richard continued, "Remember this-Alexander always wants Daniela. His loyalty to her has been unwavering. As for Joyce, with her dubious reputation and now expecting a child, she's clearly not a suitable match for him. It was Joyce who disrupted Alexander and Daniela's wedding once before. And now, just as they are finding their way back to each other, here you are causing chaos again! Katrina, the fact that Daniela isn't  your biological daughter doesn't give you the right to treat her like garbage. Remember, it was Brylee who took you in. After that,you fucked your way to power by crawling into her husband's bed. You're a walking disgrace. If you're hell-bent on this path, don't cry when Joyce ends up just as ruined as you. Is that what you're aiming for?"



Richard was a master at manipulating words, skillfully unveiling Joyce's secrets in a few deft sentences while portraying himself as the paragon of virtue.



His maneuvers were carefully orchestrated to capture Daniela's favor.



He cast a smug look towards Daniela, expecting approval. Yet, her expression remained icy and detached.



Katrina was left reeling, feeling the weight of judgmental glances and whispered conjectures around her.



The only response she could summon was a fiery glare directed at Daniela. "Daniela! Just you wait! This isn't over!"



Humiliated and cornered, Katrina was briskly escorted away by the Harper family, her departure marked by a trail of disgrace.



Caiden made a futile attempt to converse with Daniela,  who turned her back and disappeared into the building,leaving him amidst the unsettled crowd.



Richard dashed after her, his face stretched into a perennially ingratiating grin. "Daniela, next time something like this happens, don't hesitate to reach out to me. As for individuals such as Katrina, extending excessive politeness only serves as an invitation for exploitation."



Daniela entered the elevator, her gaze sharp and frosty as she faced Richard. "Shouldn't you be the one handling this mess? What, are you expecting gratitude from me now? If I'd known the circus of bullshit you'd bring into my life, I would've stayed the hell away from Alexander. Don't even think about showing your faces again."



With a resolute press of a button, Lillian initiated the elevator doors to close.



Richard made a brief attempt to wedge himself into the elevator to offer an explanation, but the doors clamped shut before he managed,leaving him outside.A security guard promptly intervened, escorting him away from the scene.



Visibly irked, Richard stomped his foot and dialed Alexander's number. "You need to resolve this immediately! Damn it, Daniela's pissed off! That bitch Katrina is trying to screw me over completely. If she  szibves Daniela away, I'll hunt her down and make her teansh she never crossed me!"
###Chapter 106 Begging For Help

That day, the scandal that Joyce was pregnant with another man's child and still pestered Alexander erupted across social media.



The very crowd that once lauded them while disparaging Daniela was now furiously posting online.


"Getting knocked up and then bugging her stepsister's ex-husband? That's some next-level desperation!"



"Richard said it himself-Joyce's mom schemed her way into the Harper family by spreading her legs for Caiden.Guess neither of them has a shred of decency."



"Poor Daniela. Honestly, I've always seen her as someone decent. But losing her mom so young and living under Katrina's rule must've been brutal."



The online frenzy was growing more intense by the minute.



Joyce was sprawled on the couch, weeping so intensely that she struggled for breath.



Peyton remarked nonchalantly, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Caiden, we're caught in your  storm. Haven't you noticed? Daniela won't even spare us a glance. I'm warning you, Caiden. If she bears a grudge, it'll be on you to salvage any favors she might extend to Ronald and Wyatt."



Katrina's tears stopped suddenly, her expression hardening in an instant.



Just as she opened her mouth to object, Caiden cut in."Alright, I'll handle it. Just leave Daniela out of this."


No sooner had he spoken than Ronald and Wyatt began to tally up their demands with their fingers."Caiden, since you're stepping up to take responsibility, we're not asking for much-just cars,houses,and a tidy sum of money."



Ronald and Wyatt exchanged knowing looks and declared in unison, "Eighty million each."



"Eighty million? Are you out of your mind?" Katrina jumped up, her voice dripping with disdain. "Just go rob a bank if you're that desperate!"



Ronald and Wyatt frowned. "Why the hell are you so worked up, Katrina? This isn't about you. We're talking to Caiden,not you."



"These are joint marital assets!" Katrina argued, her voice firm. After years of dedicated service to Caiden,all she desired was a fair share of the wealth."Don't even dream of getting a penny from me unless I fucking allow it!"



Ronald glared at her, jabbing a finger in her direction."What bullshit are you even talking about? Joint marital assets? Do you even have any claim to this money? This is the legacy our former sister-in-law left behind. You have no part in this!"



Katrina stormed into the kitchen, snatched up a knife,and bellowed, "Anyone who dares touch my family's fortune will answer to me. I'll make damn sure you regret it!"



Her shitty past, riddled with hunger and hardship,crept back in, making Katrina tremble. Giving away eighty million to those leeches felt like signing her own death warrant.



Unperturbed by the prospect of death yet terrified of destitution, Ronald advanced, his face defiant, and taunted her. "Go on, do it if you've got the guts!You're nothing but a bitch, Katrina. If you can't bring yourself to do it today, that money is as good as mine!What's the matter? Are you scared? Let me tell you something-within these walls of the Harper estate,you're not the one in charge..."



He was cut off mid-sentence as a sinister gleam flashed before his eyes.



"Ah!" Ronald's scream ripped through the air as a knife plunged.



Blood spattered everywhere.



Then came the piercing scream of Peyton. "You fucking bitch! How dare you assault my son! I swear,I'll fight you to my last breath!"


Soon after,the wail of an ambulance filled the estate,rushing three members of the Harper family to emergency care.


Ronald, the knife still embedded in his cheek, was in the gravest condition, his screams barely audible above the chaos.



Katrina paused at the doorway, her hand tightly clutching the knife, while a piercing cold wind moaned through the night. ①


Beside her, Joyce shuffled forward, her legs barely supporting her trembling frame. Her voice broke through her tears as she murmured, "Mom, you attacked Grandma and both uncles. Are you going to be arrested?"



The knife slipped from Katrina's grasp, clattering against the floor.



She slumped against a stone pillar, her gaze burning with fierce resolve. "No, your father will protect his image at all costs. If word of this spreads, Harper  Group's shares will nosedive. They'll have to keep quiet."



She was determined to prove that she was not a woman to be underestimated.



Meanwhile, in the hospital, Caiden was overwhelmed by despair. Ronald had sustained the gravest wounds;Wyatt was writhing from a back injury, and Peyton,having fallen, had broken her arm.



Their cries of agony echoed through the sterile corridors, each one stabbing at Caiden's conscience.


Haunted by the lifeless look in Katrina's eyes as she brandished the knife, he knew her intent had been lethal. She had truly been prepared to kill.


Ronald's knife was lodged deep in his cheekbone,necessitating its removal, yet no specialist in the area was available in the city.



The doctor suggested, "Mr. Harper, maybe your daughter could help. She's quite worldly and might know someone who could assist."



Daniela, who not only operated a successful design firm but also ventured into the medical field, was well -equipped. Much of the hospital's cutting-edge equipment came from her company.



Her connections and resources dwarfed their own. Caiden, clutching a phone borrowed from the doctor,stepped aside and implored in a hushed, desperate tone, "Please, as a personal favor to me, could you come to the hospital? This is a life-or-death situation.Even if you don't consider us family anymnore,perhaps you could help us as mere strangers in dire need?"



Tears streamed down his face as he spoke.



When Brylee was there, she fortified his world,giving him the freedom to live a blissful life, playing with his pets without a second thought. 3


Following Brylee's passing, he stepped back from the company,thriving on the monumental empire she left behind, enough to carry him through forever.



His days were filled with bliss, enchanted by Katrina's captivating presence.


But now, confronted with this dire crisis, he was begging Daniela for help.
###Chapter 107 The Family He Cherished
 "Daniela, I'm begging you, get here as fast as you can!Things could take a very dark turn if you don't!"Caiden's desperate plea crackled through the phone line.



The attending doctor had rarely encountered such raw vulnerability-a father who seemed shattered, unsure of where to turn.



Once the call ended, Caiden dabbed at his eyes,briefly masking his sorrow before facing the doctor."My daughter will be here shortly."



He then dialed his home number again, seeking some comfort or update.



Silence greeted him-no response.



Annoyed and anxious, he switched tactics and called Joyce.Over the years,he had indulged her every whim,sparing no expense for her happiness.



Now, amidst the turmoil, he expected her to rise to the occasion.



After all, it was Katrina who had entangled themin this  disaster.



Moreover,he needed Joyce to bring a substantial sum of money. In his haste to reach the hospital, he had managed only to bring five hundred dollars.


The phone rang several times before Joyce picked up.


"Joyce, I'm at the hospital. We need fifty thousand dollars. Ronald requires surgery, and Wyatt and Mom need to be hospitalized immediately."



On the other end, Joyce sighed dramatically,her tone laced with exasperation. "Dad, Mom has the safe key,so I can't access the money. I'm not going to that hospital. It's full of sickness and bacteria, and as someone who's pregnant, I'd think my health would be a priority!"


A fresh wave of helplessness swept over Caiden.



After a brief pause, Joyce went on, "Dad, you really should come home too. Mom's incredibly upset.There's little you can help there. It's probably best to employ a nurse-they'll mnanage everything far more effectively than you. Plus, Mom blames the entire ordeal on them, insisting it's none of our concern." Initially, Joyce had felt a twinge of anxiety when the chaos erupted.



However, as the minutes passed without any police involvement, her womy dissipated, giving way toindifference
Caiden felt a deep ache in his chest as he absorbedher dismissive tone
Over the years, he had lavished Joyce with affectionand gifts, often at the expense of Daniela, whoreceived scant attention from him.
Now, in his time of need, Daniela rushed to his aidafter just a simple call Joyce, conversely, offerednothing but weak justifications.
Stop talking like that, Joyce," Caiden retorted sharplyThey're still family, and tuming our backs on them iscruel. Or do you enjoy watching them struggle fortheir lives?"
Sprawled on the couch, an apple in hand. Joyce rolledher eyes and huffed, "That's their dilemma. not mine.If it's help you need, go to Daniela. She's always readyto play the martyr."
Caiden's fingers dug into his phone, his face growingalarmingly pale, as if all the blood had vanished.
Before he could utter another word, Joyce ended thecall abruptly.
A profound sorrow enveloped him This was the family he had cherished for over a decade.



Left with no alternatives, Caiden hastily summoned a taxi to take him home.



Upon his arrival, finding Katrina absent, he reluctantly turned to Joyce to request financial help.


With a touch of reluctance in her voice, Joyce stated,"Fine,but consider this a loan. You're going to have to repay me-with interest. Family or not, money is money."



She then proceeded to transfer ten thousand dollars to him.



As he confirmed the transaction, Caiden inadvertently saw the balance in her account-a startling number of zeros trailing behind.



He had been providing Katrina and Joyce a lavish monthly allowance, which accumulated to over a million dollars a year.



Yet now, at his timne of need, one had vanished, and the other grudgingly handed over merely a fraction of her wealth.



Caiden felt a profound sense of poverty wash over him. On his somber journey back to the hospital, he mused bitterly that depending on Joyce had been a futile hope all along.



Upon his arrival, he found Daniela already waiting.


As the hospital staff delineated the steep expenses involved, Caiden, who had previously never been troubled by financial concerns, shut his eyes in bitter disappointment.



Peyton, overwhelmed by the sum mentioned,dissolved into tears. "We can't pay for the treatment.Just let me go already."



Seeing the distress filling the room, Daniela stepped outside to the doctor and inquired, "Can you tell me exactly what the situation is?"



After piecing everything together, she made a brief phone call. Returning to Caiden, she announced, "A top-notch surgeon will oversee the surgery. He's reviewed the scans and sees no significant concerns.He arrives tonight, will rest tomorrow morning,and is scheduled for the procedure in the afternoon."



Ronald's shoulders dropped as he exhaled deeply, a visible weight lifted by the news.



"Wyatt and Peyton don't have any major problems-they just require proper care," Daniela stated, her voice unwavering. "Unless there's anything else, I'll take my leave now."



As she strode towards the exit, Caiden tagged along behind her, his steps uncertain. "Thank you."



Pausing by her car, Daniela faced him with a stern expression. "The financials are your responsibility.They never showed me consideration, so why should I bear the cost? You'll manage, I'm certain. Besides,this hospital belongs to a friend of mine. I've already discussed it with them. You have five days to arrange the payment."



With those final words, she slid into her car and drove away.



The clock struck 1 a.m., and a gentle rain began to patter against the pavement.


Outside the hospital, Caiden stood rooted to the spot,overwhelmed by a sudden surge of regret. His hands flew to his face as tears escaped, mourning the years lost and the estrangement that had grown between them.



How had it come to this?



How had he allowed the little girl who once called him "Daddy" to become so estranged?



Inside the hospital room, Peyton's eyes burned with  anger as he confronted Caiden. "You're the reason Daniela's done with us! She doesn't give a damn about this family anymore, and it's all thanks to you!"
###Chapter 108 The Empty Safe








Ronald reclined on the bed, his face swollen and contorted in agony.



Wyatt,observing the grim scene, turned to Caiden and spoke with evident frustration. "Did you witness the day's events? Daniela, your own flesh and blood, came despite not wanting to deal with your shit.Yet,one word from you, and she was here. She respects us as family. But Joyce? That ungrateful brat isn't even ours and couldn't give a shit about us. And Katrina? What's there to say? She swung a goddamn knife at us! Who the hell does that? We never imagined she'd actually go through with it, but she did. Look at Ronald and me -sure, we're just your brothers. But think about our mother.Even if she were a stranger, an elderly woman on the street, one simply does not strike someone of her age. That's just common decency!"



He exhaled heavily and continued, "We always thought your ex-wife was too assertive, too formidable. Had she been here, this chaos wouldn't have unfolded like this. And the family finances? Are they even under your control anymore? As the CEO of a publicly traded company, why are we scraping together funds for hospital bills? Do you really think Daniela isn't crushed by all of this? Let's face it-your comfortable life today is built on the foundation of your late wife's diligence. Instead of safeguarding Daniela's future, you're being swayed by another woman's machinations. If I were Daniela, I wouldn't recognize you as my father either."



Peyton then fixed Caiden with a cold, piercing stare."What are your plans to address this? We'll refrain from involving the police for your sake, but we cannot ignore this. If you're planning to let this shit slide, don't you dare call me Mom ever again!"



Peyton had never addressed Caiden in such a harsh tone, and her biting words struck him like a punch to the gut.



Silently, Caiden exited the room and made his way to the hallway, where he succumbed to his emotions,weeping uncontrollably.



The following day was marked by Ronald's surgery.Anxious, Caiden attempted to reach out to Daniela,only to be informed by her secretary that she was tied up in a meeting.



By the time Daniela got back to him, the operation had concluded.



With his voice quivering from relief, Caiden expressed his gratitude. "Daniela, I can't thank you enough! The  surgeon you recommended was exceptional. It all went perfectly! No need to worry about a thing!"



Daniela offered a brief, indifferent "Hmm" before disconnecting.



A bitter taste replaced Caiden's fleeting smnile,as he acknowledged his own role in the unfolding events.



Attempting to spread the positive news,he called home, only to be met with Joyce's harsh, resentful tone. "Oh, the surgery was successful? That's unfortunate. They deserved to fucking rot for what they put Mom through!"



With a chilly edge, Joyce reminded him before hanging up. "And remember, Dad-you still owe me money. I expect it back soon."



Caiden shut his eyes, a single tear trailing down his cheek in silence.



From the corner of the room, Peyton observed him and let out a scornful chuckle.



Throughout the hospital stay of Peyton, Ronald, and Wyatt,neither Katrina nor Joyce paid a visit.



Caiden found himself borrowing money from friends to manage the overwhelming hospital bills.



He no longer sought Daniela's assistance, burdened by a deep sense of shame.



To minimize discord, he arranged for their relocation to a modest apartment in a different neighborhood.



Once they were settled, he ventured back to the villa to collect some personal items.


As Caiden neared the front door, the sound of laughter echoed from within.



The blend of joyful voices with the scent of a meal being prepared struck him harshly-it seemed like a bitter mockery after enduring countless days filled with fatigue, sleepless nights, and the stress of caregiving.



His appearance was disheveled, his beard unkempt from days without proper care. When he entered,Joyce looked at him with a grimace, her expression piercing his already tender spirit.



"What the hell, Dad? You smell so bad I'm about to gag! Did you roll around in a dumpster or what?" she exclaimed.



Caiden's gaze turned to Katrina, who was engrossed in a television show. She didn't bother to look his way;her expression was icy, stripped of the warmth and affection she once radiated towards him.



Without a word,Caiden made his way up the stairs, craving the relief of washing the dirt and weariness from his body.



Refreshed after the shower, he was about to leave the room when he noticed the safe was open. Inside,nothing remained but the stark, empty void of the once-secured container.



Rooted to the spot, Caiden stared into the empty safe
###Chapter 109 Inheritance



With rage boiling over, Caiden charged downstairs, his eyes blazing as he prepared to confront Katrina.



Joyce reclined on the sofa, leisurely biting into a crisp,bright red apple, barely glancing his way. "Dad, you're in the way! Move-I'm watching the best part!"



Without uttering a response, Caiden strode over and turned the television off.



He folded his arms and fixed a piercing stare on her,his tone brooking no defiance."Getupstairs.Rightnow."



Joyce, undeterred by Caiden's authority, knew well that in this household, it was Katrina who held the reins.



Remaining calm and collected, Katrina reassured Joyce. "Head upstairs, sweetheart. Everything's under control."



With a reassuring smile, she watched Joyce ascend the stairs, clutching her doll tightly.



At home, Joyce was doted upon, and recently,her pregnancy was becoming noticeable.


Katrina harbored concerns but kept them to herself. Given the family's wealth, she mused over the possibility of securing a live-in son-in-law. True,Joyce was pregnant,yet it would be her first marriage.Nowadays, with enough money in her pocket,what was there to even stress about?



She decided to let the Bennett family suck up to Daniela all they wanted. That fucking bitch was bound to face her downfall sooner or later.



The vengeful thought curled K<atrina's lips into a wicked,twisted smirk that made Caiden's blood run cold.



He inhaled deeply before confronting her. "Did you take everything from the safe?"



"Yes, I did. What about it?" Katrina's response came with a dismissive shrug, her voice dripping with nonchalance. Relief had washed over her when she'd earlier checked the safe; without that, she wouldn't have unearthed the fact that Brylee had left Daniela a lavish inheritance.



The bounty included a colossal insurance policy and an entire island-a prime tourist hotspot whose value had likely soared.


The terms of the inheritance were strict, stating the island would only legally belong to Daniela after she had been married for a year. Until that milestone, any revenue the island generated was to be strictly held in trust, utterly inaccessible.



Katrina eyed the island with voracious intent.



Securing it for her daughter meant independence from any financial reliance on a partner. She envisioned a future where men would queue up, desperate to cater to Joyce.



"All that shit belongs to Daniela. Even some of the properties-Brylee left them for her, not you. So keep your grubby hands off," Caiden interjected, his voice steady yet assertive.



Without even granting him a glance,Katrina countered,"This house and everything in it belongs to me. Let me make one thing clear-if you dare tell Daniela,I'll divorce you!"



Her tone turned icy, slicing through the air. "You understand the stakes, don't you? Harper Group has been riding on Brylee's coattails for years. Should another scandal erupt, we might as well file for bankruptcy right now!"



Katrina reclined in the sofa, her laughter tinged with derision. "Really, do you believe Brylee would be pleased,knowing you've frittered away everything she painstakingly established? Not leaving even a penny for Daniela? She would despise you. She'd rue the day she fell for a worthless man like you. And Daniela?She'd sever all ties. Isn't that your greatest dread?Being forsaken in your old age, with no one to look after you? Go ahead, keep it up. You'll end up rotting alone with no one to even care when you're gone!"



Her words struck Caiden with surgical precision, each syllable designed to inflict maximum pain. Yet, Katrina was not through.



Her voice took on a syrupy tone, dripping with deceit."However,align yourself with me,follow my lead,and we can keep this family whole. Remember, you are Daniela's biological father. Once she marries, you could travel overseas, apply for her death certificate,and all her assets would naturally revert to you. You'd be set for life, so don't act like you're the one losing out."



Caiden's face registered shock, his features contorting between disbelief and dread. He gaped at Katrina, his voice barely above a whisper. "What the fuck did you just say? Apply for Daniela's death certificae?"



With a wicked grin, Katrina clapped her hands together and chuckled. "Oh, come on! It's just some damn paperwork-it's not like she's really going to drop dead. What's got you trembling? Listen closely,Caiden, I married you seeking a stable life. Maintain that stabilty, and I'll ensure your life remains lavish.Your fortune won't be squandered on my watch." As she spoke, Katrina sent him a coquettish look-a look that once had him utterly ensnared and distractible.



Seeing Katrina's ruthless, greedy nature laid bare,Caiden's stomach churned with disgust. She was the embodiment of everything he despised.



Katrina was already plotting the course of Joyce's life.She envisioned an ideal suitor for Joyce-tall, striking,burdened by neither aging kin nor any familial ties,ideally an orphan, unencumbered and free.



She had pledged a sizable amount of five million dollars for the suitor who satisfied these criteria.



Caiden realized where Katrina's boldness stemmed from-it was the inheritance Brylee had set aside for Daniela.



Yet, something held him back; he couldn't force himself to see Daniela about the matter.



Overwhelmed by shame,he couldn't bear to meet her gaze-not after all the turmoil they had endured.
###Chapter 110 Not A Word To Anyone
Richard had been on edge lately.



He couldn't get his hands on the land in the North District, and Daniela had flat-out refused to meet Alexander.



Moreover, things with Joyce had completely fallen apart,leaving no opportunity for reconciliation.



It seemed as though he was trapped in a losing battle,with no way to turn things around.



He stared at the sketchbook in his hands, his eyes fixed on it. Days had passed, yet he couldn't pinpoint what set it apart from Daniela's.



Meanwhile,Alexander paced restlessly back and forth,his mind visibly preoccupied. His thoughts circled around whether Daniela suspected he was the person from their shared past.



If she did, there was no trace of the warmth she used to show him.



If she didn't, her straightforward nature would have likely prompted her to confront him outright. Her indifferent attitude left him unsure of what she was thinking.



Alexander never thought he'd find himself in a position where he had to guess what was going on in Daniela's mind.



Lost in his musings, Alexander didn't notice Keith stepping in through the doorway.



Keith greeted Richard, but his words went unnoticed.



Taking a seat beside Alexander, Keith leaned in and asked, "Hey, did you hear? Daniela's gone and purchased lands in both the South and East Districts.She'sunstoppable!lsshe building her own empire now?"



Richard's eyes flew open in shock. "What? She's acquired more land?"



"That's right," Keith confirmed, his attention turning to Alexander's phone, where a photo of a note displayed the message, "Let's meet tomorrow."



Something about the handwriting struck him as familiar, so he picked up the phone for a closer look.



Almost immediately, Richard turned to Alexander with urgency. "Alexander, you have to grab this chance!"His voice shook with a mix of excitement and nerves. He hadn't expected Daniela to be so wealthy,let alone imagined another shot at securing the project.



To top it off, the South and East Districts had a larger building area than the North, which meant they promised even bigger profits.



"Alexander, you have to act fast and tell Daniela you want the building rights for those plots. Securing them will skyrocket Bennett Group's financials for the next five years. Don't let Cedric swoop in and snatch them away from you!" Richard's impassioned plea appeared to light a spark in Keith's thoughts.



"Wait,Cedric!" Keith exclaimed with a booming laugh,pointing at Alexander's phone. "That handwriting-it's Cedric's!"



Keith slapped Alexander's thigh enthusiastically."Remember when we visited that celebrity exhibition in the city? There was a whole section about Cedric,showing his rise to fame, and even a childhood notebook where he practiced writing. You pointed out something then-that Cedric had this quirky habit of adding a dot in the bottom right corner of the last letter on every page."



Keith gestured towards the dot in the corner."See?The handwriting matches perfectly, and so does that little dot! It's unmistakable, right?" When Keith looked up, his laughter abruptly faded.Both Richard and Alexander were staring at him with expressions far too serious for the moment.



"What's going on?" Keith asked, his confusion evident as he scratched his head. "Why are you so interested in Cedric's handwriting? What's the big deal?"



The color drained from Richard's face, which had been flushed with excitement just moments ago.



Under the stark glare of the lights, his complexion now resembled a ghostly shade of white.



Keith was just about to crack a joke to ease the tension when Richard suddenly leaned back, collapsing to the floor with a loud thud.



The room instantly descended into chaos. When the paramedics arrived, Alexander didn't hesitate to climb into the ambulance with them.



As the doors shut, he locked eyes with Keith and said in a chillingly firm tone, "This stays between us. Don't say a word to anyone!"
###Chapter 111 Are You Taking Revenge On Me
Richard jolted awake in the hospital bed, his breathing uneven as he clutched Alexander's hand tightly."Alexander, you must not breathe a word about Cedric being that boy. If you do, you can kiss any chance of seeing a penny from Daniela goodbye for the rest of your life."



He glanced at the clock on the wall-it was well past midnight.



Letting out a strained sigh, he continued, "Go home.Put all your energy into winning Daniela over. I'm fine here.All I want is for you to win Daniela back."


Despite Alexander's hesitation, Richard insisted,urging him to leave and focus on the bigger picture.



As he drove aimlessly, Alexander eventually found himself parked at the Elite Lux building.



He stepped out of the car, his gaze instinctively drawn to a specific floor of the towering structure. Without a word, he lit a cigarette, letting the hours slip by as he smoked in silence under the cover of night.



Richard's tireless efforts to win over Daniela were  falling flat, despite all the time, money, and energy he'd poured into the attempt. The lack of progress gnawed at Alexander, leaving him with an uneasy restlessness he couldn't shake.



He remained there until the first light of dawn crept over the city, then finally got back into his car and drove off to check out the plots of land in the South and East Districts.



Richard hadn't been exaggerating-these plots combined were massive, easily over five times the size of the North District. Securing them would come with an astronomical price tag,running into tens of billions.



Alexander couldn't help but admit that Daniela's wealth and influence were nothing short of extraordinary.



As Alexander stared at the vast land before him,his phone suddenly buzzed.



It was his secretary calling. "Mr. Bennett, you're trending online."



Alexander's brow furrowed.′′|Sthis about my father being taken to the hospital yesterday?"



"Actually, no. It's about you standing outside Elite Lux last night. Someone caught it on camera, andit's gone viral this morning. Do you want us to have it removed?" After a brief pause, Alexander replied evenly, "No,leave it. There's no need."


Ending the call, he glanced at his watch. Daniela should be up by now. Had she come across the viral post yet?


Would it stir something in her heart? ①







The first light of morning found Daniela face-to-face with Lillian.



She stood by the door, tablet in hand, peering at Daniela with a curious look.



Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, Daniela greeted her,"Good morning."



"Did you catch the trending topic this morning?"



Daniela stretched out,leisurely taking in the morning air. "No,I haven't."



Between juggling major deals and the recent acquisitions in the South and East Districts, she hadn't had a moment to check her phone.



"You're such a rebel against modern habits! Most people grab their phones the moment they wake up,"Lillian teased.  Daniela chuckled, continuing to stretch her limbs."Anything interesting going on?"



"Yes, there is. The number one trending topic is Alexander standing outside Elite Lux last night,smoking away the entire night!"



Daniela replied nonchalantly, "Is he eyeing the building?We can move out and let him bid for it."



"Daniela! He's interested in you!" Lillian exclaimed,her voice filled with concern.



Even though nearly six months had passed, Lillian couldn't shake her worries about the possibility of Daniela and Alexander reigniting their old flame.



They had shared ten years together.



After all,how many decades did one have in a lifetime?



It was hard for most people to let go of a relationship that had lasted that long, and Lillian wasn't sure if either of them could truly move on.



Daniela gave a relaxed smile, ready to head to the dining room for breakfast, when Lillian suddenly gasped, "Wait, why did they take down the trending topic?"



Lillian looked at Daniela's radiant expression and  mused, "Could someone be interested in you and not like seeing you and Alexander trending? Maybe they had it removed first thing this morning?"



Daniela nibbled on a small piece of bread as her eyes skimmed through her schedule for the day.



Lillian suddenly thought of a certain man from the construction site and felt a pang of sympathy.She had never witnessed such devotion, a person who asked for nothing in return-not even acknowledgment.



She felt it would be harsh to leave Cedric working at the construction site. "We have an inspection today.How about we visit the land in the North District?"



Daniela gave a slight nod.



Ryan, standing just a few feet away, winked desperately at Lillian, but she pretended not to notice.



After Daniela went downstairs to get to work,Ryan turned to Lillian, frowning. "What's going on? Cedric asked us not to tell Daniela he's personally managing the project, so we don't add any pressure on her."



Lillian crossed her arms, clearly frustrated with the two clueless men. "Do you want Daniela to end up with Cedric or not?"



Ryan nodded eagerly. "Of course, I do!" Lillian pressed on, "One of them has to step up,make their feelings clear, and show they're present. Look at Alexander, he's at Elite Lux every day. Meanwhile,Cedric's out there getting dirty at the construction site.By the time he returns in a year, Daniela and Alexander might have kids."



Ryan was visibly shocked by the thought.



Josie appeared from the kitchen, spatula in hand,clearly agreeing with the conversation. "Exactly! What kind of guy chases a woman while vanishing for a whole month to work at a construction site? It'sjust ridiculous!"








When Daniela made her way downstairs, Alexander was already there, waiting in her office.



He stood and greeted her with a smile. "Good morning."



Daniela nodded back, sat down, and began working on her computer without a word.



Alexander had hoped she would be a bit warmer today,but instead, she remained as indifferent as ever,maybe even a bit colder.



"Did you see the trending topic this morning?"Alexander asked, trying to make conversation. Daniela kept her eyes on her screen, not responding to him.



The silence in the office began to gnaw at Alexander,his irritation building with each passing second.



Daniela's consistent disinterest and dismissive attitude towards him had left him feeling invisible, sidelined in his own efforts.



Now, he truly understood how she must have felt when he had ignored and neglected her all those times.



"Is this your way of getting back at me?" Alexander asked,staring at her.


At that moment, the secretary knocked before entering. "Ms. Harper, the car is downstairs, and the surveyors for the lands in the South and North n Districts are ready. Should we head out?"


t=Daniela replied, "Yes, I'm almost ready. Tell the driver y to bring the car to the main entrance."



As Daniela powered down her computer, it seemed rielike she finally noticed Alexander in the room. "Do you ahsneed something?"



Alexander was about to suggest joining her to inspect the land when Daniela quickly cut him off. "If it's not  urgent, maybe you should head back to your own company. I've been swamped lately, and if you don't have anything important to discuss, it's better you don't drop by. We both run companies, and some things need to stay confidential. As another business owner, I'm sure you understand that, right?"
###Chapter 112 Elite Lux Was Just The Least Of Daniel...
Daniela wasn't moved at all, and she even reprimanded Alexander. This sparked a flare of irritation within him.



He considered himself a sought-after man, not one to be dismissed lightly.


Daniela's demeanor, suggesting he was somehow desperate for her attention, was intolerable to him.



Yet, when she drove away from the parking lot, he couldn't help but trail behind her.



With Daniela at the helm of a billion-dollar project,he knew staying close was his only option-if he didn't,someone else surely would.



This realization was a blow to his ego. Alexander had never felt so diminished.



At the construction site, Daniela dove into her tasks with unwavering dedication. Alexander, donning a safety helmet, remained by her side throughout the day.



What caught him off guard was her expertise-she  wasn't only giving orders but knew the intricacies of architecture, engineering, and market trends by heart.



In several respects, her expertise eclipsed his own,despite his ten years in the industry.



This revelation cast Daniela in an entirely different light.



He observed her,her delicate features accentuated by the helmet, exuding a sharp concentration. She even seemed to grasp the surveyor's techniques intuitively.



During the lunch break, Alexander walked over to her with a meal he had brought along.



But Daniela, leaning into the brisk wind, was engrossed in a phone conversation.



Alexander's ears perked as he overheard snippets of her phone conversation. "Dreamscape Research Institute must quicken its steps. Our heart restoration technology already leads the world, but I need sharper,more intricate data. Let's hold off on notifying marketing-more thorough evaluations are essential before we push forward with experimental surgical initiatives."



She delivered each word with a resolute and commanding air.



On the other end of the line, someone responded  submissively, "Understood."



Alexander stood motionless, his lunchbox dangling in his grasp, as a surge of realization overwhelmed him.



Dreamscape was the titan of tech-medical research,a behemoth reigning over the medical sector for decades, boasting over 50, 000 medical patents globally.



The implication was clear-Dreamscape's workforce casually generated billions annually through their patents alone.



The researchers at Dreamscape were an elusive league,comprising the world's top ten intellects. They shunned the public eye, yet their rare appearances heralded monumental advancements.



The Bennett family had once ventured into the medical sector, but it proved too intricate and profound for them; their attempts amounted to nothing more than modest endeavors.



Lately, whispers had circulated throughout the global medical circles that Dreamscape had pioneered a groundbreaking technology for repairing heart damage. This innovation promised a definitive remedy for cardiac ailments, potentially eradicating congenital heart defects in patients.



Their claim was almost unbelievable-a single pill  could restore heart function and breathe life into those who thought all hope was lost.



News of the pill spread like wildfire, leaving the entire planet buzzing with anticipation.



Questions swirled like a storm. Who were the unseen geniuses driving this monumental force? What marvels were unfolding within their brilliant minds?



Stunned into silence, Alexander couldn't tear his gaze away from Daniela's graceful frame.



It dawned on him that the very person he had been searching for had been right before his eyes the entire time.



The thought made him sick-he had actuallychoose Joyce over Daniela, like a fool chasing scraps.



It was as if Alexander's chest had been ripped open,his heart left bleeding.



Daniela pivoted, her eyes narrowing on Alexander,who stood there, his face ashen and beads of sweat forming despite the sweltering heat.



"What are you doing here?" she inquired,her voice tinged with suspicion.



Alexander's response lingered in the air, his eyes distant and unfocused. Suddenly,he erupted into a fit of laughter-loud and wild,bordering on the edge of madness.



With an intense glare, she demanded, "What's so funny?"



His laughter erupted even louder, tears now cascading freely down his flushed face.



Lillian stepped in, positioning herself between them."He's completely lost his mind, Daniela. Avoid him at all costs-it's for your safety!"



Undeterred,Daniela sidestepped him, returning to her tasks with a dismissive shake of her head.



Alexander's laughter was still ringing through the air when his phone vibrated. It was a call from Richard.



Initially, Richard was puzzled by Alexander's unrestrained laughter, but he quickly grasped the situation.



"Has Daniela finally agreed to relinquish the construction rights?" he probed,his voice laced with impatience. 



"No, Dad," Alexander responded, a hint of sardonic humor coloring his tone. "Daniela's expertise is such that she can manage those projects with her eyes closed." Richard's response was a dismissive scoff. "Bullshit! A partnership with us is a no-brainer. Why the fuck would she refuse?"



The laughter that escaped Alexander then was tinged with cynicism.



′′Apartnership? That's the most absurd thing l've heard all year! Dad, do you truly understand who Daniela is?" he queried.



Richard's irritation was palpable as he retorted sharply,"What about her? She's just Daniela. So what if she's the CEO of Elite Lux? Has Elite Lux become so prosperous that it's now invincible?"



In that moment, Alexander's laughter came to an abrupt halt.



Straightening his posture, he fixed his eyes on Daniela.The evening gloom cast her into a silhouette, barely discernible in the darkening horizon.



Turning back his attention to Richard, he said into the phone, "Daniela has been immensely wealthy-far wealthier than we've realized. She isn't just the CEO of Elite Lux; she's also the one running Dreamscape."



Compared to Dreamscape, what significance did Elite Lux really hold? Perhaps to Daniela, Elite Lux was merely a minor outpost in her vast business dominion.
###Chapter 113 We're Not Fools Here

Richard stood frozen for a moment, his mind reeling.



Then, a spark of realization flashed in his eyes.Dreamscape launching its new heart medication?" he asked,his voice bubbling with excitement.



"Yes," Alexander answered in a flat tone.



Richard's face brightened, his voice nearly trembling with joy. "This is it! Dreamscape and Bennett Group should team up! What a golden opportunity!"



Alexander was drained of energy, while Richard practically burned with fervor.



"And Daniela marrying into our family-isn't that the best thing ever?" Richard continued, his excitement almost contagious.



Alexander had never heard him so animated before.



"Daniela's brilliant at making money, you know! And who knows, she might even have hidden identities. Do you realize how lucky you are? She's cut ties with her family. It means she has no backing now, no one to protect her. Everything she owns could be yours. Wait, no, ours! Go speak to her about the medical deal,"Richard urged.



Standing in the biting wind, Alexander remained unnervingly composed.



As Richard's enthusiasm grew, Alexander allowed a faint smile to tug at his lips, but his eyes spoke of nothing but irony. "Dad, think for a second. If you were Daniela, would you even consider working with the Bennett family?" Do you know why I laughed just now? Do you remember what you said about Daniela when she was after me? You said Daniela was just some unwanted daughter her family didn't care about and was shamelessly clinging to me because she was after our wealth and power. You said with her poor background, marrying her would ruin the Bennett family. And what use was a woman like that if she was not obedient and submissive? And at our wedding,you openly pointed at Daniela and accused her of marrying me for my money."



He could still picture Daniela's unshaken calmness that day.



She smiled slightly, her eyes showing quiet strength.Behind her, a sea of whispering guests pointed fingers and threw accusations. Through it all,she remained by his side, her resolve unwavering.



Alexander laughed bitterly at himself. He had been  given a rare treasure but hadn't recognized its value.



He was, without question, the most foolish man to ever walk the earth.



Daniela had no time to waste on fools.



She didn't bother with people who weren't on her level. Occasionally, out of boredom, she might entertain their nonsense, but she didn't wNaste much energy on it.



After finishing her work, she moved on to inspect another property.



Later, she stopped by a barbecue restaurant and rented out the entire place.



She placed an order for hundreds of skewers and had them delivered to the construction site in the North District.



Lillian, holding a megaphone, shouted, "Cedric has ordered barbecue for us! Everyone, take a break!"  



Cedric spun around in surprise and found Daniela standing behind him, her smile warm and genuine.



"What are you doing here?" Cedric asked, his brow furrowing. "It's cold and windy, you'll catch a cold."



Daniela,dressed in Elite Lux haute couture, looked like she had stepped out of a luxury advertisement. Yet there she was, casually sitting on the sidewalk as if it were the most natural thing to do.



She offered Cedric a skewer with a teasing smile."Care to do me the honor of trying one?"



Cedric couldn't help but smile. Shaking his head, he grabbed a clean piece of cardboard and slid it under Daniela for her to sit on before sitting down next to her.



It was already past 11 p.m.



The dim lights from the distant construction site cast long shadows. The two sat there together, watching as the towering structure slowly took shape in front of them.



"What do you think?" Cedric asked with a grin,mimicking Daniela's earlier tone. "Any suggestions?"



Daniela shook her head, nibbling on a piece of corn."None."



It was the plain truth.



Cedric was dependable and thorough-someone who could be relied upon to get things done without a hitch.



She had no feedback or advice to give. In that moment, Daniela wasn't focused on work or plans. She just wanted to sit on the cool concrete in front of what would soon be her empire, enjoying barbecue and beer with Cedric.



When Alexander showed up, he found Daniela and Cedric clinking beer bottles, casually seated on the sidewalk,completely carefree.



Alexander frowned deeply as he walked over. He looked at Cedric and said, "She's being reckless,but you should know better. Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux. If someone catches a picture of this, it'll cause a storm of rumors. You need to think about your own reputation and stop encouraging her careless behavior."



Alexander believed his words were perfectly reasonable. However, to his surprise, Daniela's face turned to a cold frown.



The friendly, relaxed vibe she'd had with Cedric disappeared in an instant, replaced by clear frustration that was impossible to hide.



"Mr. Bennett, do you know where you're standing?"Daniela's voice was icy, and she didn't even glance his way. Her eyes stayed locked on the muddy construction site in the distance. "This is my domain.You don't get to come here and act like you're in charge." Alexander quickly tried to explain, "I'm doing this because I care about you."



But Daniela got to her feet and wiped her hands clean.She looked at Cedric and said, "I've seen enough.The progress looks good. I'll send someone else to take charge from here. You don't need to stay. Focus on your company."



Only then did she face Alexander. "Care about me,huh? I've outgrown that kind of talk. Consider this your first and final warning. Never say that to me again.We're not fools here."



With that said, she turned and started walking away.



After a short while, she stopped and looked back at Cedric,her face relaxing into a smile. "Do you need a ride back?"



Cedric laughed and nodded. "I'd really appreciate it
###Chapter 114 Make Katrina Hate Daniela
Anxiety gripped Alexander immediately!



Just as he was about to follow Daniela, his phone erupted with the shrill ring of an incoming call.


It was Katrina on the line. He pressed the decline button, but she was persistent, calling again.



He declined once more, only for her to send a message.



"Please,Alexander,justpickup already-it'simportant!"



Typically, Katrina's urgencies revolved around Joyce.



Anything less seemed to barely stir her.



His phone rang yet again, and this time, Alexander couldn't ignore it.



He answered, barely getting a word out before Katrina's anxious voice spilled through. "Alexander, I'm terribly sorry to call so late, but I'm really at my wit's end. I need your help."



"What's going on?" Katrina's response was a flood of tears, her voice cracking with emotion. "Alexander, Joyce had a prenatal check-up today, and the doctor fears there might be complications with the baby's heart. They said it might need immediate surgery after birth to survive!"



Her voice broke as she continued, the sobs shaking her, "Alexander, it's my curse to be stuck with someone as cold and soulless as Caiden. All I have left in this world is Joyce, my sweet daughter. If she's taken from me, I don't think I'd have the strength to keep living this wretched life!"



Alexander was hardly in the mood to entertain Katrina's theatrics. He went straight to the point,his voice cutting through the tension. "Just tell me what you want from me!"



Katrina paused, her tears momentarily forgotten as she considered her plea.



What she truly desired was for Alexander to intervene in Joyce's predicament. The blame, in her eyes, lay squarely with Daniela. If not for her, Joyce would have been Alexander's wife by now,uniting their families and sparing her this torment.



Fueled by a resolute desire to see Daniela held responsible, Katrina implored, "Alexander,your group operates a healthcare company, doesn't it? Could you  possibly find out if there's a top specialist capable of performing such a surgery? Or maybe there's a way to treat the baby without surgery. It's heartbreaking to think of the baby facing a lifetime of medication after surgery."



Alexander fell silent, absorbing her words.



Thoughts of Daniela flickered through his mind, along with Dreamscape's cutting-edge medical solutions.



Typically, such innovations would need official approval, clinical trials, and extensive marketing-a process spanning at least a year.



But time was a luxury the child did not have.



A sliver of hope emerged as he considered whether Daniela might be persuaded to grant an exception for Joyce.



When Alexander confided in Richard, his response was fierce and immediate. "Stay out of it, Alexander! This mess isn't worth ruining yourself over! Daniela has completely severed ties with the Harper family. What business is it of yours to interfere? Think about it-if they mend fences and Daniela ends up backed by the Harpers, given our past run-ins with Katrina, do you seriously believe she'd make peace with us? And what about Joyce? How will you face her?"



The more Richard pondered the situation,the more  his disapproval grew.



"Just let Daniela and the Harpers go their separate ways! Offering help is generous, but choosing not to is your decision. Nobody can fault you for that.Listen carefully, Alexander, don't even think about getting involved in that mess! You don't need to sort this out.Leave it to me," Richard insisted, his voice laden with concern that Alexander might be too compassionate for his own good.



Daniela was a treasure too valuable to let slip into anyone else's hands.



With a firm resolve, Richard muttered, "I'll call Katrina myself. Why the hell are you always dragged into their mess? You're not even family! They're just using you like a damn tool!"



With those words, Richard seized the phone and quickly exited the room.



"Katrina, I regret to inform you that our medical division lacks the necessary technology and expertise.However, I've done some research on your behalf.Lipool Hospital is renowned for its proficient techniques-you might want to consider consulting with them. It's critical to address these matters promptly, especially if surgery is on the table."



He paused, a hint of caution in his voice. "Furthermore,  I must mention, Harper Group's performance hasn't been doing so well lately. Should the public learn of your child's health issues, it could negatively impact your stock prices. I'd advise you to secure a competent surgeon soon. The advancements in medical technology these days generally assure successful outcomes. Please, try not to worry excessively."



Katrina found her usual poised demeanor slipping away, caught in a whirlwind of emotions.



She wholeheartedly believed in Richard's sincerity and quickly expressed her gratitude before reaching out to the recommended doctor.



Unbeknownst to her, Alexander was aware that the doctor in question was hardly a specialist in cardiac matters and had a checkered past with several medical controversies.



Richard's maneuvers were strategically aimed to eventually reveal Daniela's role as the CEO of Dreamscape, leading Katrina to suspect Daniela had knowingly remained passive.



He was determined to make Katrina hate Daniela to the core.



Such a scheme was devilishly clever.



Truly, it was a stroke of genius.
###Chapter 115 Her Former Gentleness Was Gone
Katrina dialed the doctor's number,her movements tinged with urgency.



Joyce slumped into the sofa, her tears flowing unchecked.



Across from her, Caiden occupied a chair, absorbing the scene: Katrina issuing firm commands to the doctor and Joyce's despairing cries piercing the quiet.



Mixed emotions churned within Caiden as he witnessed the unfolding drama,his mind wrestling with indecision.



Finally,unable to remain passive, he addressed Joyce."This illness is no small matter, Joyce. Perhaps you should consider consulting multiple hospitals, seeking various opinions. Weren't you once a director at Daniela's company? Despite everything, you're still on their roster. Maybe Daniela could recommend some specialists. She's well-connected, far more than we are now."



Joyce turned, her face twisted in a grimace. "Dad,please, not this. My friends have already mocked me enough. Do you think Daniela would really help? She  assigned me to supervise the restrooms. It's degrading,sitting there all day. It's clear she's just trying to retaliate. How could she possibly lend a hand after that?"



As Katrina ended the call, she caught the tail end of the conversation and entered the room, her eyes narrowing in displeasure. "What did you just say?Daniela put you in charge of the restrooms?"



"Yes," Joyce replied, dabbing at her eyes, "Mom,what's Dad thinking? Daniela is using her position to demean me, and he suggests I go groveling back to her? It seems like he'd rather enjoy seeing me humiliated!"



After her outburst, Joyce turned sharply and concealed her tear-streaked face within the soft folds of the pillow, her sobs wrenching painfully at Katrina's heartstrings.



Katrina shot Caiden a fiery look, her voice thick with resolve. "Caiden! Daniela torments Joyce relentlessly,and I refuse to stand idly by! Once I've wrapped up my current affairs, I'm going to make her answer for it."



Her features were set in a fierce mask of determination. Her eyes blazed, and her hands were balled into tight fists as though she were ready to take on the world. Caiden, despite his well-meaning advice, found himself the target of her ire.



He exhaled deeply, a hint of resignation in his tone "Alright, confront Daniela if you must. But in your current state, you're unlikely to even gain entry to Elite Lux. Katrina, I'm seriously suggesting you seek assistance from Daniela. You've never held a high-ranking position-you don't realize how those at the top can resolve matters with a mere word, far more efficiently than one can from the bottom."



Katrina scoffed at his suggestion, her disdain palpable."Caiden! Now you're trying to boast? Really? And tell me, when have you ever held a high position? Oh,that's right-through Brylee! Riding on a woman's coattails, and now you parade around as if you're some paragon of virtue? What exactly are you proud of? Any man of honor wouldn't brag about exploiting a woman's success. You're not just unashamed-you're actually proud? How utterly disgraceful!"



Caiden was utterly speechless following her rebuke.He gazed at Katrina, his eyes wide as he observed her once tender expression now contorted in anger. For a brief moment, he was uutterly dumbfounded.



His voice quavered as he looked into her eyes, the hurt evident in his tone. "How can you accuse me of such things? To say I leeched off a woman? Katrina!  Weren't you the one who, while I was drunk,lavished me with praises about my talent, admired my demeanor, complimented my handwriting, and celebrated my artistic sensibilities? You told me I was pure, untouched by the taint of money. I've clung to every word you said for years. And didn't you confide in me about the hardships you faced, how your husband mistreated you, and how you yearned to run away with me? When Brylee departed and your ex-husband passed away, I was the one who eagerly proposed, dismissing the rumors that whispered we were together before our marriage was official.For your sake, I've endured endless criticism over the years, and Daniela has shed silent tears in her room time and again because of it. But none of that mattered to me because I loved you. I wanted nothing more than to be with you. I was genuine in my feelings. And now, you say I'm just leeching off a woman?"



Tears welled up in Caiden's eyes as he sat there, each word weighed down by sorrow.



He stared intently at Katrina, his gaze searching her face for a sign of the love they once shared. "Is this truly how you've always seen me?" he asked,hoping against hope for her to refute his fears.



Yet, Katrina just stood there,her expression chillingly indifferent. Then, her lips curled into a cruel sneer as a mocking laugh escaped her. "Caiden, we're adults;  we need to own our choices."



Caiden's eyes widened in utter disbelief.



Katrina pressed on, her voice sharp with accusation."Remember Brylee? She wNas loyal to you. And you?You betrayed her and ignored your own child. You mentioned Daniela crying in secret, but do you knoW the real story? That day, when you dragged me into your home and we made love on the couch, Daniela saw us! Ever wonder why she started sleepwalking?consulted a doctor, and she was suffering from severe depression. Can you even grasp how many nights she wept silently when you thought she was just being stubborn?"



Katrina gestured to a spot near her eye. "Right here,Daniela got this huge scar during that time. It's less noticeable now, but do you think if she hated you back then?"



Caiden's entire body shook with the force of his emotions. Gazing at Katrina, he no longer recognized the tender-hearted woman he once thought he knew.In her place stood a monster-a complete monster!
###Chapter 116 Keep Loving Me
Katrina didn't even look at Caiden, who was shaking all over, unable to stop himself.



She simply grabbed her phone and walked outside to answer another call.



Caiden stayed where he was, his body tense and still,not able to move a single inch.



Even Joyce felt uneasy by Katrina's outburst. She wasn't sure how to react.



The tension in the air was thick and uncomfortable.



Wanting to avoid getting caught up in it, she hugged her doll close and quickly headed upstairs, getting away from the mess.



Caiden sat still, his eyes glued to the floor as he watched Joyce's bunny slippers disappear up the stairs.A few moments later, the loud sound of her bedroom door locking echoed throughout the house.



He blinked, his eyes slowly opening again, and then started laughing-a sad,empty laugh that kept getting louder. shut the balcony door, and didn't say anything to stop the noise.



But Caiden wasn't just laughing. He was crying, too.Tears ran down his face, mixing with his sad, desperate laughs.



He could picture it so clearly-the future he was headed towards, growing old and being left behind.



Katrina wouldn't look after him, and Joyce wouldn't think twice about leaving him. He'd end up like his father, dying alone and forgotten, filthy and surrounded by bugs.








Ever since Alexander discovered that Cedric was the boy from Daniela's childhood-the one who held a special place in her most cherished memories-he couldn't shake his unease.



Daniela held those memories close to her heart. If she found out that Cedric was the same boy, would all the love she had for him back then turn to Cedric?



Would she end up falling for Cedric?



Would they even get married?



Cedric seemed to care for Daniela in a way Alexander never did. If he had shown her even half of the  kindness Cedric did, maybe they would never have gotten divorced.



The more Alexander thought about it, the tighter the knot of anxiety grew inside him.



Pushing everything else out ofhis mind, he went to Daniela's office, unable to focus on anything else.



When he got there, Daniela was fully focused on carving a piece of jade.



What had begun as a rough, uneven block had already become a finely detailed sculpture of a man-someone who looked a bit like Cedric.



As soon as Alexander saw the jade sculpture, the tension in his mind broke. "Daniela, are you in love with Cedric now?"



Daniela hadn't expected him to show up, but she didn't even glance up. Her hands continued their careful work, her focus never wavering. "Stay in your lane. We're divorced," she replied coolly.



"Yes, we are. But you're the one who insisted on it!"



Daniela completed the last details of the carving,blowing off the dust before placing it down and finally locking eyes with him.



"You've come all the way here, late at night,into my  office, just to talk about this? Is it really that important?"



Alexander, unusually resolute, persisted, "Yes, this matters to me! Back then, I agreed to the divorce because you asked for it. But I never truly wanted it,Daniela!"



Daniela appeared to find it laughable. Her eyes gleamed with sarcasm as she met his gaze."Alexander, do you even realize what you're saying?It's like a man telling a woman after they've been together, 'You went along with it the whole time,so l don't need to take any responsibility.' It's absurd."


But Alexander stood firm. He locked eyes with her and pressed, "I'm asking you plainly-do you have feelings for Cedric? Stop dodging the question."



Daniela turned her focus back to the jade as she replied, "Even if I do, why would that shock you?Cedric was already the wealthiest man in the country long before Elite Lux came back. He's good-looking,taller than you, has a calm nature, and knows his way around the kitchen. Sure, I've made my share of mistakes, like spending time on someone who didn't appreciate me. But I've learned. Now, I only care about people who treat me right."



Her tone was direct, with no hint of apology. "Cedric treats me right and is exceptional in every way. He's  a solid choice. Don't you agree? Or should I go back to wasting my time with someone like you? I'd much rather put my effort into making more money. With enough money. I could live like you men-keeping things flexible, always enjoying life to the fullest.I could even hire a good-looking secretary to make my office more interesting."



A playful smirk appeared on her face as she continued,"You're here asking if I like Cedric? What's going on?Don't tell me after all this time, you've had a change of heart and now want me to fall for you all over again?"



The weight of guilt hit Alexander as Daniela's sharp gaze locked onto him.



After what felt like an eternity of silence,he finally spoke. "Yes, Daniela, that's why I'm here. I'm begging you not to fall for Cedric. You can still love me, and I swear-I'll treat you the way you deserve this time."
###Chapter 117 Are You Looking For Trouble

Daniela barely stopped herself from gagging at Alexander's words.



She forced down the sick feeling rising in her and gave Alexander a sharp, skeptical look.



Back when she had been obsessed with him,she could hardly take her eyes off him. But now, with no feelings left, her patience had completely run out.



Leaning her head on her hand, she couldn't help but find the situation amusing



She had put in so much effort before, bending over backwards, breaking her own boundaries,just to make Alexander love her. Yet, he wouldn't even spare her a second glance.



But now, without her lifting a finger, he suddenly wanted to be kind to her, all because he feared she might be interested in Cedric.



What a complete joke this was!



She wondered if Alexander thought she was an easy target, which was why he kept coming to belittle her. If that was the case, she saw no reason to hold back.



You want to be kind to me?" Daniela replied,continuing to carve the jade in her hand. "Well, go ahead and try. It's hard to say if I could ever feel anything for you again, but just remember, your choices are yours to make. You're an adult,right?"



In Daniela's eyes, anyone who asked for a promise before offering something in return was just playing games-and those who played games weren't worth her time or forgiveness.



Alexander's brow furrowed at her words, a frown tugging at his lips.



This wasn't how he'd pictured it. He had assumed she would agree without hesitation, and they could start building a future together. Instead, she brushed him off as if he meant nothing.



"What?" Daniela raised her eyes to meet his. "You're not willing? Is it that hard for you?"



"Then set me a deadline," Alexander said,his voice low.



Daniela let out a laugh. "Do you really need a deadline to be nice to someone? Is being good to others just another task for you? Or a project?"



"No, that's not what I meant..." 
Daniela stood up, carefully organizing her carving tools and picking up the finished jade from the table.She looked at Alexander for a moment, her expression neutral. "I'm heading upstairs to rest now. If there's nothing else you need, then goodnight."


With that, she turned and walked towards the elevator.She stepped inside and left, leaving Alexander standing there, stunned.



He was usually so quick with his words, but in that moment, he found himself completely at a loss for words.








Alexander couldn't sleep a wink after getting home,tossing and turning in bed, restless all night.


By 6 a.m., he was already up and ordered the housekeeper to prepare a variety of breakfasts for Daniela.



When Richard came downstairs and saw what was happening,he couldn't hide his satisfaction.



By the time Daniela came downstairs in the morning,Cedric was already sitting in the living room.



Lillian walked in and asked Cedric teasingly, "Is the breakfast at your company really that bad? You're  here every day now."



Daniela let out a small laugh as she handed Cedric the hand-carved jade she'd made the day before.



They had recently acquired a new source of jade and had found some really great pieces, one of which stood out as particularly beautiful.


Cedric had been eager to get a hand-carved jade piece,so Daniela had decided to carve one for him.



Cedric took a quick look, not bothered by any imperfections, and happily tucked it into his pocket.


When Alexander arrived with breakfast, Daniela and the others had already finished eating. Lillian was being her usual lively self, laughing loudly at something.



However, the moment she saw Alexander, her laughter abruptly stopped.



As they got closer, Lillian nudged the bag Alexander was carrying. "What's this? Trying to embarrass yourself by bringing this here?"



Alexander opened his mouth to reply, but Lillian cut him off. "If this is your way of trying to get back in, it's a little sad. We just had pancakes made by Cedric.Your breakfast looks like something the housekeeper picked up at the store." Daniela offered a polite smile before heading towards her office.



Alexander hurried after her. "Daniela, what do you want to eat? I'll bring it tomorrow."



Lillian frowned, frustrated at the thought of Daniela's past feelings going to waste. She shoved Alexander into the elevator, pointing a finger at him."Are you trying to stir things up?"



Alexander was about to deny it but then paused.



He had known Daniela for years, yet he couldn't even figure out what she liked to eat. If that wasn't asking for trouble, he didn't know what was.



But the truth was, he had no idea.



In the end, all of Daniela's efforts over the years had turned into nothing more than a joke.
###Chapter 118 Your Ex-wife Now Is So Powerful
Alexander left Harper Group early in the morning,feeling frustrated after his visit didn't go as planned.



By afternoon, Elite Lux had kicked off the bidding for construction project in the South and East Districts.



Keith showed up soon after, looking around the room for Alexander. When he spotted him in the front row,he quickly made his way over.



"I need your help!" Keith said urgently, sitting next to Alexander with a bidding proposal full of dense text.Alexander, you're close to Daniela. Do you have any inside info on this bidding?"



As soon as he finished, the rest of the bidding team subtly shifted closer to Alexander.



In the eyes of everyone, despite Daniela now being the CEO of Elite Lux, she remained the figure who once trailed Alexander like a devoted follower.



That image of Daniela as the ever-loyal follower was still deeply etched in their minds.


Alexander didn't have any insider knowledge at all. But seeing how intently everyone was listening,he felt embarrassed to admit he had nothing to share.



He closed his lips tight and glanced at Keith. "Why?Planning to go home and take over the family business?"



"Don't even talk about it. Last month, I crashed a Maserati, my band went bankrupt, and my gaming project lost more than thirty million. My dad said if l keep blowing money,he'll cut me off!"



Recently, in Olisvine, wealthy families had been cutting ties with their children.



People believed Daniela's success came from Caiden firmly pushing her to step up and face the world,which had led her to where she was now.



The month had barely started, and already two families had severed ties with their children.



Keith was beyond frustrated. "What is Daniela doing?Isn't it our job to be the spoiled,aimless rich kids? Now I'm being forced into this bidding project, and if l don't win it, I'm finished."



Keith gave Alexander a playful nudge. "Come on, you have to help me out! Tell me, is there any inside scoop?" Alexander lowered his gaze, his expression becoming thoughtful.



Keith let out a deep sigh. "Don't tell me the project has already been handed to you? With your connection to Daniela, it makes sense that she'd give it to you. Alexander, be honest with me. If she's already given it to you, I won't waste my time."



Alexander crossed his legs and sat back with a calm grace. "Don't say that."



His words sent a chill through the room. They hinted that the project had already been decided.



Even though everyone had prepared themselves for this outcome, hearing Alexander's confirmation still caused a collective sigh. It was a bitter pill to swallow.



This was an opportunity so profitable that it could easily support multiple companies.



Keith blinked in disbelief and whispered, "Look, this is a goldmine. I'm not asking for much, just a small share,alright?"



A voice from behind them chimed in eagerly, "Hey,what about me? Mr. Bennett, I'll offer you a deal below market value," and gestured a number with excitement. Keith's eyes widened in shock. "Are you insane? If you offer below market value, there's no way you'll make a profit."



"Are you serious? Profit? This deal's a complete loss,"the person responded with a grin, as though it was all part of the plan.



Keith stared at the person's smiling face, clearly stunned. "That smile doesn't look like someone who's losing money-it looks like you just made ten mnillion!"



"I don't think you quite getit. Our families don't have competing products. Let me explain the details."



Keith nodded eagerly. "Go ahead, I'm listening."



Alexander could feel the eyes of the room on him once more.



"As you know, Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux. She bought the landmark building without breaking a sweat. Her financial clout is truly impressive, wouldn't you say?"



Keith gave a quick nod."Of course."



Alexander straightened in his seat, a touch of pride emanating from him.



"Cedric's decision to take over the North District  construction reflects his sharp vision. When the bid came out, he didn't earn a dime. Do you know why?"



"Why?" Keith asked, intrigued.



"It's about cultivating a solid relationship with Daniela and Elite Lux. If the project hadn't been so time-sensitive, would there even have been a bidding process? Daniela could have simply handed it to Cedric, and we wouldn't stand a chance.



"Landing the project contract is like securing a ticket to future partnerships with Elite Lux. It's about establishing a solid reputation with Daniela. Her influence is irrefutable, and Olisvine practically belongs to her. Construction projects won't be in short supply. In our field, it's well-known that it's smarter to work with trusted allies. Once you're on Daniela's radar, how could you ever fear financial struggles? Didn't your father teach you these fundamentals?"



Keith was taken aback by what he had just heard.He turned to Alexander, his voice filled with awe."Alexander,is your ex-wife really this powerful now?"



Alexander crossed his arms, his tone calm. "It seems so."



Keith couldn't hide the envy creeping into his voice.



Had he known then, he would've made a move on  Daniela.



Marrying her would have meant becoming the master of Olisvine.



Regret gnawed at Keith for not acting sooner.



A man behind them handed Alexander a business card with respect, saying, "Mr. Bennett, I've heard a great deal about you. Let's get to know each other."



Soon, business cards were passed to him one after another.



Alexander couldn't help but feel as if both Daniela and her projects were now in his grasp.



A growing sense of satisfaction washed over him.



Meanwhile, another man handed Alexander a valuable antique, and Keith noticed the man subtly signal a number to him.



Eight million dollars.
###Chapter 119The Confidential Budget Report
While Alexander was basking in the attention as people eagerly handed him their business cards,Cedric quietly slipped into a seat in the very last row,keeping a low profile.



Lillian, ever observant, caught sight of him and waved,signaling for him to come forward to the front row.



Realizing there were no open seats available,she quickly arranged a place for him among the staff.



The subtle gesture sparked envy among the men in the room.



Keith leaned towards Alexander and quipped,"See?That's what having the right connections gets you."



Alexander's smug demeanor instantly darkened at those words, and he snapped sharply, "It's just a way to show off."



Keith chuckled and teased, "Feeling any regrets about divorcing Daniela now? Cedric looks like someone you should keep an eye on!"



Alexander scoffed dismnissively. "That guy?" Cedric and Daniela had known each other for ages.If there was ever anything between them, it would've happened by now.



But beneath his confident words, a flicker of unease crept in. Alexander couldn't shake the worry that Daniela might find out Cedric was the boy from her past. He knew this secret needed to stay buried-no one could ever find out.



Noticing Alexander's unease, Keith smirked. "Relax,I won't spil anything. But you owe me one. When you seal the deal, throw me a bone,okay?"



Keith's family specialized in hardware and interior design, after all.



Alexander nodded. "Fine. Once I secure the project,the interior design is all yours."



Keith's face lit up with excitement.



Alexander leaned closer, his voice sharp. "And remember-keep that secret buried."



Keith nodded with a satisfied smile, feeling confident and victorious. He was certain that he could return home with promising news to share.



Soon,the bidding meeting began right on time. While everyone had anticipated Daniela's presence,only the Elite Lux bidding team showed up.



They proceeded with an overview of the project and outlined the bidding schedule.



The entire room sat in focused silence, scribbling down notes diligently, even those who believed they stood no chance.



Among them, Cedric wNas also seen jotting down notes with unwavering concentration.



In stark contrast, Alexander and Keith remained seated upright, showing no interest in taking notes.



Keith, puzzled by their indifference, turned to Alexander. "Why aren't you taking notes? Look,everyone else is all over it."



With the two projects valued in the tens of billions and involving intricate details and cost breakdowns,it was no wonder everyone else was frantically scribbling.



"Why bother? I'll just get the confidential budget report from Daniela later," Alexander remarked,prompting a wave of envy among the note-taking executives.



Their note-taking became increasingly half-hearted. If everything had already been decided, what was the point of their meticulous notes? It felt like they were just going through the motions, jotting down meaningless numbers. This project was clearly intended for Alexander.



Meanwhile, Keith, oblivious to the underlying tension but thoroughly impressed, was in high spirits.



The meeting dragged on for over three hours.



By the time it finally ended, everyone had filled their small notebooks with notes-but no one made a move to leave.



With Alexander claiming access to a confidential budget report, the attendees lingered,hoping for even the tiniest peek to salvage some value from their time.



Alexander was fully aware of what they were sticking around for.



Standing up, he casually brushed the lint off his suit pants and made his way towards Lillian.



Before he could get too close, Lillian gestured for him to come over.



Alexander couldn't help but feel a sudden rush of happiness. Daniela's stubbornness was obvious. Deep down, she still cared about him, no matter how much she tried to hide it. Clearly, this was her way of luring him back.



Wearing a composed smile, Alexander strode forward confidently.



"Cedric," Lillian said as she handed him a thick notebook. "Daniela gave it to you."



All heads turned, and everyone strained to get a better look. And there it was, the Confidential Budget Report.



"Daniela mentioned that you're tied up with the North District project, so there's no need for you to participate in the bidding. By the time you wrap up,this project will have reached its mid-phase, and you can step in with your team to evaluate the earlier work."



The announcement hit like a thunderclap, leaving everyone speechless.



Someone quickly raised a hand. "Wait, does this mean the bid only covers the first phase of the project?"



Lillian nodded affirmatively. "Exactly. The second half wasn't part of the bidding because it's already assigned. We prefer working with trusted partners.If it weren't for the fact that Cedric's tied up with the North District project, we would've let him handle the  entire new project too."



Lillian's statement confirmed the executives suspicions, though few had anticipated the collaboration between Daniela and Cedric would extend beyond the North District project.



It was a reminder of the undeniable strength of connections.



Alexander's mood soured instantly. What on earth was this supposed to mean? Was he expected to work under Cedric's supervision if he won the project?



Seeing the same people who had been buttering him up moments ago now gravitate towards Cedric filled Alexander with indignation, yet he refrained from storming out.



Straightening his posture, he walked over to Lillian with a steely expression. "Can I have a copy of that confidential budget report?"



Lillian gave him a bemused look before chuckling. "I'm sorry, and you are?"
###Chapter 120 More Than Enough.
Alexander furrowed his brow. He was about to say something when Lillian's sharp, mocking voice cut him off. "Why are you so thick-skinned?"


Her words rang out, carrying across the room so that everyone could hear.



"What's this? Daniela divorces you, and you're still hanging around like a parasite? This is private business,don't you get it? An ex-husband is an outsider,not an insider. Got that?"



Lillian's words landed like a slap, and the room's attention snapped to Alexander in an instant.


The crowd, including those who had just handed him their business cards, now murmured to each other in hushed tones.



The weight of their stares pressed against Alexander,his face flushing with humiliation.



Seething with rage,he shot Lillian a furious glare."Fine!If you won't give it to me, I'll take it straight to Daniela.You're just her subordinate, and I won't lower myself to your level. But clearly, Daniela needs to reevaluate  her staff training. I'll make sure to have a word with her about this!"



With that, he stormed off, fury radiating from every step.



Keith, who had been trailing Alexander all day, didn't get the outcome he had hoped for either.



When he finally returned home, his father wasted no time in giving him an earful.


"Stop following Alexander around! Otherwise, Daniela will hate you too! That woman is our golden opportunity-don't ruin this for us!"



After the harsh scolding, Keith left in a huff and headed straight to a bar.



Feeling a surge of frustration, Keith grabbed his phone and dialed Alexander's number. However, the call was dismissed.



Alexander was heading straight for Elite Lux.



When he reached Daniela's office,she was fully absorbed in sorting through a large stack of paperwork. She didn't even look up to acknowledge his presence.



"Mr. Bennett, have you forgotten basic manners? You didn't even bother knocking." Alexander's anger boiled over, threatening to spill out."What the hell. Daniela?" Why did you let Lillian humiliate me like that?"



Lillian had already informed Daniela of the situation,so Daniela was fully aware of what had happened.



"I heard you called Lillian my subordinate? Let me make one thing perfectly clear everyone in this building is my equal. Lillian is my friend,someone l trust deeply and treat like family. I won't stand for anyone disrespecting her. Consider this a warning."



Finally, she raised her gaze, her eyes icy and commanding. "I won't be so lenient next time."



Alexander was about to protest, but Daniela cut him off once more. "Let's at least maintain some basic decency. Mutual respect is the bare minimum. Or should I teach you that too?"



Alexander's frustration grew. He hadn't even begun to express himself, and she was already lecturing him.



"Why are you treating me like this?" he demanded,his voice tight with anger. "Cedric gets access to the proposal.Why don't I?"


Daniela's tone remained steady,emotionless."lforgot."It was a dismissive response, and she didn't offer any further explanation. Alexander extended his hand, his voice cold and insistent. "Give it to me now."



He couldn't afford to let this go, not with rumors already circulating behind his back.



Daniela replied, "There aren't any left."



Alexander's breath caught in his chest, his frustration reaching a boiling point. "You're playing me, Daniela!"



Daniela's lips curved into a subtle smile. "You've asked to be involved in the bidding meeting,but what makes you think our relationship is such that I'd treat you the same way I do Cedric? Is it because you told me you'd 'treat me well'?"



Her smile disappeared, her face hardening into a cold,distant expression. "We're adults, Alexander. Is it really that simple to get under your skin? That's not like you."



She leaned back, a hint of disappointment in her tone."Truthfully, I thought you had some dignity, some pride.If you come crawling back to me now that l've found success, it'll make everything I ever felt for y/ou seem like a joke. It'll make me realize that even your 'love' could be bought with money."



As she spoke, her gaze never wavered from his, and she seemed entirely unaffected by the displeasure that crossed his face. "I'm incredibly wealthy, Alexander. So wealthy that you can't even begin to fathom it. And when you have so much of something, it loses its value. If it only takes money to win your favor, then you can keep it.Understand?"



With that, she turned back to her paperwork,picked up her pen, and resumed her signing



Her handwriting was immaculate, each stroke purposeful. Alexander stared at her, his lips tightly pressed together. After a heavy, silent pause,he spun on his heel and headed for the door.



Just before he left, he spat out bitterly, "Daniela!You'll regret this!"



He had never felt such humiliation. Each step felt more burdensome than the last.



"Alexander," Daniela suddenly called out.



Alexander's heart softened, and he turned back, his face still clouded with frustration. "What now?"



Throughout it all, he kept up a facade of dignity.



"Keep that attitude. Hold your head up high. And don't forget to shut the door behind you when you leave."



The brief softness in Alexander's expression vanished,  replaced by a harsh, dark frown.



With a sharp, angry motion, he slammed the door behind him, the sound echoing violently through the office.



Daniela, however, didn't flinch. She simply let out a small, almost satisfied smile, whle her attention remained fixed on the papers in front of her.



The moment was more than enough.
###Chapter 121 I'm Sorry




Alexander was seething with fury, feeling like he would explode at any moment.


Upon his arrival at the bar, he found Keith swaying slightly, clearly drunk and unsteady.


When Alexander shared his grievances, Keith's eyes widened in astonishment, realizing the truth in his friend's words.


Breaking it down for him, Keith remarked thoughtfully, "Tell me if I'm off base here, Alexander.Wasn't it Daniela who was always following you around? She used to hang on your every word while you barely gave her the time of day. Now,she's wealthy, and suddenly you're showing interest. No wonder she questions your motives. Daniela makes a good point,you know."



Alexander clenched his jaw, his expression growing stormy as he gulped down his drink forcefully. "So you're suggesting I play hard to get?"


Memories of Cedric's tender ways with Daniela flashed through his mind. "If I delay too long, she might settle down and start a family with Cedric!"


"Just keep showing her kindness," Keith advised, his words slurring as the alcohol took over. "People have hearts; they're not just emotionless stones. Be patient with her, whether it's for a year, two years,or even a decade. Alexander, your pride is getting in the way. You act as if everyone should adore you! Daniela has changed; what makes you think she'll return to you? You need to change your approach.Constantly expecting her to appease you will only drive her away. As a man, don't let pride dictate your actions,especially since she's your ex-wife. Why fuss about who's right?"


With a hearty slap on the back, Keith exclaimed,"What a foolish man you are!"


And with that,Keith crumpled to the floor in a heap.


Alexander watched, making no move to assist him. He sat in his chair, ensnared by his own thoughts for what felt like an eternity.
Eventually, his voice broke the silence, soft and uncertain. "Is that really how it is? One year... two years... a decade? If I chase after her, will Daniela ever return to me?"
Elite Lux, embracing a modern approach,had implemented a balanced work week: four days of work followed by three days of rest.
Daniela, ever the efficient worker, had completed her assignments the previous evening. Her secretary popped in with a reminder, bubbling with enthusiasm. "Daniela, don't forget about the banquet tonight."
Daniela's expression shadowed with a touch of melancholy.
The secretary departed with an uncontainable grin.Throughout her tenure, she had never encountered a CEO as genuinely charming as Daniela.

Adorned in her elegant evening gown, Daniela nINE ASKED,

descended the stairs only to be greeted by the unexpected sight of Cedric.


His attire was impeccably tailored-a stark black suit that contrasted with his recent tan, acquired from his time on construction sites, lending him an air of rugged sophistication.


Upon their arrival at the venue, Daniela excused herself to the restroom.



As she made her way back, the crisp sound of her phone's notification caught her attention.


Checking it, she discovered a message from Alexander.


Daniela's eyebrow arched high.


She had assumed Alexander had finally given up after their heated discussion last time.



She let out a dry chuckle, her smirk carrying a sharp edge of sarcasm.


Money had a miraculous way of bending principles. The man she once admired for his staunch principles was now humbling himself repeatedly.


The message simply stated, "I'm sorry."


A smirk played on Daniela's lips.


When Cedric spotted her, she was gazing at her phone, her dimples deepening enchantingly on her cheeks.



"What's got you in such a good mood? You look exceptionally cheerful."


Daniela tilted her phone towards Cedric as they continued on their way.


Meanwhile, Alexander stepped out of the restroom.He caught the sound of Daniela's laughter.


It was her happiness that echoed in her laughter-happiness sparked by his message.


Her laughter rang melodious, stirringa wave of elation in Alexander's heart.


He now believed Keith's advice. If he persisted in showing genuine kindness to Daniela, she would undoubtedly feel his sincerity.


It was only a matter of time before everything Daniela had became his.


He wished, with all his heart, that Daniela could go back to being the person she once was.
###Chapter 122 Jerk





Cedric passed the phone to Daniela, and she slipped it into her bag.


He had questions in mind, but he hesitated, unsure of the repercussions of asking them.


Cedric knew Daniela wasn't one to revisit old relationships, but back then, she had no principles when it came to Alexander.


He was always the one in control, except when it involved Daniela.


Just as they were about to enter the banquet hall,Cedric stopped briefly and gently grasped Daniela's hand.



He held it for just a moment before letting go.


Daniela turned to face him, her brow slightly furrowed. "What's wrong?" Cedric pressed his lips together as he clenched his hand and unclenched it. After a brief pause, he smiled and shook his head. "It's nothing. Just stick to juice. Drinking at night can be tough on your stomach."



Daniela chuckled, her eyes twinkling like stars.


Cedric felt his heart skip a beat, but he still hesitated.


Lillian and Ryan pulled him to a quiet corner for a scolding.


"Cedric! What were you thinking?" Ryan crossed his arms.



Lillian was frantic. "Were you about to confess? You should've just confessed already. How hard is it to say, 'I like you, and I'm going to pursue you?' It's not that difficult, is it?"


Ryan ran his hand through his hair. "You said you'd wait because Daniela had just returned. Then you said the North District project was urgent, so you'd wait again. What now? Are you going to wait until the project of the South and East Districts is finished?" It was unusual for Ryan to speak this much.


Lillian remarked, "Look at this, you've even got the quiet one talking. Cedric, what do you really want?"


Cedric leaned against the wall, his eyes focused on Daniela as she stood nearby, enjoying a cupcake,all while looking out through the large window.


A shy individual approached her with a drink, and Daniela offered a warm smile, completely unbothered by the cutthroat atmosphere that usually surrounded business.



"She's not ready yet," Cedric murmured.


"Ready for what? Look at this..." Lillian started,but her words trailed off as Alexander emerged from the restroom, walking towards Daniela.


Frowning,Cedric started to move towards them, but Lillian quickly held him back. He glanced at her in confusion.


"Don't bother. You won't get it, even if you try. Just watch and learn," Lillian advised as Ryan held Cedric in place.


The person Daniela was chatting with was a young interior designer, someone Alexander recognized.


He came from a humble, rural background with no connections, relying only on his determination to get ahead. The last time he offered Alexander a drink,Alexander took a small sip without much thought,while the young man downed the entire glass in one go.


Later, Alexander had seen the young man vomiting in the restroom, his girlfriend helping him out.


The girlfriend was simple in appearance and modestly dressed, and she smiled at Alexander as she helped the man.



Alexander had witnessed many couples like them-staying together through the toughest times.


He looked down on people like them.


By the time Alexander reached Daniela, the young man seemed visibly nervous. Daniela glanced at him briefly, her tone neutral. "Mr. Bennett."


Alexander carried himself with the confidence of someone who had made it, and the young man,feeling defeated, handed Daniela his business card before leaving.


Daniela gave the card a quick look-Leandro Prescott, an interior designer.


"Don't waste your time," Alexander said, snatching the card from her hand before she could read it."He's just a nobody with little to offer. If you need a real expert, come to Bennett Group. I'll introduce you to someone with over ten years of experience."


With a casual motion, he threw the card into the trash.



Daniela's expression darkened. "He gave that card to me. What gives you the right to make decisions on my behalf?"


Alexander's brow furrowed, his expression barely controlled. "I'm just looking out for you." Daniela's face twisted into a look of distaste, and Alexander trailed behind her, asking, "Why don't you believe I'm looking out for you?"


Daniela coolly sipped her juice, her eyes glancing at the time.


"These events might be dull, but they're great for making connections," Alexander continued. "If you're not having fun, we can go somewhere better afterward."


Daniela remained indifferent, too disinterested to respond.


Alexander caught the resistance in her eyes,tightened his lips, and fell silent.


Daniela sat on the couch, letting time pass by.With Alexander looming nearby, like a dark cloud, no one dared come near her.


Just as Daniela was about to get up and leave,Alexander spoke up. "Look, Leandro's girlfriend is picking him up again. They look so close now, but he'll dump her the first thing when the money starts rolling in."


Daniela looked over.


Leandro was being helped into a car by a slightly chubby woman in a black dress. She shut the door and quickly made her way to the driver's side.


"That woman is so ordinary. Apart from being strong,I can't think of anything else that stands out about her. Daniela, you know why men go for practical women when they're building something? It's because only those kinds of women will stick with you when times get tough. Trust me, with Leandro's ambition, it won't take long before he moves on to a new girlfriend," Alexander said with a smug smile."I've never been wrong about people."


Daniela glanced at him briefly before breaking into a smile, her expression carrying a hint of sarcasm.


Alexander sensed it wasn't a compliment, but his curiosity got the best of him. "Why are you smiling?"


Daniela responded, "I'm really impressed." Alexander, assuming it was praise, opened his mouth to offer a polite reply-but before he could, Daniela added, "You're unbelievable! Jerk!"
###Chapter 123 A Chance





Daniela emerged from the building and noticed Ryan and Lillian at the entrance, their faces clouded with discontent.


Cedric, wearing a grin, strolled up to her.


Caught by the sight of the pair who looked as rigid as statues, Daniela raised an eyebrow at Cedric and queried, "What's up with them?"


Suppressing a chuckle, Cedric shrugged nonchalantly. "Oh, them? Just two goofballs."


They had barely resumed their drive when the driver turned towards Daniela wvith a concerned expression."| think we're being followed."


Glancing behind, Daniela's eyes quickly identified Alexander's car, a vehicle she knew all too well from days filled with unrequited affection.


The mere glimpse of his car used to send her heart into joyful flips.


With an air of cool indifference, Daniela remarked,"Just pay him no mind."


"Need me to take care of it?" Cedric offered.


"There's no need," Daniela stated firmly/. "Don't waste your energy on him."


Alexander persisted in his pursuit all the way to Elite Lux.



Upon their arrival, he burst from his car, urgency etched on his face. "Daniela, we need to speak."


Offering a brief nod, Daniela replied, "Alright, get on with it."


With a sharp glance at Cedric, Alexander silently conveyed his desire for him to leave.


Cedric glanced at Daniela, who stated crisply,are you going to speak up or not? Because if you aren't, I'm heading back inside."


Daniela's tolerance for Alexander was wearing thin. "Yes," Alexander responded, his voice tinged with unease. As Daniela pivoted to leave, he reached out,grasping her arm. "Daniela, you can't have it both ways-spending time with Cedric while you're seeing me."
Her expression turned to one of surprise at his accusation.
"First off, whatever's happening between Cedric and me isn't your damn concern. And Alexander, wvhat makes you think I'm seeing you? Besides, do you honestly think you're someoneI'd consider?"
With a sour expression, Alexander shot back, "You once told me I could treat you well."
Daniela arched an eyebrow, her laugh echoing with derision. "You're really adept at embarrassing yourself. I told you that you could be kind, and that as an adult, you're responsible for your own actions.I have no interest in managing your fantasies. Don't let your imagination get the better of you-it will only lead to disappointment. And weren't you completely smitten with Joyce? You divorced me to be with her. can't fathom why, now that you're both unattached,you aren't pursuing her. Why come here to hassle me in the dead of night? Tell me, why is that?"


Her voice dripped with scorn and mockery, each word more pointed than the last.


Alexander paused, his fists clenched, a surge of frustration building within him. "I don't care for Joyce anymore. Daniela, would you ever think about giving me a shot?"



Daniela let out a soft chuckle, clearly entertained."It's not entirely out of the question."


As soon as the words left her mouth, Cedric's eyes narrowed, a sharp contraction of his pupils betraying his shock. He swiveled his head to gaze at Daniela.


Ecstatic, Alexander couldn't contain himself and blurted out, "You mean it?" Bursting with enthusiasm, he moved forward, nudging Cedric aside without a second thought. "Daniela, is this true? You actually want to be with me?"


With a faint, almnost bitter smile, Daniela tilted her head slightly. "After all the time l've spent pursuing you, it would be a waste if I didn't at least consider your change of heart, wouldn't it?"


Her expression remained impassive as Alexander,brimming with joy, eagerly agreed, "Yes, exactly!"


Meanwhile, Lillian and Ryan observed from the sidelines, their faces mirroring their confusion.



Cedric, usually so composed and astute, stood a short distance away, his hands balling into fists.


Under normal circumstances, he might have discerned the lack of sincerity in Daniela's smile and realized the truth behind her words.



However, overwhelmed by emotion, he was far from his usual calm self.


A crushing weight settled in his chest, his mind spinning in chaos.


"Daniela, I swear I have no feelings for Joyce anymore.If you doubt me, I'll prove it to you right now." Not bothering to think twice, Alexander hastily dialed Joyce's number, eagerly setting his phone to speaker as it began to ring.
###Chapter 124 Setup





The call from Alexander caught Joyce off guard, yet her voice brimmed with an unexpected happiness when she picked up. "Alexander, is this a surprise call to say you've reconsidered? Ready to mnarry me at last? You know, my mom mentioned that marrying me comes with the Harper family's fortune. Of all the suitors, you've always been my top pick."


Alexander barely had a chance to reply before the phone was abruptly passed to someone else.


Katrina's voice, firm and calculating, filled the line."Alexander, did you finally come to your senses?I always knew you were the clever one. Here's the deal -I hold the reins to the Harper family. Marry Joyce,and all that wealth could be yours."


"No." Alexander's voice was steady,his gaze fixed on Daniela as he spoke. "I called to make it clear-I will not marry Joyce. Not now, not at my father's behest.I've realized that my heart still belongs to Daniela, and I've chosen to be with her."
Not giving Katrina a chance to react, he ended the call with a swift tap.
Ignoring the insistent buzz of Katrina's callbacks,Alexander turned to Daniela, his expression earnest."I've made my stance clear to them, Daniela. Is it finally our time to be together?"
Daniela's lips curved into a grin as she remarked,"Alexander, you really went all out, didn't you? Ionly said I'd think about it, not that it was a done deal.Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?"
Alexander was aware that Daniela had only agreed to consider his proposal.
His impatience was getting the better of him. He believed that settling things quickly would be more efficient, particularly with Cedric hovering nearby, a constant threat to his peace of mind.
"We've known each other for years. Is there really anything left to ponder?" he implored, his eyes scanning her expressive face, his heart fluttering with hope.



Daniela let out a derisive chuckle. "You've known Joyce for ages too, yet you didn't hesitate to cut her off just moments ago."


"I was just..." he stuttered, searching for the right words.



Daniela's smile grew sharp. "No need to spell it out.I get it. You're the type who looks at the grand scheme of things. There's no need for excuses with me."


With those words, Alexander felt a weight lift off his shoulders. This was promising. Daniela was beginning to see things from his angle. It wouldn't be long before she returned to being the woman who had always supported him.


"Daniela, I miss the way you used to be-generous,gentle, and considerate,"he admitted.



Daniela's laughter rang out again, light and carefree.She was generous,indeed-turning a blind eye while he shamelessly flirted with her stepsister. Her gentleness was undeniable, always attentive to whatever Alexander had to say. She was undeniably considerate-obedient to a fault and painfully naive.
Of course, he liked such a fool woman.
"So, are you telling me that my power, status, or wealth don't matter to you?" Daniela queried, her gaze piercing into Alexander's soul.
With a firm shake of his head, Alexander responded,"How could those superficial things be the reasons I cherish you? Daniela, believe me, my desire to be with you now is sincere."
Daniela's expression softened as she nodded in agreement. "I'm relieved to hear that. I, too, prefer that my wealth doesn't entangle with my future partner. Genuine relationships shouldn't sprout from personal gain."
Just a moment before, Alexander was brimming with vigor. Now, his face registered shock, as if struck by lightning.
He questioned his own ears, wondering if they had deceived him.
Attempting a smile, he managed only a tense grimace, his eyes locked on Daniela's. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 125 He Didn't Have Proof





Daniela declared with a smile, "I've made my stance clear. I don't like entangling emotions with interests.Imagine us, intertwined as lovers and yet adversaries in business, whispering endearments in solitude and clashing vehemently at work-it would just rip me apart."



Her smile was there, yet her eyes betrayed no trace of warmth.



With an almost mocking sweetness, she glanced at Alexander. "I yearn for a relationship that remains untainted.Is that too much to hope for?"



Her question, profound and stirring, left Alexander utterly speechless.


He stood, bewildered, realizing for the first time the depth of Daniela's reservations.


Could it really be that she harbored such thoughts? Nearby, Cedric was rooted to the spot, equally taken aback by the revelation.


Alexander, though hesitant, wasn't ready to let go.Everything had been aligning perfectly; how could it crumble so unexpectedly?


Struggling to keep his voice steady, he questioned,11SO1what you're saying is, if I want a chance with you, I need to stay away from the project of the South and East Districts?"


Daniela nodded, her smile turning cunning. "Yes,and it's not limited to that. Any endeavor tied to Elite Lux is off-limits for Bennett Group. Moreover, should there be any competition between us, you must quit.After all, if you're pursuing me, competing against me for projects wouldn't be proper, would it? But let's be honest-even if you did try to compete,you wouldn't stand a chance. I prefer to state this upfront to spare youany embarrassment."


Daniela leaned forward slightly and explained, "Elite Lux has scaled back its ventures recently, focusing only on luxury goods, construction, education, tourism, aerospace, and a bit of high-tech involvement."
Alexander's eyes widened, a clear sign of his astonishment. "Doesn't that complicate matters for me? So, are you saying I should just shut down Bennett Group entirely?"
"Absolutely," Daniela replied, her grin brimming with cheerfulness. "Didn't my parents do just that back in their day? It was quite the role reversal. Ultimately,they still had me."
Daniela's gaze turned distant, tinged with nostalgia."That way, a man is less likely to wander. How perfect! I've always yearned for that kind of life. I vowed when I was little that if a man ever cooked for me, I'd marry him right away!"
Her heart swirled with sarcasm, yet her expression remained utterly sincere.
Her eyes sparkled with a glimmer of hope as she pressed on. "Do you think you can handle that,Alexander?"
Alexander felt a pang of despair. "Wouldn't that reduce me to a man who lives off a woman? In our circles, that's just pathetic."
"Is that so? A man who would go to such lengths for love is truly praiseworthy, isn't it? That's exactly the kind of devotion I'm looking for!" Daniela exclaimed with conviction.
Alexander's chuckle was hollow, devoid of real amusement. "You never expected this from me before." Alexander was not ready to surrender.He gazed up at the imposing structure before him. Its majesty and grandeur were undeniable.

"I did before," Daniela lied. "It's just that we hadn't reached this point back then."

Alexander was taken back.
Daniela went on, "Moreover, I've secured my assets with legal ties. If something were to happen to me in the future, I could leave you one percent of my assets. That's hardly insignificant; that one percent could be worth over a billion." himself at a loss for words. Legal ties? But Daniela appeared in perfect health. When would she even need such provisions?
Seeing the shock on Alexander's face, Daniela's smile was tinged with irony. "This is a serious discussion. Why not go home and talk it over with your father? I can wait."
She offered one last piece of advice with feigned kindness. "I'm tied up these days. If you agree, you won't need to attend Elite Lux's bid the day after tomorrow. Well, that's all. I'm off to bed."
With that, Daniela turned on her heel,leaving Alexander no chance to reply as she strode away with an air of triumph.
Alexander remained, filled with suspicion that Daniela might boe messing around with him, yet he didn't have proof.
###Chapter 126 Can't Do Math
Ryan and Lillian observed Alexander's emotions surge and plummet dramatically, much like a rollercoaster-an amusing spectacle to them.
Cedric's brow furrowed deeply, his face etched with a somber expression as he trailed behind Daniela into the room.
While he maintained a stoic exterior, the storm raging within him mirrored Alexander's own distress.
Had he been aware beforehand, he would have steered clear of any involvement with Elite Lux's ventures.
The idea of being a stay-at-home husband, once a concept he dismissed with a scoff, now seemed an unattainable dream.
Taking a deep breath to ease the constriction in his chest, Cedric felt a mixture of frustration and despair after dropping Daniela off at her house. As she began to close the door, Cedric placed his
hand against it, halting its movement.
Daniela gazed at Cedric, her expression filled with bewilderment. "What's the matter?"
Cedric implored, "Daniela, listen-| was involved in the North District project, but I'm not the legal representative. I'm not profiting from it. To date, I haven't received a dime. We're doingthis as a pro bono endeavor, purely out of goodwill. Is that something you can accept?"
Daniela blinked, taken aback. "Didn't I tell you that the profits would be calculated and distributed to everyone eventually?"
"No, that's not it at all!"
"What?" Daniela's face clouded with confusion.
"It's purely a pro bono endeavor. Honestly, we're not after any profit at all! And the project in the South and East Districts? It's entirely for charity too! Our company aims to bolster its image by engaging in these community service projects. Let's make this clear; please, linsist,no money!" Cedric walked away, a throbbing headache beginning to form. Phillips Group was rolling in wealth. How on earth was he meant to spend all this cash? And if he handed it all over to Daniela, would she even take it?
As the elevator doors slid open, Lillian and Ryan emerged. Cedric fixed them with a grave look and ventured, "Do you reckon if I offered Daniela Phillips Group, myself included as part of the package, she'd take it?"
Lillian's brows furrowed as she squinted slightly."Wait, what did you just say?"
Ryan shook his head. "I'm pretty sure her advice is to get your head checked first."
Cedric found himself at a loss for words.
The following day, the North District project transitioned into its concluding settlement phase.
The finance teams from both corporations exchanged looks of bewildered resignation. <###Chapter 126 Can't Do Math                             +120 Points at most
Lucian Chavez, the finance director at Elite Lux,queried, "Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bradley, are you implying that for this partnership, we should treat all construction expenses as charitable donations?Could such a generous arrangement really exist? Is that your final decision? To forfeit hundreds of billions?"
The twisted rationale of the elite left him utterly dumbfounded.
Tyler, the legal counsel, also gazed at Cedric, his expression one of bewildered curiosity.
From its inception, Cedric had been a key investor in the company, holding the reins over Elite LuX's ventures. His leadership had recently culminated in a windfall of profits for him.
Despite attempts to understand his strategies, they remained a mystery to many, including Tyler.
When the accountant at Tyler'sfirm scrutinized the expenses reflected in their ledger, a series of zeroes stretched before him like a road to ruin, ushering in a throbbing headache. Could this deal drive the company into bankruptcy?
Elite Lux's finance team had initially been confident in their ability to negotiate the terms of the agreement. Yet, they found themselves at a loss, as the opposing party disregarded the usual protocols.
"Are you actually forfeiting tens of billions in project funds?" Lucian massaged his temples, trying to find clarity in the chaos.
Tyler glanced at Cedric for confirmation, receiving a nod in return.
Mirroring the gesture, Tyler also nodded.
A flicker of thrill crossed Lucian's features.
They were set to rake in tens of billions, and no catch whatsoever?
"Then are there any stipulations? Perhaps terms for future partnerships with Elite Lux?" he suggested tentatively.
"No, there won't be any future collaborations!"Cedric's tone was firm, leaving no room for  argument. Lucian was utterly bewildered, unsure of how to respond. He couldn't hold back and questioned,"What exactly are you trying to get?"
Tyler, equally baffled, turned to Cedric and echoed,"What do you even want from this?"
Cedric shook his head, brushing off any argument."There's no point explaining. Just sign the settlement and be done with it."
The scene unfolded with a surreal air that made Lucian tread carefully. "Hold on, let me get in touch with our boss," he announced before stepping away momentarily.
Daniela was in a meeting, pressing down on the documents on the table. Lucian returned with the phone and gave it to Cedric. Daniela asked in exasperation, "Cedric, what are you up to?"
Cedric replied, "Like I mentioned yesterday, I'm engaged in charity work." Daniela sighed, a flicker of frustration crossing her face. "We do not entertain charitable sponsorships here. Please, pass the phone to someone from our finance team." Complying without a word, Cedric handed over the phone.
After Daniela's brief exchange, the line went dead,and Lucian's expression morphed into one of sheer confusion. "Our boss just crunched some numbers and based on our market profit share, your net gain from this transaction would be around 10.3 billion.We've decided to round it up to 11 billion."
Before Cedric could respond, Tyler's accountant leaped to his feet, equally stunned. "Excuse me? Did I hear that right? From 10.3 to 11 billion?"
The suggestion to bump the figure by a staggering 700 million sparked disbelief.
That decision defied all logic!
Was it Cedric or Daniela who deemed math meaningless in the world of extreme wealth?
###Chapter 127 Money Or Her

The finance director of Elite Lux felt as though the other party was treating him like he was foolish.
Still, he had double-checked with Daniela several times, and she insisted, "$10.3 billion, round it up to $11 billion!"
Cedric felt like all hope was gone. It wasn't just the $11 billion; it felt as though Daniela was using money to push him away.
"Mr. Phillips, are you going to sign this final statement?"

"No,I won't."
The director of Elite Lux felt as though he was trying to please someone who didn't care, offering something that wasn't even desired.

In the end, the deal fell apart. After the meeting, Daniela reached out to Cedric, but
he didn't bother answering. She found it oddly amusing.
Lillian watched the entire scene unfold with interest.She trailed Daniela into the office and asked, "You mentioned yesterday you'd give Alexander a chance to pursue you. Was that serious?"
At those words, Daniela shot a glance at Lillian. "Am I out of my mind? Why would I ever get involved with Alexander again?"
Lillian pushed further, "Then what about last night?"
"He's always picking on me, acting like I'm a pushover!" Daniela replied.
Lillian laughed. "So, mixing business and personal feelings doesn't bother you? Don't you like how your parents managed their relationship?"
"It doesn't," Daniela said bluntly. "A healthy relationship requires both people to manage it, but mixing it with business can cause a lot of complications, so it's better to steer clear. Of course, it all depends on the couple themselves.Why are you asking this all of a sudden, Lillian? Are you about to confess your feelings to Ryan?" As soon as Lillian heard that, she quickly ended the call in her pocket and started coughing uncontrollably. Her face turned bright red as she exclaimed, "What are you talking about?"
Embarrassed, Lillian hurried out of the room, only to return moments later, warning, "Don't you dare spread any rumors!"
Daniela shook her head with a grin and returned to her work.
Meanwhile, Alexander was in a full-on panic.
He was certain Daniela was finally ready to reconsider their relationship.
He had even planned that once she said yes, he'd propose right away.
That way, all of Daniela's wealth would become his.
But just when he thought he had everything lined up, she dropped the bombshell that she'd already completed a property notarization.


To make matters worse, he was now barred from taking part in any of Elite Lux's projects.


What could he possibly do now?


If he walked away now, it would make him seem like he was only after her wealth, and that would be humiliating.



So he decided to keep his cool with Daniela.


But it felt like she was toying with him, knowing he wouldn't dare agree, yet she still bombarded him with three messages a day asking about it.


Now,he was completely at a loss.


Responding felt like a problem, but staying silent was just as tricky.


He found himself stuck in an unresolvable dilemma.


With Elite Lux's upcoming bidding looming,Alexander's anxiety reached a peak. His stress was so overwhelming that it caused painful mouth ulcers, making it hard for him to speak properly. "Dad, what do you think we should do? Should we go for the bidding?"
Attending the bidding would mean abandoning the commitment he had made earlier.
But if they skipped it, how could he live with missing out on a project worth billions?
Richard balled his fists in frustration, struggling to make a hard choice. He looked at Alexander and asked, "Did Daniela leave any opening for negotiation in what she said?"
Alexander paused for a moment, then shook his head. "No, she was pretty clear. She said what she needed to, then walked out, telling me to think it over on my own. She also mentioned how she admired the way her parents balanced things-her dad taking care of the home while her mom ran the business."

Richard's grip tightened even further. His gaze cut through Alexander like a sharp knife. "So, she's really forcing you to choose, huh? Do you care more about the money or her?"
###Chapter 128 Alexander's Choice





Richard narrowed his eyes. "Don't hold back. Just be straight with me."


Life with Daniela meant a future dripping with opulence and affluence, yet it demanded a sacrifice of his own moral compass.


"Go down this road, and you'll be just another spineless lapdog, like those pathetic losers drooling over Daniela-gutless and the butt of everyone's jokes. Yet, behind the facade of derision, life would be sweet. Moreover, when she's gone, even a tiny slice of her fortune would ensure you live in luxury,much like Caiden did," Richard muttered. "But if you're the one to die first, everything you've done will be meaningless."


He fixed his gaze on Alexander, his expression serious. "This one's on you. Only you can decide. If you want to be with Daniela, remember, Bennett Group will be relegated to a life of modesty." Society often viewed a man dependent on a woman's wealth as devoid of independence and drive.
Richard muttered a string of curses under his breath,seething at Daniela's heartless, manipulative bullshit.Yet, the allure of inheriting tens of billions was no trivial matter.
It was the kind of temptation that could break even the strongest resolve.
With a troubled frown, Richard rubbed his hands together and turned away.
His chance encounter with Daniela while shopping was unexpected.
In days gone by, Richard would haughtily await Daniela's lavish praises.
Now, the sight of Daniela, a vision of sophistication in her designer clothes and shimmering pearl earrings,made his heart skip a beat in apprehension, debating whether to approach and offer flattering words.
Whispers swirled that Daniela's unassuming pearlearrings alone boasted a value exceeding eighty million.
Richard mustered a smile, preparing to exchange pleasantries with Daniela.
But she breezed right past him without a sideways glance, her entourage of mall staff in tow,rendering him, her former father-in-law, utterly invisible.
A shadow of displeasure crossed Richard's face instantly.
Was Daniela considering a reconciliation with Alexander? It seemed quite the contrary; she appeared to want nothing to do with him.
Yet, Richard couldn't help but ponder-if Alexander were to marry into the Harper family, he'd become one of them. How would he maintain his pride when interacting with Daniela? Would he be forced to greet her with a smile only to be snubbed?
This thought sent a shiver through Richard,hastening his steps towards home. Meanwhile, Daniela continued her tour of the store.Lillian cast a glance her way, curiosity tinged her voice. "Daniela, didn't you notice Richard back there?"
"Yeah," Daniela responded with a dismissive shrug.
Lillian nodded, a trace of relief in her tone. "Looks like you've finally snapped out of that obsession.
She had feared Daniela might approach Richard,addressing him with undue reverence.
The mere thought had left her anxious.
With a light chuckle, Daniela brushed off the concern.

Lillian pressed on, her voice laced with intrigue."If Alexander sacrifices his dignity and chooses to be with you, would you truly accept him?"
As Daniela surveyed the store, she shook her head and declared, "No."
Lillian turned to her with a puzzled look. "Why not?" Daniela responded, "Alexander will never relinquish control of Bennett Group. His pride wouldn't allow it.He can't stand the thought of the gossip that would follow if he married into another family to save face.His pride, believe it or not, outweighs his own interests. Even if he were to agree, it'd be because he harbors some hope that l'd pass away soon,allowing him to inherit everything. If he doesn't marry me, he gains nothing from the deal. He's not the type to take such a risk."
Over the years, Daniela had pieced together the essence of Alexander's character.
She recognized his egotism, his aloofness, and the way he masqueraded as a man of virtue while his actions were guided solely by self-interest.
He was a master at playing the part of the stoic,immovable hero.
"Just you wat," Daniela asserted with a hint of certainty. "Alexander will most certainly make an appearance at the bidding." On the day of the bidding, as Daniela and Lillian entered the venue, there was no sign of Alexander yet. However, Cedric was unexpectedly present.


Raising an eyebrow, Lillian queried, "I thought you were determined to stay out of this?"


The last time Daniela had paid him for the project,Cedric had been visibly mortified for days.


"I'm not here to participate. I'm merely here to observe, to set my mind at ease," Cedric replied,seated beside Daniela. "Leave it to me, Daniela.I'l supervise for free. I do have the experience, after all."


Daniela shot back, "Cedric, is watching others get rich your weird little kink? I offered you this job once,and you declined. Now you show up offering to supervise for free? What are you playing at?"


With a warm smile, Cedric extended a thermos towards Daniela. "Skip the mineral water today; it's chilly out. Have something warm instead."


His thoughtful actions almost painted him as a nurturing figure, sparking the question of why he'd fuss over such small details.
Feeling parched, Daniela gratefully took a few sips from the thermos.
As the bidding meeting commenced, Daniela confidently stepped onto the stage to address the gathering. However, her attention was diverted as a figure slipped through the entrance.
The newcomer, with head bowed and shoulders hunched, quietly made their way to the last row and seated themselves discreetly.
Daniela's gaze turned to Lillian.
Catching Daniela's look, Lillian glanced back and recognized the latecomer as Alexander.
A sense of defeat washed over her. Betting against Daniela had been a terrible call, and now she was stuck owing her ten grand.
With a heavy heart, Lillian transferred the money to Daniela, her mood visibly dampened as she slumped back in her chair. Maynard Group and Phillips Group had unexpectedly pulled out of the running, leaving two lucrative construction sites available. The potential profits were so immense; everyone's eyes were on the prize,dreaming of securing a fortune that could sustain their families for generations to come.
Seated among the audience, Alexander's determination hardened as Daniela declared the integration of the construction of the two pieces of land into a single project.
In his view, nothing could rival the allureof wealth.
Clutching his pen, his resolve was palpable.

###Chapter 129 Less Confident
Bennett Group, known for its formidable strength and prowess, stood second only to Cedric's enterprise.Alexander harbored no doubts-this project was meant for him, his ticket to a triumphant future.
The inner turmoil faded away, leaving behind nothing but cold, unyielding resolve.
Under the shimmering lights, Daniela's beauty captivated him anew. Alexander pondered that once he secured the project and its lucrative rewards,it was time to talk to Daniela.
She had given him a second chance before, and she'd probably do it again-she was practically obsessed with him, after all.
On the stage, Daniela's gaze swept over the crowd,landing briefly on Alexander, whose ambition seemed almost tangible.
A subtle smile played on her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, maintaining her poise as she resumed her address.
When Alexander approached Lillian to collect his copy of the bidding documents, he met with a moment's hesitation.
Confusion flickered across Alexander's face.
It wasn't Daniela's potential financial loss that bothered Lillian; rather, she found Alexander's brazen opportunism distasteful.
Alexander had to tug sharply to liberate the documents from Lillian's firm grasp.
The bidding was set for the morning.
Each competing firm would fill in its bid, and the project would be awarded to the lowest adequate offer.
They had meticulously prepared their cost estimates,aware that this was their sole opportunity to submit their bid.

At lunchtime, Elite Lux hosted a lavish buffet free of charge, yet none of the executives had the appetite to partake. Their minds were elsewhere, deeply engaged with their finance teams, laboring over the precise figures to submit on their bid forms later that day.


Alexander felt a surge of confidence in his company's calculations. After quickly finishing his meal, he made his way upstairs to meet with Daniela.


However, as he approached the elevator, a security guard stepped in his path, blocking the way.


"I need to see Daniela," Alexander insisted firmly.


The guard remained unmoved, his expression apologetic yet resolute. "I'm sorry, but Ms. Harper is currently on her lunch break and is not accepting any visitors. Additionally, to maintain fairness, she is not meeting with representatives from any bidding companies during this period. Are you by chance involved in the bids this afternoon?"


If Alexander was involved in the bidding, he would be denied any contact with Daniela. Alexander was well aware of the rules, but his dire situation left him with only one option-go to Daniela.


It wasn't just about him. This was for his family, for the livelihood of thousands of employees, and to live up to Richard's expectations.


He hoped Daniela would understand his position,allowing him to proceed to the afternoon's bid without any lingering doubts.


"Please, I need to speak with Daniela for a moment.It's a personal matter, unrelated to today's bidding."


"She's not available to meet," the guard stated firmly.


As Alexander made a move to bypass him,the guard didn't hesitate to summon reinforcement. "Lillian,could you please come down here? There's someone named Mr. Bennett here, and he won't take no for an answer-he wants to see Ms. Harper now."


Lillian's irritation was palpable the moment she got the message.


Without a moment's delay, she descended the stairs to confront Alexander. Her voice was icy as she addressed him. "What's so important that it can't wait? Why must your concerns always disrupt our peace? Can't you see everyone else deserves a lunch break? Do you really think you're so significant that the world must pause at your whim? It's frankly embarrassing, Alexander.Aren't you supposed to be more mature than this?"
Despite the sharp sting of her words, Alexander remained steady and composed. "Lillian, I realize you have your grievances with me, but this is urgent and only involves Daniela. I assure you, it has nothing to do with the bidding. May I please speak with her upstairs?"
His voice carried a sincerity that seemed more profound than usual.
Yet, Lillian perceived him merely as a man blinded by the lure of profit. Elevating her voice deliberately, she challenged him. "If this has nothing to do with the bid, why are you so hell-bent on meeting her right now?" Her words boomed across the cafeteria, capturing the attention of the other executives who were awaiting the afternoon's bidding session.


Lillian, intent on creating a spectacle, pressed on."And what's more, how can we be sure you're not planning to lean on your past relationship to influence or bribe my boss once you're behind closed doors? Are you looking for an unfair advantage-a shortcut, perhaps? That hardly seems just to the rest of us, diligently preparing our proposals. Alexander, choose the honorable route and abandon these shortcuts! Everyone else deserves a fair chance at this project, too. Why should Elite Lux favor you exclusively? What makes you so exceptional?"


At her provocation, several business owners rose,their gestures accusatory as they pointed at Alexander. "That's right. We all agreed-no meetings with Ms. Harper before the official session. It maintains fairness. How could you disregard the rules?"


"Indeed. You already have an advantage knowing Ms. Harper. Why isn't that good enough for you?"


"Let's progress together in this industry. Allowing one entity to dominate isn't just. Let's uphold equity and collective advancement."


"You're suggesting this isn't about the bid,but we all know there's more to it. You might be scheming something sinister. The Bennett family has a reputation for playing dirty to secure a contract."


With a fortune on the line, tensions were sky-high.No one was willing to back down or risk being outbid.


A minor concession for goodwill was manageable,but on a billion-dollar deal? No one was eager to absorb such a hit.



Voices escalated, clashing in the room, their pointed accusations giving Alexander no chance to defend himself.


Defeated, he withdrew to his seat, his expression one of sheer frustration. He worried Daniela might misread his intentions. Since their divorce, his place in her life had felt increasingly shaky.
Yet, he was resolute in seeking a moment alone with her. He needed to unload the burdens weighing heavily on his heart.
###Chapter 130 Alexander's Heart Was In Turmoil
Daniela was on her way downstairs after lunch break when the abrupt buzz of her phone halted her mid-step.


She mentioned the interruption to Lillian before stepping outside to answer the call.


As she greeted the caller with a crisp "Hello," a series of footsteps resounded behind her.


When she turned and saw Alexander approaching,the pieces clicked intoplace instantly.


"You've really outdone yourself. A whole new phone number just to reach me before the bidding? Truly impressive."


Alexander caught the icy edge in Daniela's eyes as she scrutinized him.


With the bidding meeting looming, he felt a surge of urgency. "Let me explain, Daniela."
Daniela's calm demeanor remained intact as she offered a small nod. "Fine, go ahead."
In Alexander's memories, Daniela was always the sensitive young woman who felt neglected by his inattention.
However, the woman standing before him now was a stark contrast to his memories. Clad in a sharp business suit, her hair slicked back into a neat bun,she radiated the authority of a seasoned CEO.
Her gaze was cool, detached, as she awaited his forthcoming stumble of words.
In that moment, as Alexander faced her, a wave of discomfort washed over him.
Daniela, once familiar and close, now seemed like a stranger, her distance palpable and chilling.
"Weren't you going to explain?" Daniela pressed on,her voice tinged with casual indifference.
Her curiosity was piqued; she was eager to uncover  the kind of elaborate excuses Alexander might unveil.


Just as anticipated, the words started flowing from him.


"Daniela, I realize my visit today might unsettle you,but I can't stand the thought of becoming just another insignificant nobody. Moreover, I believe you're not merely an echo of your father-you possess your own vision, your own strengths, your own dignity. How could you possibly be content with your future partner relegated to a mere househusband? Come on, you're underestimating me and yourself."


His words flowed with a passionate intensity, nearly swaying Daniela's initial skepticism.


Seeing her stunned expression, Alexander felt a surge of hope and continued, "Daniela, I understand you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're not someone who craves power. You may appear strong and decisive now, but I know deep down, you still long to be a little girl."


His statement was capable of thawing the resolve of  any woman, regardless of age.


Internally, Daniela couldn't help but admire the performance. Incredible! What a display of eloquence!


Alexander continued, "That's precisely why I'm here today. I'm asking for a chance to stand by your side.I envision a future where, when people look at us, they won't dismiss me as unworthy. Instead, they'll see us as a perfect couple, affirming that your choice was impeccable!"


With a definitive nod, he concluded, "Trust me,Daniela. Let me take the lead on the project.promise, I'll execute it brilliantly!"


His eyes shone with a mixture of hope and determination, waiting eagerly for her response.


Daniela found his silliness almost too much to bear.Yet, since he seemed determined to underestimate her,she felt compelled to play along.


Her lips twisted into a wry smile as she met Alexander's hopeful gaze and replied with a note of sorrow, "Is that really what you believe? If that's the case, it's clear we're not meant to be."


"What?" Alexander's voice cracked slightly as he blinked at Daniela, his expression a mix of shock and confusion. "What did you just say?"


"What I desire is worlds apart from what you pursue.I yearn for someone who values kindness,thoughtfulness, and puts family above the pursuit of riches. When people look at us, they shouldn't see us as the 'perfect couple' Instead, they should be saying, 'Wow! She really knows how to manage him!'"


Stunned and unsure, Alexander could only stand there, struggling to process.


He had meticulously followed his psychology instructor's guidance, so why was it failing him now?


Everything seemed off.


"Moreover, I'm already financially secure. What use do I have for someone who's just chasing more wealth? There's no charm in that." "But..." Alexander's voice faltered, his hands clenching at his sides. "Weren't you always in love with me? How can you just change like that? Daniela,this must be some kind of joke,right?"


Daniela gave a small, sad nod. "I did love you, but since I realized they were unrequited, I forced myself to move on."



Alexander's mind reeled. No! The way things were before was perfect!


"So, you're saying you chose wealth over what we had?" she asked, her voice laced with a mix of disbelief and sorrow.


Just as Alexander opened his mouth to protest,Daniela, her face crumpling with anguish, raised her hand to stop him. "No, please don't. I think I already know your answer."


At that moment, a storm of regret and despair swirled within Alexander.


For the first time, he felt utterly defeated. He had failed Daniela not just once, but twice now.


Watching her walk away, her shoulders slumped and her steps heavy, Alexander was consumed with self-reproach.


He wanted to slap himself until his face stung for being so damn clueless.
###Chapter 131| Think Alexander Still Loves Me

As Alexander stepped into the conference hall, his eyes immediately caught Daniela signaling something subtle to Lillian.
Moments later, Lillian spun around and shot Alexander an icy, hostile glare.
Confused by her reaction, Alexander wondered what he could have done to spark such hostility. When Lillian faced him, he offered a polite nod, but her response was a just scornful smirk. "You really have a knack for disappointing everyone, don't you?"
The bidding session commenced without further delay.
Alexander, preoccupied with his personal turmoil,found it hard to focus and respond to each bid effectively. After several rounds, he had failed to secure any significant contracts. Ultimately, he settled for a minor project with barely any profit to show for it.


At that moment, he caught Daniela sending yet another signal to Lillian.


It was then that the realization hit Alexander-he'd been set up.


He remained seated in the audience, a bitter taste of defeat settling in. The bidding was done, and there was no turning back.


Nearby, those who once envied Alexander's perceived closeness to Daniela began to snicker discreetly.


"I thought he was someone important. Turns out,he's all bark and no bite!"


"Exactly! Acting like he's close to Ms. Harper, but she barely spares him a glance."


"He always acted so high and mighty. Who was he trying to fool?" "Can you believe the nerve? Showing up at his ex-wife's event! I heard he got tangled up with Ms.Harper's stepsister, and that's why she left him.Apparently, he treated her terribly until he realized how rich she'd become!"
"No way! I thought he had integrity and pride. Turns out, he's just another gold digger."
"Hell yes! All polished and proper, but probably just trying to approach Ms. Harper for her wealth."
"This bidding just knocked the Bennett family off their pedestal in Olisvine's construction world.Serves them right."
The crowd burst into laughter, their voices echoing around him.
Alexander's fists tightened at his sides as he fixed his glare on Daniela, who walked past him with an air of composure, her steps steady and deliberate. His voice dropped to an icy, measured tone as hespoke."I used to carry guilt for the way I treated you. l wanted to make things right. But I never imagined you'd twist my regret to your advantage in this bidding and make a fool of me. Daniela, from this moment on, we're square!"


Daniela's lips curved into a faint, almost disdainful smile. Her voice carried the same chill as her expression. "Don't overestimate your importance.I was in a good mood after a nap and decided to have a little fun with someone oblivious. If your skills fell short, don't blame me for it. Are you really so easily influenced? Perhaps you're just not cut out for handling greater challenges."


Turning to leave, she suddenly stopped, throwing an amused glance over her shoulder. "If you're truly as principled as you claim, you wouldn't have gone for that minor project. You'd cut ties entirely-with me and Elite Lux. So, what's it going to be? Are you backing out now? The ink isn't dry yet; you still have a chance."


Alexander gripped the documents in his hand tightly,feeling the sting of Daniela's words strike at his pride. He wanted to fire back but found himself unable to utter a single word in response. All he could do was watch as Daniela, her mocking smile lingering, walked away without looking back.


That day, Alexander experienced a level of humiliation unlike anything he'd ever felt before.


Aimlessly drifting out of Elite Lux, Alexander bumped into Richard, who greeted him with the eager energy of someone picking up their kid from school. "So?Did Daniela give you the project?"


Alexander shook his head, his expression steeped in defeat.



"Why not? Didn't you say she gave you two options?If you didn't choose her, shouldn't she havehanded you the contract as the logical outcome?"


Alexander looked up at the towering structure before him and let out a bitter laugh. "This was never about a choice. She just wanted to humiliate me. She still holds a grudge. Daniela, your heart must be made of stone."

 
That night, Alexander was overcome by a severe fever. After hours on an IV drip, he eventually began to recover.
Following the ordeal, he allowed his hair to grow out,adopting an increasingly somber and withdrawn demeanor.
While working on various construction sites,Alexander occasionally caught sight of Daniela. But he never attempted to approach her again.
Instead, he maintained his distance and observed her with a cold, detached expression.
Over time, he found himself spending more and more time with the Harper family, particularly growing closer to Katrina and Joyce.
On bright, sunny afternoons, his gaze often drifted to Joyce's growing belly. One day, he asked, "So,when's the baby coming? Have you decided on the hospital and doctor yet?"
He went as far as arranging for a top-notch medical team to admit Joyce into the hospital an entire month before her due date. Relaxing in her hospital bed the other day, Joyce took a bite of an apple. "Mom, I think Alexander's more excited about this baby than I am. It's like he really wants to be with me."


Katrina narrowed her eyes, trying to decipher Alexander's true intentions.


He seemed genuinely invested in the child's well-being.


Whenever Joyce went in for a checkup, Alexander appeared more nervous about the results than anyone else.


But for anyone suspecting he harbored romantic feelings for Joyce, his actions suggested otherwise.He'd usually show up, sit silently, and hardly say a thing.


Joyce's hopeful smile grew as she continued,"I guess Alexander likes me. And I like him too.Could you talk to Dad? Once the baby is born, we'll get the inheritance, and Alexander can marry me."


Compared to the string of unsuitable suitors Katrina had found for Joyce, Alexander seemed like a far better catch.
###Chapter 132 Wish To Slap His Past Self
Joyce had been waiting to hear from Katrina for quite a while, but no response came.


Munching on an apple, she turned to Katrina with wide-eyed astonishment.


"Mom? What's happening? Don't you want Alexander to be your son-in-law anymore?" Previously,whenever Joyce mentioned Alexander, Katrina would quickly concur with enthusiasm.


"You were always singing his praises, pushing me towards him, right?" Joyce queried, her expression a mix of surprise and bewilderment.


Katrina, meticulously peeling an orange, avoided eye contact, lost in her thoughts.


She understood that Joyce showing any sign of weakness could be exploited by Alexander. It was crucial to be open with her daughter.


Now that Joyce was the sole heiress to the Harper family fortune, they had no reason to feel daunted by anyone.


Empowered by this thought, Katrina's confidence surged. She caught a glimpse of Alexander standing in the doorway from the corner of her eye, a slight smile playing on her lips.


Refocusing on Joyce, she responded, "Alexander was a suitable match previously. However, since he's lost the Elite Lux project, he's no longer at his peak.His renewed interest in you? It's merely because his prospects with Daniela fell through, and now he's recalling your worth."


Joyce's lips puckered in a pout at Katrina's blunt words. "Mom, do you really have to say it that way?"


Katrina remained unapologetic. "I'm merely stating the facts. We are not anyone's backup plan. If he's genuinely interested, he should adhere to the proper channels-a formal proposal, a meeting between both families, and plans for a proper engagement and marriage. Yeah, we're rich, but we're not dumb enough to let anyone screw us over."


Joyce came to understand that Katrina truly had her best interests at heart. She pressed her lips tightly together, choosing not to continue the argument.


With a warm smile, Katrina extended the peeled orange towards Joyce. "You'll be a mother soon.If Alexander truly cares, it's time our families had dinner together and discussed a date for the wedding."


Just then, Katrina's attention snapped to the doorway, her expression unreadable. "Alexander?How long have you been there? I didn't notice you.Did you catch all that?"


Joyce stole a timid glance at Alexander.


His hair, styled in a rebellious, slightly tousled manner, was just the way she liked.


His silence lingered uncomfortably long, prompting Joyce to coax him, "Alexander, please, say something. Don't you see what my mother is getting at? She wants us to set a wedding date."


Alexander understood the implication behind Katrina's words perfectly. Yet, he remained silent,casting a brief, telling look at Joyce's swollen belly before he turned away and strode towards the doctor's office.


Both Katrina and Joyce were rooted to the spot,utterly speechless.


"What does that mean?" Joyce turned to Katrina,confusion clouding her features.


Katrina, equally baffled, speculated that perhaps Alexander's pride was getting in the way of his response.



Meanwhile, Richard, who was privy to Alexander's intentions, knew precisely the turmoil unfolding in Alexander's mind.


Alexander had taken a significant blow because of the failed bidding, yet certain matters still needed to be addressed. "I know you're biding your time until Joyce's baby is born. Just when the surgery is about to take place,you'll spring the news on Katrina. You'll tell her that Daniela's breakthrough research can save the child without any surgical intervention, promising a complete recovery. Daniela might falter at first, but she'll come through eventually. Is this your grand plan? To make her feel disgusted as payback?"


Richard's deduction was not merely a guess.It was a conclusion drawn the instant Alexander showed an unusual interest in Joyce's unborn child. "But think this through, Alexander. This maneuver willirreparably fracture your relationship with Daniela.You could have feigned ignorance, yet you opt formanipulation. How does alienating her benefit you orBennett Group? lf Daniela were a nobody, i'd say takeyour shot, But here in Olisvine, she's a force toreckon with. Cross her, and do you really think she'l!let you walk away unscathed? And let's not overlookthe fact that Daniela has harbored feelings for youover all these years. Her love isn't fleeting. lf youproceed with this plan, you'll extinguish any hope for reconciliation. Can you live with that?"
Alexander kept his mouth shut, but Richard's irritation boiled over. There was no way he was putting up with this crap.
The fallout from this could be absolutely devastating.Thinking about the golden opportunities they had blown made him wish he could travel back in time just to beat some sense into his dumbass self.
###Chapter 133 Cutting Ties With Daniela
Richard had always considered himself adept at gauging people's true nature, yet somehow, he had completely overlooked that Daniela was a top-tier CEO.



Now, watching one lucrative opportunity after another slip through his fingers left him restless,haunting his nights with wakefulness.


Richard gazed at Alexander, his expression a mix of urgency and frustration, silently wishing he could swap places with him and plead at Daniela's feet.


"Self-respect? Pride? What value do they hold nowadays?" Richard's voice escalated with intensity."In the absence of wealth, they're worthless!Alexander, I'm not compelling you to act, but I urge you to consider. Do you truly wish to sever all ties with Daniela permanently?" In the days leading up to this conversation, Richard had briefly visited Joyce in the hospital.


Pregnancy had intensified her cravings, rounding out her formerly sharp features.


Richard found himself unable to remain by her side for more than a few minutes, quickly excusing himself.


In his eyes, Joyce couldn't hold a candle to Daniela.


"Try it one more time," Richard suggested, his tone carrying a subtle edge of expectation. "Do you realize why Daniela managed to accomplish so much? Back in the day, when she pursued you, she was unconcerned about appearances. Regardless of the gossip or judgment, she never allowed it to deter her. Reflect on her past actions towards you. Isn't there a lesson to be learned from her perseverance?And consider this-perhaps Daniela is putting you through a test. With her newfound wealth, it's natural for her to be more guarded. Can't you see that?"


The cold detachment in Alexander's face slowly gave way to something softer. His gaze turned to Richard, a brief pause hanging in the air before he finally asked, "Really?"


Richard, although thrilled by the conversation,managed to maintain a composed demeanor.



He nodded solemnly and responded, "Absolutely.And it's not just me-others are saying the same.Just the other day, a friend of mine mentioned that Daniela, now positioned quite high up, might be using these tactics to test people's true intentions.He even asked me to pass on a message: don't get discouraged."



Richard, having played the role of Alexander's father for so many years, was well aware of his son's Achilles' heel-his pride. To Alexander, his self-esteem was paramount, overshadowing all else.


The deliberate choice of Richard's words seemed to unravel Alexander's pent-up frustration.


Rooted to the spot, Alexander clenched his fists tightly, then slowly uncurled them. "Alright. I'll give it another try." A flicker of relief passed through Richard's eyes.


Alexander's demeanor stiffened abruptly, his voice sharpening as he went on, "If Daniela still doesn't give a damn about my efforts, then screw her-l won't hold back anymore!"


Richard responded, "Don't worry. After the distance you've put between you and Daniela, she's bound to have noticed that she upset you last time. Plus, we secured that small bid, right? There's a project progress meeting this afternoon.It's not really tied to us, but you should go anyway. It's the perfect opportunity to see Daniela and break the awkward tension."


Pausing for a moment, Richard nervously rubbed his nose.




If Alexander delayed any longer, Daniela might erase him from her thoughts completely.


With her wealth at her disposal, she had the freedom to choose from a wide array of suitors-kind-hearted,passionate, and untamed alike. She truly had the world at her feet. If Alexander didn't take actions, he would be forgotten by her.


As Alexander headed upstairs to choose a suit,Richard let out a sigh of relief.


His attention then turned to his buzzing phone.Katrina's name lit up the screen. Without a second thought, he swiped to decline the call.


What a load of crap!


Joyce was a complete wreck, yet Katrina still dared to consider marrying her to Alexander?


Utterly pathetic!


Meanwhile, at the hospital, Katrina let out a laugh tinged with disbelief as her call was dismissed."Really? What's so terrible about the Bennett family now? Oh, so I'm the one groveling to them now, is that it?"


Caiden, seated beside her, didn't look up from his phone, where he was absorbed in the latest financial headlines.


The growth of Elite Lux in recent months had been impressive, and Caiden found comfort in the figures dancing on his screen.


Right now, nothing else was of consequence. His primary concern was preserving the Harper family fortune, ensuring Katrina didn't fritter it away as Joyce's wedding gift.


By maintaining control over their assets, he could secure a future where Daniela, endowed with wealth,would ensure his comfort in his later years.
###Chapter 134 Whatever It Took To Secure Her Child's Future
Katrina cast a sidelong glance at Caiden's detached expression, her eyes drifting to his phone screen,where a photo of Daniela was prominently displayed.


She stayed quiet for a moment, the faintest flicker of calculation flashing in her gaze.


Since their last heated exchange, Caiden had become a different man-aloof and disengaged,barely sparing a word for her or Joyce.


Even their moments of intimacy had lost their warmth;he would pull away almost immediately.


It was obvious that he had some hidden agenda.


His once palpable excitement for Joyce's pregnancy had faded,replaced with a cold indifference.


Could he be shifting his reliance to Daniela instead？  That simply wouldn't do.


Katrina had spent decades scheming for the Harper family fortune. There was no way she would let Daniela swoop in and claim the prize.


She needed Caiden to view Daniela as untrustworthy and realize that she and Joyce were the ones he could truly depend on.


Katrina's lips curved into a measured smile as she ladled soup into Joyce's bowl and settled beside her."Joyce, have you given any thought to the baby's last name?"


Without missing a beat, Joyce replied, "Of course,it'll be Bennett. This child will be with me when l marry. It's my first, and you can see how much Alexander already cares about it. He'll adore this baby just as much."


That had been Katrina's plan all along.


Joyce would marry into the Bennett family, taking the Harper family's assets with her. Over time, those assets would pass to her child. However, as the Bennett family's influence waned,Katrina began rethinking the inheritance and the child's role in it.


"The child should carry the Harper name instead,"she proposed.


Joyce and Caiden both turned to Katrina, startled by her suggestion.


Katrina's smile softened as her eyes settled on Joyce. "Joyce, you're not Caiden's biological daughter. It was me who brought you into this family.But all these years, he's done nothing but treat you with kindness. Raising a child is no small task, and you owe him your gratitude. Without his support, you wouldn't have the comfortable life you enjoy today.Do you see that?"


Joyce blinked, confused by the sudden change in Katrina's stance.


"When I first joined the Harper family, I made a promise to Daniela, in front of the media, that l wouldn't have any more children to avoid upsetting her. But over time, Caiden has regretted that  decision, and Peyton has voiced his displeasure,saying our branch of the family has lost its importance. Caiden has always cared for you, Joyce.So, I propose that this child takes the Harper name.It would become a part of the Harper legacy,strengthening the family, and also show gratitude to Caiden for all he's done for you. What do you think?"
Joyce was left speechless, her mind racing. When she glanced at Caiden, his eyes sparkled wit hope and happiness. After a moment of thought, she finally nodded."Alright."  recent days. "Mom, does the baby really need to take the Harper name?"


Katrina scoffed lightly, "Silly girl, what does a last name really mean? If changing it can guarantee a life of wealth and privilege for both you and your child,does the name really matter?"


She let out a cold laugh. "Caiden is selfish and manipulative. If we don't play our cards carefully, do you think he'll willingly hand over the family fortune to you and the baby? Now that you've agreed to let the child take the Harper name, he's thrilled. Daniela won't even cross his mind anymore. People like Caiden only care about securing their future, not the welfare of others."



As Katrina spoke, a gleam of malice flashed in her eyes.


"Joyce, no matter what last name the child carries,they'll always be yours. Blood ties can never be broken, and you must hold on to that truth for the rest of your life. Caiden doesn't grasp this, which is why he turned his back on Daniela. Listen-whether  the child is a boy or a girl, the most important thing is that they respect and follow your lead. Names,loyalty, and affection from others are mere distractions. When you grow old, do you think your child will reject you because of a last name? A wealthy child ensures a secure future for you.Look at my mother. She's reaping the benefits of having a daughter like me. Who wouldn't envy her?"
Joyce nodded, only partly grasping the full weight of the words.
She had to make sure the baby lived a life of wealth and privilege. She would go to any lengths necessary to ensure their future was secure.
###Chapter 135 The Harper Family's Child

Later that day, Caiden strode into the hospital with a lunchbox and a hefty book of baby names.
He declared his mission to pick the perfect name for the newest addition to the Harper family.
Seated next to him, Katrina offered a warm smile as she playfully fed him slices of orange. "Joyce is truly selfless, isn't she? To forgo her right to pass on her own family name and instead let the baby have yours? Honey, should her in-laws ever treat her unjustly over this decision, you mustn't overlook it."
Behind his reading glasses, Caiden thumbed through the book, shaking his head firmly. "That's not going to happen. Joyce is doing so much for this family. If anyone even thinks of mistreating her, I'll be the first to defend her."
Katrina exchanged a sly glance with Joyce, her lifted eyebrows and mischievous grin hinting at quiet triumph. "Exactly my point. It's clear you cherish Joyce above all. And think about Daniela and her accomplishments. Would she really risk a fallout with her future in-laws just to ensure the Harper name lives on? Yet here is Joyce, showing her loyalty to you without hesitation."
Caiden didn't glance away from the book, his voice cool and composed. "Trust me, I haven't forgotten where my loyalties are."
Reassured, Katrina rose to go to the bathroom. By the time she returned, Caiden was already in the hallway, lost in lively conversation with his friends over the phone.
Caiden was still gripping the book tightly. His tone was light, yet a subtle trace of pride colored his words. "Joyce is incredibly dedicated. The baby is hers. There's no need for it to take my surname.Why not hers, right? But you know what her response was? She told me she felt so indebted to me for all the ways I've raised her, more than she could ever repay. She even quipped that had she been born  a boy, she might have changed her surname to mine a long time ago. Now, she insists I should be the one to pick the baby's name personally. I've been poring over this book since dawn and I'm still clueless, so l had to call you. Help me find a name that will bless the child with every possible good fortune!"


Caiden reached out far and wide that afternoon,connecting with nearly everyone he could. His voice resonated down the hallway.


By the time evening fell, the news had spread among all of Caiden's friends and all the patients on the same floor.


Katrina's smirk sharpened, the hint of malice in her expression impossible to miss. Silently, she scoffed to herself, "What an absolute idiot."


Meanwhile, Richard, worried that Alexander might encounter another setback, decided to accompany him in person this time.


Alongside them, several project managers gathered,their spirits high. As they awaited Daniela's arrival, they engaged in light-hearted conversation.


"Marco, this year has been phenomenal for you,hasn't it? You must be seeing some hefty profits from this project," one of them remarked.


Basking in the glow of a deep suntan earned from countless hours outdoors, Marco Pittman flashed a broad smile. His hands, large and calloused from the rigors of construction work, were a testament to his dedication, yet he exuded pride.


"Indeed, we've done quite well financially. It's a rarity to encounter someone like Ms. Harper who genuinely appreciates hard labor. She's always quick to pay and even quicker to lend a hand whenever we're in a bind. There was this one instance when a hurricane was on the approach, and I was concerned about falling behind. I nearly had the team work straight through the storm. However, she personally visited the site and declared she'd extend our deadline by a full week. She remarked that we already put in more than enough effort and refused to push us further.During summer, she ensured we had chilled beverages, and when the cold hit, she didn't hesitate to provide heaters. She even constructed dormitories adjacent to the site for us. Having been in this industry for years, I've yet to meet another leader as fair and compassionate as her. I'll undoubtedly give my all for her!"


Raul Brewer chimed in, "I'mn finally taking a real break this year, too. The project I've been managing just wrapped up, and we passed the inspection yesterday. Ms. Harper has already transferred the final payment. It's a relief-I can face my crew with pride now. You know, with other contracts, payment delays are common, and I often feel embarrassed in front of my team."


The crowvd erupted in hearty laughter.


"Come on, Marco, don't hold out! How much did you make? I heard about your new car. Seems like you're doing quite well for yourself!"


Marco chuckled, his complexion tanned from days in the sun. His eyes sparkled as he flashed a wide,toothy smile. Lifting his hand, he flashed a number with his fingers.
Richard glanced at him, presuming Marco was merely an amateur worker who wouldn't earn much.

However, the moment Richard caught sight of the number Marco displayed, he was stunned into silence.

His mind reeled as if struck by a massive explosion.

###Chapter 136 Blacklisted





Richard tried to smile politely, but it came off forced and uncomfortable. "You really earned that much?"


"What I've earned is nothing compared to what others have made. You know how much Raul earned?" Marco raised his hand, miming a figure.


Richard felt his heart skip a beat as the words hit him. His chest clenched, and for a brief moment,he thought he might faint right there.


He shot a quick glance at Alexander, his voice trembling. "Is that really possible to earn that much?"


Having distanced himself from the business world,Richard only had a general sense of how large these projects were, but he never imagined the profits could reach such astronomical numbers.


Alexander, still involved in business, knew these projects were profitable, but even he hadn't anticipated figures like this. This was more than anything he had ever imagined.


Alexander frowned in disbelief. "Are you sure there's no mistake? Could the profit really be this high?"


"Absolutely," Marco replied with certainty. "Ms.Harper made it perfectly clear. Her company supplies the materials, and her team inspects the construction. Once the inspection passes, we receive payment as agreed."


Alexander squinted, his suspicion growing. "Doesn't that just make you all her employees?"


"In a sense, yes. Ms. Harper mentioned that the industry was once full of fierce competition.Companies would lowball their bids just to secure contracts, leaving little room for profit. As a result,contractors had no choice but to cut corners on materials to make ends meet, wvhich led to subpar construction. By supplying the materials herself, she guarantees quality, while we take care of the work.Once the project meets her expectations, we receive the agreed-upon profit. No one loses, and she gets the quality she demands. It's a win for everyone." Marco gave a thumbs-up, his voice filled with admiration. "Now that's how you make real money.Her vision and bravery-I can't help but admire her!"


Raul nodded eagerly. "Exactly! I even brought some gifts from my hometown today. I'm hoping to thank Ms. Harper in person and ask for more opportunities.Working for a boss like her, it's truly a pleasure."


Richard's eyes darted towards the group of contractors, and it was only then that he noticed the bags they were carrying.


The items weren't costly, nor were they extravagant,just simple, local treasures, but they were meaningful and came from the heart.


Richard looked at Alexander and felt a twinge of regret for arriving without a gift.


He quickly reassured himself. The others had brought gifts, but he had brought Alexander. Surely a living, breathing person like him was worth more than any small tokens.


By the time Daniela arrived, Alexander and Richard had been shuffled into a corner by the eager crowd of contractors.


The crowd surged forward, eager to present their gifts to Daniela.


Richard, shoved and jostled by the crowd,turned to Alexander and muttered, "Is Daniela really this influential now?"


Alexander stood frozen. While he had been focused on Joyce's pregnancy, Daniela had silently built her reputation and earned the admiration of so many.


In contrast to these contractors, hardened by years of grueling labor, Alexander and Richard-accustomed to the comfort of office work-felt completely out of place.


Eventually, when the meeting started, Alexander and Richard had been relegated to the back of the room,sitting on tiny stools in a distant corner.


Richard sat there with a scowl on his face, but despite his frustration, he couldn't bring himself to leave. Pulling Alexander along with him, he stayed glued to his tiny stool, his face contorted in frustration.


Alexander, on the other hand, sat in silence.His eyes remained fixed on Daniela, who stood confidently at the front of the room.


For the first time, he felt an overwhelming sense of distance between them. She had risen to a level he could only dream of reaching.


The realization ate at him, leaving a suffocating weight in his chest.


"Thank you all for your excitement. The reasonI've called you here today is simple. As some of you may have heard, I recently acquired a large plot of land in Kaloria to build an airport."


The room went dead silent in an instant.


Richard's and Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief,their shock clearly visible on their faces.


Richard,convinced he had misunderstood, turned to Alexander, his finger trembling as he pointed to the stage. "What did she just say she's building?"


Alexander's expression stayed tight as he replied,"An airport."


Richard stood frozen, staring at Daniela in utter disbelief.


"All the necessary permits and approvals arealready in place. I've always valued the partnership model we've used in the past. That's why, for this project,I've opted not to go through an open bidding process. Instead, I'll be announcing the companies I've selected to collaborate with. Each of them will receive the airport's construction plans and architectural layout. After reviewing them, please submit your budget proposals. If the pricing is fair,we'll move forward with the collaboration."


Daniela paused, a confident smile playing on her lips."However, there's one thing I want to make clear. At Elite Lux, our guiding principle is..."


Before Daniela could finish, the room erupted in enthusiastic unison as the contractors completed her sentence. "Quality over quantity. Money is no object!"



Richard's jaw dropped. They al know this slogan?


He shot a glance at Alexander, a wave of embarrassment washing over him as he realized they were the only ones in the room who hadn't known.


Daniela's meeting was straightforward and efficient,no frills attached. She then started announcing the companies chosen for the project.


Raul and Marco, both selected, descended from the stage, clutching their blueprints like prized possessions.Despite their age, they were practically bouncing with excitement.


Richard crossed his arms and shot a sideways look at Alexander. "Just wait. Let's see what prime part of the project Daniela has lined up for us."


And so,they continued to wait.


One by one, the blueprints were handed out, and the names of the companies were called. Finally, Daniela announced the meeting was over. But the father and son remained seated, still waiting eagerly. As the crowd started to thin, Richard could no longer keep it in. He stood up quickly, calling out, "Daniela -" Realizing the sharp glances from the crowd, he quickly corrected himself. "Ms. Harper, did you forget about Bennett Group?"
Daniela didn't respond right away. Instead, her assistant took a step forward.
"Bennett Group? I'm terribly sorry. In the last project with Elite Lux, your company's work failed quality inspections three times. So, Elite Lux has decided to cut ties with Bennett Group moving forward."
The room fell deathly silent, and every eye turned to Richard and Alexander.
The words hit them like a slap-sharp and painful,stinging across their faces.
Bennett Group, once seen as the leader of the industry, the epitome of excellence in Olisvine's architectural world, had not only failed inspections three times but was now publicly blacklisted by Elite Lux.


This wasn't just a dent in their reputation; it was an excruciating humiliation.


Richard's body seemed to crumble under the weight of the shame. His vision went hazy, his knees buckled, and he collapsed right there.


The last thing he heard before everything went black was Alexander's frantic voice calling out, "Dad! Dad!"

###Chapter 137 Cedric Has Gone Too Far




After Richard opened his eyes, Alexander gathered Bennett Group's management team responsible for the failed Elite Lux project.


Historically, Bennett Group had been a titan in the industry, orchestrating many high-profile projects and reaping substantial rewards. These managers were accustomed to success and privilege.


Yet, the tables had turned. Daniela's Elite Lux, now a beacon of rigorous oversight, had eclipsed their operations, forcing them to engage with smaller firms they had previously overlooked or assigned only trivial tasks.


This shift in dynamics brewed discontent among them.


In their eyes, Daniela had always been overshadowed by her infatuation with Alexander, appearing more as an obsessive admirer than a formidable professional. This underestimation proved costly. Their sloppy execution led to the project failing three consecutive inspections, resulting in an abrupt and humiliating cancellation.
Mortified by the debacle, they opted against reporting the fiasco up the chain, presuming it tobe a minor blip unlikely to stir significant repercussions given Daniela's past relationship with Alexander.
However, when Alexander brought it up today, it was clear the incident had not faded into obscurity as they had hoped. Caught off-guard, they scrambled to piece together their recollections of the events.
As Richard absorbed their explanations, his expression turned thunderous. Still weak from his recent ailment, the fury coursing through him nearly sent him spiraling into unconsciousness once more.
"It's all Cedric's fault!" one of them declared, his voice laced with desperation to shift the blame. "Our performance has been impeccable! Mr. Bennett,we've mastered this craft over the years. How could we possibly falter on such a basic task? Yet, Cedric
scrutinized every minute aspect. We had adhered strictly to his directives, but he still refused to approve our inspections. It's as though he has it out for us. He even proclaimed, 'Not even your boss can sway my decision!' Can you believe that?"


With his temper flaring, Richard demanded through gritted teeth, "He really said those words?"


The manager paused, a flicker of guilt crossing his features, but he soon affirmed with a decisive nod."Absolutely! That's precisely what he said. He's being a pain in the ass just because he's got a thing for Ms. Harper. What other stupid reason could there be? It's likely eating him alive to see her giving Bennett Group any attention." And now, because of this debacle, there's no chance for Bennett Group and Elite Lux to join forces on any ventures in the future. It's exactly what he desired!"


"That's fucking ridiculous!" Richard, overwhelmed by indignation, slammed his hand against the bed frame. "Cedric has crossed the line!"


He flung aside the bed covers, resolved to rise,but Alexander restrained him, his expression somber."Dad, leave this to me."
As the project managers made their way out of the hospital room, one asked, "You really think this is going to work?"
"Shut the hell up and just keep going!"
After all, Bennett Group wasn't stupid enough to challenge Cedric head-on. Pinning the blame on him was far more convenient.
Richard, his emotions simmering, confronted Alexander. "We can recover lost money, but Daniela is irreplaceable. If you have any courage as a man,you'll fight to win her back."
Gritting his teeth, Alexander stormed out, his mind set on confrontation.
His first destination was Phillips Group, but Cedric was nowhere to be found.
Next, he rushed to the bustling construction site,only to discover Cedric had just departed.  Growing more agitated, Alexander headed straight for Daniela's place.
There, he saw Lillian engaged in conversation with Cedric.
With a thunderous expression, Alexander approached and pointed accusingly at Lillian. "Stay out of this, Lillian. Cedric, we need to talk-now!"
Lillian's brow furrowed, piecing together the reason behind Alexander's urgent pursuit.
She internally critiqued his character, noting how men like Alexander often shirked responsibility and pointed fingers when things fell apart, expecting the world to revolve around them.
Pathetic losers like him did nothing but exist and piss people off.
Before she could voice her thoughts, Cedric intervened with a raised hand,silencing her.
He told Lillian, "If Daniela arrives, please tell her I'm caught up with some pressing business issues but will meet up with you both at the restaurant later Then, he excused himself and followed Alexander.
###Chapter 138 A Beating




Alexander marched forward, his anger silent but undeniable. He made his way to the top floor of the hotel across the street.


Behind him, Cedric pulled out his phone and quickly typed a brief message, sending the location to his assistant.



"Deliver a new shirt to this place."


After slipping the phone back into his pocket, he shrugged off his suit jacket, letting it fall onto a nearby chair.


"Cedric, you've decided to take Daniela from me,haven't you?" Alexander's gaze was icy, his tone slicing through the air, and his whole presence radiated hostility.


As the last slivers of sunlight disappeared, Alexander stood in the chilly evening wind. His hair, disheveled and tousled by the breeze, gave him a menacing, almost sinister look.
In contrast, Cedric stood composed in a crisp white shirt and tailored trousers, his sharp features highlighted by the cool night air. "Yes," he responded, his voice blunt and without a second thought.
Alexander's eyes narrowed to dangerous slits, his gaze cutting through Cedric with the force of a blade. "So, you're confessing it then? You want Daniela!"
Cedric, with his hands tucked into his pockets, met Alexander's stare with equal intensity. "Do I really need to spell it out? Isn't it clear?"
He wasn't a fool. If he didn't have feelings for Daniela, why would he keep going out of his way to help her? He wasn't some reckless playboy. If he didn't love her,why would he keep chasing after her?
Cedric could easily defend his actions. Aside from being a little shy around Daniela, his reputation as a powerful figure spoke for itself. Alexander's chest rose and fell with his mounting rage. "So it's true. You intentionally undermined Bennett Group during the inspections? Cedric, you're nothing but a conniving,manipulative bastard!"


Cedric chuckled darkly, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Alexander, I honestly can't fathom how someone like you managed to make it to the top in this industry. I'm not here to teach you a lesson, nor do I owe you any kind of explanation. But let me be perfectly clear-you can kiss any future involvement in Daniela's projects goodbye."


Bennett Group, with their shoddy projects that crumbled with the smallest push, had the nerve to call themselves industry leaders?


"Cedric!" Alexander bellowed, his voice breaking under the force of his anger. "So, you're set on opposing me,are you?"


Cedric answered with cold certainty, "Yes. What are you going to do about it?"


Alexander hadn't anticipated such a blunt and unapologetic reply. His breath quickened as his anger surged. He was seething, completely and uncontrollably furious. But beneath the rage, an unsettling feeling began to creep in, gnawing at him from the inside.
This was Cedric-the man who, besides Daniela,ruled the city's business landscape without question.
Was it wise to make Cedric an enemy?
Could an all-out clash hurt Bennett Group's prospects?
And most importantly, did he stand a chance of winning?
At that moment, Alexander felt a pang of regret for acting on impulse.
He had rushed in, fueled by raw emotion, without thinking things through, while Cedric stood calm,composed, and unfazed.
Cedric's icy gaze met Alexander's,filled with indifference and scorn.
He'd dealt with men like Alexander before-those who thrived on intimidating the vulnerable but fell apart when confronted with true strength.


Cedric smirked against the cold wind on the rooftop.Before Alexander could even respond, Cedric swung his fist and delivered a punishing blow straight to Alexander's face.


Alexander took a shaky step back, struggling to keep himself upright. He wiped his nose roughly, then stopped to stare at the blood on his hand."Cedric Phillips!"


Cedric chuckled, his voice dripping with mockery."I'm right here."


"Cedric! I'll kill you!"


The rooftop descended into utter chaos.


Dust swirled in the howling wind, mixing with the sickening sound of fists pounding into skin and bone.The punches kept coming, hard and fast, each one landing with brutal force.


Alexander's cries echoed through the night, gradually fading into the biting cold air.
Cedric's assistant reached the rooftop.
He found Cedric standing there, calm and collected,as poised as ever. But his sleeves had some blood stains.
"Sir, your..." His words trailed off as his eyes fell on Alexander,lying unconscious on the rooftop.
Cedric unbuttoned his bloodstained shirt and tossed it aside, slipping into the fresh one without sparing a glance at Alexander."WelI, I'm off for dinner."
The assistant stood frozen, his thoughts racing. He had known for some time that Cedric had been eager to put Alexander in his place, but this?
He stole one last look at Alexander.
Was this really necessary for Cedric to do?
Alexander's face was so swollen and bruised that it was barely recognizable. Would he need surgery to repair this? Cedric adjusted his cuffs before adding, "Call an ambulance. Having someone die here isn't good for business."
With that, he bent down, grabbed his suit jacket,shook it out as though brushing off unseen dust,and put it on. He didn't spare another glance before walking off.
The dinner was already buzzing with conversation,the dishes being served and the Elite Lux team in high spirits when Cedric walked in.
Everyone's gaze turned to him, as they admired the sharp and polished look of his tailored suit.
Daniela, picking at a small appetizer, followed their gaze and glanced at Cedric.
She watched him in silence for a brief moment,then lowered her eyes and went back to her meal, her expression impossible to read.
Cedric's heart skip a beat.
The team,well-acquainted with Cedric, greeted him with casual banter. "Cedric, weren't you with Lillian earlier? What took you so long?"
Cedric grabbed a drink from the table and poured it into Daniela's glass. He smiled faintly and answered,
"Got caught up with something. It took longer than l thought."
The question had been lighthearted, and the team shifted to other subjects.
As Cedric adjusted his suit jacket, preparing to take it off, Daniela's voice suddenly came from beside him."Lillian mentioned you went back to the office."
Cedric froze in place.
Her voice was light, almost indifferent, as if it were a mere comment with no weight.
For some reason, he couldn't bring himself to look at her. His hand, which had been resting on his jacket,slowly dropped to his side.
Desperately trying to mask his discomfort, he selected a dish for Daniela and offered with a smile, great. You should try it."
Daniela gave him a quick glance and a slight nod but didn't say a word.
Cedric's composure faltered. He awkwardly fumbled with his utensils, almost knocking over the dish in front of him.
As the meal went on, he kept serving Daniela, but she ate in silence, offering no feedback. Still, Cedric couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that hung over him.
###Chapter 139 A Man Under His Wife's Thumb
Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Is this really such a big deal? You know, if you two ever tie the knot, you'll be a hen-pecked husband, Cedric. All this drama just because you went back to the office? Keep this up and you'll shatter that aloof, invincible persona everyone admires!"


Cedric chuckled, shaking his head. "Persona? I've never cared about that."



Just as Lillian was about to reply, Cedric turned to Daniela. "Alright, alright, I admit it-I didn't go back to the office; I had something else to take care of.Please, forgive me this time.I promise, no more lies."


Daniela gave him a skeptical look, her eyes dropping to his hand. "Were you in a fight? Your hand looks hurt."



Lillian leaned in, her curiosity escalating. "Oh wow you're right."


Cedric, the epitome of composure and precision,had gotten into a brawl? It seemed out of character, but then again, considering his often cold and distant demeanor with others, maybe it wasn't so far-fetched after all.


Cedric embodied contradiction, a blend of extremes that rarely made sense.


Around Daniela, he was gentle and attentive, yet around others, he was like a simmering volcano on the verge of eruption.


Cedric was oblivious to the fresh scrape marring his knuckles until Daniela pointed it out. He offered a feeble, uncomfortable grin, tucking his hand out of sight behind his back.


"Why don't you head down to the lobby and have the manager get you some iodine for that?" Daniela suggested, her tone laced with concern.


Cedric was about to dismiss the fuss with a shake of his head, but the sight of Daniela's earnest  expression halted him. He rose and said, "Alright, I'll do that."


Lillian, unable to suppress her amusement, leaned towards Daniela. "You know, you two really have the whole old married couple act down pat."


Upon returning, Cedric paused in the doorway,his gaze landing on Daniela, who was quietly sampling the dishes he had placed on her plate.


He watched her for a spell, a surge of simple happiness bubbling within him. He didn't understand why he loved her so deeply.


Shaking off his reverie, Cedric finally proceeded to his chair and resumed his place.


Daniela said lightly, "You really should avoid getting into fights, you know."


Cedric's face softened, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "How about a deal? Be my girlfriend, and not only will I avoid fights, but I'll hang on your every word and devote myself entirely to you," he whispered in a voice that no one else could hear. Lillian cast a quick glance at Cedric and asked Daniela, "What is wrong with him?"


Daniela shook her head. "I'm not sure. He seems to be in a world of his own."



At the same time, Alexander was wheeled into the emergency room. His return to consciousness was marked by agonizing screams of pain that echoed through the sterile corridors.



Richard arrived moments later and was met with a harrowing sight: Alexander's face, a horrifying tableau of bruises and swelling, distorted beyond recognition. He let out a heart-wrenching cry.


Their cries resonated through the hospital,compelling nurses, doctors, and even other patients to peer into the room, curious about the source of such distress.



They were met with the grim visage of Alexander,sitting on the bed, his features battered and raw.


That evening, the incident captured the attention of the media. Reporters descended on the hospital, eager for a sensational story. However, Alexander was in no state to confess that he had been mercilessly beaten by a single individual who had nonchalantly continued his evening as if nothing had occurred.


The thought of acknowledging such a humiliating defeat was mortifying.


The turmoil within him mounted, pushing Alexander to the brink of madness.


As the room emptied and quiet settled once more,he dragged himself to the mirror.


Confronting his reflection, he was rooted to the spot,the severity of his injuries mirroring the turmoil inside him.



Every inch was marred by bruises and swelling,turning his features into those of a man who'd suffered a grave calamity.


Now, he realized the source of the excruciating pain that shot through his skin with even the slightest movement. "Cedric is envious because Daniela preferred my looks! That's why he targeted my face!"


Richard found himself utterly speechless.


At the doorway, their secretary asked, "Should we call the police?"


Richard whirled around, his eyes blazing as he fixed the secretary with a stern glare. "Call the police?Have you lost your senses? Just look at his face! If word of this gets out, it'll be said that the president of Bennett Group was assaulted. Do you want to tarnish our company's image?"


The secretary stood there, dumbfounded. Cedric was stepping on their dignity, and yet, their primary concern was the company's image? This was not the Richard and Alexander he knew.


Usually, they wielded their power ruthlessly, lording it over those beneath them. Only last month, Richard had visited a construction site and a mere speck of dust had settled on his suit. Infuriated, he had demanded that the worker responsible compensate him with 100, 000 dollars. That amount represented a whole year's worth of dedication and labor for the employee.


The man had sunk to his knees, pleading for forgiveness with desperate eyes, yet Richard remained unmoved, his resolve as cold as steel.


The unfortunate worker had driven himself to illness,tirelessly gathering every penny he could muster.


And now? Alexander's features were so brutally marred that his own mother wouldn't recognize him.Yet here they were, forced to digest this bitter pill of defeat without so much as a whimper of resistance.


The secretary, witnessing the scene, couIdn't suppress a twisted sense of satisfaction mingled with curiosity. Who held such sway that they could compel such a complete and humiliating retreat?


With a dismissive gesture, Richard signaled for the secretary to leave.


Once the door clicked shut behind him, Richard's gaze hardened as he addressed Alexander. "Don't hold it against me for not involving the police. You're aware, just as I am, that our family's clout has waned.Since we lost the partnership with Elite Lux, we're not the titan we once were. Crossing Cedric now would spell our doom in Olisvine. For the company's sake,you must endure this."


Alexander's face, swollen and distorted from the assault, betrayed no emotion. Yet, beneath that battered exterior, a fierce hatred simmered,threatening to boil over.


Gesturing towards his disfigured face, he snarled "Dad! Cedric didn't just attack me-he wrecked my face. He's envious because Daniela shows interest in me, so he targeted every strike at my face. Now, with my face like this, how will I ever win Daniela's affection back? And what about my standing? Cedric reduced me to nothing. IfI don't retaliate or even report him, what will others think of me once they hear? They'll call me a goddamn coward! A spineless loser! How the hell am | supposed to lead when everyone thinks I've got no balls?"



Richard remained silent for a moment, his expression unreadable. He sat there, contemplating deeply as Alexander's anger simmered.


With a sigh, he finally suggested, "Listen, here's what you need to do-go to Daniela. This chaos all began with her, didn't it? Demand that Cedric apologize to you. But not just a simple apology-he must also handle all your medical bills."


A sly, calculating gleam flickered in Richard's eyes."And while you're at it, tell Daniela that if she really wants to resolve this situation, she must give us the airport project. That will be the cost of our silence." 
###Chapter 140 Caiden's Plan





Alexander's anger had cooled somewhat."Do you really think this will work?"


Richard replied, "I think it will. Daniela used to care so much about you, even when you were cold towards her. Now that you're in this condition,how could she still be angry? She's your ex-wife. She can't just ignore you. If you land the airport project,there will be plenty of chances to be with her. Once she sees your vulnerability, reconciliation will follow.Alexander,you need to look at the bigger picture.Often, misfortune opens doors. If getting beaten up is what it takes to win her back, then it's worth it.Don't wait for the doctor now. Go straight to Daniela.She has private doctors. Let her take care of you and show her that Cedric is nothing but a brute-completely unworthy of her trust."


Alexander lowered his gaze, uncertainty clouding his expression. "Are you sure, Dad?" He couldn't deny how distant and cold Daniela hnad become toward him lately.


More often than not, Daniela had looked at him as though he were nothing more than a piece of trash.


He no longer had the same confidence he used to share with her.


Not to mention his face was now so disfigured it was almost unrecognizable.


He dreaded facing Daniela in his current state.


"Oh come on, why wouldn't it work?" Richard said firmly. "Alexander, Daniela has loved you for all these years. If it were just about appearances, that kind of love wouldn't have lasted this long."


Alexander nodded slowly. "You're right! Daniela loves me for who I truly amn!"


Standing outside the door, the secretary caught snippets of the conversation. He let out a heavy sigh and closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to shut out the absurdity of it all. Alexander certainly knew how to flatter himself, didn't he?


Upstairs in the obstetrics department, Katrina came across the news about Alexander's beating.


She had just been informed that both Alexander and Richard were in the hospital downstairs.


She cast a quick glance at Alexander's face. What she saw unsettled her, leaving a lingering sense of unease. With a final, apprehensive glance,she made her way upstairs.


She told Caiden what she had witnessed. "You should've seen it, Caiden. Alexander's face was a complete disaster! It looked like a truck had just run over him."



Caiden chuckled at her description, amused but unable to fully picture it in his mind.


He wasn't concerned about Alexander or who Joyce would eventually end up with.


His focus was elsewhere. After secretly consulting the doctor, he discovered that the child Joyce was expecting was a boy.


The news brought him a sense of satisfaction, and he stayed up all night, too elated to sleep.


But this time, he knew better than to rush. He would move forward with careful consideration.


He casually flipped open the book of names,skimming through its pages. "I spoke with the doctor today," he said to Katrina, his tone casual. "Joyce's due date is next month."


Katrina nodded in agreement. "Yes, that's right," she replied, her gaze drifting to Caiden, whose face was partially hidden in the shadows.


Caiden continued, "I've chosen a name for the child -Jack. He'll stay with me after he's born. As for Joyce, I'll find her a suitable match and give her 30million as a wedding gift, considering I'm her stepfather. The rest of the assets-the company,real estate, investments, and even the villa we live in-will go to Jack."


At first, Katrina frowned slightly upon hearing this. Thirty million seemed like a trivial amount for Joyce.


But as Caiden explained further, her expression softened. What difference did it make? The child was still young, and the assets would eventually be under Joyce's control, regardless.


"Of course, the child is far too young to handle this kind of wealth. I intend to keep it under my control until he turns fifteen. Until then, it will remain in my hands," he added.


In that instant, Katrina grasped Caiden's true intentions.



Considering the child's delicate health, Caiden didn't want to take the risk of transferring the inheritance too soon.



What if something were to happen to him?


By the time the child reached fifteen, he would have spent enough time under Caiden's roof to naturally form a bond with him, not Joyce.


This approach would ensure that the boy belonged to Caiden entirely, with very little connection to Joyce.





Katrina forced a smile, her mind whirling. For the moment, she chose to go along with it, deciding to handle the finer details later when she had more time to think.



As she absorbed this, Caiden retrieved a folded document from inside the book-a contract that seemed to have been prepared long before.


"I had a lawyer prepare this agreement," he said."It states that Joyce will marry once she's fully recovered. If we can't find a suitable match, she can live in our city-center apartment."


Katrina stared at Caiden in disbelief. She hadn't expected him to be so ruthlessly calculating.


Caiden went on, "You don't have to worry.The Harper family will always be Joyce's home. I'll continue managing the company as usual. Whether Daniela and I fix things or not, as her father,she can't turn me down if I request a project. You've seen how large Elite Lux's projects are. If I put in the effort, Jack's inheritance will grow immensely. Daniela is close to Cedric, and as her father, I have leverage.Cedric will treat me with respect and wouldn't dare refuse me resources. With connections to both Daniela and Cedric-the two dominant forces in Olisvine-the Harper family will only thrive."


He paused for a moment before adding, "If you think this plan works, persuade Joyce to sign the agreement. After all, she's the child's mother, and she'll want the best for him. I'm not doing this for myself. You both know Daniela wouldn't support us if the child remained too closely tied to Joyce. This is for his future. He'll understand when he's older. And for now, I'll thank you on his behalf."


The hospital room felt unbearably cold, as though winter had seeped into every corner.


Katrina shivered, realizing how carefully Caiden had planned everything.


So,he had always been aware of how she treated Daniela, yet he had chosen to overlook it-because it didn't serve his interests, he simply turned a blind  eye.
Now, every action he took was driven by self-interest, leaving no space for mistakes or second thoughts.  Katrina felt as though she had been tossed into the frigid waters of a frozen lake, the biting cold sinking deep into her bones, draining her of all warmth and leaving her numb to the core.
Caiden gave her a small smile and said, "I know Joyce respects you. Go talk to her. After all, I'm not her real father. If I bring it up, she'll probably just resent me."
###Chapter 141 Our Past



By the time the doctor reached Alexander's hospital room,Alexander was no longer there.



Richard sat in the room, a smug grin plastered across his face. He was certain that, this time, Daniela would feel pity for Alexander. Once she gave in to her sympathy, the future of their family's wealth and status would be secured without question.



The doctor shot Richard a look filled with confusion and disbelief. He couldn't make sense of it. Richard's son had been left battered and bruised, yet instead of rushing to call the police, the man just sat there,grinning as if nothing had happened.


At Elite Lux, Daniela was hard at work preparing for an important event. She was so absorbed in her tasks that when Alexander entered her office, she didn't even acknowledge his presence.



It wasn't until she paused to sip some water that she finally looked up.



Startled,she instinctively threw the cup at his face.



Alexander had lingered at the doorway for what felt like an eternity, growing more and more humiliated as  she stayed completely unaware of his presence.



Just as he was about to put on a pitiful expression to draw her attention, a cup flew towards him.



He was so stunned that he couldn't even react in time to avoid it.



"Ouch!"



The pain was unbearable.



Daniela instantly realized how forcefully it had hit him.



She could even hear a sharp crack-the unmistakable sound of a nose breaking.



Blood began gushing from Alexander's nose,running down his face and dripping onto the floor.



As the cup clattered to the floor, Daniela finally got a clear look at him. Her face drained of color, her stomach twisting in shock. "Who the hell are you?"



Just as Alexander was about to shout in pain, her question struck him silent.



He struggled to shape his face into an expression of sorrow,hoping to appear pitiful enough to win her sympathy,but no matter how hard he tried, his efforts fell flat. To Daniela, the figure standing before her was hardly recognizable.


His face was a grotesque mess, swollen and bruised beyond any hope of recognition.



"Who are you?" she repeated.


Alexander pressed his hand to his bleeding nose, his voice muffled as he rasped, "It's mne! Alexander!"


Daniela blinked, her face frozen in sheer disbelief. Her first instinct was to grab her phone and call the police.After all, this disfigured man could only be here to extort her for money.



Just as she reached for her phone, Alexander stumbled forward, clutching his nose, and shouted,"Don't be scared! I look like this because Cedric beat me up!"



Daniela's thoughts flashed to Cedric-the small cut she had seen earlier on the back of his hand. Slowly,she lowered the phone.



Alexander stood there, waiting for her response, but Daniela remained silent. Finally, unable to keep his frustration in check, he snapped, "Aren't you going to ask why Cedric hit me?" Daniela barely hesitated before answering,"If Cedric hit you, there must've been a reason."


Alexander froze, stunned by her response. Clenching his teeth, he hissed, "That's not it! He..."


He wanted to shout, "Cedric likes you!" But he bit his tongue. Saying it out loud would only end up doing Cedric a favor, and that was the last thing he wanted.


After a brief pause, he changed tactics. "Cedric has been sabotaging Bennett Group during the project inspections. I confronted him to get answers, and what did he do? He attacked me!"



Daniela raised an eyebrow, her expression becoming sharper. "So, let me get this straight-you actually went to confront him?"



Alexander gave a stiff nod."Yes."


"And instead of answers, you ended up getting yourself beaten?"



Alexander balled his fists tightly, his tone filled with resentment."Yes."



"And now, you're too scared to retaliate because it might hurt your company, so you've come running to me, expecting me to step in and handle it for you?"Daniela summarized flatly, getting straight to the point. Alexander's chest tightened, the sting of humiliation hitting him hard. It was the painful truth, but hearing it spelled out by Daniela, along with her icy, mocking look, only deepened his embarrassment.


"Alexander, even children understand that when you lose a fight, you own up to it. Are you seriously telling me you're worse than a child? Or did you come here to play the victim? Hoping I'd feel sorry for you?"Daniela's tone was filled with disbelief. "Do you seriously think I'd still feel the same way about you?That I'd protect you no matter the circumstances?Alexander, if that's what you're counting on, then you clearly have no clue about how women think. Let me be blunt-any woman who sees you walk in with a face like that would lose every last ounce of sympathy she might've had."



Daniela grabbed a mirror from her desk and held it out to him. "Here, take a long, hard look. Why not pay Joyce a visit instead? See,I'm shallow, Alexander.I can't handle a face like that. But Joyce? She'd probably embrace you likea long-lost treasure."



Alexander's bruised and battered face darkened with humiliation, the sting of her ridicule cutting deeper than the physical pain.



Standing there, he felt utterly defeated,wondering how he had been naive enough to believe that Daniela might still harbor any feelings for him, even in his current state.



He turned to the mirror, his swollen and bruised face staring back at him like a cruel reminder of his downfall.Shame,raw and overwhelming,clawed at him for the first time in his life. A fleeting wish crossed his mind-that the floor might split open and swallow him,sparing him from the weight of his disgrace.


Yet, despite the heartbreak crushing his spirit, he didn't walk away. He remained rooted in place, his gaze fixed on Daniela with the silent desperation of a man grasping at his final lifeline. "Daniela, is there truly no chance for us? Just a few months ago, things were okay, weren't they?"



Daniela let out a sharp breath, clearly struggling to believe what she was hearing. "That was all in your head. Now, do yourself a favor and get to the hospital.While they're patching up your face, maybe ask them to take a look at your brain. Or better yet, see a psychiatrist. Who knows? You might have some delusional disorder. If you're really unwell, get help.Don't let it go untreated."



Alexander stood motionless, the ache of humiliation piercing him more painfully than any wound could.



He had come here, clinging to a hope of salvaging what they once had. But her icy indifference shattered him completely.



"Daniela, do you truly have no respect for what we shared? Not even the slightest?" he asked, his hand slowly dropping from his face.
###Chapter 142 You Won



Alexander watched as Daniela nodded without a moment's hesitation.



It felt as though she had never loved him in the first place.


In that moment, the cold wind brushed against his face, sharp and cruel, as the sound of his heart breaking echoed loudly within him.



Women were the most unforgiving,cold-hearted creatures!



Alexander was caught between pain and a strange sense of relief. At least when Daniela had been chasing him desperately, hehadn't shown her an ounce of mercy.



If he had let his guard down, he would've been a complete fool by now. 2



Someone like Daniela, so heartless and calculating,wasn't worthy of love.



She didn't deserve it!



His fists clenched, his face twisted by rage, Alexander shot Daniela a chilling glare. "Fine, Daniela. You've got courage. Don't come crawling back later!"



Without a flicker of hesitation, Daniela nodded again,her voice steady and uninterested. "Alright."


He had anticipated her to second-guess herself, to show a hint of regret-but there was nothing.


He gazed at her composed, emotionless face, and something inside him shattered even further.


His voice rose, now filled with fury and shame."One day, you'll be begging me to take you back. You'll regret treating me like this."



Daniela nodded again, her expression almost mockingly sincere. "Alright. I'll wait for that day."


Alexander narrowed his eyes. "This isn't over, Daniela.Don't think for a second I'll let this go. What Cedric did to me-it's practically mutilation. Either you compensate me now, or I'll go straight to the police.I don't care about my reputation anymore. Let's see if Cedric can deal with the fallout. You don't care about me? Fine. Let's see how you feel when Cedric's name is dragged through the mud!"



At last, Alexander's true nature had come to light.



Daniela's gaze sharpened instantly, the calm demeanor she once held replaced by an unmistakable icy chill. She straightened, her stance stiff and commanding."If Cedric hit you,why don't you go straight to him?"


The implication was clear-he still saw her as an easy target.


He was too afraid to confront Cedric, but had the audacity to come to her, hoping she'd pay him off.


Alexander yelled, "I came to you because all of this is your fault. You're the cause of it all. You're the one responsible."


Daniela let out a light, mocking laugh. It had been a while since she'd come across someone so utterly shameless.



She used to think Alexander was a man of pride and respect, but now? "What do you want me to do?"


"Give me the airport project!" Alexander demanded without a hint of shame.



"That's impossible," Daniela replied firmly. "The project's already been assigned. At Elite Lux, we keep our word. Any company that fails inspection three times is permanently blacklisted."



Alexander grasped his face in frustration, his voice rising with anger. "It's because Cedric sabotaged us!" Daniela remained silent, her cold, emotionless gaze locked on him. Her expression seemed to say,"And?So what if he sabotaged you?"



But her silence only made Alexander's frustration grow."So you're going to back him no matter what,huh?Fine! If the project is off the table, then just give me money instead!"



Daniela raised an eyebrow, her voice dripping with disbelief. "You want me to give you money?"


Fuming with rage, Alexander didn't realize that Daniela had leaned back in her chair, her fingers casually grazing her phone.



"Yes!" he snapped, his voice brimming with indignation.


To his surprise, Daniela nodded without a word of protest. "How much do you want?"


Alexander froze, his eyes locked on her, confusion swirling in his mind.



Why was she being so compliant all of a sudden?



"Three hundred million!"



"Three hundred million?" Daniela echoed, her voice incredulous.



"Yes!" Alexander affirmed, his conviction strong. "Are you certain?" Daniela's gaze narrowed as she let the words sink in, stretching them out deliberately."Three hundred million?"



A flicker of excitement flashed in Alexander's eyes as Daniela reached for her checkbook from the desk drawer. He nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! Three hundred million!"



He hadn't anticipated Daniela would be so agreeable.



In that instant,one thought crossed his mind-he should've asked for more.



He stole another glance at Daniela, watching as her pen hovered above the check, poised to write.



Suddenly, a deep, steady male voice broke the silence in the room. "That's enough."



Daniela stopped mid-motion, lowering her pen Without a second look at Alexander, she shut the checkbook and slid it back into the drawer.



"What? Who's speaking?" Alexander instantly tensed,his eyes darting across the room.



Before he could ask any more questions, a knock echoed at the door. The door opened, and Elite Lux's attorney entered, holding a small recorder in his hand.Without a word, the attorney pressed play. Alexander's voice blared out, loud and unmistakable,demanding three hundred million from Daniela.



The attorney's voice remained composed but carried a sharp edge. "Mr. Bennett, I strongly advise you to leave right now. Given the sum you just demanded from Ms. Harper, this is nothing short of extortion.If you continue down this path, I assure you, the rest of your life will be spent behind bars. Moreover, should you ever make any public remarks or take any actions that tarnish the reputations of Ms. Harper or Mr.Phillips,we will pursue legal action with every tool at our disposal. I suggest you consider your next move very carefully."



Alexander stood frozen, his mind reeling from the unexpected twist. He turned to Daniela with disbelief written all over his face. "You set me up?"



All the words she had spoken earlier? They hadn't been an attempt to negotiate. They had been bait-and he had walked right into the trap.



Alexander's chest constricted, the weight of realization crashing down on him like a sledgehammer.



He had come here today, swallowing his pride,hoping for one last chance to make things right. He was convinced that Daniela still cared and that they could work things out. But she had turned her back on him-coldly, without hesitation-all for Cedric.



"Fine!" Alexander spat, his voice shaking with both fury and heartbreak. "Call the police! Do it! Go ahead!"


The attorney turned to Daniela, awaiting her instruction.



Without lifting her gaze, Daniela opened her drawer,took out her phone, and dialed it right in front of Alexander.



The moment the call connected, Alexander's resolve shattered. His fists clenched, his voice trembling as he muttered, "Fine! You win!"



Daniela hung up the phone.


Alexander gasped for air, his hand pressing against his chest as he staggered back. "Daniela, they always say when a woman stops loving a man, there's no going back. I used to believe you were different. I thought you weren't like those cold, shallow women. But I was wrong. You're just like them. No. You're worse. It's not you walking away from me, Daniela. It's me walking away from you!"



His eye reddened with so much emotion that, to anyone watching, it might have seemed like he was the one who had been betrayed.
###Chapter 143 Daniela Runs Dreamscape
Alexander finished his outburst,his anger spent,but he didn't move. He remained rooted to the spot while staring at Daniela, as if silently daring her to respond,giving them both one final chance.



Daniela slowly raised her gaze, her tone steady."Alexander, I never really blamed you."


He froze, taken aback by her unexpected words.



"| didn't come back for you. I was the one who chose to love you in the first place. That was my mistake.I fell for the wrong person. So no, I don't blame you at all.I understand that I can't control how someone else feels. You treated me badly because you simply didn't love me, and that's fine. It hurt, and I spent a long time questioning myself. I tried everything for you.l learned to drink, I learned to race cars, and I even tried to embrace Joyce, whom I once looked down on. We only get so many years in life, and for a decade, I chased after you. Those were the years of my youth that I can't get back. I always tried to make things between us as comfortable as possible because,even then, there was so much I admired about you. I hoped one day those memories would be worth holding on  to. But today, you've ruined it all. You've shattered everything I worked for. Your behavior has exposed the worst of human nature. All the things I gave up,the sacrifices I made... They mean nothing now. And whenever I think of the past, I'll remember that | loved someone who wasn't worth it. Do you know what that feels like? Your very existence disgusts me."



Daniela's voice was measured, each word deliberate and controlled. Despite the calmness in her tone, the weight of her words cut through him, one after another, each sharper than the last.


Alexander stood still, his gaze locked on her, seeing nothing but the disgust in her eyes.


After a while, a security guard appeared and escorted him out.



That night, Daniela sat alone in her office for hours,as if she were mourning the loss of a part of her youth that had been broken beyond hope.








After leaving Daniela's office, Alexander wandered back to the hospital in a daze.



As he reached the entrance, he ran into Joyce and Katrina, who were out for a walk.



The dim lighting made it hard to see, and Alexander's  face was streaked with blood.



Joyce let out a startled cry and staggered forward.Katrina screamed,"Help!"



Joyce collapsed, her abdomen hitting the ground, and she screamed out in pain.



Hospital staff rushed over with a stretcher to help her.



Alexander attempted to step in,but Katrina pushed him back with all her might. "Get out of here! Who do you think you are? You scared the future Mrs. Bennett!Stay right there! You've terrified my daughter, and you will pay for this!"



Katrina hurried after the stretcher, her steps frantic.



Alexander stood there, alone, in the chilly night air.



He found the situation both absurd and pitiful,but he couldn't bring himself to laugh.



Hadn't Joyce once said she loved him? Yet here she was, too scared to even recognize him, and had been so frightened that she fell.



Didn't Katrina want him as a son-in-law? Now she didn't even know who he was.



They were no different from Daniela, claiming to care but only looking out for their own interests. These women, so quick to turn away, deserved nothing but punishment for their hypocrisy.



Shaking off the anger, Alexander pushed forward,seeking the on-call doctor to tend to his injuries.Afterward, he made his way to the maternity ward.



Katrina, not recognizing him, swung at him in a blur of anger. But before she could make contact,Alexander's voice stopped her. "Daniela runs Dreamscape Research Institute."



Katrina froze,stunned by his words."What did you say?"


Caiden rose from his seat, his expression serious. He was deeply concerned, more than anyone, about the safety of the child growing in Joyce's womb. His eyes narrowed, and he demanded sharply, "What did you just say?"


Alexander let out a heavy sigh. "I'm Alexander. I just learned that Daniela is in charge of Dreamscape, the one with the heart repair technology that could save the baby. I went to her today, begging for help, but she and Cedric had me beaten senseless. You've seen how much I care for Joyce and her child. I gave up everything, including my marriage to Daniela,and even fought with both her and Cedric. But despite all that, I couldn't get the technology in time to save the baby. I've failed you." Alexander's swollen, bloodied face only seemed to reinforce the truth in his words.



The moment his words hung in the air, a newborn's cry echoed from the delivery room.



A doctor entered, beaming with a smile. "Both mother and baby are doing well. It's a boy, though his heart condition isn't ideal. He'll need his first procedure in two days."



The instant Caiden heard that, he grabbed the doctor by the shoulders.



"Doctor, you mentioned that Dreamscape's cardiac repair could save the baby from surgery. Is that true?"Caiden's voice was strained, his eyes locked on the doctor. Desperation filled his gaze



The doctor nodded. "Yes, but..."



Before the doctor could finish his sentence, Caiden and Katrina rushed off, clearly furious.



The doctor shouted after them, "But we don't know who runs Dreamscape!"



Alexander stayed behind, his eyes fixed on the baby.Without hesitation, he reached forward and lifted the newborn from the doctor's arms. The baby let out a sharp, wailing cry that echoed through the room.



A slow smile spread across Alexander's battered face,his expression twisted in the dim light, as a chilling grin formed.
###Chapter 144 Please Leave Immediately
"I must see Daniela now!" Caiden insisted fiercely.



"Apologies, sir, but it's the middle of the night. Ms.Harper has already retired for the evening. If this is urgent, I'd suggest returning at a more suitable hour,"said the security guard.



Katrina edged closer to Caiden. "Every moment we delay puts the child at greater risk. Remember what Alexander told us? Daniela and Cedric assaulted him when he tried to get the medicine for the child. It's obvious Daniela is deliberately avoiding you. This child is your future-your pillar in old age. It seems Daniela doesn't want you having anyone to lean on later in life!"



Caiden's temper exploded instantly at those words. He fixed a fierce glare on the security guard. "Do you have any idea who I am? I'm your boss's father, for fuck's sake! Without me, there's no Daniela, no building,and no shit for you to guard! Now get the hell out of my way!"



The guard remained unyielding. "I'm truly sorry, sir.However, these are not visiting hours. If you genuinely are Ms. Harper's father, perhaps you could call her?" "I am her father!" Caiden's words came out in a rush,and for a moment, he almost let slip that he didn't have her number.



Seizing his arm, Katrina shot him a cautionary look.She then turned to the guard, her expression melting into a persuasive smile. "We truly are Daniela's family.We came in such a rush we forgot our phones at home.Could we perhaps use your phone? We know her private number."



The guard eyed them suspiciously, uncertainty flickering across his face. He hesitated briefly before reaching for his phone. Yet, before his fingers could grasp it,Lillian came.



The guard greeted her with respect.


Lillian's gaze sharpened upon seeing the visibly agitated Caiden and Katrina waiting outside.



"They claim they're Ms. Harper's parents," the guard informed her.



Lillian snorted derisively, her arms crossed as she faced Caiden. "Oh, so now you're her parents? Didn't you cut ties with her? What,you suddenly forgot your own bullshit?"



Caiden's face darkened with fury. "Quit screwing around. Bring Daniela here before I lose my patience."Unmoved, Lillian yawned, signaling her disinterest."She's resting. If you have something important, I'm here to listen."



Caiden spat, "Talking to you is pointless! You don't call the shots! Drag Daniela's ass down here immediately!"



With a dismissive laugh, Lillian countered, "You can say it or not, the choice is yours. But at this late hour,I'm the one you're dealing with."



Beside him, Katrina gave Caiden a gentle push and murmured, "Just tell her. She's working for Daniela,isn't she?"



Caiden cast a quick glance at Katrina before refocusing on Lillian. "Look, it's clear Daniela runs Dreamscape, and your lab has concocted some groundbreaking heart repair tech. I need one of those miracle pills. If you've got the authority, pass it here and spare me a trip to Daniela!"



"Well?" Katrina, previously jittery, now exuded a calm demeanor as she observed Caiden's escalating frustration. She offered Lillian a sly smile and queried,"Can you make that decision, or should we have Daniela come down here? Of course, if you're not inclined to help us, we're more than willing to purchase it. It would be interesting to see if Daniela still values family ties or if she's lost touch with her origins."


Lillian's gaze sharpened, her mind racing.



She recognized that meddling in Daniela's familial conflicts was beyond her role.



The thought of mishandling the delicate matter and complicating things for Daniela filled her with dread.


Yet, the urge to wipe that smug expression off Katrina's face was almost overwhelming.



With no other recourse, Lillian texted Daniela,receiving no immediate response. After a tense pause,she dialed Daniela's number.



The phone barely completed one ring before Daniela picked up.



Katrina perched on her tiptoes, straining to catch a snippet of Daniela's conversation, but her words remained elusive.



Nearby, Caiden paced, a mask of impatience and concern etched across his face.



Whirling around, Katrina faced the security guard and flashed a knowing smirk. "See? I was right. We're still her family. Your earlier display of authority was quite over the top, don't you think? To an outsider, it might even appear as though you owned the place!" The guard's jaw tightened as he fought to keep his composure under her taunts.



Unperturbed, Katrina's sneer deepened. "It's just the way things are, isn't it? Some folks, like you, draw the short straw-destined for a badge and a uniform.Meanwhile, we're cut from a different cloth, born to bask in the lap of luxury."



Caiden echoed her disdain with a derisive look towards the guard.



The guard, biting back his retort, knew better than to engage. After all, the pair had introduced themselves as the president's parents.



Just then, Lillian hung up and faced them with a composed expression.



Katrina straightened with an air of authority, fully prepared to storm in. But just as she moved, Lillian's hand shot up, stopping her in her tracks.



Katrina's smug expression evaporated, her features contorting into a scowl of rage. "What is the meaning of this?"



"Our boss was very clear. Everyone is te master of their own fate, and she refuses to meddle in someone else's destiny. It's best if you leave now." She then turned to address the security guard. "And just so you know, the boss wanted me to inform you -she considers herself without parents now. Handle this as you deem appropriate. If they become troublesome, don't hesitate to call the police. You're an Elite Lux employee, empowered to reject unwelcome visitors. There's a $10,000 bonus for your discretion. Stop by the finance department tomorrow to claim it."



With a stretch that betrayed a hint of nonchalance,Lillian sauntered off.


Caiden and Katrina were left rooted to the spot, their eyes locked on the closing doors of the elevator as Lillian disappeared from view.



She just walked away? Was Daniela really going to let them suffer without giving a shit?



Unwilling to concede, Katrina took a determined step forward, only to be met by the security guard, who now brandished his baton with an authoritative grip.



"This is Elite Lux, not an open house," he stated icily,blocking their path.



His stance underscored his formidable presence,and the palpable tension caused Katrina to falter.



Katrina begrudgingly retreated toward the entrance. As they stood in the chilling gusts of wind, she turned to Caiden, worry etching her face. "What do we do now?"
###Chapter 145 What A Joke



Caiden had never imagined that Daniela would treat him with such indifference. After all, he was the man who gave her life. Yet, it became painfully clear that he could not rely on Daniela.



He came to the realization that the only one he could truly depend on was the newborn child.



Beside him, Katrina, her body shivering from the chill,understood Caiden's thoughts intimately after years of being together.She stoked his growing resentment and remarked, "Daniela is truly ruthless. It's understandable she might disregard me, since I'm not her real mother. But you're her father. She should at least consider speaking to you for the baby's sake.How can she be so heartless? Then again, those in business often show no mercy. Remember how her mother treated you? Had she not died so unexpectedly, you likely wouldn't have seen a penny of the Harper family's fortune. And now Daniela is just the same. She's indifferent to your suffering, leaving you to freeze out here. Perhaps she's hoping you'll simply pass away, making it easier for her to claim the Harper family's fortune for herself."



Caiden stood silently, his teeth chattering from the  cold. His eyes, though he spoke no word,conveyed the depth of his chilI and bitterness.



He felt as if the entire world scorned him, offering him no genuine respect, except forthe child. To him,only this baby represented a pillar of future support.



Caiden gritted his teeth, his voice a harsh growl as he declared, "Fine, I'll camp out here all evening. Let's see if Daniela has the guts to ignore me tomorrow. If she can stomach seeing her father endure the cold,then so be it. But does she really believe she can escape the gossip? The whispers will start!"



His voice carried a veneer of toughness, yet he scarcely managed thirty minutes before his resolve began to crumble.



Donning a bulky coat that Alexander had offered,Caiden and Katrina braced against the biting winter gusts.



Clutching the coat close, Katrina turned to Caiden and remarked, "It's Joyce who still cares for you.Without her,would Alexander ever show such kindness?Iknow youI've been angry with me over that disagreement with your mother, but regardless of what anyone says,Joyce and I have always supported you without fail.Consider this-who else would willingly give you her child? And yet, you forced her to agree to that harsh contract. Do you truly deserve her loyalty?" Amid the piercing cold, Caiden clenched his fists, his teeth clattering as he made a vow. "As long as Joyce's child remains faithful to me, he will inherit the entire Harper family's fortune. I'm changing my will immediately. Daniela won't get a dime."



In the shadowy night, a smile crept across Katrina's face. Her usual warmth returned as she softened her voice, her words a gentle caress in the chill air,comforting Caiden with her nurturing presence.



Caiden was slowly coming to terms with the realization that he had been a complete idiot to waste even an ounce of compassion on Daniela.



What did it matter if Daniela was his own flesh and blood? She had callously left him to endure the cold outside alone.



As the night wore on, both Caiden and Katrina could no longer bear the chill. They sought refuge in Alexander's car, where they cranked up the heat to fend off the frostbite-inducing temperatures.With the arrival of dawn, they were back on their feet, calling out for Daniela across the sprawling parking lot.



Caiden had not anticipated the extent of Daniela's cruelty. Evening came again, yet there was still no sign of her.



Even Katrina, the architect of their scheme, started to unravel with worry.



The hospital was pressing for a critical treatment for the infant, pushing Caiden to the brink of fury right at the doorstep of Elite Lux.



The turmoil attracted a substantial crowd and caught the attention of numerous news channels.



In front of rolling cameras, Caiden exploded with rage,branding Daniela as heartless and vile.


Amidst it all, Katrina sobbed uncontrollably, claiming she was at her wit's end.


Onlookers gathered in the lobby, murmuring and speculating. But when the hospital set a stern ultimatum, Caiden recognized that his back was against the wall.


After all his screaming, insults, and public tantrums aimed at Daniela, he was left burnt out and stuck in the same damn place.



Left with no alternatives, he finally set aside his ego and approached Lillian. "Could you please tell Daniela I want to see her? I'm really asking here. I'll let go of my pride if I need to."


Lillian's smirk was unfaltering, her composure steady even wth the cameras capturing every moment. "Had you shown this courtesy from the start, you wouldn't  be in this predicament. Elite Lux has dealt with its share of troublemakers. You thought you could intimidate us? Look where that's gotten you."


Lillian's eyes burned with contempt as she spat, "Get moving. What, you think you're so important someone's going to beg you to walk inside?"


Exhausted from two sleepless nights, Caiden's and Katrina's shoulders slumped as they followed Lillian.


As they neared the doorway, Lillian halted them abruptly. "Keep yourself in the cafeteria. We don't let people like you anywhere near the upstairs."


Caiden closed his eyes, frustration etching deeper lines across his face.



Such an ungrateful daughter!



The phrase echoed in his mind, a cruel reminder ofhis past leniency towards Daniela, making him feel utterly foolish.



What an absolute disgrace!
###Chapter 146 Far Beyond The Age For Jokes
The meeting unfolded in the cafeteria on the first floor.



Daniela, fresh from leading a conference, treated herself to a bowl of pasta, savoring each bite with a serene composure.



Merely a few paces from her, Caiden and Katrina found themselves hemmed in by a quintet of imposing security guards.



Daniela's voice carried a cool detachment as she addressed them. "If you have something to say, make it quick. You've got ten minutes."



Caiden's expression blended shock and pain. "Daniela,is this how you treat your own father?"



Unperturbed, Daniela continued to ate her food.  


Midway through her meal, she asked casually, "Did you take that document severing our relationship as nothing more than a joke?"



Caiden opened his mouth to respond, yet words failed him. Daniela pressed on, her tone unyielding. "After you exploited our last shred of familial ties to secure a position for Joyce,why pretend there's a fence left to mend?"



Katrina, attempting to diffuse the tension, chimed in with an overly bright smile. "Come on, that was just a family spat. Sometimes people say things they don't mean in the heat of the moment."



"Is that so? That agreement is upheld by the law,"Daniela retorted, her voice slicing through the air."You're both well beyond the age of such jokes. If there's something pressing on your minds, state it clearly. Don't waste my time."



Caiden's gaze lingered on Daniela's face, seeing echoes of Brylee in her features, and his eyes narrowed with resolve.



"Fine. Just give me the cardiac-repair medicine.Then I'll go," Caiden declared, clenching his teeth as he felt his dignity being eroded.



Katrina maintained her sweet demeanor, her smile unwavering. "Daniela, since it's clear you've stripped all sentiment from this equation, we shall not owe you any favors. Just name your price, and we'll settle it."



She deliberately raised her voice, making sure the media clustered at the door caught every word,  painting Daniela as ruthless and opportunistic.



As Katrina's words hung in the air, Daniela flicked a glance towards her before turning her eyes to the media throng at the entrance.



She arched an eyebrow and allowed a small, knowing smile to play on her lips.



It seemed like the perfect moment to unveil Dreamscape's latest breakthrough to the world.



"Yes," Daniela responded evenly. "We indeed possess the treatment you're inquiring about, and if you're prepared to meet the cost, that's agreeable to me."



Katrina,seizing the moment, leaned closer to Caiden and murmured conspiratorially, "Told you, didn't l?Daniela's all about the money-nothing else matters to her. She'd overlook even the bonds of family for profit. Once she states her price, let's skip the haggling. We'll manage it, for our baby's sake."


Katrina spoke with defiance, as though completely unafraid. She meant every word, or so it seemed.



Caiden responded with a look filled with gratitude and whispered tenderly, "Katrina, marrying you was the best decision of my life."



Radiating warmth and serenity, Katrina smiled at him.In her mind, the cost wouldn't be steep; after all,how  expensive could the medicine be?



All she wanted was to ruin Daniela's image completely.



If Daniela dared to take money for the medicine,Caiden's wrath would be absolute, and public opinion would cast her as the ruthless villain who turned her back on her family.



In Katrina's eyes, her strategy was foolproof.



"Three hundred million," Daniela declared, placing her fork on the table. Her gaze met Katrina's. "Transfer that sum to Dreamscape, and you'll get the medicine."


Katrina froze, her expression one of sheer disbelief."How much did you say?"



"Three hundred million," Daniela reiterated firmly,maintaining eye contact. "What's the problem? A moment ago, you appeared quite eager. Does this mean you don't value a human life at three hundred million?"



The smug smile that had been playing on Katrina's lips suddenly stiffened.


"Daniela, don't you dare push it! We've bought medicine before, and there's no way in hell it costs that much!" She strode towards the entrance, signaling to the gathering reporters. "See this for yourselves,everyone. Daniela's trying to extort money from us.  Three hundred million!"



Daniela's lips curled into a subtle smile.



That twisted smile made Katrina's blood run cold.



Of all things, nothing terrified her more than seeing Daniela grin like that.
###Chapter 147 Defiant Yet Sorrowful
Daniela's smile sent a sharp pang through Katrina's heart, causing it to skip erratically. Recoiling, she asked, "Why are you smiling like that?"



With a serene composure, Daniela gently wiped her lips with a napkin before responding nonchalantly,"Because you're being a fool."



Katrina felt a flush of embarrassment heat her cheeks.Surrounded by a sea of reporters, the sting of being publicly ridiculed as foolish was too much. She yearned to snap back fiercely but, catching the eyes of the crowd, her resolve melted into tears of frustration instead.



Her visible distress instantly softened Caiden's heart.He glared at Daniela, accusation sharp in his tone."You're exploiting our desperate need for this treatment to inflate the price, aren't you?"



Daniela's smile remained unfazed, a picture of tranquility and poise-a stark contrast to the visibly perturbed Katrina and the incensed Caiden.



Ignoring their accusations, Daniela turned gracefully to the assembled reporters and began to outline the  journey of their heart repair technology-from the early stages of research, through substantial investments in equipment, to years of meticulous experimentation, and finally, the modest yet significant breakthroughs.


Her words, imbued with conviction and transparency,resonated with the reporters, touching them with the evident passion and challenges her team had faced.



"Our institute's dedicated professors have devoted their lives to this project. Don't they merit some acknowledgment for their dedication? Isn't it right to honor their hard work and sacrifices appropriately?"



Her poignant words resonated deeply with everyone gathered.


The reporters and onlookers, stirred by her plea,responded with vigorous agreement, their voices echoing in solidarity, "Absolutely!"



Daniela's features softened, a mixture of relief and sorrow playing across her face. Her eyes, brimming with tears yet unshed, met the camera lenses. "Initially,we intended to present this research at a grander affair. Yet, circumstances have compelled us to proceed otherwise. The sheer scale of investment in this technology is astronomical-top-tier equipment,legions of engineers, and endless nights dev/oid of sleep. Is it unreasonable, then, to seek 300 million for  treatment?"



"No, it isn't!" the crowd roared back, some attendees visibly tearful, moved by her heartfelt words.


Daniela then fixed her intense gaze on Caiden. "Mr.Harper, do you still consider it expensive?" ①


Caiden's hand tightened into a fist, every muscle straining as if he was fighting the urge to unleash hell.



Was it expensive?



Securing 300 million would stretch Harper Group's finances to their limits.



Was it excessive?



The funds would be his own-undeniably, it was a hefty sum.



However, Daniela had expertly swayed the crowd,turningthem into her staunch allies.



The term "expensive" almost escaped his lips, but he restrained himself, keeping it unspoken.



Daniela's face was a mask of seriousness, her eyes methodically scanning the audience. "I never planned to air personal grievances in such a public forum,yet here we are, surrounded by onlookers and the integrity of our research institute hanging in the  balance. As many of you are aware, Katrina is my stepmother, and Joyce is my stepsister. Over the years, they have basked in opulence, whereas I was ostracized. Harper Group, my mother's legacy,seems forgotten. I often ponder-would my mother regret her choice in a partner if she witnessed this today?"



Caiden's reaction was one of utter disbelief. He pointed to Daniela, his voice shaking. "What are you implying?"



Daniela faced the audience again, her smile tinged with bitterness. "I'm suggesting that everything changed with my stepmother's arrival. I was sidelined as others reveled in the fortunes that were rightfully mine. And now, after all my endeavors and successes,Caiden and his scheming spouse seek to strip it all from me!"



Emotion overwhelmed Daniela; she clasped her chest,her voice breaking from the strain. "Tell me, does justice even exist anymore? Or is this world just one big pile of shit?"



Lillian advanced, placing a supportive hand on Daniela's shoulder, addressing the gathered reporters "You all know Ms. Harper rarely justifies her actions Yet today,circumstances have driven her to these extremes. Her father has disowned her; her quest for justice rests upon your shoulders!" Daniela flicked her hand dismissively. "Come on, Lillian,let's get out of here."



Lillian, standing tall yet imbued with a subdued grief,assisted Daniela as they made their way to the elevator.
###Chapter 148 Brylee's Death



The crowd jeered,hurling insults at Caiden, calling him a pathetic failure of a father.



Daniela entered the elevator and glanced at Lillian."What did you think of my speech?"



Lillian responded with a thumbs-up.



Back in her office, as Daniela settled in, a new secretary timidly approached Lillian. "Do you think Daniela is upset?"


Lillian shook her head with certainty. "She is warmly kind to those she respects, but she's swift and decisive in cutting ties with anyone who disappoints her."



Katrina and Joyce had felt the sting of her resolve.And now Caiden and Alexander had been added to that list.



Daniela's public confrontation was a clear sign she had already put any past relations behind her. There was no point in feeling sorry. They weren't worth her time or a damn ounce of her concern.



Meanwhile,Caiden was stewing in the shame of being completely humiliated. Daniela's harsh dismnissal had caught him off-guard.



Even if he handed over the three hundred million,people would still think he was a worthless piece of shit.



Favoring his stepdaughter over his own, squandering his ex-wife's earnings to coerce his biological daughter into handing over her research-every accusation was painfully accurate, leaving Caiden defenseless.



Katrina, anxious and wary of the media, whispered urgently from behind him, "Caiden, what should we do now? The hospital's expecting us."



Caiden clenched his teeth tightly and announced with a heavy heart, "Three hundred million... It looks like we'll have no choice but to sell the company."


Katrina immediately objected, her voice laced with desperation. "Absolutely not!"


Her expression twisted into one of fury as she seized Caiden's hand with a fierce grip. "You can't possibly sell it!"



Katrina had spent half her life serving Caiden,so that she could get her hands on Harper Group. But the discussion about selling the company was on the table.She was not prepared to surrender without a fight. Caiden held her hand firmly. "And what? Allow the child to die?" His eyes, red and frustrated, bore into hers as he shook with anger. "We need to prioritize saving the child! Everything else can wait. I promise you, whatever Daniela ends up taking, I'll reclaim it.Trust me."



Katrina felt a deep conflict stirring within her.



Locking eyes with Caiden, she realized arguing was futile.



With a heavy sigh,she nodded in agreement.


Her lips quivered in anger, tears born of frustration trailing down her face. Her body tensed, her shoulders stiffening,yet she gave a reluctant nod.



While Caiden was on the phone with Daniela, Katrina stood aside, her fingers digging into the flesh of her thigh, the pain a sharp reminder of her resolve.



She silently swore to herself to recover whatever losses were to come, at any cost.



Caiden called Daniela.



"Have you made your decision?" Daniela responded in a tone of cool indifference.



Caiden clenched his fists and growled through gritted  teeth, "I'll hand over twenty percent of Harper Group's shares! Just give me the damn medicine!"



Daniela responded with a soft, derisive chuckle, her amusement clear.



A wave of panic surged through Caiden. He had gambled on her ignorance of Harper Group's precarious situation.



He silently prayed she didn't realize that the twenty percent stake was merely worth five million dollars.Unfortunately,his hopes were dashed.



"Twenty percent? You think that's sufficient?"Daniela's voice cut through the air, sharp as a knife."Or are you implying that the life of a child is worth merely a few million?"



Caiden's heart raced, skipping a beat at her words.



"If you insist on playing these games, I'm not particularly bothered, but I doubt the child can afford to wait," Daniela continued calmly,her voice steady yet chilling.



Caiden found himself gasping for air, his breath catching in his throat.



"Fine, let's not complicate things unnecessarily,"Daniela declared evenly. "I demand fifty-one percent of Harper Group's shares. Agree, and the child lives. Otherwise,you're merely wasting my time here."



It dawned on Caiden that Daniela was after true control of Harper Group.



"Deal," he choked out, the word tasting of bile in his mouth.



His eyes smoldered with deep resentment.



Lillian shook her head, her expression one of bewilderment. "Why not demand everything? They'd probably yield if you pressed them further."



Reclining in her chair, Daniela narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. "Perhaps. But I've just had a change of heart."
###Chapter 149 | Should Have Taken Your Advice
Daniela's phone vibrated, announcing a video message from Ryan.



In the footage, Katrina lingered near the bathroom entrance,gripping her smartphone.She whispered into the device, "Mom, I'm doing everything I can to handle this mess, but if Caiden's decided to sell the company, there's nothing more I can do."



The reply from the other end was muffled and indecipherable.



Katrina's expression contorted with vexation as she retorted, "Doesn't that just prove Brylee had it coming?Damn it, I should've listened to you and finished her too back then. Now she's become an immense threat."



Suddenly, Katrina stiffened, her eyes flickering anxiously towards the security camera overhead. Then,she terminated the call smoothed down her dress,and strode off.



Seated in her office, Daniela clutched a pen so fiercely her knuckles blanched.



Katrina's mother had been dead for years, hadn't she? 
What could Katrina possibly mean by those ominous words?



Meanwhile, Caiden returned to the hospital bearing the new medication. Remarkably, the child became the first in the nation to show clinical improvement with this treatment, sidestepping the need for surgical intervention.



The medical team buzzed with excitement, eager to document this breakthrough and glean insights that might benefit others facing similar predicaments.



Caiden dismissively rejected the pleas from parents with sick children. His face twisted into a sharp,disdainful sneer as he snapped, "This is the health we paid for! Fund it yourselves! Why should you benefit from our child's plight? Dream on! Our child is a treasure, not a public spectacle!"



Outside the hospital room,desperate patients begged for assistance, but Caiden strode past them, utterly indifferent to their suffering.



In his eyes, his own interests always took precedence.


Elsewhere in the hospital, Alexander was recovering from a skin graft surgery when he overheard a news broadcast.



Richard, his eyes wide with astonishment, gestured  towards the television. "300 million for a single pill?That's astounding!"



A bitter smirk crossed Alexander's lips, pulling painfully at his fresh stitches, making him grimace."Daniela's making quite the spectacle. She's using this to embarrass Caiden."



Richard nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. "But why didn't she just seize control of the entire company? It was her mother who established it, after all. What stopped her from going after the entire company? Is there still a part of her that cares about Caiden, even after everything?"



Alexander's scoff was tinged with scorn,his expression growing sterner. "That kind of emotion doesn't exist in Daniela's world. Look at my scars-do you really think a person capable of this harbors any kindness? Her beauty is merely a facade, a tool for devastation."



Richard cast a glance at Alexander. It sounded like Alexander had moved on from Daniela.



Yet, when the surgeon posed a question about whether Alexander desired his post-operative appearance to mirror his former self or to be altered,Alexander wanted it to be as it was before.



Richard believed Alexander still had lingering affections for Daniela. As Alexander and Richard ambled near the maternity ward, Caiden's loud curses came from within. The whole corridor echoed with his voice.



Richard and Alexander slowed their steps, drawn by the commotion.



"Daniela! What a fucking nightmare she is! If I'd known the hell Brylee was bringing, I'd have stopped it before it started!"



Katrina let out a soft sigh.



Caiden continued, "For fuck's sake, now that she's holding 51%, she thinks she's untouchable, turning Harper Group into a playground for her lackeys.What's her endgame? To push her own father out?"



On the other side of the glass door, Alexander observed as the veins on Caiden's neck stood out starkly,his fury palpable and filling every corner of the room.
###Chapter 150 Caiden's Grand Plan
A mischievous grin curled at the corners of Katrina's mouth. "Caiden,why fight Daniela for Harper Group?We've still got 49% of the shares, and look at her now -she's running both Elite Lux and Dreamscape. Even if a small slice of the profits from those companies flows into Harper Group, it'd be enough to revive it.Wouldn't it be smarter to just sit back and watch the money roll in?"


Upon hearing this, Richard and Alexander shared a meaningful look.



It was evident that Katrina possessed a more strategic mind than Caiden.



Meanwhile, Caiden sat stiff as a board,his bruised ego plastered all over his face. He detested the very notion. The company his late wife had established thrived under her direction but dwindled on his watch,now teetering on the brink of collapse. The senior executives' growing discontent with his leadership was palpable.



Was it the right move for Daniela to take control? Her cutthroat efficiency promised a swift resurgence for  Harper Group. Yet, the mere thought tormented Caiden.What would the public think?


They would label him a failure, a man devoid of personal achievement.


First, he had depended on his wife, and now on his daughter?



What a pathetic way to ruin his reputation!


Observing the turmoil etched across his face, Katrina leaned closer. "Why concern ourselves with idle gossip? Daniela is your flesh and blood. If she revitalizes Harper Group and fortifies it, our dividends by year's end will surely swell. Truly, what weight do the opinions of strangers hold? Ultimately,it is we who will enjoy the fruits of her labor."



Under Caiden's stewardship, the trajectory of Harper Group had nosedived, marking yet another dismal ###Chapter in its history.



Two years ago, a senior executive had walked out,shamelessly dragging an entire production line with him.



The following year, the company's top salesperson had resigned, taking their most lucrative client with them.



This year,the situation had deteriorated further. A slew  of key employees had defected, draining all business from the northern region. Caiden had spent hours furiously cursing and shouting, yet his efforts were futile against the rapid decline of Harper Group.


Daniela had offered to sell them medicine for three hundred million, but even if they sold the entire company, it wouldn't fetch that amount.


The factory workers had lost their drive, going through the motions without passion.



The machinery had been neglected since Brylee's demise.



Meanwhile, in the office,most employees were biding their time, eagerly anticipating bankruptcy to claim their severance.



For Katrina, Daniela's offer to salvage this floundering company seemed like a reasonable arrangement.


In her view, by taking on this challenge, Daniela would effectively be serving their cause.



After making this realization, Katrina's spirits lifted considerably, and she set about persuading Caiden."Why not show some generosity for a change? Pass the reins of the company to Daniela. With Elite Lux's backing, she'll bolster Harper Group effortlessly,Imagine us in the future, just relaxing at home while profits from Harper Group pad our bank account. Doesn't that sound wonderful?"



Stroking his arm lightly, she went on, "Daniela has everything she could possibly desire. She doesn't actually need Harper Group for herself. She's only interested because it holds sentimental value-Brylee built it from nothing. As long as that emotional tie remains,Daniela will never let Harper Group falter."



Caiden looked over at Katrina, skepticism flickering in his eyes. "Do you really believe that?"



"Yes. Let Daniela deal with the hard stuff while she works her ass off making us money!"



This reassurance seemed to ease Caiden's concerns somewhat.



Glancing down at the newborn cradled in his arms,his mood brightened even more, and he declared, "You're right! Let Daniela accumulate wealth for our little treasure-plenty of it! Tomorrow, I'll head over to the company.Honestly,these years in charge have been nothing short of grueling!"



He had always felt out of place in his role. His subordinates held little regard for him, and his series of missteps had led to a string of disasters.



After losing significant orders time and again, his standing in the company had deteriorated irreparably.Even he had to admit that he was in over his head and  it was time for him to move on.



With a renewed sense of resolve, Caiden took out his phone and composed a message to Daniela, asking her to join him at Harper Group the following day to discuss the management transition. He was prepared to relinquish his position as chairman and pass on the leadership.



Richard and Alexander walked away from the hospital room in silence.



As they strolled down the hallway, Richard broke the silence. "Katrina's cunning and manipulative ways are something else. And with Daniela's tenacity, don't be surprised if Harper Group makes a swift comeback,especially with Elite Lux in their corner. Considering Katrina's influence, Joyce's prospects are looking pretty solid. It's something you might want to ponder."



Alexander remained silent.



Richard glanced over at him, only to find Alexander's face devoid of any reaction, as if the words had passed him by unheard.



Richard let out a quiet sigh. It was clear Alexander still hadn't gotten over Daniela.



When they returned to Alexander's ward, Caiden burst in. "I'll be seeing Daniela tomorrow at Harper Group to wrap up the handover. Alexander, you have a knack for these negotiations. Could you join me? And about Joyce and the baby-we owe you so much,Alexander.Once things calm down, we'll throw a grand banquet in your honor. Would you mind accompanying me tomorrow? Daniela... well,you know her tactics. She's sly and full of maneuvers. There's no way I can take her on alone!"



Richard shot a look at Alexander.



With a nod, Alexander signaled his agreement.



Caiden departed with a joyful stride.



As soon as he was gone, Richard emitted a sharp scoff. "What an impudent request. If it weren't for your intervention, their baby would be undergoing surgery right now. And all they promise is a banquet in the future? He didn't even bother to bring a gift for you, and now he brazenly asks for your help again tomorrow? It's astounding!"



Turning to Alexander, Richard's expression darkened with fury. "Are you actually planning to go with that bastard tomorrow?"



Tugging the blanket over himself, Alexander settled into the hospital bed and replied, "Yeah." Richard opened his mouth to protest, but Alexander had already shut his eyes, cutting off further discussion.
###Chapter 151 Cedric's Confession
 Returning from his business trip, Cedric was met with the infuriating news-Caiden and his wife had once again made things difficult for Daniela.



He lingered in the doorway, his expression somber and contemplative.



It was only when Daniela emerged from her office that his demeanor softened into a smile.



Stepping towards her, Cedric asked, "Might I join you for dinner tonight?"



Daniela asked, "Has your grandmother driven you out once more?"



Cedric nodded, a rueful smile tugging at his lips."Indeed. She has forbidden me from returning home this evening. Since Lillian and Ryan are already under your roof,could you possibly spare a corner for me as well,just for tonight?"



As dinner approached, Cedric persisted with his request. Beside them, Ryan chimed in, "We'll play games in my room. We won't bother you." Daniela gave a nod of approval.



Her home was a frequent gathering spot anyway.Aside from the private floor for Daniela alone, the rest floors were filled with guest rooms.  



Although each member of Elite Lux had their own residence, they all had their respective rooms in Daniela's place.



Initially,Daniela was hesitant.Cedric seemed the least likely to need her hospitality, yet there he was,seeking solace in her home.



She was well aware of the true motive behind his questions, though she had never openly admitted or accepted it.



After the evening meal, Cedric made his way to her door and knocked lightly.



Without waiting for an invitation, he entered and quietly took a seat in a chair, his eyes fixed on her.



Fresh from the shower, Daniela was clad in a plain white loungewear set, her hair still damp. "What's on your mind?"



Cedric remained seated, his demeanor grave and thoughtful. He had not bothered to change from the shirt and slacks he had worn earlier that afternoon.



His intense gaze locked onto Daniela, unwavering and deep.



For a brief moment, Daniela averted her eyes, letting out a soft sigh before steeling herself to return his gaze,her expression unreadable.



The room was thick with silence for a tense few seconds.



Cedric's face grew even more somber as he finally spoke, his voice low and steady. "Daniela, it's been a year and a half since your divorce."



Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around the pen she was holding, betraying a flicker of emotion. "Yes."



"Things have changed a lot since then. I've restrained myself," Cedric admitted, his voice slow but firm."Fear has gripped me-the fear of pressing too hard,the trepidation of causing offense, and the anxiety that you might feel uneasy. I was petrified of upsetting you in any way. Thus, I chose to bide my time,considering perhaps you required space to heal and to discover your true desires. I tried to make my way into your life gently, like a soft breeze you wouldn't think twice about. My only wish was to become someone important to you, without you ever catching on to how  much it meant to me. Over the last eighteen months,I've carefully avoided overstepping. I refrained from actions or words that might seem too assertive. I've kept myself in check, abiding by my own boundaries,waiting endlessly for the right moment."



Daniela gave him a thoughtful look.



"I don't mind the wait. Yet, it breaks my heart to watch you suffer, knowing I'm stuck on the sdelines as just a friend. Daniela, I yearn to shield you. It pains me to witness anyone push you around. I want the world to recognize that you have an ally, that you are never alone. I've made up my mind-I won't wait for fate to decide. It's clear that you and Alexander are done, so I'm stepping forward now. I want to be the one who's there for you. Whether I succeed or not is irrelevant to me. From this moment on, I'm claiming my place in your world. And when you're ready to open your heart,I want to be the one you choose first."



Cedric laid his heart bare, speaking with a fiery determination he rarely allowed himself to show.



For a few moments, Daniela remained silent, her eyes narrowing as she evaluated him.



Realizing his forwardness might have been too much,Cedric's demeanor softened, his voice now/ carrying a hint of desperation. "Look, from here on out,consider me a suitor, okay? Don't shut me out. Just give me a  shot."



Cedric abruptly stood up, hoping to leave on a strong note, but in his haste, he knocked over the chair behind him.



Flustered, he righted the chair, his cheeks coloring with embarrassment, and he hurried out of the room without another word.



Shortly after, Lillian stepped in from the balcony,having just ended a phone call. With a quick,incredulous look at Daniela, she shook her head in exasperation. "Did Cedric actually just take off like that? After pouring his heart out like that, he doesn't even stick around for your response? Is he for real?Can you believe this is the same guy who pulled off that huge international deal recently?"
###Chapter 152 Daniela Takes Over The Harper Group
As dawn broke, Caiden made his way to Harper Group,accompanied by Alexander, whose recent skin graft was visibly healing.



They entered the CEO's office, where Caiden nonchalantly tossed his feet onto the desk and motioned for Alexander to make himself comfortable.



Alexander cast a scrutinizing glance around the room,his expression unreadable as he took everything in.



The desk was a chaotic stack of documents needing approval, official seals, and stamps-all disorganized and scattered.



His eyes then caught a piece of paper on the floor.Stooping to retrieve it, he realized it was Harper Group's business license.



Despite being aware of Caiden's lax approach to business, the level of disorder still shocked Alexander.



"Don't fuss over that," Caiden remarked casually, as he placed a steaming cup of coffee on a nearby table,settling back with a relaxed air. "Daniela will be here soon to sort out this disaster. I'm tired of managing  this circus; it's her turn to take the reins."



Flashing a self-satisfied grin, Caiden leaned back further. "If Daniela can elevate Harper Group to compete with Elite Lux, my remaining forty-nine percent stake could turn into a gold mine."



He smiled, basking in the glow of his imagined future riches.



Alexander sat across from Caiden. "Daniela has climbed her way to the top; she's clearly capable. Do you really think she'll accept defeat without a fight?"



Just moments earlier,Alexander had eavesdropped on the chief financial officer detailing a grim financial reality: the company was drowning under a debt exceeding seven hundred million dollars.



The only lifelines were bank loans and a handful of clients still loyal to Brylee.



On the outside, Harper Group maintained its majestic facade, yet internally, it was mere shadow of its former self.



Alexander found it astonishing how effectively Caiden had managed to run the corporation into the ground.



Engrossed in his thoughts, Alexander's contemplation was interrupted by the buzz of his phone. It was a message from Caiden containing a list of contacts. Puzzled, Alexander raised his eyebrows at Caiden.



With a sly grin, Caiden responded, "Your tip about Joyce's baby was a lifesaver, and I'm grateful you joined me here today. That list? It's our last batch of solid clients. Feel free to transition their accounts to Bennett Group. Tell them I approved the move."


Relaxed in the glow of the well-lit office, Caiden leisurely sipped his coffee, a subtle smile playing on his lips.



From where he stood, Alexander could see Caiden's blatant disregard for Daniela, his own daughter.


He couldn't help but remember the day Daniela was a drunken mess, and the Harper famnily treated her like trash left out on the curb.



Even now,it seemed like the whole world had turned its back on her.



Tucking the list-a generous offering from Caiden-into his pocket, Alexander sensed the tension in the air.



By nine o'clock, whispers of impending doom circulated among the employees.



Caiden remained detached, offering no reassurances.When they questioned him about what to do next,his  response was firm and clear. "Wait for Daniela.If she's truly capable as they claim, she'll prove herself. I'm eager to see if she possesses her mother's unshakable grit in crisis situations!"



As the clock struck ten, the secretary notified them of Daniela's arrival.



Moments later, the door to the CEO's office burst open. Daniela entered, her stride confident, her presence commanding.



She was not alone; accompanying her were Ryan,Lillian, Cedric, and a lead auditor.



Caiden rose from his seat, his eyes locked on Daniela in disbelief. "You've brought an auditing team to scrutinize your own father's company? How dare you!"



Ignoring the tension, Daniela walked over to the executive chair and settled into it with an air of authority.


Behind her, Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric lined up, their faces masks of unwavering confidence.


Daniela began, "We've legally dissolved any familial bonds. This isn't just a family matter; it's business. And with fifty-one percent of the shares in my possession,I have full authority here. I need you to hand over every financial record and key document now. After a thorough audit and the transfer of documents, I will assume leadership of Harper Group."



This poised declaration took Alexander by surprise.



It had never crossed his mind that Daniela might actually understand the intricacies of business affairs.



He had always presumed her accomplishments were more a stroke of fortune than expetise.



"And what if I refuse? The company's right here. Take it if you can, or walk away." A derisive smirk twisted Caiden's lips, the frustration of being trapped evident in his expression.



Daniela's tone was serene as she delivered her ultimatum. "Each day you resist, the company will be shut down. I can absorb such losses. Can you?"


Caiden glared at her, incredulous. "What the hell,Daniela? You're more vicious than I ever thought you could be!"



The cost of shutting down would bleed the company of hundreds of thousands daily. Caiden's stake in this venture was personal-he aimed to lay down a sturdy groundwork for Joyce's offspring.


"This is standard protocol during a takeover. You've been running this firm for a decade. Don't tell me you're clueless about how a handover works.Your ignorance has been apparent for too long." Daniela's  eyes then fell to the business license under Caiden's foot. "Under your leadership, Harper Group nearly crumbled from a titan to ruins. We know who's responsible."



Rising, Daniela exuded an icy demeanor that made Caiden instinctively recoil.



Without a flicker of emotion, she approached him,locking eyes briefly, her expression unreadable.



Caiden, reminded of Brylee by the intensity in Daniela's gaze, took a cautious step back.



Daniela's eyes then dropped to the license on the floor,her voice cutting through the tension. "Pick itup."
###Chapter 153 The Harper Group Is Changing Hands	 
As Daniela's words echoed in the air, a chill of fear raced through Caiden. He instinctively recoiled,taking a step back.



Under the relentless intensity of Daniela's gaze,Caiden realized she was no longer the person he once knew. When had she turned into this formidable figure,utterly independent and unyielding? With a fiery intensity, she hissed through clenched teeth, "Pick it up.Now!"



Caiden's throat tightened, visibly swallowing his apprehension.



Observing his hesitation, Alexander intervened. He leaned down, scooping up the fallen business license,and extended it towards Daniela. "There's no need to be so severe. Caiden is still your father." He spoke with a measured calm.



However,Daniela snapped her head up, locking eyes with Alexander. A scornful laugh escaped her lips. "Is that so? Go ahead and wait for Richard to drop dead,and when some bastard shows up to rob you blind,we'll see if you'll be singing the same tune." Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.


Daniela didn't wait for an answer. "You have one week.I expect every document and account to be in order by then. Fail, and I'll personally drag every one of you down with this sinking Harper Group."



With a decisive turn, Daniela marched out, her steps resolute.



Caiden, consumed by a surge of rage, opened his mouth to shout after her, but his fury choked the words in his throat.



Daniela strode from the CEO's office to the conference room, her heels echoing sharply against the floor.



Within five minutes, she had gathered the department heads around the polished conference table.



With the current employee roster clutched in one hand,Daniela briskly checked off several names, then handed the list to the HR representative from Elite Lux.Her voice was firm, her command unequivocal. "By tomorrow, anyone whose name is crossed out better be out of Harper Group. I don't want to see their faces again."



Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with  Her biting statement hit Alexander hard, leaving him stunned and unable to muster a response.

"By tomorrow, anyone whose name is crossed out better be out of Harper Group. I don't want to see their faces again."



Several managers sprang up, their faces etched with shock and  disbelief. One of them, his finger jabbed  towards Daniela in accusation, sputtered, "Who the hell do you think you are? You can't just fire us! Do you realize how long we've served here? Do you know how close your father and I are?"



Daniela, leaning forward with her palms flat against the cool surface of the table, met their gazes with a steady, unflinching look. "I don't give a damn about how long you've been here or your ties with Caiden.From this moment forward, I'm the only Harper who matters here."



She then snatched up the finance report, scanning its contents with eyes that seemed to burn with resolve.The finance manager quivered, his face a mask of anxiety as her scrutiny bore into him.


Addressing the visibly shaken manager, Daniela's tone was icy as she delivered her demand. "Inform Caiden that he needs to return every single penny he siphoned from Harper Group. If he fails to comply, I will not hesitate to press charges for embezzlement and ensure he spends his remaining days behind bars."



With a swift mental tally, Daniela concluded, "The total comes to precisely one hundred eighty million.Additionally, there's a villa on the east side of the city purchased under the company's name for Jack Harper.Liquidate it and return the funds to our accounts."



Leaning against the doorframe, Caiden felt as if a fist  had slammed into his stomach.



He watched, his eyes wide, as Daniela unleashed a torrent of sharp questions at the managers from operations, development, and marketing.


One after another, these seasoned players in corporate politics crumbled beneath her relentless interrogation.



In that instant, a grim, icy realization dawned on Caiden.



Daniela had him completely at her mercy.



When she finally exited, the conference room descended into a hushed silence.



Not a single soul dared to speak.



They exchanged wary glances before dispersing quickly to compile the information Daniela had commanded.



As they hustled out, they brushed past Caiden, giving him only fleeting glances before lowering their gazes and scurrying away to attend to their duties.



It was clear to everyone that the reins of Harper Group were being handed over.



The days of easy rides were decisively behind them. Caiden remained rooted to the spot, watching as those who had previously sought his favor now passed him by without a word.


A frigid weight pressed down on his chest, growing heavier with each passing moment.
###Chapter 154 You Remind Me Of Someone I Knew
"Whatdid you just say?" Katrina burst out, her voice seething with rage inside the hospital walls.


She had just ended a phone call and her first impulse was to unleash her fury on Caiden, but she restrained herself.


Taking several deep, calming breaths did little to soften the icy edge in her voice. "Caiden, my cousin just called. Have you really dismissed their whole family from the company?"


Caiden was seated on a bench, distress evident as he ran his fingers through his hair. "Daniela stormed into the office today and completely overran my authority!"



Katrina had braced herself for Daniela's bold moves against Caiden, yet the extent of the purge took her by surprise. All her carefully placed allies within Harper Group had been ousted overnight.



To the outside world, it might appear that only her cousin's family was tied closely to her,but she had strategically positioned individuals across crucial departments like finance, marketing, and public relations. Now, they had all been swept away wvithout exception.



Daniela's audacity left Katrina reeling. In that moment,she understood just how much she had underestimated Daniela's capabilities.



"Daniela even mentioned that the villa we acquired for Jack needs to be sold off and the assets liquidated,"Caiden continued, a mix of anger and disbelief in his voice. "She's also demanding that all the embezzled funds and transferred assets be returned to the company."



"How on earth does she know all these details about our business?" Katrina pressed, incredulity lacing her voice.



"How should I know? There's got to be a spy among us!" The very idea of Daniela tearing apart the company he'd nurtured for more than ten years hit Caiden like a punch in the gut,leaving him seething with unease.



In that regard, Daniela was a carbon copy of her mother-cold, calculating, and utterly heartless.



A deep frown creased Caiden's brow, his mind a whirlwind of disarray.



Daniela's assertive actions earlier had filled him with dread, planting seeds of profound anxiety within him "The funds have been transferred, and the villa's in our name now. You're still her father, Caiden. Even if she cuts you off, she wouldn't drag you into court.Just let her be!"



Katrina, ever the optimist, clung to the hope that Daniela would not abandon Harper Group.



Caiden's voice was a low murmur, tinged with certainty. "No, Katrina, you don't understand Daniela.She's relentless, just like her mother. If we don't meet her demands,she'll take legal action without a second thought."



Though Katrina scorned Caiden's timidity inwardly,she maintained a cheerful demeanor. "Alright, let's not rely on her then. What if I manage it? I can sell the villa and bring back the overseas funds. Would that work for you?"



This suggestion finally brought a sense of relief to Caiden.



Once Caiden had left, Joyce turned to Katrina with a hint of reluctance in her voice. "Mom, all this should be mine. Why should I have to return anything to Daniela?"



As she sat beside Jack's cradle, Katrina's gaze rested on the newborn, her lips curling into a soft, serene smile. "Don't worry; I know what I'm doing. What belongs to you will always remain yours. No one can take that away."



Katrina then leaned forward, engaging playfully with Jack,who responded with joyful giggles.



When Daniela returned from her meeting at Harper Group,her demeanor was noticeably subdued.



Observing this, Lillian turned to Cedric, her voice tinged with concern. "What should we do now?"



Cedric didn't respond; instead, he walked purposefully into the kitchen. Moments later, he returned, bearing a plate of Daniela's favorite pastries, and gently tapped on her office door.



Inside, the business certificate that had been tarnished and trampled upon lay cleaned and flattened on the desk.



Setting the pastries aside, Cedric picked up a damp cloth and began to cleanse every speck of dirt from the certificate.



Only after restoring it to pristine condition did he place it in a new frame and returned it to its rightful spot on Daniela's desk.



"Things that get dirty can be cleaned. What's  important is ensuring that what's taken is always returned."



Daniela looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the warm,ambient light of the office. In Cedric's serene expression,she recognized something deeply familiar."Cedric, you remind me of someone I once knew in my childhood."
###Chapter 155 Cedric Lost His Temper
The moment Daniela's words hit him, Cedric's shoulders went rigid, his tension palpable.



He remained hunched over for an extended period, his heart racing wildly in the oppressive quiet.



Then,he gradually straightened, his eyes locking with Daniela's for a brief moment before he could utter a word.



Abruptly, the office door burst open.



Katrina appeared in the doorway, her face buried in her hands,sobbing uncontrollably.



Daniela's brow furrowed in response.



Out of breath, the secretary burst into the room,her voice trembling. "Ms. Harper, I'm so sorry! I tried to stop her, but she pushed right past me!"



Katrina collapsed against the desk, her tears falling uncontrollably as she begged, "Daniela, your father is in a dire state! You need to go to him."



Shock rippled through Cedric's face, his features  twisting in disbelief.



Peering through her handkerchief, Katrina caught Daniela's gaze-cold, detached, her piercing eyes unflinching as they stared back.


A relentless pounding filled Katrina's chest, her heartbeat surging with raw emotion.



"Why are you looking at me like that?" Katrina demanded, her panic barely masked by a sharp edge in her tone.



She sensed an unspoken accusation in Daniela's steady gaze, an intangible something she couldn't identify.



"Oh dear!" Katrina's distress intensified, her actions becoming more theatrical. "Daniela, you can spew all the nonsense you want about cutting ties, but at the end of the day, his blood still runs in your veins. Your father's about to die, and you act like it's nothing What the hell is wrong with you? How can you be so ruthless?"



Daniela rose slowly, her eyes narrowing,scrutinizing Katrina as if she were a suspect under interrogation."Yes, I am ruthless. Knowing that, why bother coming to me?"



Katrina, taken aback, had not anticipated such calm composure from Daniela, nor such a chilling retort. For a brief moment, she was momentarily speechless,the thick layers of makeup unable to mask the crimson spreading across her cheeks. "You..."



"Funny how this works," Daniela declared, her voice sharp and emphatic. "Caiden was perfectly healthy before.Now,suddenly, when I take over the company,he becomes sick? Katrina, don't you think it's a little too convenient to be a coincidence?"



At her words, Cedric glared at Daniela, his mind racng.She had the chance to destroy the Harper family and turn the company inside out, but instead, she only took 51% of the shares.



Katrina's heart raced, yet she managed to maintain a composed facade. "Daniela, what exactly do you mean by that? Are you implying I harmed your father?Even if you refuse to acknowledge me as your stepmother, my devotion to your father is genuine.I couldn't possibly want any harm to come to him just for some minor profit. If you truly doubt his condition,perhaps you should verify it yourself."



Daniela's gaze was icy as she fixed it on Katrina."Harper Group means more to you than a 'minor profit,' doesn't it? You'd stop at nothing to get what you want,right?"



A luxury villa and offshore assets-how could anyone reduce those to minor profit? Daniela turned and made her way downstairs, Cedric on her heels.



As she approached the car, she swung the door open and found Cedric already waiting inside.



Daniela tilted her head slightly, a faint, amused smile playing on her lips. "Cedric, honestly, you don't have to follow me around like this. They wouldn't dare touch me."



Cedric's face was a mask of icy severity, contrasting sharply with Daniela's demeanor. He fixed her with a piercing gaze and questioned, "What are you suspecting?"



Upon hearing Katrina's mention of Caiden's illness,Daniela had remained unmoved. But Cedric's question made her hesitate momentarily. Then, with a faint smile, she responded, "What could I possibly suspect?Didn't Katrina accuse that I suspect she refused to return the money and decided to hurt Caiden over it?"



Cedric crossed his arms, his gaze unwavering and full of curiosity."And?"



Daniela blinked, chuckling. "And what more is there to say?"



"What do you think? Is there more?" "I'm not sure."


The car was gripped by a suffocating stillness, thiek with unspoken tension.



The driver stole glances at them through the rearview mirror, picking up on the charged atmosphere.



What exactly were they discussing?


He could grasp each word, but their conversation seemed like a puzzle, the pieces not quite fitting together.



Halfway through the rde. Daniela started to think Cedric had given up on conversation entirely.



However,Cedric exhaled sharply, turning to face her more fully. "Why did you only claim 51 percent of Harper Group's shares? Why weren't you surprised about Caiden's condition? And why did you confront Katrina in such a manner?"



Daniela was bombarded with questions, each one striking with increasing intensity.



The driver,eavesdropping with a mix of curiosity and confusion,found himself pondering the same things.



He stole another glance at her through the rearview mirror. This time, Daniela remained silent, her usual poise replaced by a visible unease.



For the first time, she seemed genuinely troubled,sparking a flicker of intrigue in the driver. He was about to look again when Cedric's intense gaze turned from Daniela's perturbed expression to the driver.



Sensing Cedric's scrutiny, the driver quickly straightened up, his attention snapping forward.


"Then..." Daniela began, her voice lacking its usual conviction. "Why do you think that is?"



"I don't know! But there must be a reason you're keeping from me!" Cedric's voice brimmed with frustration.



As someone who held a high position, he was accustomed to masking his emotions. But now, his fury was unmistakable,coursing through him alongside the sting of betrayal.



"Daniela, you don't need to explain yourself, but until I grasp your intentions, don't assume you can operate independently. I'll be keeping an eye on you!"



He was resolute about not leaving her side until he had neutralized any threats. His intuition hinted at the motives behind Daniela's actions, though he remained uncertain. Clenching his jaw, his grip tightened on his knee.



He turned to look at her, the interplay of light and shadows from the passing streetlamps casting her features in a dramatic relief. Her eyes,usually vibrant,now appeared dim and weary.



The sight softened his resolve momentarily, and he found himself reluctant to press her further.
###Chapter 156 Cause Of Death
The driver struggled to make sense of the conversation.



However,having worked for Phillips Group for years,he had seen Cedric evolve into an impressive and authoritative individual.


Was this really how he intended to charm a woman?



Miguel Powell, the driver, felt drained just observing the scene.



As Daniela stepped out of the car, Miguel let out a heavy sigh. "Mr. Phillips?"


Cedric stopped in his tracks. "Yes? What's wrong?"



Miguel massaged his temples. "Have you ever even tried to impress a woman? You're going about it all wrong! Seriously, did you just tell her, 'I'll be watching you'? To anyone else, that'd sound downright creepy -like a stalker!"



Cedric stared blankly, bewildered. "What?" Could his words really have been taken that way? Miguel sighed again. "You scared Ms. Harper so much that she stayed completely silent for the rest of the trip."



Cedric scoffed,rolling his eyes. "Her? Scared? No way.She's the most fearless person I know. Honestly,if anyone's scared, it's probably me, not her."


Without another word, he slammed the car door and strode off towards the hospital.


As he vanished into the hospital, MMiguel shook his head. To him, Cedric seemed less like a man wooing someone and more like someone ready to start a confrontation.



Daniela had barely stepped out of the elevator when Cedric came charging up the stairs, slightly winded.



Daniela arched an eyebrow, her frown deepening."Was it absolutely necessary to tail me so closely?You should at least think about your reputation."



Gasping for breath, Cedric placed his hands on his hips. "I'm only here because you left me no choice!"



Her stern expression eased as a hint of amusement glimmered in her eyes. "And how, exactly, did I force you? I haven't done a thing."



"Don't play innocent! I know how you are. You keep  everything inside and never open up. Fine, Daniela,"he muttered, flinging his suit jacket over his arm,frustration coloring his voice. "Mark my words-one day, you'll come to me and tell me everything on your own!"



Daniela's lips curved into a faint smile.



As she pushed open the hospital room door,Cedric trailed in behind her. By then, his entire demeanor had changed-his jacket was back in place, and his expression was icy and unreadable.



Alexander was seated inside the room. He hadn't anticipated Cedric tagging along, and the sight of them together left him with an odd feeling.



The one thought circling his mind was-could Daniela actually be thinking about being with Cedric?



Daniela's eyes flickered briefly towards Caiden.Without another word, she walked away.



The hospital belonged to Cedric, and as soon as he arrived, the director rushed to greet him in person.



The attending doctor started explaining Caiden's condition. "He's suffering from severe inflammation,though the exact cause remains unknown. We're treating it while conducting further investigations."



"Is it life-threatening?" Daniela asked, her tone measured.



The doctor shook his head. "It doesn't seem to be life -threatening at this point."



Daniela gave a curt nod, her voice polite but distant."I appreciate your efforts."



The doctor stole another glance at Daniela. Seizing a moment when no one was watching, he stood near the door and discreetly snapped a photo of her.



Cedric spotted it right away. He marched out of the room towards the doctor, reaching for his phone, but the man effortlessly evaded him.



Cedric let out a frustrated sigh. "Fine, keep the photo,but don't you dare post it anywhere."



Russell Steele, the doctor, smirked and waved his phone teasingly. "Too late. Quick fingers-I've already shared it in the group chat."



Grinding his teeth, Cedric grabbed his phone. As expected, his group chat was now flooded with endless notifications, his friends mercilessly teasing him.



Cedric's expression turned stormy as he typed a curt,icy reply. "Cut it out, or I'm leaving the group."


Russell laughed and shook his head. "Cedric, with a  temper like that, do you honestly think you'll win her over? No wonder you've been single for over two decades.At this rate, you'll end up growing old alone."



It was the second time that day his attempts-or failure-to woo a woman had been ridiculed.Cedric could feel his irritation boiling over.



Russell cast a look toward the hospital room,one brow lifting in amusement. "You've set your sights pretty high, haven't you? She's the head of Elite Lux, and her wealth could probably buy an entire nation. So, what's your angle? Marrying into her family or settling for the role of a hidden admirer?"



Cedric's mouth tightened in frustration as he murmured, "That's assuming she'd even consider letting me marry in."


Russell stopped in his tracks, his eyes going wide with disbelief. "Hold on, are you still Cedric? Did you seriously just say that? She must really be one of a kind."



He chuckled and began making his way towards the hospital room,but Cedric reached out and yanked him back by the arm.



Russell turned back, puzzled. "What is it now?"



Cedric clenched his jaw. "Don't go saying anything dumb. She's shy." Russell arched an eyebrow as he leaned slightly to peer into the room.



Daniela radiated authority, like a queen overseeing her domain, while two nervous women in the corner looked as though they barely dared to draw breath.



"Shy?" Russell asked, clearly unconvinced. "Are we even talking about the same person?"



"Not shy in that sense," Cedric replied with a weary sigh. "She avoids forming deep connections."



It stemmed from losing her mother at a young age.Deep down, she believed relationships were fleeting.So she naturally kept her distance.



Cedric had watched her closely for years. Daniela unconsciously maintained a distance from everyone.Beyond a select few senior members at Elite Lux, she rarely let anyone get close. She was always courteous but emotionally distant, never revealing her true self.



Her firm emotional barriers weren't intentional-they were instinctive, buried deep within her psyche.


That was exactly why he had held back from making any moves for so long.



If he hadn't picked up on the possibility that Katrina's schemes could endanger Daniela's life, he wouldn't have said what he did earlier.


"Russell, I need you to help me wwith something,"Cedric said.



Russell slid a piece of gum into his mouth and offered another to Cedric, who shook his head in refusal."What's it about?"



"I need you to pull up something in the system for me.Find Daniela's mother's file. I want to see what her official cause of death was recorded as."



Russell stopped chewing mid-motion,his eyes drifting instinctively towards Daniela. "Cedric, you're in for a tough journey."
###Chapter 157 | Don't Trust Him
After Cedric had gone, Katrina sat inside, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. "Daniela, just look at your father now, lying there like this. And all that money overseas..."



Daniela cast a glance at Caiden, lying in the bed with his mouth slack on one side. Her tone stayed even."That's not what matters right now."



She knew that if she pushed Katrina too hard, the woman might very well resort to killing Caiden.



Daniela's goal was to make Katrina expose herself-not to start fighting over the inheritance yet.



Hearing her response, Katrina couldn't hide the flicker of delight that lit up her face. She bobbed her head eagerly. "Yes, exactly! That's what family is allabout,Daniela. Blood is thicker than water, after all. I knew you still cared for your father. So regarding the villa..."


Daniela cut her off mid-sentence, her voice unwavering. "I'll arrange for someone to sell it."



Katrina's cheerful expression faltered. She forced an uneasy laugh. "Daniela, isn't it a little inappropriate to sell your father's villa while he's still unconscious?We don't even know when he'll regain consciousness.There's no urgency here. His belongings aren't going anywhere,are they?"



Despite her calm words, Katrina's thoughts were whirling. She had already begun contacting potential buyers for the villa, planning to funnel the money into a hidden account where Daniela would never trace it.



If her scheme unraveled, Katrina figured she could always pin the blame on Caiden and let him take the fall.



For now, she took Daniela's hospital visit as a sign that she still had some concern for her father.



Katrina had thought everything through, sure that Daniela would go along with her plan. But Daniela's reaction completely threw her off.


"Is that villa Caiden's own property? It was bought with the company's money. As the main shareholder,I have every right to manage it. What makes that wrong?"


At Daniela's biting response, Katrina's fists tightened in anger."Yes,but-"



Before she finish, Daniela interrupted, her voice turning icier. "Or do you expect me to handle the overseas assets as well?" The mention of foreign assets made Katrina's face contort with an involuntary twitch. "Fine. If you insist,go ahead. The villa isn't really worth much anyway. If the company needs the money, then..."



Her voice was composed, but inside,Katrina was seething with fury. Daniela! This scheming woman!


"But the villa is a huge property, and as a young woman,you might find it difficult to manage the sale.Alexander is here today, and you trust him,don't you?Why not let him take care of it for you? Doesn't that sound better?"



Katrina's plan was straightforward. If Alexander took charge,she could control the timing.



He could drag things out long enough for her to sell the villa and move the money before Daniela even noticed.



Alexander had remained silently in the corner,observing.



Katrina turned to him, flashing a sweet smile."Alexander, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a burden for you. Daniela trusts you implicitly, and if I handled it,she wouldn't feel comfortable."



Alexander nodded slightly, his tone collected and professional. "Of course, leave it to me. Bennett Group specializes in real estate, so selling a villa is no problem. Since both you and Daniela trust me, I'll..."



Before he could finish, a voice as cold and sharp as a blade interrupted him. "I don't trust him."



Alexander froze, his unfinished sentence hanging in the air. Slowly, he turned to face Daniela. "What did you just say?"



Daniela repeated her words, emphasizing each one."I said, I don't trust Alexander to handle this."
###Chapter 158 He Regretted It
Alexander stood motionless, his eyes locked on Daniela, unable to believe what he was hearing.



Her face remained impassive and her gaze never once met his. Her profile was serene yet cold, a detachment that sent a jolt of unease through him.



"Daniela..." Alexander inhaled deeply, trying to steady his racing heart. "You don't trust me?"



Katrina,thrilled by the drama, pretended to be stunned and covered her mouth dramatically. "Daniela! What did you just say? You don't trust Alexander? The man you loved for ten years! The man you married! And now you're saying you don't trust him to take care of this for you? You..."



She paused deliberately, her words suspended in the air,intensifying Alexander's discomfort.



Alexander's fists clenched at his sides, his pride stinging from the blow.



"Daniela, what are you implying?" he demanded, his tone sharp as his gaze bore into her. "Do you think I'll try to pocket the money? Or do you think I'd side with someone else?" Recently, Alexander had been reflecting on the past.


The memories resurfaced in quiet, unassuming moments, and with each passing thought, he realized how much Daniela had sacrificed for him. She had bent her own rules for him time after time, yet he had never truly appreciated it.



These revelations stirred something deep within him.He had come today hoping for a chance to repair their broken bond.



He had come with honest intentions. And what did he receive in return?



Alexander was stunned to find that his rare display of goodwill was met with this. He felt a deep sting of insult.He couldn't believe Daniela would turn on him like this.



Locking eyes with her, he pressed on, "Daniela, do you really think so little of me? That I can't tell right from wrong?" 



Daniela didn't actually think Alexander would embezzle.She simply wanted nothing more to do with him. After all, hadn't he always chosen Katrina and her daughter? And now, he was acting wounded? Who was he trying to deceiv/e?



Cedric stood behind Daniela, silently watching the  scene, his face betraying no emotion. But inside, he knew exactly what was unfolding. Men always had a way of seeing through each other.


So now, Alexander regretted it? He wanted to fix things?



Cedric's eyes darkened.



"Daniela, you're being too harsh," Katrina interjected,attempting to play the role of the peacemaker."Look at Alexander-you've hurt him deeply. You can't just erase the past because you have someone new in your life. Your father and I are family;no matter how much you hurt us, we'll accept it. But Alexander isn't.You're divorced,remember? Is it fair to target him?"



Cedric frowned and was about to speak when Daniela raised a hand to stop him. She then turned to face Katrina,her gaze sharp and cutting like a knife.



Katrina's confidence wavered, her heart pounding as Daniela's cold stare pierced through her.


"Katrina, there's no need for you to add fuel to the fire.I stopped caring about Alexander a long time ago.Don't think you can use the past to manipulate me.Let me be clear-I do what I want. As for you,you can plot all you want, but it'll be in vain. I tolerated you before, but not anymore. Soon enough, you'll long for the dayswhen I was more patient with you." Her words were sharp and blunt, leaving Katrina completely humiliated.



She opened her mouth to fire back, but before she could say anything, Daniela spoke first. "Just days after my mother passed away, you moved into my house. A woman like you has no right to talk about morals or decency. Honestly, I thought you'd lost any shred of shame long ago."



Katrina shook with fury, her finger accusingly jabbing toward Daniela. "Daniela! I'm still your stepmother!How dare you speak to me this way?"



Daniela's eyes fixed on Katrina's sharply pointed red nail, the bold gesture only fueling her anger. Slowvly her expression hardened and her gaze deepened with intensity.



From the side, Alexander scowled and snapped,"Daniela, have you lost it? Do you even hear what you're saying? Calling Katrina that way means you're calling Caiden indecent too. He's your father, andhe's lying in that bed!"



Katrina's rage exploded. It had been years since anyone had the audacity to speak to her like this.



Had she known Daniela would cause so much trouble,she would've taken care of Daniela along with her mother all those years ago. She thrust her finger even closer to Daniela's face and screamed, "Daniela! You ungratefuI little brat! You're nothing but a motherless orphan! I'll teach you a lesson for your father!"



The instant the words left Katrina's mouth, a loud crack rang out through the room.



And then, the whole room went completely still.


Even Katrina froze, her mouth agape in disbelief.



At the doorway, Joyce froze, her face drained of color in surprise. The thermos she had been holding slipped from her grip and crashed to the floor with a loud clang.
###Chapter 159 Daniela Doesn't Want Alexander...
A sharp crash rang out, shattering the silence,followed by a haunting stillness.



Daniela slowly lifted her gaze, her expression icy,before casually pulling a wet wipe from her bag and cleaning her hands.



The simple gesture jolted Katrina back to reality.A piercing scream tore from her throat, echoing through every corner of the room. Pain shot through her injured finger.



Daniela leaned in, and her lips curled into a sinister smile as she asked, "Doesn't it hurt?"



Katrina gasped, her body trembling in fear. She saw Daniela's smile, but it was as if Brylee was standing before her.



Daniela met Katrina's gaze with calm detachment,offering a smile that seemed almost innocent. "You pushed your way into the Harper family right after my mother passed.Do you remember how that made me feel? Did you think I was too scared to speak up, or that Caiden mattered so much to me that I wouldn't dare upset him?" 
Cradling her broken finger, Katrina's fear deepened with every step Daniela took closer. She mumbled incoherently, her body shrinking back in terror. To her,Daniela appeared utterly unhinged.


"Katrina, I normally couldn't care less about you. But since you all insist on harassing me, let me make one thing clear-I won't hesitate to fight back."


Daniela's voice was soft, yet filled with an unmistakable steel.



The calmness on her face made a chill run down Katrina's spine.



In that moment, Daniela seemed to resemble Brylee more than ever.



She was beautiful, merciless, and uninterested in speaking a word more when a single action would suffice.



Fear crept slowly into Katrina's heart, tightening its grip.



Seeing Katrina cornered,Alexander quickly moved to help her.



But just as he took a step forward, someone stepped in his way. 
"Cedric!"



Cedric crossed his arms nonchalantly. "That's me."



"Do you see what Daniela's doing?" Alexander asked,his voice rising, "She's hurting Katrina. Aren't you concerned she might call the police? Are you just going to stand by and watch this?"


Cedric's laugh was low and unhurried. "Relax, buddy.I've got top-notch lawyers and endless financial support. Unless someone dies, this isn't a big deal."


Alexander stared, stunned by Cedric's obvious favoritism. "You're just letting her do this?" he asked,unable to hide his disbelief. ①



Cedric grinned again. "I'm courting her."



Alexander's shock quickly morphed into something darker. He locked eyes with Cedric, emphasizing each word. "Daniela was married before. She was married to me."



Cedric chuckled. "Oh my God,really?"



Alexander had known Cedric's interest in Daniela was more than just business. But Cedric was one of the most powerfuI men in Olisvine.



If Cedric wanted to have a fling with Daniela, Alexander could understand.



But hearing Cedric claim he was actively pursuing her?
That felt completely surreal.


He thought Cedric had lost his mind.



They were all insane.



On the other hand, Joyce was frantic, screaming about calling the police. Daniela,however, didn't seem bothered at all. She simply shrugged, settling into a chair as if she had all the time in the world.



Katrina teetered on the edge of unconsciousness,overwhelmed by pain.



Joyce,her voice trembling with worry, rushed to her side. "Mom, are you okay?"



Daniela was busy playing a shooting game on her phone, the loud blasts from the game echoing through the room. She appeared completely unfazed by Katrina's suffering or Caiden's critical state.



Joyce stood, fury flashing in her eyes as she glared at Daniela. "You're just here to make our lives hell, aren't you?"



Daniela didn't flinch. She gave a simple nod. "Yes.Isn't that clear? I'd say you're not exactly known for your intellect if you have to ask." Joyce seethed at Daniela's cold attitude. "How did you turn into this, Daniela? Just because you have money doesn't give you the right to do whatever you please!"



Daniela let out a dry laugh, her fingers still tapping at her game. "Maybe you should work your way up to mny level before you start lecturing me about what's possible or not. But I doubt that'll ever happen. With your lack of initiative, you'll never know what it's like to actually hold power."



Daniela tilted her head, pretending to sympathize."Even if you did marry Alexander, I highly doubt you'd ever really control his family's fortune."



Joyce's anger flared. But, unfortunately, Daniela's words hit home. She had never been quick on her feet. The only time she'd ever gotten the upper hand over Daniela was when Alexander left Daniela for her.



Now that it was obvious Daniela had no interest in Alexander anymore, Joyce had no way to claim another victory.



Her fury made her voice shake, but it was clear she couldn't land a hit on Daniela.



She couldn't even get close to Daniela,with Cedric standing guard near her, relaxed yet protective, like a warning to anyone who thought to approach Joyce balled her fists, her voice rising in a sharp,high -pitched tone. "Just wait! The police are on their way!"she yelled, her finger stabbing the air, aimed at Daniela.



At the mention of the police, Daniela paused her game. She raised her eyes slowly, her calm gaze settling on the finger Joyce had pointed at her.
###Chapter 160 Had Daniela Figured Something Out
 Joyce's confident stance faltered the moment Daniela's piercing gaze fixed on the finger she had raised.



Daniela gave a faint, knowing smirk before lowering her head, resuming her game.



When the police finally arrived,representatives from both Phillips Group and Elite Lux had already shown up.



Joyce, lacking the wit to keep up, found herself tangled in the barrage of legal arguments.



Meanwhile,Daniela's words were clear and precise. "It was an unfortunate accident. I'm more than willing to make amends and settle this fairly."



Joyce stood stunned, watching Daniela effortlessly play the same pity game Katrina often used.



Daniela told the police, "My stepmother has always harbored resentment towards me. After my mother passed, she convinced my father to sever our relationship. She married him just days after my mother's death. Now that my father is critically ill,she's barred me from visiting him. Naturally, I became  emotional..."



This strategy quickly made the legal complications fade away, and the matter was resolved swiftly.



Still reeling,Joyce watched as Daniela transferred $20,000 into the hospital account. Then with a sweet smile,Daniela addressed Katrina, who was pale from the pain of her fractured finger. "This money is for you. Get some medicine and take better care of that brain of yours."



Katrina tried to respond, but before she could utter a word, Daniela's voice grew colder. "Oh, and just so you know, I've been feeling a bit homesick lately. I'll be moving back tomorrow."



Katrina's expression changed drastically at her words.



Joyce scowled, her voice laced with indignation."What right do you think you have? Dad already severed ties with you!"



"Do you even think? If not, you might want to consider getting yourself a brain." Daniela leaned back,completely at ease. "Yes, Caiden cut ties with me.But the villa was my mother's. Under inheritance law, I still have a stake in it. I can move back whenever I choose,and not even Caiden can stop me-certainly not you."



Daniela stood, stretching lazily, her eyes sweeping over Katrina and Joyce with clear contempt."You two  should probably start praying that Caiden doesn't die anytime soon. Otherwise, the portion of the villa left to you might be smaller than a bathroom."



Her words landed like a heavy blow. Katrina's eyes widened in disbelief. The doctor, misreading her response, murmured, "I'll be more gentle."


Katrina's face remained torn, her mind swirling with confusion. Then, Daniela added the final blow. "I'll be on my way now. I have a feeling Caiden will wake soon. Don't you think so,Katrina?"



Katrina was stunned into silence, her thoughts scattered.



Joyce stormed over to Alexander, slipping her arm through his with a sense of urgency. "Alexander! Did you hear the way Daniela was talking? So sarcastic,so cold! Anyone who heard her would think we were the ones who killed Brylee! It's a blessing you didn't stay with her; she's totally out of her mind!"


Alexander wasn't so easily fooled. Joyce might have missed the meaning of Daniela's words, but he didn't.What did she mean by Caiden waking up soon? How could she possibly know?



Alexander narrowed his eyes, a growing suspicion forming as his gaze turned to Katrina.


Meanwhile, Katrina,getting ready for surgery on her  fractured finger,stepped out of the ward to make a call before signing the necessary forms.


In the quiet hospital garden, she whispered into the phone, "Mom, do you think Daniela has figured something out? Why would she suddenly want to move back? She has a prime spot in the Elite Lux building with a city view. Why would she want to move back?"



On the other end, her mother was playing cards."You're overthinking it. Daniela was just a kid back then. She was only five. Who remembers things from that age?"



Katrina's unease persisted. "Then why did she snap so suddenly? She's always been so calm, never argumentative. But today, she was completely different."



Her mother let out a soft laugh. "Maybe it's because of Alexander. She's probably just holding a grudge.Think about it-she loved him for so long. What's the term? Oh,right, sunk cost. Alexander's her sunk cost.She's upset she lost him and can't do anything about it,so now she's taking it out on you."



Katrina muttered quietly, "Is that really what it is?"


 
But something didn't sitright. Daniela didn't appear bitter. In fact, she seemed to have grown quite close to Cedric. She had even entrusted him with the sales of the villa.



Didn't that imply Cedric was now more significant to Daniela than Alexander?



The thought made Katrina boil with anger.



Daniela had lost Alexander but gained someone even more valuable-Cedric.



How could she have such luck?



If Cedric had chosen Joyce, it would've been perfect.



Her mother's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.
"Sweetheart, I'm out of money again. Send me half a million. And stop worrying about Daniela. Brylee was tough back then, but she couldn't outdo you in the end,right? You've done fine since then. If you handled Brylee,Daniela will be a breeze. And if things go south,just take care of her too. Problem solved."



Katrina ended the call, but her mind was still swirling with uncertainty.



Upstairs,Joyce summoned her for surgery, and Katrina made her way back to the surgical ward.



Had Daniela figured something out?
What was her real reason for coming back this time?


Lost in thought, she missed a step and tumbled down.



There was a sharp crack, and her whole hand snapped.



Her piercing scream rang out, reaching the underground parking lot.


In the parking lot, Cedric stopped Daniela just as she was about to enter her car.



She glanced up at him, asking, "What's going on?"
