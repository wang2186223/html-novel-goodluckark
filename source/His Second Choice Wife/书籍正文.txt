###Chapter 1

On the outskirts of Aldenria, Evelyn Carter received the devastating news—her own brother had sold her off for a hundred thousand dollars to settle his gambling debts.

Technive was a lawless district, a cesspool of crime where scams, human trafficking, and violence thrived. Life held no value here.

Evelyn’s striking beauty had drawn the attention of ruthless criminals, who now sought to force her into prostitution.

She fought back with every ounce of strength, but her resistance only earned her brutal beatings. Her clothes were torn, her body covered in bruises.

Overwhelmed by pain, she thought of her husband, Liam Blackwood.

"Please, don't touch me!" she begged, her voice trembling. "I can get my husband to pay you whatever you want—just name your price!"

For the first time, she pleaded instead of resisting.

One of the criminals, whose specialty was ransom demands, smirked.

The leader, Brett Hawkins, signaled his men to stop. He grabbed a phone and shoved it into Evelyn’s hands.

"Tell your husband to bring twenty million dollars," he sneered. "A single dollars less, and you'll service every one of us before we sell you off."

A violent shiver wracked her body.

She had admired Liam from afar for three years before finally marrying him a month ago.

Would a man who had barely spared her a glance be willing to pay such a fortune for her?

"Okay," she whispered weakly. Right now, Liam was her only hope.

She dialed his number. The call connected—but a woman’s voice answered instead.

"Hello? Who is this?"

Evelyn’s heart plummeted.

She forced herself upright, wincing in pain. "This is Evelyn Carter, Liam Blackwood’s wife. Please, let me speak to him!"

The woman on the other end drawled lazily, "Liam’s asleep right now. You can talk to me."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "This is urgent. Hand him the phone."

The woman’s tone turned venomous. "Evelyn, don’t fool yourself into thinking that marriage makes you his real wife."

"I know you manipulated his grandmother into forcing him to marry you. But I’m the one he loves—you tore us apart!"

Her voice dripped with malice. "Liam would never waste a thought on a shameless gold-digger like you. You deserve to rot alone."

Evelyn’s face drained of color, her heart shattering.

Then, faintly, she heard Liam’s voice in the background. "Who is it, Victoria?"

"Just a scam call," Victoria Dawson replied before abruptly hanging up.

Laughter erupted around Evelyn.

"Your husband already has another woman," one of the men jeered. "Forget about him rescuing you—he probably doesn’t even remember your name."

Evelyn hadn’t known Liam was in love with someone else.

For three years, she had foolishly pined for him, unaware that his grandmother’s claims of his affection were lies.

She had unknowingly destroyed a relationship.

Tears spilled down her bruised cheeks as she closed her eyes.

The physical pain was nothing compared to the agony in her heart.

Suddenly, one of the men shifted uneasily. "Wait… the name she mentioned earlier… her husband isn’t the commander of the Aldenrian military, is he?"

Everyone in Aldenria knew Liam Blackwood.

During the bloodiest conflict in the Middle East, he had led his forces to rescue countless civilians and annihilated every enemy in his path.
###Chapter 2

Liam Blackwood had carved his legend through blood and steel on the battlefield, defending Aldenria's borders with unmatched ferocity.

Ryan Sullivan remembered how Liam had distinguished himself in the Valtorian Conflict, emerging as a decorated war hero after single-handedly neutralizing enemy forces.

How could this trembling woman before them possibly be his wife?

"Relax," Brett Hawkins scoffed, waving off his men's concerns. "General Blackwood is the most feared man in Aldenria. No fool would dare traffic his wife. Last I heard, he's still unmarried."

Brett turned his attention back to Evelyn Carter. "Her husband probably just shares the same name. Keep calling until he delivers the twenty million dollars."

His men continued their frantic attempts to reach Liam.

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed into the corner, squeezing her eyes shut against the hopelessness of her situation.

—

The explosion came without warning, shaking the warehouse's foundations.

Evelyn's eyes flew open as the deafening blast echoed through the space.

The card-playing thugs scrambled for their weapons in panic.

"Boss!" A lookout came running, face pale. "We're under attack! Someone just blew open our gates!"

"Blew them open?" Brett's voice cracked with fear. "Who?"

"The military!" The man pointed upward with a shaking hand. "Two attack helicopters—"

"The Aldenrian Special Forces? The ones from the Solterra campaign?" Brett's face drained of color. "We're dead men!"

He yanked Evelyn up by her hair. "Is your husband the fucking Commander of Aldenria's armed forces?"

Evelyn gave a weak nod. Brett's grip tightened as he pressed his gun to her temple, realizing his fatal mistake.

Outside, the compound was surrounded by armored vehicles. Rows of elite soldiers stood at perfect attention, their advanced weaponry glinting in the sunlight.

Above them, fighter jets carved through the sky while snipers took position on nearby rooftops.

The sheer military might made several of Brett's men drop their weapons in surrender.

"Let me go or I'll kill her!" Brett screamed, dragging Evelyn toward the back exit.

A black SUV's door swung open at the center of the formation.

The man who emerged wore tactical gear that accentuated his powerful frame. His chiseled features were set in an expression so cold it made the air itself seem to freeze.

When Evelyn saw him, her breath caught. Her pulse pounded so loudly she feared everyone could hear it.

Liam.

His glacial gaze swept over the scene before settling on Brett. "Release her," he commanded, his voice like steel.

Brett's hands shook violently. "I-I didn't know she was yours, General! L-let me walk away and she goes free!"

Liam's eyes never once acknowledged Evelyn.

Instead, he slowly raised his service pistol. The click of the safety disengaging echoed through the sudden silence. "If she dies," Liam said calmly, "you'll take seven bullets before you hit the ground."
###Chapter 3

Trembling with fear, Brett Hawkins snarled, "Then I'll take your wife down with me!"

Liam Blackwood had never been one to yield to threats. A deadly glint flashed in his piercing eyes.

Suddenly, seven gunshots shattered the silence, ringing violently in Evelyn Carter's ears.

Her body jerked violently before freezing in shock. She squeezed her eyes shut, feeling warm droplets splatter across her cheeks.

At that moment, calling herself Liam's wife felt like a cruel joke.

He was here to save the hostages—not her. So what if she got caught in the crossfire?

A sharp pain clenched her heart. Overwhelmed by terror, her vision blurred, and darkness swallowed her whole.

The military headquarters of Aldenria was the nation's largest weapons production facility, heavily guarded and impenetrable.

"No!"

A nightmare jolted Evelyn awake. Her eyes flew open, her body drenched in cold sweat.

She gasped for air, her pulse racing as she scanned the unfamiliar room.

Her gaze landed on a woman standing beside her bed—Victoria Dawson, her expression carefully blank as she held a tray with a glass of water and a plate of food.

"You're awake?" Victoria said flatly. "Liam asked me to bring you something to eat."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, pushing herself up weakly. Her limbs felt like lead after going without food for an entire day.

Victoria smirked. "Too bad you don't deserve it."

With that, she took a deliberate step back and flung the tray to the ground before throwing herself down with it.

The crash was deafening. "Ouch!" Victoria wailed, her voice thick with fake tears.

Evelyn stared, stunned.

The door burst open, and Liam stormed in, his sharp eyes immediately zeroing in on Victoria sprawled on the floor. His subordinate, Ryan Sullivan, followed closely behind.

Liam strode to Victoria and helped her up. "Are you hurt?"

Victoria sniffled, her lashes fluttering. "I kept insisting Evelyn eat, but she refused. I—I shouldn't have pushed her. Now the food's wasted, and the floor's a mess. It's all my fault."

"Leave it," Liam said, his voice softening. "Go rest."

Victoria nodded, but before leaving, she caught his hand. "Liam, please don't be angry with her. It was my mistake."

He gave a curt nod.

Evelyn watched the entire act with disgust.

The moment Victoria left, the room plunged into suffocating silence. Liam's presence alone made the air feel heavier, colder.

He loomed over her, his gaze icy. "What was that about?"

Evelyn knew he'd never believe her over the woman he loved. Still, she whispered, "I didn't do anything."

His expression darkened. "If you ever treat Victoria like that again, there will be consequences."

His words lashed at her like a whip. The pain was so sharp her vision blurred with unshed tears.

She lowered her head, unwilling to let him see her weakness.

After a long pause, she finally spoke, her voice barely audible. "Mr. Blackwood, I didn’t know you were forced into this marriage because of your grandmother."

"She told me you wanted this. That you were someone I could trust. But I was wrong."

Her heart ached, but she forced her voice steady. "You're in love with someone else. And back there—you fired without a second thought about whether I'd be hit. There's no reason to stay in a marriage like this."
###Chapter 4

Liam's piercing gaze held an icy calm. "Explain yourself."

Evelyn met his stare without flinching. "I want a divorce."

Three years of loving this man. Three years believing in pure love. Now their marriage stood tainted, and she refused to continue this charade.

Liam's expression darkened like storm clouds gathering.

Behind him, Ryan spoke up with obvious disdain. "Evelyn Carter. Age 25. Native of Aldenria's capital. Daughter of an abusive alcoholic father. Mother and brother both compulsive gamblers drowning in debt."

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock at Ryan's words.

Unperturbed, Ryan continued his brutal recitation. "Dropped out at fourteen after being catfished by online predators. Later worked as a hostess in nightclubs."

"At twenty, married an octogenarian who died within two years - leaving you penniless."

The merciless cataloging continued. "Formal education ends at elementary level. Arrested twice for prostitution."

"Fifteen cosmetic surgeries. Three STD treatments. Thirty-two documented relationships - including five simultaneous partners - plus countless anonymous encounters."

"Returned to Aldenria three years ago. Deliberately befriended Mrs. Blackwood. Schemed your way into this family to become General Blackwood's wife."

Cold sweat trickled down Evelyn's spine as each sordid detail struck like a whip.

She couldn't believe what she was hearing.

Ryan delivered the final blow with a sneer. "Marrying General Blackwood was winning the lottery for trash like you. How dare you mention divorce?"

Evelyn felt stripped bare, exposed in her shame. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Liam remained impassive. This marriage had always been just a concession to his grandmother. Meaningless to him.

With a bitter smile, Evelyn explained, "Mr. Blackwood, I lost all memories three years ago. I've heard fragments about my past, but remember nothing."

She continued softly, "I don't know why I made those choices, and I'm sorry you were forced to marry someone so... damaged because of your grandmother."

"I'm unworthy of being your wife. Let's end this."

Liam closed the distance between them. His towering presence made the air feel thick. Nervous, Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet his.

His lips curled in derision. "I'll decide when this marriage ends."

What did that make her?

His grandmother's pet project?

Tears of frustration pricked Evelyn's eyes. "I don't know who I was before, but the woman I am now won't accept a loveless marriage or trade dignity for wealth."

Liam scoffed. "Dignity? You?"

His contempt cut deep. Did she not even deserve basic self-respect? How low did he think of her?

She fired back, "Mr. Blackwood, if you refuse divorce, then act like a proper husband. No other women. No secrets. A real marriage."

"Or I'll take this matter to your grandmother myself. I promise to make it painless for you."

Liam's face hardened instantly. He loomed over her, eyes blazing.

Evelyn pressed back against the headboard, pulse racing.

His intoxicating scent enveloped her, sending heat flooding her cheeks. Her breath came in shallow gasps.

"W-what are you doing?" she stammered.
###Chapter 5

The tension around Liam was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife. "Are you threatening me?"

Evelyn's breath hitched, her chest tightening under the weight of his dominance. "Please, don't force me into something I don’t want."

Liam's sharp gaze narrowed on her.

Her delicate, innocent features stirred something in him—a fleeting resemblance to Victoria as a child.

Lost in thought, his lips curled into a knowing smirk. "I'll admit, you’ve done an impressive job mimicking her childhood likeness. No wonder my grandmother adores you."

Her childhood?

Evelyn frowned. Who was he talking about?

Before she could dwell on it, Liam straightened, his tone cool. "Fine. I agree."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode out, Ryan trailing behind.

Evelyn stood frozen, his words echoing in her mind. What exactly had he agreed to?

Divorce? Or playing the role of husband and wife?

Night draped over the estate, a soft breeze drifting through the open window.

Ryan brought dinner to Evelyn’s room. After eating, she picked up a book on military tactics, engrossing herself until late.

When exhaustion finally claimed her, she headed for the shower. Half an hour later, she realized—she had nothing clean to wear.

She washed her clothes and hung them by the bathroom window, then wrapped herself in a towel before stepping out.

And froze.

Liam stood by the bed, shirtless, his sculpted torso on full display. The faint scars tracing his skin only amplified his raw masculinity.

Heat flooded her cheeks.

His gaze flickered to her, taking in her flushed face and wide eyes. The innocence in her expression seemed genuine.

His eyes trailed down—her bare shoulders, the smooth curve of her legs.

For someone who’d supposedly undergone extensive cosmetic work, her beauty was unsettlingly natural.

Clearing his throat, he grabbed a set of athletic wear from the closet and tossed it at her. "Put these on."

She fumbled to catch them.

Confusion knitted her brows until he added, "Unless you’d rather stay like that."

Evelyn clutched the clothes tighter. "What are you doing in my room, Mr. Blackwood?"

He didn’t turn. "Who insisted on living as husband and wife?"

She had.

But she’d meant it as leverage for divorce—not to endure a hollow marriage with another woman in the picture.

The bathroom door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn exhaled, her pulse erratic. She pressed a hand to her chest, then her burning cheeks.

Fifteen minutes later, Liam emerged in pajamas.

She shot to her feet. "Mr. Blackwood, we need to talk."

Three years of longing meant nothing if this marriage would only bring her pain.

He pulled a spare blanket from the closet and dropped it on the bed. "It’s late. Tomorrow."

Her fingers twisted in her shirt. "Aren’t we getting divorced?"

Liam stretched out on the bed, eyes closed. "Not yet."

Her stomach knotted. "Then you’d better commit to the act."

"Fine." No hesitation.

His bluntness left her restless. She watched him settle in, then grabbed her own blanket and pillow, arranging them on the floor.

If he loved another woman, he wouldn’t want to share a bed with her.

The lights flicked off.

A second later, they snapped back on.

Liam loomed over her, irritation darkening his features. "What are you doing?"

"Sleeping?"

In one swift motion, he scooped her up—blanket and all—and dumped her onto the bed.

She bounced, dizzy, her injuries throbbing.

Then he leaned in.

Her hands flew to his chest. "You—"

He caged her beneath him, his body solid and unyielding.

The moment her palms met his bare skin, she jerked back, flustered.

Heart hammering, she stared up at him, breath shallow.

Fear and something else—something dangerous—coiled inside her.

What was he planning to do?
###Chapter 6

Liam's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "Who exactly are you trying to humiliate by sleeping on the floor?"

Evelyn found herself drowning in his intoxicating masculine scent. Her lungs constricted as if she'd forgotten how to breathe.

Her thoughts scattered like leaves in a storm. "I-I just thought... it wouldn't be proper... since you're in love with someone else."

A dark eyebrow arched as Liam's lips twisted into a mocking smile. "Don't flatter yourself. Even if you stripped naked and danced before me, I wouldn't spare you a glance, let alone touch you."

Each word struck her heart like shards of glass, piercing her deepest insecurities.

She opened her mouth to retaliate but choked on unshed tears, terrified her true feelings might spill out. Biting her lip until it hurt, she blinked back the moisture gathering in her eyes.

For a fleeting moment, Liam seemed captivated by her glistening eyes.

Then just as quickly, he rolled onto the bed and snapped, "Lights out. Now."

The smart home system plunged the room into darkness instantly.

Evelyn stared into the void, disappointment settling heavily in her chest. She adjusted her position stiffly, putting as much distance between them as possible.

The king-sized bed might as well have been an ocean - the space between them felt vast and unbridgeable.

Sleep eluded her for hours.

Exhaustion finally claimed her just before dawn.

The shrill ringtone shattered her restless slumber.

Blinking against the morning light, she saw Liam already dressed in an immaculate black suit.

Love truly was blind - he seemed to radiate his own sunlight wherever he went.

"Morning, Victoria," Liam answered softly. Then his voice sharpened with concern. "You're sick? I'll be right there."

Hearing that name sent a bolt of jealousy straight through Evelyn's heart.

As she rubbed sleep from her eyes, Liam ended the call and turned. "I have to go."

She swallowed the lump in her throat. "You promised fidelity. That's the foundation of any marriage."

His hesitation lasted only a heartbeat. "Our families go way back. Victoria's practically family. This doesn't violate our vows."

Since when did "family" call each other at dawn with trivial complaints?

Evelyn's vision blurred as her chest constricted painfully.

"Liam Blackwood," she called out as he turned to leave, "can't you stay?"

He froze mid-step.

No one had used his full name in years.

Staring at his rigid back, she whispered, "You're married now. Think about how this looks. Just send a doctor."

Several heartbeats passed in silence.

Then the door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn collapsed onto the mattress, squeezing her eyes shut against the burning tears. Her fists clenched the sheets so tightly her knuckles turned white.

His promises were worthless - just empty words to keep her from filing for divorce. The painful truth was clear: Liam still belonged to Victoria Dawson.

She'd end this farce of a marriage today.

Outside the dormitory, Liam's subordinate snapped to attention. "General Blackwood."

The title gave him pause as he remembered his vow to Evelyn.

After a brief hesitation, he ordered, "Send a physician to Ms. Dawson's residence."
###Chapter 7

"Understood, General." Adrian Castillo responded with military precision.

Liam Blackwood exhaled sharply through his nose. He fully intended to honor his promise, but Evelyn's definition of a faithful husband remained an enigma to him.

Three days had passed since Evelyn's injuries healed completely.

Three days since Liam had last visited Victoria Dawson. Evelyn hadn't seen hide nor hair of him since that encounter.

Her mood darkened with each passing hour. Determined to channel her frustration productively, she headed to the military training facility to learn self-defense techniques.

Among the sea of uniformed soldiers, Evelyn's feminine curves stood out starkly.

At the far end of the compound, Victoria appeared beside Special Assistant Adrian Castillo.

"That's three days now," Victoria pouted, her voice dripping with petulance. "Where could Liam possibly be?"

Adrian adjusted his stance. "General Blackwood had urgent business to attend to. He should return today."

Victoria's eyes turned glacial when she spotted Evelyn practicing defensive stances. "What's she doing here?"

"Mrs. Blackwood—" Adrian began.

"Don't call her that!" Victoria spat. "That conniving little tramp would do anything to get what she wants. She's making Liam miserable."

She leaned closer to Adrian, her voice lowering to a venomous whisper. "I heard she used to be some high-class escort. And—"

Meanwhile on the training field, sweat glistened on Evelyn's forehead, but the physical exertion had lifted her spirits considerably.

"Thank you," Evelyn nodded to her instructor. "Could you show me a few more techniques?"

The trainer smiled warmly. "My pleasure."

Before he could demonstrate, Adrian strode over with purposeful steps, his expression dark. "I'll take over her training."

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

The instructor immediately snapped to attention. "Sir!"

Adrian dismissed him with a curt gesture.

Evelyn sensed the hostility radiating from Adrian, though she couldn't fathom its source since they'd never met.

"What would you like to teach me, Mr. Castillo?" she asked politely.

"Close quarters combat," he replied icily.

Before Evelyn could protest, Adrian launched into an aggressive demonstration that left her bruised and breathless.

The watching soldiers winced in sympathy but knew better than to interfere.

After her fifth painful landing, Evelyn's entire body screamed in protest. "I think that's enough for today."

"We're just getting started." Adrian hauled her up and locked her in a chokehold from behind. "Now, how would you escape this?"

Gasping for air, Evelyn's vision swam. Through the haze, she spotted Victoria watching with malicious amusement.

The realization hit her like a physical blow. This wasn't training—it was punishment.

"Stomp...on...foot..." Adrian instructed through gritted teeth as Evelyn struggled. "Twist...thumb..."

Evelyn followed his directions but only succeeded in crashing painfully to the mat again.

Humiliation burned through her. She felt like a circus animal being put through its paces for others' entertainment.

Just as her vision began to blur, strong hands gripped her shoulders, pulling her upright.

She blinked up into the stern face of Liam Blackwood.
###Chapter 8

Liam's face darkened visibly as he snapped, "Are you training her or playing games with her?"

Adrian swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing nervously. "Commander, I was teaching Mrs. Blackwood basic self-defense techniques."

The tension in the training room was palpable. Everyone knew Adrian had crossed a line, and Liam wasn't one to overlook such transgressions.

With a sharp movement, Liam pushed Evelyn aside. "Stay back," he ordered.

Evelyn's pulse quickened inexplicably at his protective gesture.

Though his eyes never met hers, his actions spoke volumes. This contradiction left her utterly confused about his true intentions.

Casually removing his platinum watch, Liam tossed it to Evelyn. "Spar with me. Win, and you keep your position. Lose, and you're dismissed immediately."

Adrian's face turned ashen. "Sir, I could never defeat you! I swear I was only—"

Liam cut him off with a devastating roundhouse kick that sent Adrian crashing into the mats. The impact knocked the wind from his lungs.

Evelyn gasped. The sheer force behind that kick could have killed her instantly.

Groaning in pain, Adrian realized Liam was deadly serious. Gathering his courage, he launched a desperate attack.

Liam dodged effortlessly before delivering a brutal punch to Adrian's solar plexus. Blood trickled from the corner of Adrian's mouth as he collapsed.

Victoria suddenly rushed forward, clinging to Liam's arm. "Stop! He wasn't hurting her!" she pleaded.

The other soldiers joined in. "Have mercy, Commander!"

Liam's expression softened when he looked at Victoria. "You shouldn't interfere," he chided gently. "You might get hurt."

Victoria pouted, pressing closer. "I know you'd never hurt me," she cooed.

The intimate scene made Evelyn's chest constrict painfully. She clutched Liam's watch so tightly the edges dug into her palm.

The contrast was unbearable. Liam feared accidentally harming Victoria during a simple spar, yet he'd fired his weapon inches from Evelyn without hesitation.

"Nate, I need to speak with you privately," Victoria said, tugging him toward the door.

As they left, Liam called over his shoulder, "His fate is in Evelyn's hands now."

Adrian crawled toward Evelyn, desperation in his eyes. "Please, Mrs. Blackwood! I'm loyal to the Commander! I—"
###Chapter 9

Evelyn raised her hand sharply, cutting off Adrian's words. "Enough. You're not leaving."

She wasn't cruel enough to destroy someone's career over something so trivial.

Adrian's face lit up with relief. "Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood. I'm forever in your debt. Whatever you need, just say the word."

Uncomfortable with his dramatics, Evelyn thrust Liam's watch at him. "Just return this to Liam. That's all I ask."

"Consider it done." Adrian carefully took the timepiece.

Evelyn hesitated before asking, "Where's the nearest train station or airport?"

Adrian's expression fell. "You're leaving?"

She forced a tight smile and nodded. Watching Liam dote on another woman was more than she could bear.

She wasn't a glutton for punishment.

Her plan was simple - explain everything to Margaret Thorn and end this farce of a marriage.

After an awkward pause, Adrian offered, "Let me drive you to Aldenria tomorrow. It's about six hours."

"Fine. Thank you." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. Her voice sounded hollow even to her own ears.

She wandered away in a daze.

The golden sunset painted everything in warm hues.

Having skipped lunch while hiding in her room with a book, Evelyn realized dinner time approached.

She headed toward the mess hall.

Fate intervened when she nearly collided with Liam, flanked by Ryan and Adrian.

Both men greeted her respectfully. "Mrs. Blackwood."

Evelyn gave a curt nod.

"Hello." Liam's gaze remained as distant as ever. "Adrian mentioned you're leaving tomorrow."

"Yes."

"Not adjusting well here?" His probing question felt like salt in a wound.

Evelyn fabricated an excuse. "I miss Margaret."

Liam's expression darkened. "Going to discuss our divorce with her?"

Since he'd seen through her lie, she didn't bother denying it. "This marriage was never your choice. Why prolong the inevitable?"

He scoffed. "After three years caring for her, you should know Margaret better than that."

"Then we'll divorce quietly and pretend for her sake," Evelyn countered firmly.

With his subordinates listening, Liam's pride bristled. Women across the country would kill to be in her position, yet she treated it like a prison sentence.

"Was this all just a play for money?" he sneered. "Name your price then."

Evelyn froze, his words like a physical blow.

Her hands clenched into shaking fists. Tears pricked her eyes.

What kind of monster did he think she was?

Blinking back tears, she forced calm into her voice. "Sorry to disappoint, but I don't need your money. A woman like me has earned plenty from men over the years. I just needed a loyal fool to marry."

"A loyal fool?" Liam's scowl could have melted steel.

Behind him, Ryan and Adrian struggled to maintain straight faces.

The tense moment shattered when a researcher came sprinting toward them. "General! Chemical leak in Lab Five! Multiple casualties including Ms. Wright!"

Liam took off running before the man finished speaking.

Chemical poisoning?

Concern overriding her anger, Evelyn chased after him without hesitation.
###Chapter 10

Panicked staff streamed from Lab Five's entrance, hands clamped over their mouths. Some collapsed onto the pavement, retching violently. Others swayed on their knees, faces drained of color.

Military medics in white coats pushed through the crowd with urgency.

Evelyn arrived breathless at the perimeter, scanning the chaos with frantic eyes. Her pulse hammered against her ribs - where was Liam?

Then she saw him.

Emerging from the smoke-filled doorway, Liam carried Victoria's limp form with practiced ease. Medics rushed forward with a stretcher.

The irony burned Evelyn's throat.

While she'd been terrified for Liam's safety, his only concern had been Victoria.

After transferring Victoria to the medical team, Liam turned back toward the building without hesitation.

"Nate!" Victoria's trembling fingers caught his sleeve. Tears streaked her ashen face. "Don't leave me. I can't breathe—"

"Easy now." Liam's voice softened as he pried her grip loose. "The doctors have you."

Her chest heaved with panicked sobs. "I'm dying, Nate. I can feel it!"

At that moment, Ryan's voice cut through the commotion. "General Blackwood! Building's cleared. Thirty-five confirmed poison cases."

Liam's attention snapped to Ethan Reynolds nearby. "Doctor, what chemical leaked? Fatal?"

Ethan's hands shook as he adjusted his glasses. "Azurium, sir. Experimental import. We barely understand its properties—" He flinched under Liam's glacial stare.

"General, I swear," Ethan babbled, "I've never encountered Azurium in twenty years of practice. We need tox screens before—"

"Carelessness with hazardous materials?" Liam's roar made several researchers jump. "Explain this negligence!"

Ethan swallowed hard. "Ms. Dawson was...rummaging through restricted storage when the container tipped."

All eyes turned to Victoria, who sniffled dramatically. "If they'd labeled things properly, this wouldn't have happened!"

Liam's jaw hardened. "This is a secure facility. What were you doing in chemical storage?"

Victoria dissolved into fresh tears. "You're blaming me when I'm poisoned? How cruel!"

Evelyn observed the theatrics with detached amusement before approaching Ethan. "Azurium alone isn't toxic. Was Rhenium compound also spilled?"

Ethan blinked. "Yes, but Rhenium's used in jet propulsion. Harmless."

"Not when combined." Evelyn's calm voice carried across the stunned crowd. "The reaction produces a colorless, odorless neurotoxin. Symptoms progress from nausea to violent purging, then death by dehydration."

She turned to Adrian. "Their systems are dangerously acidic. Alkaline solution will neutralize it. Check the commissary for food-grade bicarbonate."

Adrian nodded sharply. "On it, Ms. Carter."

As he sprinted away, skeptical murmurs rippled through the onlookers. Liam studied Evelyn with an unreadable expression, something unfamiliar stirring behind his steel-gray eyes.
###Chapter 11

Had Liam's background check on Evelyn missed something crucial?

Ethan Reynolds was the only one visibly excited at the prospect of uncovering an expert in such matters.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he asked eagerly, "did you major in chemistry?"

Evelyn's eyes shimmered with emotion, but her mind was blank. She shook her head softly. "I don't remember anything."

"Nothing at all?" Ethan's face fell instantly. "Then how did you recognize Azurium and Rhenium? And you even knew the antidote to the toxic gas!"

Evelyn considered for a moment before replying matter-of-factly, "It's like knowing you need salt to cook or bait to fish. Common sense."

The fact that she called such advanced knowledge "common sense" nearly made Ethan drop to his knees in admiration.

Nearby, Adrian Castillo and Ryan Sullivan returned with their team, administering alkaline water to the poisoned staff.

Within minutes, the vomiting stopped, and the abdominal pain faded. Though some still felt dizzy, the antidote had worked like a miracle.

Ryan approached Liam respectfully, offering the solution. "General Blackwood, this works. Please give it to Ms. Dawson."

Victoria clenched her teeth, furious that Evelyn had stolen the spotlight. "I won't drink that!"

Liam frowned. "Why not?"

Victoria burst into dramatic tears. "Liam, I refuse to take some random concoction! Evelyn didn’t even finish middle school—she’s practically illiterate! There’s no way she knows anything about this!"

If Evelyn hadn’t graduated middle school, that meant she only had an elementary education. The room buzzed with shock, some casting disdainful glances her way.

Evelyn’s chest ached, but she kept her composure. "I see Ms. Dawson has principles. After all, a person of integrity would never accept charity from someone they despise."

She flashed a cool smile. "Stay strong, Ms. Dawson. I’m rooting for you."

With that, she turned and walked away, her slender figure disappearing into the distance, radiating quiet sorrow.

Victoria pouted. "Liam, what did she mean by that?"

Liam’s expression darkened. He said nothing.

Could she really not understand such a simple remark?

Ryan sighed and explained patiently, "Ms. Dawson, Madam implied that if you think she’s beneath you, then you shouldn’t accept her help. Like a proud beggar refusing food from someone they dislike."

Victoria gasped dramatically. "Liam! She insulted me! She called me a beggar!" She collapsed onto the bed, sobbing.

The room fell into awkward silence.

Liam was more preoccupied with the destroyed Azurium and Rhenium—especially the latter, which was nearly impossible to replace. A headache pulsed at his temples.

He massaged his brow and ordered coldly, "Ryan, make sure she drinks it." Then he strode out without another word.

Victoria shrieked after him. "Liam! Wait! I feel awful! You can’t leave me like this!"

He didn’t slow down. If anything, his steps quickened.

After the mess Victoria had caused, everyone was growing tired of her theatrics.

Once Liam left, the room emptied quickly. Doctors tended to other patients, while Ethan and his team cleaned the lab.

Adrian cast Victoria one last glance before following Liam.

Only Ryan remained, holding the glass with a resigned expression. "Ms. Dawson, General Blackwood has enough to deal with. Don’t make it harder. Just drink this."

Realizing no one was indulging her anymore, Victoria snatched the glass and gulped it down weakly.

Ryan exhaled in relief.

A thought nagged at him. Was this really the woman Liam had been infatuated with for over a decade?

His taste was… questionable. Compared to Evelyn, Victoria didn’t stand a chance.
###Chapter 12

The night wrapped around Blackwood Manor like a velvet glove, silent except for the occasional rustle of leaves.

Fresh from her bath, Evelyn Carter stepped onto the balcony, the cool night air kissing her damp skin. She settled into the wicker chair, fingers dancing across her phone screen.

Brett Hawkins, the man who'd held her captive, lay dead in a pool of his own making. All hostages from Technive had been rescued unharmed. Liam Blackwood's team had rounded up the remaining criminals, delivering them to justice.

Her purse and phone had been recovered. But the discovery that her brother Dominic had drained her three years' worth of savings left her numb.

Now Evelyn stood penniless, clutching only her smartphone like a lifeline.

After her memory loss, Margaret Thorn had taken her in, treating her like family. That kindness had led Evelyn to become Margaret's caretaker.

Friendless and with relatives who brought only misery, she had nowhere to turn in her financial crisis.

The creak of the door shattered her thoughts. Evelyn stiffened, turning toward the sound.

Liam's imposing silhouette filled the doorway as he entered. Her pulse quickened inexplicably.

Nervous fingers fumbled with her reading app, selecting a random novel to feign absorption.

Each of Liam's measured footsteps echoed like a drumbeat in her chest. The air grew thick, making breathing difficult.

He moved past her line of sight.

Looking up, she found him leaning against the balcony railing, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. A shiver ran down her spine.

"Something wrong?" she managed, voice barely above a whisper.

"Tell me again," Liam's voice cut through the night, "about your memory loss three years ago."

"It's as I said before," Evelyn replied.

His lips pressed into a thin line. "What do you know about Azurium?"

Information flooded Evelyn's mind with crystalline clarity, as if etched there permanently.

"Azurium's primary use is in biochemical weapons," she recited. "Its electron configuration makes it highly reactive, capable of massive detonations when combined with—"

Liam raised a hand, brow furrowing. "Hold on."

She fell silent immediately.

While each word made sense individually, the technical specifics left him baffled. "You called Azurium 'common'?"

Evelyn nodded earnestly, her wide eyes reflecting moonlight.

A humorless chuckle escaped Liam.

The Aldenrian military had invested 80 million dollars in mere ounces of Azurium for defense research. This woman dismissed it as commonplace?

Victoria Dawson's stunt at the lab had vaporized that investment. The true loss wasn't monetary—pure Azurium was nearly impossible to procure at any price.

"Middle school chemistry doesn't cover this," Liam observed darkly. "How do you know these details?"

Evelyn merely shook her head.

"I'll have my team reinvestigate your past," he declared.

Her heart plummeted. The bitter taste of shame rose in her throat. Some histories were better left buried.

"Dr. Reynolds wants you at the lab," Liam continued.

Evelyn's thumb moved absently across her screen, rereading the same sentence without comprehension.

"But I'm no scientist. Today was just... fortunate recall."

Liam remained silent.

She met his gaze. "I read extensively. Maybe I retained something about Azurium from an article."

The lie hung between them, fragile as glass.
###Chapter 13

Evelyn gestured toward the bookcase in the corner. "I've read every single book on your shelves these past few days."

Liam studied her face intently. "You're really not going to reconsider?"

Her lashes fluttered downward. "No. My flight leaves at dawn. This might be goodbye forever."

He didn't press further.

The silence between them grew heavy as he strode past her into the bedroom. His fingers worked methodically at his shirt buttons. "When we visit Grandmother tomorrow, don't mention the divorce. It would only worsen her condition."

Evelyn's grip on her phone turned white-knuckled. The device trembled in her hand like a trapped bird.

A dam burst inside her. "I found something in your copy of War and Peace. A photograph of a little girl." Her voice cracked. "The inscription read 'My one true love - Victoria Dawson.'"

Liam froze mid-motion. His entire body went rigid as if struck by lightning.

The shadows in his eyes deepened. He remained silent.

The pain in Evelyn's chest pulsed like an open wound. She forced her expression neutral, masking the hurt. "I assume she's the woman you always intended to marry?"

An eternity passed before Liam resumed undressing. "Childhood infatuation. She left for boarding school at fourteen and we lost contact." His tone was carefully measured. "Haven't seen her in over a decade. She's practically a stranger now, despite being back in town for a year."

He disappeared into the ensuite bathroom without another word.

His explanation provided no comfort. The ache in Evelyn's chest intensified. She couldn't shake the feeling of being an interloper in their story. Liam and Victoria had shared a lifetime before she'd ever entered the picture.

Had fate not intervened, they'd be married by now. What was the point of clinging to this hollow marriage?

The night air chilled her flushed cheeks as she stepped onto the balcony. She welcomed the cold, hoping it might numb the pain.

Returning inside, she dimmed the lights and burrowed beneath the covers. Normally sleep came easily, but tonight her mind raced. Liam's presence in the adjacent room made relaxation impossible.

Every time she closed her eyes, unwanted images surfaced.

The bathroom door creaked open fifteen minutes later. She felt the mattress dip as Liam slid in beside her. Darkness swallowed the room whole.

Though mere inches separated them, the gulf between their hearts felt oceanic.

A phone vibration shattered the silence.

Evelyn's body went taut in the darkness.

Liam fumbled for his device. Victoria's saccharine voice filled the room through the speaker. "Liam, I'm scared. Please come stay with me?"

The sheets rustled as he threw them off. The bedroom door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn lay perfectly still, eyes squeezed shut. She'd heard every word. Witnessed his haste to leave.

She told herself not to care. He wasn't worth her tears.

Yet the pain came anyway - sharp and relentless. Hot tears soaked her pillowcase.

Rolling onto her side, she muffled her sobs in the duvet. Her teeth sank into her forearm, channeling the heartache into physical pain.

The bite mark would fade. The scars he'd left on her soul never would.

Beneath the covers, her shoulders shook with silent, uncontrollable grief.
###Chapter 14

Liam stepped out of the bedroom, his footsteps echoing down the dimly lit hallway. The grandfather clock struck midnight as he entered his private study, flipping the light switch with practiced ease.

His fingers dialed Victoria's number before he even sat down.

He'd deliberately chosen this room to avoid disturbing Evelyn, who was peacefully asleep in their shared bed.

"Liam! Where are you?" Victoria's shrill voice pierced through the receiver the moment she answered. "I'm terrified here alone!"

Exhaustion weighed heavy on Liam's shoulders. "What exactly are you afraid of?" he asked, keeping his tone measured.

Victoria switched to her signature pouty voice. "Does it matter? Just come over and stay with me!"

Glancing at his Rolex, Liam noted the late hour. "It's past midnight. Highly inappropriate." His voice turned firm. "I'll have security stationed outside your door."

"But there's nothing to fear. Get some rest. I'm taking Evelyn back to Aldenria first thing tomorrow."

Victoria's displeasure was immediate. "I thought Adrian was handling that? Why must you go?"

Sinking into his leather chair, Liam massaged his temples. "She's my wife. Fulfilling basic marital duties is the bare minimum."

"Nate, she's... contaminated!" Victoria's voice turned shrill. "You can't possibly be intimate with her!"

Liam's expression darkened. "Victoria Dawson," he warned, "that's enough. Everyone's past deserves respect."

He could hear her sharp intake of breath before the tears started. "You've slept with her, haven't you? I heard she carries diseases! What if—"

Had this been anyone else, Liam would have terminated the call immediately. But this was Victoria Dawson - the girl he'd idolized since childhood.

Taking a steadying breath, Liam maintained his composure. "Whether I share a bed with my wife has no bearing on my feelings."

"I don't love her. Therefore, I haven't touched her. End of discussion." His tone left no room for argument. "And I won't tolerate this kind of talk again."

"Then if you love me so much," Victoria purred, testing boundaries, "why won't you sleep with me instead?"

Liam's patience shattered.

"Victoria Dawson," his voice dropped dangerously low, "is this what ten years abroad taught you? Who put these ideas in your head?"

Recognizing her misstep, Victoria backpedaled quickly. "Liam, darling, I was only joking!"

"I don't have time for jokes." His tone brooked no argument. "Go to bed. Security will be there shortly. And Ryan is bringing a therapist for you tomorrow morning."

"A therapist? Whatever for?" Victoria's shock was palpable.

"Figure it out yourself," Liam replied before ending the call.

Within minutes, he'd dispatched security to Victoria's residence and arranged for morning counseling. Leaning back, Liam rubbed his tired eyes, memories surfacing.

Young Victoria had been plump-cheeked and kind-hearted - a sensitive child who never made unreasonable demands. Her pouting face had charmed everyone, her emotional intelligence remarkable for her age.

But the woman she'd become... Liam wasn't so sure anymore.

Dawn found Liam awake first.

"Evelyn." His morning voice, rough with sleep, sent shivers down her spine. "Time to wake up."

When gentle shaking followed, Evelyn stirred reluctantly. Warmth enveloped her - she was curled against Liam's solid chest, his heartbeat steady beneath her ear.

Blinking sleepily, she looked up to find Liam's striking features inches from hers, his expression unreadable.

Reality crashed down. She was practically draped over him - one arm around his neck, a leg hooked over his hips in scandalous proximity.

Evelyn recoiled as if burned, scrambling to the far side of the bed. "I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to—I was asleep, I swear—"

Her frantic apologies made her seem like a chastened child rather than a grown woman. After all, someone like her shouldn't dare touch someone like Liam Blackwood.

The sudden absence of her warmth left Liam strangely hollow. He wasn't certain whether his current... situation resulted from morning physiology or Evelyn's unconscious ministrations. Regardless, the evidence was undeniable.

"Unnecessary," Liam dismissed coolly, clearing his throat.

Evelyn's gaze dropped. Memories of Liam visiting Victoria last night resurfaced, twisting her stomach. When had he returned?

"Get ready," Liam said, throwing back the covers. "I'm driving you to Aldenria after breakfast."

Evelyn froze. "You're taking me?"

"Yes." Liam moved to the wardrobe and began undressing without ceremony.

His bare back was a masterpiece of sculpted muscle, each ridge and valley casting shadows that drew Evelyn's gaze like a magnet. Heat flooded her cheeks as her pulse accelerated. She spun away. "Must you change here?"

Liam paused mid-motion, trousers halfway down. Military living had erased any modesty - this was simply habit. Without reply, he took his clothes into the adjoining bathroom.

When he emerged fully dressed, Evelyn found her voice again. "I thought Adrian was handling my return?"

"Adrian's occupied," Liam answered, fastening his cufflinks.

"What about Ryan?"

"Unavailable."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "With hundreds at your disposal, you can't spare one driver?"

Liam's gaze sharpened, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn backtracked quickly. "A train ticket would suffice—"

"Why can't I take you?" Liam countered, a challenging edge to his voice.
###Chapter 15

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, her voice barely above a whisper. "I assumed you'd prefer spending the day with Victoria."

The words carried an undercurrent of hurt that Liam didn't miss. It made something in his chest tighten uncomfortably.

He hated that reaction. "That wasn't my intention," he replied curtly.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, releasing the tension in her shoulders.

If he wanted to abandon her here, so be it. She'd make him sign the divorce papers as soon as they returned to Blackwood Manor anyway. This torment needed to end.

After freshening up and changing into casual wear, Evelyn grabbed her purse and followed Liam to the base cafeteria.

The morning crowd buzzed with activity. Every passing soldier saluted them respectfully.

"Good morning, General Blackwood. Mrs. Blackwood."

Liam acknowledged none of them - there were simply too many.

Evelyn, however, offered warm smiles and cheerful "Good mornings" to each greeting. Her kindness during the recent chemical spill incident had made her beloved among the troops.

She selected a quiet corner table while Liam fetched their meals. He returned with two trays, sliding one toward Evelyn without ceremony.

As he ate, Liam noticed Evelyn's peculiar eating habits - meticulously peeling crusts from toast, separating egg whites from yolks, picking croutons from her salad.

His fork clinked against the plate. "You share Victoria's exact same irritating quirks."

Evelyn swallowed a bite of salad. "Pardon?"

"Victoria," Liam smirked. "Do all women have these ridiculous food aversions?"

The mention of Victoria extinguished Evelyn's already-diminished appetite.

She set down her fork. "I'm finished."

"Don't waste food," Liam commanded without looking up.

Evelyn's chest constricted. Jaw clenched, she speared the discarded toast crusts and forced them down, followed by every detested crouton.

To Liam, her petulant chewing was oddly endearing.

Their silent car ride to Aldenria stretched six excruciating hours, broken only by brief rest stop pauses.

Upon arrival, Liam finally spoke. "Blackwood Manor or Shovale first?"

Shovale - the exclusive retirement community where Margaret Thorn resided. Liam's grandmother remembered only him since her Alzheimer's diagnosis. Evelyn had cared for her as a nurse before their arranged marriage.

Margaret had stopped paying Evelyn and barred her from Shovale, effectively trapping her at Blackwood Manor - where Liam himself rarely stayed.

"Drop me at East No. 3," Evelyn said after consideration.

Liam's brow furrowed. "Your family home?"

"Yes." Her tone gave nothing away.

Liam didn't press. Her whereabouts concerned him little with pressing matters awaiting at base.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn directed them to stop at a hardware store.

She emerged carrying a burlap sack and aluminum baseball bat purchased with her nearly maxed-out credit card.

Liam's questioning glance went unanswered as the car rolled toward the slums.
###Chapter 16

"Thanks for the ride." The moment the car stopped, Evelyn threw open the door and stepped out in a hurry, clutching her shopping bags. She slammed the door shut behind her and marched toward a rundown building.

Two thugs were smoking outside, their eyes scanning the street.

Liam knew instantly this wasn't a normal place. The men at the entrance were clearly guards.

He ordered the driver to call for reinforcements before stepping out and following Evelyn.

The thugs recognized her. They let her pass without question but blocked Liam when he tried to enter.

Liam gestured toward the door. "That woman you just let in is my wife. I'm going in with her."

One of the men smirked. "Dominic's sister is your wife? You'd have better luck telling me I'm your damn father, pal."

Liam had no patience for words. Men like these only understood one language.

His expression darkened. His fist flew before they could react.

A sharp crack echoed as his punch landed on the first thug's skull, knocking him out cold.

The second man scrambled for his knife, but Liam was faster. A brutal strike sent him crumpling to the ground, writhing in agony.

Liam pulled out a handkerchief, wiping his hands as he stepped inside.

The dimly lit corridor led to a crowded underground casino. The air was thick with smoke and the murmur of gamblers.

A commotion in the corner caught his attention.

He pushed through the crowd—and froze.

Evelyn had pulled a burlap sack over a man's head. She swung the baseball bat with terrifying force, striking him again and again.

The man screamed, clawing at the sack, but she didn't stop. Her jaw was clenched, her movements ruthless. She looked ready to break every bone in his body.

No one intervened. The spectators only whispered among themselves.

"Damn, Dominic's sister doesn't hold back."

"If your brother sold you to traffickers and you survived, you'd do worse."

"Should've stabbed him instead!"

The casino manager finally spoke up. "Hey, Dominic's sister, he still owes me a fortune. You kill him, who's paying his debts?"

Evelyn ignored him. She only paused when her arms grew tired, breathing heavily, sweat glistening on her skin.

The moment the beating stopped, the man yanked off the sack. "Who the hell—"

His voice died when he saw her.

His face paled.

How was she alive?

"E-Evelyn? You're back?" He scrambled to his feet despite his injuries.

Evelyn took a slow breath, her voice icy. "Don't say my name. You lost that right." She tightened her grip on the bat. "Yes, I survived. And now, you're not my brother—you're my enemy. Pray you kill me first, because I won't stop until you're broken."

Dominic staggered back, forcing a weak smile. "Evelyn, come on. We're family."

She raised the bat again. "I swear on Dad's grave, I'm leaving you crippled today."

Dominic panicked. "He was my father too!" He bolted into the crowd, dragging his injured leg behind him.

Evelyn moved to chase him—then froze.

Liam stood there, watching.

Her breath hitched.

His polished presence was starkly out of place in this den of filth.

Her stomach twisted.

When had he come in?
###Chapter 17

Liam Blackwood never imagined Evelyn Carter could be so fierce. She always appeared so delicate and soft-spoken.

Before Evelyn could speak, a thug burst in, pointing at Liam. "Boss! That's the guy who started trouble! He knocked out Harry and punched me!"

Within moments, Liam found himself encircled by several burly bouncers, their murderous glares fixed on him.

This was an underground casino that only welcomed regular patrons. Every gambler in the room eyed Liam with suspicion - a stranger in their midst.

"Why did you attack my men and force your way in here?" Vince, the casino manager, demanded.

Evelyn stepped protectively in front of Liam. "Vince, he's with me."

Vince snorted. "You came here beating up your own brother, disturbing my customers. Fine. But this?" He gestured to his injured men. "Your friend assaulted my security."

Evelyn worried Liam couldn't handle all the bouncers. "I apologize for him, Vince," she said soothingly. "We'll leave now without further trouble."

She grabbed Liam's hand to exit.

Several thugs blocked their path. "Oh no you don't. You're not walking away that easily."

Evelyn froze.

She didn't realize she was still clutching Liam's hand tightly.

Liam wasn't concerned about the bouncers. What captivated him was Evelyn's nervous defense of him.

His gaze dropped to their intertwined hands. Her soft fingers gripped his with surprising strength, making his pulse quicken.

Victoria Dawson's touch had never elicited this reaction.

Evelyn forced a smile. "What do you want, Vince?"

"Compensation for my men's medical bills," Vince growled.

Evelyn sighed. Money ruled everything here.

"How much?"

Vince held up five fingers.

Evelyn turned to Liam. "Do you have cash? Give him five thousand."

Liam's expression darkened.

"Five thousand?" Vince laughed harshly. "I meant five hundred thousand!"

"That's robbery!" Evelyn gasped.

"No payment, no leaving."

"Fifty thousand?" she bargained.

"Not a single cent," Liam declared imperiously.

He despised extortion and would never comply.

Vince studied Liam's muscular frame and commanding presence. The man looked capable, but surely not against so many.

Vince smirked. "Cocky bastard. Think you can walk out without paying?" He waved his men forward. "Get him!"

Liam pushed Evelyn toward the crowd. "Stay back. Don't get hurt."

Worried, Evelyn retreated to avoid complicating things for him.

Several men charged with metal bats. Liam dispatched them effortlessly with a sweeping kick, sending them crashing before they could swing.

The bats clattered loudly.

The room fell silent in shock.

Chaos erupted as patrons scattered or gathered to watch the unprecedented spectacle.

Seeing his men fall so quickly, Vince panicked. He stepped back, shouting, "Everyone! Take him down now!"
###Chapter 18

The gang of thugs brandished their weapons and charged toward Liam.

Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs. Every instinct screamed at her to throw herself between him and danger.

Liam remained utterly composed. With practiced ease, he drew his pistol and leveled it at Vince.

Vince's face drained of color. His hands shook violently as he yelled, "Hold! Everyone freeze!"

The remaining gamblers scattered like frightened mice at the sight of the weapon. In Aldenria, only those with immense power carried firearms legally - people you didn't cross.

Evelyn exhaled sharply when she saw Liam's gun. Now she understood his calm demeanor.

Vince forced an ingratiating smile. "My apologies, sir. Please, take your leave. Consider the debt forgiven."

A commotion erupted outside.

Liam checked his watch precisely as ten black SUVs screeched to a halt. His men operated with military precision.

Holstering his weapon, Liam watched as Vince wiped sweat from his brow, thinking the danger had passed.

Suddenly, two dozen armed operatives in tactical gear stormed the casino, subduing every thug within seconds.

"Apologies for the delay, General Blackwood," his lieutenant said with a crisp salute.

Only one man in Aldenria commanded such forces - General Liam Blackwood, supreme commander of the Aldenrian Special Forces.

Vince collapsed to his knees, trembling. "General Blackwood! Mercy! I beg you!"

Liam ignored the groveling man. "Shut this place down. Arrest them all."

"Yes, sir!"

His team moved with ruthless efficiency.

Liam's nose wrinkled at the stench of stale alcohol and sweat as he turned to leave.

Evelyn hurried after him, her pulse racing as she stared at his broad shoulders. Despite knowing his heart belonged to another, admiration swelled within her. She despised her own weakness.

The armored limousine whisked them away from the scene.

Liam knew Evelyn couldn't return to her family. Shadowmire Island wasn't an option either - he couldn't risk her upsetting his grandmother with talk of divorce.

The car glided through Blackwood Manor's wrought iron gates.

Evelyn hesitated, staring at the palatial estate. The mansion loomed like a gilded cage, sending sharp pain through her chest.

Liam unbuckled his seatbelt. "Come. We'll enter together."

Her fingers clutched his sleeve. "Liam, please. Take me to Shadowmire instead."

His icy gaze dropped to her hand.

She recoiled as if burned.

"This is your home," he stated with finality.

Home? She had none - not with her family, not here.

Bitter anguish threatened to choke her. "Why must you be so cruel?" Her voice cracked.

Why chain her to this loveless marriage? Why torment her with his indifference and family obligations?

The injustice of it all crushed her spirit.
###Chapter 19

Liam stood frozen, staring into Evelyn's shimmering hazel eyes. A single tear traced down her porcelain cheek.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest. The sight of her distress confused him, stirring an unexpected irritation.

"What happened?" His voice came out sharper than intended.

Evelyn turned her face away, hastily brushing away the evidence of her emotions with trembling fingers.

Taking a steadying breath, she composed herself. "It's nearly dinner time. Your entire family will be gathered. I'll go in first - wait by the doorway and listen."

Before he could respond, she slipped from the car and strode toward the Blackwood mansion without a backward glance.

The moment Evelyn crossed the threshold, Winston, the family's longtime butler, materialized from the shadows.

The silver-haired man in his late fifties maintained perfect composure, though his eyes widened briefly in surprise.

"Ah, Mrs. Blackwood. How fortunate - dinner is about to be served," Winston intoned with practiced politeness.

Evelyn recognized the hollow courtesy. Every staff member at Blackwood Manor treated her with the same detached professionalism masking thinly veiled disdain.

"Thank you," she murmured before moving past him.

The grand living room buzzed with cheerful conversation as the Blackwood clan lounged around an ornate mahogany coffee table. The warm glow of crystal chandeliers illuminated their contented faces.

"Mother, Father, good evening—"

Evelyn's greeting shattered the domestic harmony like glass.

An icy silence descended. Dozens of eyes turned toward her, their gazes sharp as daggers.

Goosebumps prickled along her arms. Her throat constricted under the weight of their collective hostility. She opened her mouth to greet others, but a cutting voice interrupted.

"Darling, who is this woman calling you 'Mother'?"

"That? Just the caretaker from Shadowmire Island who manipulated Grandmother Margaret. Don't tell me you've forgotten how she trapped Liam into marriage by threatening the old woman's life?"

"Oh, that schemer! I'd nearly succeeded in forgetting her existence."

"How careless of you. A conniving gold-digger like her leaves quite an impression."

"Poor Liam. A decorated military leader with such impeccable reputation, shackled to this... creature. What a disgrace."

"Absolutely. She's not fit to polish our silverware, let alone bear the Blackwood name."

"Winston, have my meal sent to the solarium. I refuse to share a table with this... person. She ruins my appetite."

The barrage of insults continued unabated, each more vicious than the last, delivered without regard for her presence.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. Her entire body trembled with suppressed rage. Hot tears threatened, but she blinked them back through sheer willpower.

This was nothing compared to the humiliation she'd endured when first arriving. Back then, she'd believed Margaret's assurances that Liam returned her affection.

She'd suffered their cruelty for love's sake, clinging to the belief that at least Liam cared.

Now the memory turned to ashes in her mouth. Did Liam secretly share his family's contempt?

Clearing her throat, she spoke, though her voice wavered slightly. "I apologize for disturbing you all. I only returned to announce that Liam and I will be divorcing. You needn't concern yourselves with me any longer."

She refused to disparage Liam directly. This was the only way to show him the torment she'd endured in his home.

If he didn't love her, he should let her go!

"A divorce? Splendid news! We must open the '85 Lafite to celebrate—"

The room fell abruptly silent. All eyes shifted behind Evelyn, their expressions transforming into obsequious smiles.
###Chapter 20

Evelyn sensed Liam's presence the moment he stepped through the grand foyer doors.

Though the youngest Blackwood heir, Liam commanded undeniable authority that even his elder siblings respected. His parents dared not challenge him.

Richard and Eleanor Blackwood sprang from their seats, their faces lighting up as they rushed past Evelyn without a glance.

"My boy! You've finally come home!" Richard boomed, clapping Liam on the shoulder.

Eleanor cupped her son's face with trembling hands. "Let me look at you, darling. Have you lost weight this past month?"

Liam gently removed his mother's hands, his stormy gaze sweeping across the assembled family.

"Since you're here, stay for a few days at least," Eleanor pleaded, sensing his dark mood.

Ignoring his parents, Liam's voice cut through the room like winter wind. "Who did my wife offend? Whose precious home did she soil?"

Wife? Evelyn's breath hitched. The word sent shockwaves through her system.

She never imagined Liam would defend her against his own flesh and blood. The humiliation weighing on her shoulders lightened fractionally.

His sisters-in-law shifted uncomfortably, opening their mouths to protest before shrinking under his glare.

Richard's face darkened. "Liam! These are your elders! Show some respect!"

Liam's piercing gaze turned to his father. "Respect?" His voice dropped dangerously. "Tell me, Father, have they shown basic human decency?"

Richard faltered, unable to counter.

The room erupted in indignant protests.

"You've gone too far!"

"We merely spoke the truth about that woman!"

"Don't pretend you care for her!"

Chaos descended upon Blackwood Manor.

Liam finally understood Evelyn's reluctance to live here. Even without love between them, she deserved basic dignity.

Without another word, he seized Evelyn's wrist and turned toward the exit.

Eleanor rushed after them. "Liam! Where are you going? This is ridiculous over some harmless comments!"

"You can't possibly be angry with us!" Richard called after them.

After bundling Evelyn into the car, Liam turned to his mother. "We're returning to Blackwood Manor. I'll visit when I have time."

"But you just arrived!" Eleanor cried.

The car door slammed shut, cutting off further protests.

Tension thickened the air inside the vehicle. Evelyn leaned against the window, watching the world blur past through unshed tears.

Liam broke the silence. "I apologize for my family's behavior."

Evelyn closed her eyes against the fresh wave of pain. His apology only highlighted the cruel distance between them.

Her voice barely rose above a whisper. "Let's get divorced."

A beat of silence. Then: "After Grandmother's birthday."

Relief and sorrow warred in Evelyn's chest. "Thank you," she murmured.

Turning fully toward the window, she let the tears fall. The vibrant spring scenery mocked her inner devastation.

Each breath burned like shards of glass in her lungs. The weight of unspoken words threatened to crush her completely.
###Chapter 21

The drive lasted exactly fifty-three minutes.

Liam pulled up to the gilded gates of Royal Heights.

This was the most exclusive enclave in all of Aldenria - home to presidents, military commanders, and the nation's most brilliant minds. The car came to a smooth stop. "Step out," Liam ordered.

Evelyn's breath caught when she saw the words "Royal Heights" etched in platinum lettering above the gates. Reality crashed over her - Liam had brought her somewhere ordinary citizens couldn't even approach.

Her fingers trembled as she unclasped the seatbelt. The pavement felt unsteady beneath her heels as she moved to stand beside him.

Two armed sentries approached with practiced efficiency. The taller one examined Liam's identification with a sharp nod.

"General Blackwood," they greeted in unison, snapping perfect salutes.

Liam acknowledged them with a tilt of his chin.

Advanced scanners whirred to life, sweeping the vehicle with invisible beams. Only after the system beeped approval did the guards step aside. "Clear for entry, sir."

"This woman will be residing here," Liam stated. "Register her biometrics."

Evelyn's protest died in her throat as technicians appeared with equipment. "We'll need fingerprints and retinal patterns for security clearance," one explained.

Before she could object, they'd guided her through the process, her biological data now permanently embedded in the compound's systems.

She slumped back into the passenger seat, defeated.

As they drove through the manicured grounds, Evelyn's stomach twisted tighter with each passing minute.

The mansion came into view after seven minutes - a stately two-story residence with armed patrols circling the perimeter.

The interior surprised her. Unlike the opulent Blackwood estate, this home exuded quiet power. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves dominated the living space, housing what must have been thousands of volumes. The air smelled of leather and aged paper.

She was admiring the reading nook when Liam's voice shattered the moment. "Victoria and I occupy the second floor. Choose any guest room downstairs."

His words landed like a physical blow.

So this was where he brought his mistress. Where they shared a life while she played the dutiful wife elsewhere. The humiliation burned her cheeks.

"I can't stay here," Evelyn choked out. "Victoria will-"

"Victoria's temper is childish at best," Liam interrupted, settling onto the sofa. "I'll manage her."

That affectionate dismissal cut deeper than any insult. Evelyn bit her tongue, clinging to the thought of freedom in thirty days.

She fled to the nearest bedroom, locking the door behind her.

Her knees buckled. Back pressed against the wood, she gulped air like a drowning woman. Through the balcony doors, the sunset painted the sky in hues of betrayal.

Three years of love. Three years of lies.

Had her devotion ever meant anything to him? Or had she merely been an inconvenient obligation?

A sharp pain lanced through her chest. Evelyn fisted her blouse over her heart, twisting the fabric until her knuckles whitened. The physical ache barely registered against the devastation tearing through her.
###Chapter 22

Evelyn Carter shut her eyelids tight, drawing in a ragged breath. She attempted to push down the anguish rising in her chest, but the pain was simply too much.

Tears escaped against her will, tracing hot paths down her cheeks.

Copyright by N?v/elDrama.Org.

At dawn's first light, Evelyn rose from bed. After freshening up, she stepped out of her bedroom chamber.

Her breath caught when she spotted the distinguished visitors occupying the living room sofa - their weighty conversation halting abruptly at her unexpected entrance.

Curious gazes turned toward her.

Liam Blackwood stood smoothly. "President Pierce, may I present my wife, Evelyn Carter."

Harrison Pierce, leader of Aldenria, was a distinguished gentleman in his mid-fifties. His eyes held a warmth that softened his presidential demeanor.

Evelyn blinked in surprise at Liam's casual introduction. Perhaps he saw no reason to conceal their relationship from the nation's leader.

With nervous hands, she approached Harrison and dipped her head respectfully. "Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning to you all."

"Mrs. Blackwood." Harrison extended his hand.

Startled by the gesture, Evelyn accepted his handshake.

Harrison's lips curved. "I've often wondered why Liam remained immune to my daughter's charms. Seeing you now, I understand completely - she simply couldn't compare."

Liam's icy gaze flicked to Evelyn. He noted, not for the first time, how her natural beauty required no artificial enhancements. There was an ethereal quality to her melancholy expression that made her appear softer, more refined than society's polished debutantes.

Most crucially, every aspect of her beauty was authentic - no surgeon's knife had touched her delicate features.

"You flatter me excessively, Mr. President," Evelyn demurred with an awkward laugh. "I'm quite ordinary compared to your accomplished daughter."

The other gentlemen exchanged amused glances.

Evelyn noted the bare coffee table - no refreshments in sight. Clearly, business had taken precedence over hospitality. "Please allow me to prepare some tea," she offered.

"No need for formalities, Mrs. Blackwood," Harrison declined politely.

Evelyn smiled and nodded, yet still retreated toward the kitchen. Proper hosting demanded certain courtesies, regardless of the guests' protests.

Entering the kitchen, she realized the partition allowed sound to travel freely from the living area. She could still hear fragments of their discussion.

Searching for teacups, she instead discovered an exquisite porcelain set alongside premium tea leaves.

Just then, Harrison's voice carried clearly: "Project Shadowhunt has run three years without progress. Given your global resources, I'm hoping you can assist. Finding this individual is critical - not just for weapons advancement, but national security."

Another man added, "Every nation seeks this person. They possess the world's only known supply of hydronium - fifty grams. More importantly, they alone understand how to handle it."

"I'm familiar with the target, Mr. President," Liam responded. "I've pursued this lead for three years."

Evelyn froze, her blood turning to ice.

Hydronium?

That was an extraordinarily volatile compound.
###Chapter 23

Hydronium was the deadliest bioweapon known to mankind. Possessing even a gram of this substance could make any nation invincible.

When combined with ultrasonic waves, hydronium could silently eliminate half the world's population within two hours. No pain. No warning.

Every government was desperate to acquire it.

The bidding wars had reached astronomical levels - five billion dollars per gram was the current market price.

The lively discussion in the living room suddenly fell silent.

Evelyn entered carrying a silver tea tray. She found Liam engrossed in reviewing the Project Foghunt files.

With graceful movements, she set the tray on the mahogany coffee table and knelt beside it. Her practiced hands arranged the delicate china with precision.

The porcelain clinked softly as she poured the steaming amber liquid. The rhythmic sound held everyone's attention captive.

Even Liam found himself distracted from his reading, drawn to watch her elegant ritual.

"Your tea, Mr. President," Evelyn offered the first cup to Harrison Pierce with a polite smile.

Harrison's face lit up as he accepted the cup. "Ah! This must be that rare Earl Grey blend I gifted General Blackwood last month. Exquisite but rather bitter, don't you think?"

"Try this cup," Evelyn suggested gently. "I believe you'll find the flavor more balanced."

The President took a cautious sip, then beamed. "Remarkable! You've worked magic with these leaves, Mrs. Blackwood."

The other officials murmured similar praises as they sampled their tea.

When Evelyn finally served Liam, he noticed something different immediately. The delicate aroma rising from his cup was unlike anything he'd experienced before.

The first sip confirmed it - perfectly balanced flavors danced across his palate. Just the right amount of bergamot, with a whisper of honeyed sweetness. The finish lingered pleasantly.

It wasn't just the quality of the tea leaves that impressed him. Evelyn's brewing technique was nothing short of artistry.

After serving a second round, Evelyn quietly excused herself.

Once she'd left, Harrison leaned forward curiously. "Your wife has remarkable poise, General. She carries herself like royalty."

Liam's brow furrowed slightly. "She's just an ordinary woman from a middle-class family."

Harrison shook his head knowingly. "I've met enough aristocrats to recognize breeding when I see it. That woman is anything but ordinary." He drained his cup and reached for the pot. "Would she consider giving my aide some tea-making lessons? The boy ruins every decent blend I acquire."

"I'll mention it," Liam replied diplomatically.

Outside, Evelyn wandered into the sun-dappled garden. She sank into a wrought-iron chair, tilting her face toward the golden light.

The warmth seeped into her skin as her eyelids grew heavy. Before she realized it, she'd drifted into a light doze.

Liam saw his guests to the gate. Upon returning, he discovered Evelyn asleep in the garden, her cheeks flushed pink from the sun.

He studied her peaceful expression for a long moment.

Noticing the security post nearby, he retrieved a large parasol and positioned it to shade her sleeping form.

A gentle breeze stirred the rose bushes as Evelyn awoke. Her arm tingled from being bent at an awkward angle. As she stretched, she noticed the unexpected shade above her.

Then she smelled it - the earthy aroma of burning sage in a small dish beneath her chair, keeping insects at bay.

Her heart swelled with unexpected warmth. She glanced around the empty garden, wondering which thoughtful soul had tended to her comfort.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn Carter cradled the smoldering sage bowl as she retreated toward Blackwood Manor.

"Madam."

The voice made her turn.

A sharply dressed man approached, offering a respectful nod before extending a sealed envelope. "Colonel Blackwood instructed me to deliver this."

Evelyn accepted it with curious fingers. "What does it contain?"

"Unknown to me," the man replied. "The colonel mentioned he'll be occupied with official matters in Solterra for an indefinite period. Should you require anything during his absence, please don't hesitate to ask."

Her heart constricted at the news of Liam's extended departure. Composing herself, she transferred the sage bowl to the messenger and tore open the envelope.

A platinum credit card slid into her palm, accompanied by a note in bold script: "Door and card PIN: 1516117. Indefinite assignment in Solterra."

Folding the note, Evelyn tucked it away, fingertips tracing the embossed lettering on the card - Liam Blackwood's personal account. A bittersweet weight settled in her chest, equal parts longing and melancholy.

"Who prepared the umbrella and sage earlier?" she inquired softly.

"At Colonel Blackwood's request," came the reply.

The gesture pierced her defenses. How could anyone resist such thoughtful devotion? Victoria Dawson must be drowning in happiness, basking in Liam's affection.

Envy coiled around Evelyn's heart.

What cosmic debt must she repay to earn even a sliver of such devotion in another lifetime?

Shaking off the thought, she reclaimed the sage bowl with murmured thanks and returned inside.

+15 BONUS

The following days at Blackwood Manor unfolded as the most serene Evelyn had known in years.

With staff attending to every need, her world narrowed to literary escapes, melodic interludes, and lazy mornings cocooned in luxurious solitude.

The tranquility shattered exactly seven days later.

News of Evelyn's residence had reached Victoria, who descended upon the manor the moment Liam's departure was confirmed.

"You!" Victoria's accusatory finger trembled with rage as she stormed into the library. "By whose authority do you occupy this house? How dare you touch my collection!"

Evelyn marked her page deliberately before meeting Victoria's furious gaze. Rising, she reshelved the volume with deliberate care. "Liam granted me permission."

Victoria's fists clenched, knuckles whitening. "Listen carefully," she hissed. "My patience with you exists solely out of respect for Colonel Blackwood's grandmother."

She swept an arm toward the custom-built shelves. "Every detail here reflects my taste - this library, these volumes - all designed for our marital home." Her voice turned glacial. "Had you not schemed your way between us, I'd rightfully occupy your place."

"Twenty years of shared history binds us. Was stealing him not enough? Must you pilfer my home, my books?" Victoria's contemptuous laugh held no warmth. "Your audacity astounds me, Evelyn Carter."

To an outsider, Victoria's narrative might seem plausible.

But Evelyn knew the truth.

She'd been an unwitting pawn, unaware of Victoria's existence or Liam's coerced marriage until it was too late.

"My apologies for the intrusion," Evelyn responded flatly. "I'll depart immediately."

Upstairs, she packed with military efficiency - essentials only. The duffel weighed little as she descended.

As she brushed past, Victoria's hand shot out, nails digging into Evelyn's forearm. The smile twisting Victoria's lips held no kindness. "Oh no, you don't leave that easily."
###Chapter 25

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "What do you want?"

Victoria's lips curled into a chilling smile. "Liam's coming home. Did you know this mansion has no security cameras except at the entrance? Perfect for private diplomatic meetings, isn't it?"

A shiver crawled down Evelyn's spine. Every hair on her body stood on end when she saw the predatory gleam in Victoria's eyes.

Before Evelyn could blink, Victoria lunged at the bookshelf, sending expensive leather-bound volumes crashing to the marble floor. Then came the sharp crack of palm against flesh - once, twice - until angry red fingerprints bloomed across Victoria's porcelain cheek.

Evelyn watched in horrified fascination. She'd known Victoria was manipulative, but this level of self-harm shocked even her.

Liam adored Victoria blindly. With Evelyn's already tarnished reputation, no explanation would convince him.

She was trapped.

"You're psychotic," Evelyn spat through clenched teeth. "Hurting yourself just to frame me? You're completely deranged!"

Victoria's eyes narrowed to slits as she advanced like a panther stalking prey.

Evelyn retreated warily. "Does Liam know the monster you really are?"

Victoria's laugh sent chills through Evelyn. "You should've researched your husband better, Evelyn. Everyone knows Liam's childhood sweetheart holds his heart. You'll never understand how deeply he loves me."

"To him, I'm perfection itself - kind, innocent, flawless." Victoria's smile turned vicious. "Do you really think he'd ever doubt me?"

Evelyn couldn't breathe. She turned to flee.

Victoria caught her at the door just as armored tires crunched on the driveway gravel.

The transformation was instantaneous. Tears welled in Victoria's eyes as she wailed, "I'm sorry Evelyn! I never meant to come between you two! Please don't hurt me again!"

"Let go, you lunatic!" Evelyn struggled against Victoria's iron grip.

The car door slammed. Liam's furious footsteps approached.

"Nate!" Victoria sobbed dramatically. "Evelyn hit me! I swear I'm not trying to break up your marriage!"

Liam took in the vivid handprint on Victoria's face. His expression darkened like a thundercloud.

In one brutal motion, he wrenched Evelyn away with enough force to send her sprawling down the stone steps.

Her palms scraped raw against concrete. Tears of pain blurred her vision as she bit back a whimper.

The physical pain was nothing compared to the dagger twisting in her heart.

When Liam saw her bleeding hands, something flickered in his eyes - just for a second. Then his face hardened again.

"I warned you, Evelyn," he growled. "Touch Victoria again and you'll regret it."

Evelyn met his icy gaze, her voice trembling with anguish. "Liam Blackwood, you haven't seen her in a decade. Do you really know this woman? She's framed me repeatedly. That sweet angel act? She's a venomous snake in designer clothes!"
###Chapter 26

Liam's face turned stormy as Evelyn's words sank in. His icy glare sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn trembled with fear. The murderous rage in his eyes terrified her, yet she couldn't remain silent while being framed. She had to defend herself, even if it cost her life.

Whether Liam believed her or not didn't matter anymore. She knew nothing could change his perception of Victoria.

A heavy silence fell between them.

Liam studied the fierce determination in Evelyn's eyes. That same fire had burned when he'd rescued her in Valtoria, and when she'd confronted her gambling-addicted brother at the casino.

Her tearful yet resolute expression reminded him painfully of young Victoria. That same stubborn will to overcome any obstacle.

The resemblance unsettled him, stirring unexpected emotions.

Wiping her tears roughly with bruised hands, Evelyn revealed raw, bleeding wounds. Only then did Liam notice the extent of her injuries.

She grabbed her duffel bag and turned toward the door. Each limping step seemed agonizing as she paused to examine her scraped knees before continuing forward.

The morning sunlight illuminated her retreating figure - so fragile yet proud. While warmth bathed the world, her heart remained in shadows.

Inside, Victoria pressed a hand to her swollen cheek, sobbing dramatically. "I'm not some homewrecker! Why did she attack me? Why?"

With theatrical despair, she retreated into the house.

Liam followed, watching pensively as she gathered scattered books. His sharp eyes noted how carelessly she reshelved them.

The real Victoria from his childhood had been obsessive about proper book arrangement.

The discrepancy shocked him.

That evening in his study, Liam reviewed surveillance footage from Blackwood Manor's entrance. With quick keystrokes, he sent the file to Aldenria Military's top programmer.

"Enhance the audio and remove background noise," he ordered coldly when the call connected. "I need crystal clear dialogue from this specific timestamp."

"Consider it done, General Blackwood," came the confident reply.

Only Liam knew about the hidden cameras at his residence. Evelyn's tear-streaked yet defiant face haunted him. Her resignation stirred an unfamiliar restlessness.

Ten minutes later, the enhanced audio arrived.

Liam hesitated before pressing play. What he heard kept him awake all night.

Shovale Manor stood majestic amidst lush gardens. Evelyn returned with an armful of freshly picked wildflowers.

An elegant silver-haired woman sat in the pergola. Despite her age, Margaret Thorn radiated quiet strength and grace.

"Grandmother," Evelyn called softly.

Margaret extended a welcoming hand. "My dear, have you been gathering flowers again?"

Evelyn arranged the blossoms on the stone table before settling beside her. "The lupines are blooming beautifully," she murmured. "I thought they'd brighten the house."
###Chapter 27

Margaret gently stroked Evelyn's hair with affection, her lips curling into a warm smile. "Your husband has arrived."

Evelyn froze. The color drained from her face instantly.

Margaret gestured toward the grand hallway. "He's waiting inside."

Panic surged through Evelyn as she spun around to look.

Was Liam here to punish her for what happened with Victoria? Or had he finally come to serve divorce papers?

"You stayed here overnight," Margaret whispered conspiratorially. "I believe he missed you terribly. That's why he's come to bring you home."

Evelyn forced her lips into a tight smile, swallowing the bitterness rising in her throat.

Sweet Margaret knew nothing about the disaster their marriage had become. She still imagined them as the perfect couple.

Supporting Margaret's arm, Evelyn helped the elderly woman back into the mansion. The moment they stepped inside, Liam emerged from the study.

Margaret's face lit up. "Come here, dear boy."

"Grandmother." Liam approached with military precision, greeting Margaret with a respectful nod.

Dressed in casual black attire, his simple shirt somehow enhanced his commanding presence.

Despite her resentment, Evelyn couldn't deny the familiar pull of attraction. She averted her gaze, determined not to speak to him.

Liam's eyes lowered when he noticed Evelyn accompanying Margaret.

The man who issued orders with such ease now stood awkwardly silent, his usual confidence gone.

His gaze dropped to Evelyn's injured hands, guilt flashing across his chiseled features.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

Liam cleared his throat. "How are your hands?" His voice was uncharacteristically gentle.

Evelyn instinctively pulled back, curling her fingers slightly. "They're fine," she clipped, too raw for polite conversation.

Margaret frowned. She grabbed Evelyn's wrist, displaying the wounded palms to Liam. "They're clearly not fine! Look at these scratches!" Her voice trembled with concern. "She claims she fell on the road, but look at her knees too - completely scraped raw."

"She wept uncontrollably when I treated her wounds yesterday. Two hours of nonstop crying, Liam. Her eyes were so swollen, if I didn't know better, I'd think she'd lost her husband!"

Evelyn yanked her hand away, cheeks burning. "That's not true," she muttered. "Please don't exaggerate, Grandmother."

Liam shifted uncomfortably. Reaching into his pocket, he produced a small medical tube. "This ointment will help the healing," he offered, extending it toward Evelyn.

She stared at the proffered tube, making no move to accept it. "I appreciate the thought, but no thank you," she said coldly.

Liam flinched as if struck. After a tense moment, he set the tube on the nearby console table, his guilt visibly deepening.

Evelyn guided Margaret to the plush living room sofa. Liam followed silently, taking a seat nearby.

"I'll be in my room if you need me, Grandmother," Evelyn said softly.

Margaret looked startled. "But your husband is right here! Shouldn't you spend time together?"

"He doesn't want my company," Evelyn replied tersely.

Without another word, she turned and walked away.

Liam remained silent, but his intense gaze followed Evelyn's retreating form.

Margaret observed the guilt in her grandson's eyes and smiled knowingly to herself.
###Chapter 28

The evening air was thick with unspoken tension as Evelyn, Liam, and Margaret sat around the dining table. The clinking of silverware against porcelain was the only sound breaking the heavy silence.

Liam's phone buzzed violently against the mahogany surface, shattering the fragile peace.

He glanced at the screen, his brows knitting together in irritation.

Victoria was calling via video chat.

Answering would be inappropriate with Evelyn and Margaret present. Besides, he still hadn't addressed yesterday's incident with Victoria.

With a swift motion, he declined the call and typed a quick message. "Occupied. Will call later."

Sliding the phone aside, he resumed eating with forced nonchalance.

Margaret's sharp eyes caught the exchange. "Work keeping you busy these days?" Her tone was deceptively light.

"Somewhat." Liam kept his answer deliberately vague.

"Business or pleasure?" She nodded pointedly at his device.

"Nothing important," Liam deflected.

The phone lit up again with Victoria's persistent call.

Evelyn didn't need to see the screen to know who it was. She kept her gaze fixed on her plate, though her appetite had vanished.

Liam's eyes flickered to Evelyn before rejecting the call a second time.

Flustered by the interruption, Liam served them both bowls of steaming lobster bisque - Evelyn's favorite.

Evelyn froze, staring at the golden soup. A year ago, this small gesture would have made her heart soar.

Now, it left a bitter taste in her mouth. Slowly, she pushed the bowl away without tasting it.

Liam's jaw tightened. He could see the hurt radiating from Evelyn's stiff posture.

He opened his mouth to speak, but the words caught in his throat. The apology refused to come.

When Victoria called for the third time, Margaret snatched the phone before Liam could react.

The moment the call connected, Victoria's hysterical sobs filled the dining room. "Liam! Evelyn went through my things! My jewelry drawer is ransacked, and my diamond tennis bracelet is missing! It's worth fifteen thousand! I bet she—"

Margaret's face darkened like a thundercloud.

Evelyn kept her head bowed, fingers tightening around her steak knife until her knuckles turned white. An invisible weight crushed her chest, making each breath painful.

Liam swiftly reclaimed his phone. On screen, Victoria was dramatically covering her face, not realizing who had answered.

"Who dares accuse my granddaughter of theft?" Margaret's voice could have frozen hell. "Evelyn was raised with honor and integrity!"

Victoria's crying ceased abruptly. Her eyes flew open, widening when she saw Liam's stormy expression.

"Liam? Is that... Margaret? You're at Blackwood Manor?"

"Yes." Liam's voice was arctic.

"Is... is Evelyn there too?" Victoria's tone turned apprehensive.

"She is." The words were clipped.

Victoria backpedaled frantically. "I didn't mean she stole it! I just thought—"

"Evelyn doesn't touch what isn't hers." Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "We're done here."

"Wait, Liam! When are you—"

The call ended with a decisive tap.

Margaret fixed Liam with a piercing stare. "Are you involved with that woman?"

Liam struggled for words. "It's not what you think, Grandmother. Let's just finish dinner."

Seeing she'd get no straight answer, Margaret turned to Evelyn. "Sweetheart, tell me truthfully - is my grandson betraying your marriage?"
###Chapter 29

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "He's not," she said firmly, coming to Liam's defense.

"Then who is that woman?" Margaret demanded.

Evelyn hesitated. The elderly woman's health was fragile. Bad news could worsen her condition.

Using Liam's own words, she replied, "She's just a confused girl who doesn't understand what she's saying."

Liam's eyes widened in surprise. He hadn't expected Evelyn to shield him after everything that had happened.

Unlike Victoria, Evelyn hadn't lashed out or sought revenge.

Margaret seemed appeased by Evelyn's explanation and didn't press further.

After dinner, the trio retired to the garden gazebo to enjoy the evening.

A light mist hung in the air as crickets chirped their nightly symphony. The soothing aroma of jasmine tea blended with the peaceful atmosphere.

Margaret looked content, surrounded by her grandson and his wife.

A servant approached discreetly. "Madam, there's a Ms. Wright requesting to see you and General Blackwood."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her teacup as she took a nervous sip.

"Who is this Ms. Wright?" Margaret inquired.

The servant replied, "She claims to have grown up with General Blackwood and says she's his true love. She mentioned you once considered her your future granddaughter-in-law."

Liam's expression darkened instantly. "I'll handle this, Grandmother."

Margaret's face mirrored his stormy look. "Stay seated," she commanded coldly. "Let's hear what she has to say."

Liam's fists clenched but he remained in his chair.

Evelyn maintained her composure, though turmoil churned within her. "Grandmother, perhaps I should excuse myself—"

"You'll stay right here," Margaret interrupted sharply. "That's an order."

With no other choice, Evelyn remained seated as Victoria was led to the gazebo.

Victoria floated toward them in a white chiffon dress that made her look ethereal. Diamond jewelry sparkled at her throat and wrists.

"Good evening, Grandmother, Liam," she greeted sweetly, pointedly ignoring Evelyn.

Liam studied her with a mixture of anger and resignation before slumping back in his chair.

"Have a seat, Ms. Wright," Margaret said with forced politeness.

Victoria smiled triumphantly and took the chair beside Liam.

Margaret frowned at the young woman. "Ms. Wright, your earlier words were highly inappropriate. Did you not realize my grandson's wife was present?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her cheeks burning with humiliation.

Victoria shot Evelyn a dismissive glance before turning her charm on Margaret. "Grandmother, don't you remember me? I'm Victoria. We were neighbors for fourteen years. Liam and I grew up together. Your entire family adored me." She leaned forward conspiratorially. "You promised I could marry Liam when we grew up."

Margaret looked startled, her eyes darting between Evelyn and Victoria. "That's impossible," she said uncertainly.

Victoria blinked innocently. "I'm the granddaughter-in-law you cherished, Grandmother. Evelyn merely resembles how I looked as a child." She touched her slender waist. "I was much plumper then, remember? The weight loss changed me. Have you truly forgotten your dear Victoria?"
###Chapter 30

Evelyn's hands shook with barely contained fury. She turned to Liam, her knuckles white from clenching. "She's lying, isn't she, Liam?"

Liam's shoulders slumped in defeat. "She's Victoria, Grandma."

Margaret's face crumpled. Tears welled in her eyes as she grasped Evelyn's hand with trembling fingers. "Sweetheart, tell me they're joking. You're my granddaughter."

Evelyn's heart ached. She'd known this moment would come, but the pain still took her breath away.

She'd accepted Margaret's affection unknowingly, never realizing she'd been mistaken for someone else.

Now the truth was out, she couldn't keep pretending. She didn't deserve to remain as Liam's wife.

The thought of losing Margaret's love felt like a knife twisting in her chest, but she forced herself to continue. "Grandmother, I thought you called me Chubs because of my round face. I never knew you meant someone else."

Tears streamed down Margaret's wrinkled cheeks. "I didn't mistake you, child! You are Chubs! Don't you remember? You were plump as a child. Liam gave you that nickname."

Her voice broke. "You were his whole world. He adored you, but you were too young to understand why."

"When you left for boarding school and stopped writing, Liam was inconsolable. He waited years for you. Begged me to arrange your marriage when you returned. Said he couldn't live without you."

"I fought so hard to bring you two together. And now you're telling me I got it wrong?" Margaret's frail body shook with sobs.

Evelyn's vision blurred. The pain in her chest burned hotter than ever. Their love story was beautiful - the kind of devotion she'd never experience, because she wasn't Victoria.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm so sorry, Grandmother. I truly didn't know. I kept telling you my name was Evelyn, not Victoria."

"I don't care about names!" Margaret cried. "You're still my Chubs! Maybe you're thinner now, more beautiful, but I know your heart. You lived with me for three years. I can't be wrong."

Victoria panicked, fumbling for her phone. "Grandmother, you're confused. Look, I have proof - photos with my parents abroad. And my uncle Julian, you know him. We took pictures every year until... until the accident."

Her voice cracked. "I stayed with Uncle Julian for two years after that. Only returned recently. He can confirm everything. I even visited you once, but you didn't recognize me."
###Chapter 31

Evelyn shoved the phone Victoria thrust at her. "I don't want to see it!"

Tears streamed down her face as she turned to Liam with desperate eyes. "Tell me, Liam! Tell me I wasn't wrong about this!"

Liam moved toward Evelyn before kneeling gracefully. His strong hands enveloped her trembling fingers.

"Grandmother," he soothed in that velvet voice, "don't distress yourself. If you believe Evelyn is Cassandra, then she is Cassandra. Your heart knows best."

Victoria sprang up like a jack-in-the-box. "Liam, I'm the real Cassandra!" Her shrill voice cut through the garden. "You can't rewrite history just to humor her! How long will you let her live in this fantasy?"

"Enough!" Liam's voice cracked like thunder.

The sheer fury in his stormy eyes froze Victoria mid-breath. Her lower lip trembled as unshed tears glistened.

Margaret gazed at Evelyn with heartbreaking tenderness. "She has Cassandra's spirit," the elderly woman murmured. "I'd recognize that light anywhere."

Victoria stomped her designer heels into the grass. "Grandmother, open your eyes! Liam has always loved me! His marriage to Evelyn means nothing!"

"You're destroying him with this charade! Their divorce is inevitable! Why must you be so blind?"

Victoria's venomous words hung in the air like poison. She'd crossed a line no one dared approach.

Liam saw red. His jaw clenched so tight a muscle ticked dangerously. What twisted upbringing had warped Victoria into this viper?

Margaret's cheeks flushed crimson. Her delicate hands shook as she pointed at the younger woman. "How dare you speak to me like that?"

The Thorn matriarch had lived eighty years with grace and kindness. To be insulted by this spoiled brat?

She rose unsteadily, tears blurring her vision. "Leave!" Margaret's voice shook with decades of unused anger. "Get out of my sight!"

Evelyn rushed to steady the swaying woman. "Breathe, Grandmother," she urged, rubbing soothing circles on Margaret's back. "Your blood pressure—"

Then to Liam: "Remove her. Now."

Liam seized Victoria's arm with bruising force, dragging her toward the estate gates.

"I won't go!" Victoria shrieked, digging her heels in. "She's the fraud! That gold-digging whore who slept her way through high society! She even married some senile old—"

Each vile word struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Even without memories, the accusations left her raw.

Inside the gazebo, Margaret gasped for air.

Liam released Victoria so abruptly she stumbled. He was at Margaret's side in three strides, scooping the unconscious woman into his arms.

Victoria stood frozen as Liam charged past, Evelyn close behind with panic written across her face. The garden echoed with the pounding of their footsteps against the cobblestones.
###Chapter 32

Evelyn's hands trembled as she pressed them against the hospital window. The thought that her actions might have triggered Margaret's stroke made her stomach churn.

What if the worst happened?

Then it hit her like lightning. If Margaret didn't survive, the legal bond between Liam and Evelyn would dissolve naturally. No more forced marriage. No more pretending.

The realization sent an unexpected wave of calm through her veins.

The private hospital corridor stretched endlessly, illuminated only by flickering fluorescent lights. An eerie silence blanketed the VIP wing where Margaret lay unconscious.

Evelyn sat vigil at the bedside, clutching Margaret's paper-thin hand between both of hers. Silent tears traced paths down her hollow cheeks as she studied the older woman's peaceful face.

Each beep of the heart monitor sent a fresh stab of guilt through Evelyn's chest. She prayed desperately for those eyelids to flutter open.

Memories flooded back of her own hospital awakening three years prior. The sterile white walls. The pounding headache. The terrifying blankness where her past should have been.

Strangers had crowded her bedside claiming to be family, friends, creditors. Their greedy eyes had betrayed their true intentions before they even spoke.

The police report said she'd stolen millions from a dead ex-husband. That she'd been beaten within an inch of her life for it. The official records painted her as a con artist, a thief, a woman without morals.

Private investigators confirmed her childhood had been a nightmare. Abusive parents. A brother who sold her out. Years spent surviving through questionable means.

Then came Margaret.

The first person to show her unconditional kindness. The woman who treated her like family when she had none. Three years of caregiving had forged a bond deeper than blood.

Now that bond might be severed forever.

A sudden commotion outside the room shattered Evelyn's thoughts. The clock read 3:17 AM when Liam burst into Victoria's bedroom at Blackwood Manor.

Victoria barely had time to gasp before Liam hauled her from the silk sheets, her bare feet scraping against the hardwood as he dragged her down the hallway.

"Liam! Have you lost your mind?" Victoria shrieked, struggling against his iron grip. "It's the middle of the night!"

Liam's jaw remained locked, his stormy eyes fixed ahead as he propelled her toward the grand staircase.

The cold night air hit Victoria's exposed skin as Liam shoved her into the passenger seat of his Aston Martin. He buckled her in with clinical precision before slamming the door.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face as the car peeled away from the manor. "Where are you taking me like this? I'm in my nightgown for God's sake!"

Liam's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. His silence was more terrifying than any outburst.

Thirty minutes later, the car screeched to a halt outside Wright Manor. Liam yanked Victoria from the vehicle and deposited her on the marble steps like unwanted luggage.

"Why are you doing this?" Victoria sobbed, clutching her thin nightdress against the chill.

Liam loomed over her, his voice dangerously quiet. "Let me make something crystal clear, Victoria. I have never loved you. Not then. Not now."

Victoria recoiled as if struck.

"This marriage between Evelyn and me is legally binding. She owns half of everything I have. Blackwood Manor is her home, not yours. Stay in your lane."

The slam of his car door echoed through the estate like a gunshot.
###Chapter 33

Evelyn finally understood the depth of Liam's anger. She let her tears flow freely, hoping her pitiful appearance would soften his heart.

With trembling lips, she whispered, "I'm sorry, Liam. Why are you treating me this way?"

Liam's voice turned icy. "Did you truly believe I wouldn't discover your scheme against Evelyn just because Blackwood Manor has no surveillance?"

All color drained from Victoria's face. She stood frozen, unable to form a response. After a long pause, she finally managed, "Evelyn was the one plotting against me!"

"Still lying?" Liam's disappointment cut deeper than his anger. "Do you take me for a fool, Victoria?"

Realizing the truth couldn't be hidden any longer, Victoria broke down. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she adopted a remorseful expression.

"I'm so sorry, Liam! I never meant for things to go this far!"

Liam clenched his jaw, struggling to control his temper. His voice remained dangerously low when he finally spoke.

"If that were true, you wouldn't have accused Evelyn of theft. You wouldn't have provoked Grandmother into needing hospitalization!"

His next words came like a death sentence. "You're forbidden from interfering with Evelyn ever again. And you won't visit Grandmother alone. One more mistake, Victoria, and you'll face consequences you can't imagine."

Victoria reached for Liam's hand, her touch tentative. "Please," she begged, her voice trembling with false sweetness. "Forgive me this once. I swear it won't happen again."

Liam recoiled as if burned. "Your belongings will be delivered tomorrow," he stated coldly. "Use this time to reflect on your actions." Without another word, he turned and pressed the doorbell.

Victoria's pleas turned desperate. She cried, she begged, she even tried childish pouting - but Liam remained stone-faced.

When the Wright family butler appeared, Liam handed Victoria over without ceremony. He didn't look back as he strode to his car and drove away into the night.

The streets lay empty at this late hour. Liam sped through the darkness, his only thought reaching the hospital. When he finally arrived at Margaret's room, he entered quietly.

There, in the dim light, he found Evelyn carefully tending to his grandmother. She hadn't rested all night, her movements gentle yet tireless.

Liam approached silently. Evelyn turned, their eyes meeting in the half-light. Her breath caught at the intensity of his gaze.

"I thought you'd gone home," she murmured. "Why did you return?"

"I had unfinished business," Liam replied, his voice rough with emotion. "Now that it's settled, I'm here to relieve you. You should rest."

Evelyn shook her head, glancing at the still-sleeping Margaret. "I'm not tired."

Liam took her wrist, pulling her gently to her feet. "I insist," he said firmly. "You need sleep."

The warmth of his touch sent electricity through Evelyn's veins. She pulled away hastily, her cheeks flushing. "Wake me when Grandmother stirs?" she asked shyly.

"Of course," Liam promised.

Evelyn settled onto the narrow cot, curling on her side to face Margaret. She tucked her knees close, making herself small.

Liam watched as she struggled to keep her eyes open. Rising silently, he retrieved a blanket from the closet and draped it over her.

Evelyn's breath caught at his unexpected tenderness. She could only stare, speechless, as he carefully tucked the edges around her.

When he moved to draw the privacy curtain, his final instruction came softly: "Close your eyes."

A strange warmth filled Evelyn's chest as she obeyed. Her heartbeat quickened at the thought of their impending divorce after Margaret's birthday.

Liam embodied honor and loyalty - a man of deep passion beneath his cool exterior. A man who loved his country, his family... and undoubtedly Cassandra.

These bittersweet thoughts followed Evelyn into sleep.

She awoke to find midday sunlight streaming through the windows. Liam sat by Margaret's bedside, helping her with lunch.

Evelyn's heart twisted painfully before she managed a reproachful look. "You promised to wake me!"

Margaret chuckled weakly. "Liam said you finally slept at dawn. He wanted you to rest."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed even as her heart swelled. She took Margaret's hand anxiously. "How are you feeling? Does anything hurt?"

The genuine concern in her voice made Liam look up, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 34

Margaret gave Evelyn's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Don't fret, dear. I'm much sturdier than I look."

Evelyn exhaled deeply, her shoulders relaxing. "Thank heavens you're alright! You gave me such a fright last night!"

A mischievous twinkle appeared in Margaret's eyes. "I may be old, but I'm not made of glass. I need to bounce back quickly."

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "That way I can help you get rid of that meddling homewrecker once and for all."

Liam's face fell at his grandmother's words. He straightened his posture before responding firmly, "Grandmother, there are no homewreckers in our marriage."

Margaret snorted indignantly, sounding more offended than if she'd been the wronged party herself.

"Then explain that hussy from last evening! Don't tell me you believe in platonic friendships between men and women!"

Liam opened his mouth to protest but thought better of it, pressing his lips into a thin line instead.

Evelyn bit her lower lip to suppress a giggle at Liam's flustered expression. Feeling slightly guilty for her amusement, she ducked her head, though the corners of her mouth twitched uncontrollably.

Noticing Evelyn's struggle, Liam's stern expression softened. Margaret gave Evelyn an encouraging pat.

"Sweetheart, I've had the staff prepare fresh toiletries for you. They're waiting in the bathroom. Why don't you freshen up before lunch?"

"Of course," Evelyn replied dutifully before disappearing into the ensuite.

Margaret watched her leave with a wistful sigh. "Whether she's Evelyn or Cassandra, she's perfect for you, Liam. Promise me you won't divorce her just because that other woman says so."

Liam exhaled through his nose, careful not to upset his grandmother further. "Understood."

Margaret narrowed her eyes. "Be honest with me. Do you truly have no feelings for her at all?"

Liam considered the question carefully before answering. "She's remarkable, no doubt. But we've been married barely a month, and spent even less time together. We're practically strangers."

Margaret's voice took on a sage tone. "You've always been responsible, Liam. Now that you're married, you must honor that commitment. Marriage isn't child's play."

Running his fingers through Margaret's silver hair affectionately, Liam could only nod in resignation. "I know, Grandmother."

Margaret beamed. "Couples who weather storms together stay together. I expect you two to have a long, happy life."

Liam suppressed a sigh. He'd already promised Evelyn they'd divorce after Margaret's birthday gala. He never broke his word.

The moment was interrupted by the arrival of the entire Blackwood clan, flooding the hospital room with sudden energy.

Margaret's Alzheimer's made recognition difficult. When they introduced themselves, she only nodded vaguely.

"Mother, it's me, Richard. This is your daughter-in-law Eleanor, your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren come to visit."

Margaret studied them blankly before declaring, "My son's name is Andrew."

"Andrew was your youngest, Mother. He passed at ten. I'm your eldest, Richard."

"My... eldest?"

"Yes! And your grandson Liam is here too!"

Such reunions had become routine - the Blackwoods reintroducing themselves each visit.

Evelyn emerged from the bathroom to find the room packed with unfamiliar faces. She froze in the doorway, overwhelmed.

The Blackwoods barely glanced her way. After years of Evelyn caring for Margaret during hospital stays, her presence had become background noise.
###Chapter 35

The Blackwoods surrounded Evelyn, their voices overlapping as they expressed concern for her condition. Their worried faces and gentle touches created a suffocating cocoon of attention.

Victoria stood awkwardly at the periphery, feeling like an intruder in this intimate family moment. Without a word, she slipped out of the hospital room and found herself drawn to the first-floor garden corridor. The stone bench felt cool beneath her as she sank onto it, her gaze fixed on the distant hedges with unseeing eyes.

A deep baritone voice sliced through her thoughts like a knife. "Penny for your thoughts?"

Victoria startled, her head whipping toward the sound. Liam stood mere inches away, his imposing frame casting a shadow over her. Without waiting for invitation, he took a seat beside her, the space between them charged with unspoken tension.

Her fingers curled into the fabric of her skirt. "Nothing important," she replied, her voice carefully neutral.

Liam's lips twisted into a humorless smile. His next words came out like an accusation. "Did you hear about our classified project?"

Victoria blinked in genuine confusion. When their eyes met, she noticed how his piercing gaze seemed to see straight through her. There was something unsettling about the way he studied her - as if she were a puzzle to be solved.

"Project Shadowhunt?" she ventured cautiously.

His expression darkened. "The details have been compromised."

The implication hit her like a physical blow. Her spine straightened as realization dawned. "You think I leaked it?"

Liam didn't answer immediately. Instead, he looked out across the garden, his profile sharp in the afternoon light. "Aside from the President and his inner circle, only you and I had access to that information."

Victoria's breath caught in her throat. The unfairness of the accusation burned like acid. "It wasn't me," she said, each word deliberate. "I don't know the specifics of your project, Liam. And I certainly didn't share anything about it."

His cold scrutiny didn't waver. "While I was away in Solterra," he said slowly, "I took the opportunity to dig deeper into your background."

A chill ran down Victoria's spine. She clenched her hands in her lap to stop their trembling.

"What I found was... illuminating," Liam continued, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "You have quite the interesting hidden history."

Victoria felt the blood drain from her face. What fresh horror was he about to reveal?

"You were recruited by Obsidian Circle," Liam stated flatly. "Their elite training program."

Victoria frowned. "What's Obsidian Circle?"

"A shadow organization," he explained, his voice like steel. "They specialize in creating perfect weapons - assassins, spies, honey traps."

Goosebumps erupted across Victoria's skin. The accusation was so absurd she nearly laughed. Nearly. Because the look in Liam's eyes told her he believed every word.

She swallowed hard. "I understand why you'd suspect me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I swear to you, I know nothing about your project. I haven't told anyone anything."

Her throat tightened as she continued. "My memory loss is real, Liam. Those missing pieces? I don't want them back. Whatever darkness is in my past, I want it to stay buried."

Tears pricked at her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. "I don't know how to prove my innocence to you. Just like with all of Victoria's schemes against me, I suppose I'll just have to bear the blame."

With a bitter laugh, she spread her hands in surrender. "If you have proof I'm your leak, then by all means - arrest me as the traitor you clearly believe I am."
###Chapter 36

Liam studied Evelyn intently, his voice laced with lingering doubt.

"Evelyn, all these events would perfectly align if you've been pretending to have amnesia this entire time."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her shoulders slumping as she spoke with bitter amusement.

"So you're suggesting I underwent plastic surgery and bonded with Grandma solely to marry you and remain at your side."

"Clearly, wealth and status mean nothing to me because my only goal is stealing classified Aldenria documents. If this amnesia is fake, then I must be some master spy."

"Exactly," Liam confirmed.

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Now that my cover's nearly blown, I'm suddenly desperate for divorce. How conveniently everything fits together."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn tilted her face toward the sky, an invisible vise tightening around her chest. Each breath became a struggle against the crushing weight.

She longed to defend herself, but her memory loss rendered her powerless. She couldn't even be certain what parts of her past were real.

Perhaps she had truly been part of Obsidian Circle before the accident. Maybe getting close to Liam had been part of their scheme all along.

The only difference? She'd forgotten the mission mid-execution.

Words felt useless now - they carried no proof, no substance to clear her name.

Evelyn turned on her heel, preparing to leave the garden without another word when Liam's voice stopped her.

"Evelyn, everything's falling into place too easily."

She froze but kept her back to him.

Liam rose, his gaze fixed on her slender frame. "If you were truly Obsidian Circle, I wouldn't have obtained your files so effortlessly."

"Your background, past records, pre-and post-op photos - even your alleged training records with them. It's as if someone handed me everything on a silver platter."

"That's not how Obsidian Circle operates. Something's off here. I'll keep investigating. Don't overthink it."

His explanation eased some tension in Evelyn's chest. Of course her sudden appearance in his life seemed suspicious - she'd question it too in his position.

After a quiet moment, she murmured, "Thank you for not arresting me."

With official matters addressed, Liam shifted topics. "I've sent Victoria back to Wright Manor. About that night I hurt you... Are you still planning to stay at Blackwood?"

Evelyn kept her back turned, grateful he couldn't see her crumbling composure or the tears welling in her eyes.

"No," she whispered.

"Where will you go then?"

"Wherever the road takes me."

A pang of guilt struck Liam. "Just... let me know if you need anything."

Evelyn's fists clenched at her sides, pulse quickening as fresh sorrow washed over her.

Steeling her voice, she continued, "About the divorce-"

"I'll respect your wishes," Liam interrupted.

It was the answer she'd sought. So why did her heart ache so violently?

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she stared stubbornly at the corridor ahead. "Thank you," she managed.

Not trusting herself to speak further, Evelyn hurried away before any sobs could escape.

The path stretched endlessly before her, each step emphasizing how utterly lost she felt.

She had no idea what came next.
###Chapter 37

Evelyn didn't remain at Blackwood Manor or Shadowmire Island in the following days. She withdrew several thousand dollars from the card Liam had provided, using it to rent a modest apartment and purchase basic necessities.

Without formal education or clear knowledge of her skills, Evelyn settled on buying flowers wholesale at the Floral District. She set up a small cart at a busy plaza to sell them.

This humble venture provided steady income. Within two weeks, she'd saved enough to repay her debt.

Life felt simple yet fulfilling. Meanwhile, she devoted evenings to crafting Margaret's birthday present.

Knowing Margaret adored classical art, Evelyn spent fifteen days hand-embroidering a replica of "Starry Night."

At 8:00 am on Margaret's birthday, Evelyn woke to her doorbell chiming. She rubbed sleep from her eyes, finger-combed her hair, and answered the door.

Ryan stood in the hallway, cradling an enormous gift box. "Good morning, Mrs. Blackwood," he greeted formally.

Evelyn offered a small smile. "Good morning, Mr. Sullivan."

"Mr. Blackwood instructed me to deliver this."

Accepting the package, Evelyn's brows lifted. "What is it?"

"A gown and accessories. I'll return at 5:00 pm sharp to escort you."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest as she held the heavy box. "Please thank Liam for me."

"Certainly, ma'am." Ryan departed with a polite nod.

Evelyn placed the gift on her bed, untied the satin ribbon, and lifted the lid. Inside lay an exquisite white gown with flowing chiffon layers - ethereal as a moon goddess's raiment. Beside it shimmered a jewelry set worthy of royalty.

Never had Evelyn owned anything so luxurious. The thoughtfulness behind the gesture touched her deeply, momentarily softening her lingering resentment.

She spread the dress across her bed, fingers tracing delicate beadwork. Joy sparkled in her eyes like sunlight on morning dew.

Tonight's banquet mattered. She'd comport herself flawlessly, ensuring no embarrassment for Margaret or Liam.

The doorbell rang again.

Assuming Ryan had forgotten something, Evelyn hurried back. Her smile vanished upon seeing her visitor.

"How did you find me?" she asked coldly.

Victoria flashed a saccharine smile and brushed past without invitation. "If Liam knows your address, so do I. He had me select your ensemble." Her gaze swept the apartment. "Cozy."

Evelyn's heart sank. Then she remembered Victoria's penchant for lies designed to divide. She wouldn't be manipulated.

"You weren't invited. Leave."

Victoria ignored the demand, striding to admire the dress. "Evelyn, I came to advise you. Stay invisible tonight. Better yet, don't come. Spare Liam the humiliation of anyone discovering he married beneath him."

The words crushed Evelyn's remaining excitement. She stood frozen, fists clenched, skin paling to match the gown's ivory fabric. No retort came.
###Chapter 38

Evelyn's breath caught when she spotted the half-finished embroidery still lying on her worktable.

The intricate needlework was breathtaking - a perfect replica of Van Gogh's Starry Night recreated with silk threads. Every brushstroke had been painstakingly reproduced with such precision that it could fool museum curators.

"You did this yourself?" Victoria's voice dripped with barely concealed envy as she pointed at the masterpiece.

The question snapped Evelyn from her reverie. She moved to gather the embroidery, hands trembling with urgency.

But Victoria was faster. With a cruel smile, she produced a vial of crimson ink from her designer purse and poured it over the delicate fabric.

The liquid spread like blood across the canvas, obliterating months of work in seconds.

"Have you gone completely mad?" Evelyn's voice shook with barely contained fury.

Victoria merely smirked, then deliberately tipped the remaining ink onto Evelyn's new evening gown.

Evelyn stood frozen, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

Her fingers clenched around the ruined embroidery until her knuckles turned white. The sight of Margaret's birthday gift - the dress Liam had specially commissioned - now stained beyond repair shattered something inside her.

In that moment, Evelyn understood what murderous rage truly felt like.

Victoria carelessly tossed the empty vial onto the bed, then used the cleanest corner of the ruined dress to wipe her hands. The deliberate humiliation made Evelyn's blood boil.

"Remember your place," Victoria said airily. "Someone with your... background would only embarrass the Blackwoods at Margaret's gala. Besides-"

The sharp crack of Evelyn's palm meeting Victoria's cheek silenced the room.

Victoria staggered back, clutching her face in shock. "You dare strike me?"

Evelyn refused to let her tears fall. She wouldn't give Victoria the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Instead, she grabbed the ruined dress and shoved it over Victoria's perfectly styled hair, grinding the stained fabric into the golden locks with all her strength.

"You destroy my work? My gifts? Then you'll wear the consequences!"

Victoria shrieked as Evelyn yanked her toward the door by her hair. With one final shove, Evelyn ejected the screaming woman into the hallway and slammed the door.

The torrent of obscenities that followed would make a sailor blush, utterly destroying Victoria's carefully cultivated innocent image.

Evelyn turned away from the door, her gaze falling on the devastation in her room.

Should she really stay away from Margaret's celebration? Was her presence truly such a disgrace to the Blackwood name?

Even if she wasn't worthy of being Liam's wife, why did Victoria have to destroy what little happiness she'd found?

Two silent tears traced paths down Evelyn's cheeks before she could stop them.

She tilted her head back, pressing her palms against her closed eyes until she saw stars. Her slender frame trembled with the effort of containing her sobs.

The pain in her chest was so acute she feared it might stop her heart.
###Chapter 39

The tension in the room was palpable as Evelyn Carter clutched the medical report in her trembling hands. The sterile hospital lights cast harsh shadows across Liam Blackwood's chiseled features as he stood motionless by the window.

Outside, the storm mirrored the turmoil in Evelyn's heart. Rain lashed against the glass like thousands of tiny needles.

"I don't understand," Evelyn whispered, her voice barely audible over the howling wind. The document confirmed what she'd feared most - the memory loss wasn't accidental.

Liam turned slowly, his military posture rigid. "We've been over this. The car crash-"

"Was no accident," Evelyn interrupted, her green eyes flashing with rare defiance. She thrust the papers toward him. "These test results prove it."

A muscle twitched in Liam's jaw. The man who commanded armies now stood unnervingly still.

Victoria Dawson chose that moment to sweep into the room, her designer heels clicking against the linoleum. "Really, Evelyn? More conspiracy theories?" Her saccharine smile didn't reach her cold blue eyes.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the papers. "Stay out of this, Victoria."

Liam finally moved, placing himself between the two women. "That's enough."

The heart monitor attached to Donovan Blackwood's unconscious form beeped steadily in the background, a grim reminder of why they were all there.

Ryan Sullivan burst through the door, his uniform damp from the storm. "Sir, we've got a situation at Wright Manor."

Evelyn's breath caught. Her ancestral home held more secrets than anyone realized.

Liam's phone buzzed with an encrypted message. His expression darkened as he read it. "It's Julian. He's made his move."

The pieces suddenly clicked into place for Evelyn. Her uncle's sudden interest in her recovery, the mysterious break-ins at her studio, the coded messages she'd found in her old sketchbooks.

"I have to go back," Evelyn said with sudden certainty.

Victoria scoffed. "To that crumbling estate? Don't be ridiculous."

Liam's gaze locked with Evelyn's. In that moment, an unspoken understanding passed between them. He nodded once. "We'll leave in twenty minutes."

As Ryan hurried out to prepare the vehicles, Evelyn glanced at the unconscious Donovan. Her fingers brushed against the silver locket around her neck - the one containing the only photo of her real parents.

The storm outside intensified, rattling the windows. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rolled like approaching footsteps.

Evelyn didn't know what awaited them at Wright Manor. But one thing was certain - the answers to her past, and the key to Donovan's poisoning, lay hidden within those walls.

And Julian Whitmore would stop at nothing to get there first.

Ryan arrived outside Evelyn's apartment building precisely at 5:00 pm. His eyebrows lifted in surprise when she emerged.

She wasn't wearing the designer gown Liam had selected for her. Instead, a simple sky-blue sundress hugged her frame. The only adornment was a matching ribbon pulling her chestnut hair into a casual ponytail.

The minimal makeup accentuating Evelyn's features, combined with the understated elegance of her outfit, gave her an ethereal, girl-next-door charm.

"Mrs. Blackwood, you..." Ryan's voice trailed off as he caught himself. Something in her guarded expression warned against commenting on her appearance.

Evelyn offered a tight-lipped smile before sliding into silence, her mood visibly subdued.

Noticing her empty hands, Ryan chose his words carefully. "Did you forget anything inside?"

"No," came her clipped reply.

With a quiet nod, Ryan held open the car door. The drive to Blackwood Manor passed in weighted silence.

Dozens of security personnel lined the estate's perimeter. A parade of luxury vehicles streamed through wrought-iron gates, each depositing glittering guests at the grand entrance.

The head butler greeted arrivals while Blackwood family members circulated inside. By the time they arrived, twilight had surrendered to velvet darkness.

Blackwood Manor blazed with light, the hum of conversation and laughter spilling from every window.

The guest list comprised Aldenria's elite - politicians, business magnates, and society royalty. None noticed Evelyn's arrival, nor cared to acknowledge her presence.

The ballroom pulsed with energy. Crystal glasses clinked in endless toasts to Margaret. A pianist's melody floated above the din.

Evelyn claimed an isolated corner table, nursing a water with lemon. She'd deliver her obligatory birthday wishes, then escape this gilded cage.

"Well, well. The charity case actually showed up."

The venomous voice made Evelyn's shoulders tense. She turned to face Victoria Dawson, resplendent in couture and diamonds that made Evelyn's simple dress look like a hand-me-down.

Evelyn returned her attention to the pianist, letting the music drown out Victoria's presence.

"Did you raid a homeless shelter for that tragic outfit? Even the catering staff dresses better."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass. "Some people's ugliness shines through, no matter how much they spend covering it up."

Victoria's flawless complexion mottled with rage. "You little-"

"Victoria, darling!" Eleanor Blackwood's cultured voice interrupted as she glided over. Instantly, Victoria's expression sweetened. "Eleanor! Just catching up with Evelyn."

Eleanor's polite mask faltered momentarily when she noticed Evelyn's attire, but quickly recovered. Evelyn stood immediately. "Good evening, Eleanor."

"Evelyn." Eleanor's nod held restrained warmth. Though she disapproved of how Evelyn had trapped Liam into marriage, she maintained impeccable manners. "Do help yourself to the buffet. Margaret will make her entrance shortly."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured.

Eleanor's demeanor transformed as she turned to Victoria. "Cassandra and Penelope are looking for you, dear. They've found something you simply must see."
###Chapter 40

A radiant smile lit up Victoria's face. Her enthusiasm seemed exaggerated, almost performative in its intensity.

"Really? Cassandra and Penelope have something incredible to show me? I'm absolutely thrilled!"

She gave Evelyn a polite nod before adding, "Eleanor and I will excuse ourselves now. We'll catch up with you later."

Victoria and Eleanor walked away arm in arm, their laughter trailing behind them.

Evelyn felt an emptiness settle in her chest. The festive atmosphere around her only magnified her isolation as she mechanically sipped her lemon water.

She sat motionless amidst the lively banquet, an outsider observing the celebrations from a distance. The contrast between her stillness and the animated crowd made her presence seem almost intrusive.

Ten minutes later, Victoria returned with Cassandra Blake and Penelope Hart in tow.

"Look Evelyn! Cassandra gifted me this exquisite emerald bracelet!" Victoria's sugary tone couldn't disguise her malicious intent.

Evelyn saw through the charade immediately. This was clearly a setup to humiliate her in front of Liam's sisters.

Choosing diplomacy, Evelyn greeted the women politely instead of acknowledging the bracelet.

Cassandra's critical gaze swept over Evelyn's attire. "You call yourself Liam's wife? That dress is downright embarrassing."

Penelope joined in with a mocking laugh. "With your background, Evelyn, why even bother showing up? You're making a spectacle of yourself."

Victoria feigned kindness. "Now ladies, don't be harsh. I think Evelyn looks lovely tonight."

Cassandra patted Victoria's arm. "Your generosity is wasted on someone like her. Unlike you, I have no patience for social climbers."

Evelyn remained composed, offering a small smile. "If you truly value your blue blood status, perhaps you should consider how causing a scene at your grandmother's birthday reflects on you."

The barb hit its mark. Cassandra and Penelope exchanged uneasy glances.

Victoria quickly changed tactics. "Evelyn, what gift did you bring for Grandmother? I don't see anything with you."

The question struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's eyes flashed with barely contained anger.

Penelope seized the opportunity. "No need to glare, Evelyn. It's not our fault if you came empty-handed. Not that Grandmother would appreciate anything from you anyway."

"Let's go. Her presence is ruining my appetite," Cassandra declared, sweeping away with Penelope following.

Victoria stepped closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Leave now if you know what's good for you. Unless you want a public humiliation you'll never forget."

With that final threat, Victoria strutted away, already victorious in her own mind.

Evelyn's hands clenched into trembling fists. Avoiding direct confrontation was one thing, but Victoria's scheming nature made her unpredictable.

The smart move would be to leave before things escalated further.

As Evelyn reached the grand entrance, she froze. Liam stood just inside the doorway, having arrived late to the celebration.

Their eyes locked across the distance. The surrounding noise faded into silence as tension crackled between them.
###Chapter 41

Liam stood tall in his tailored black tuxedo. The impeccable cut accentuated his broad shoulders and lean frame.

The dark fabric made his piercing blue eyes appear even more striking. Evelyn found herself unable to look away.

Her pulse quickened whenever he was near. Even after all this time, his presence still left her breathless.

Right now, her palms were sweating. Words failed her completely.

Liam's gaze swept over Evelyn's simple attire. A shadow of displeasure crossed his handsome features.

He had respected her choice not to wear the designer gown he'd selected. But the disappointment still lingered.

"Have you greeted Grandmother yet?" His deep voice was carefully neutral.

Evelyn shook her head mutely. If she spoke, the tremor in her voice would betray her emotions.

Liam had always been her anchor. She longed to lean on him now, to pour out her troubles.

But she'd forfeited that right.

His expression darkened. "Were you planning to leave without seeing her?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes. The silent admission hung between them.

Liam exhaled sharply. Without another word, he closed the distance between them and grasped her wrist.

The unexpected contact made her gasp. Her wide eyes searched his face questioningly.

"You may leave after the reception." His tone brooked no argument as he guided her toward the glittering crowd.

Though they weren't holding hands, the proximity sent her heart racing. An unfamiliar warmth spread through her.

With Liam beside her, the sea of strangers felt less intimidating. His presence was a shield against her social anxiety.

He introduced her to various guests with effortless grace. Each time someone inquired about her identity, his response never varied.

"This is my wife, Evelyn Carter."

The simple declaration made her chest tighten. No matter how temporary their arrangement, hearing those words still affected her.

Because tonight, after this charade ended, their marriage would be dissolved.

So why was he still claiming her as his wife?

Around them, whispers spread like wildfire. The elite of Aldenria were clearly shocked by Liam Blackwood's marital status.

When pressed for details about Evelyn's background, Liam smoothly deflected the questions.

Just then, Margaret made her grand entrance, supported by two attendants. They seated her in the ornate chair at the head table.

The elderly woman radiated quiet dignity, her face alight with childlike delight at the celebration in her honor.

Though her memory failed her these days, she remembered this was her birthday. That these were loved ones gathered to honor her.

The Blackwood family descended upon her immediately with well-wishes and lavish gifts, presenting them in order of seniority.

Margaret's delighted laughter rang out frequently.

When Liam's turn came, he offered an exquisite velvet box with quiet words of affection. Then he added, "Evelyn and I chose this together."

The inclusion spared Evelyn the embarrassment of arriving empty-handed.

Margaret beamed as she accepted the gift, running her fingers over it lovingly before gazing at the couple.

"My dear grandson and his lovely bride! You've made an old woman very happy."

More murmurs erupted through the crowd. The mystery of Liam Blackwood's marriage was clearly the evening's hottest topic.

Cassandra chose that moment to interject with a saccharine smile. "The rest of us brought separate gifts. How...convenient that Evelyn's is combined with yours."

Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation.

Liam's eyes turned glacial as they locked onto his sister. "My schedule hasn't permitted personal shopping. I insisted on adding my name to Evelyn's thoughtful gift. Do you have an issue with that, Cassandra?"

Cassandra blanched, immediately backpedaling with a strained smile. "No, of course not! I didn't mean anything by it."
###Chapter 42

Evelyn felt a warm flutter in her chest as she turned to gaze up at Liam. Though he stood just six feet tall, the commanding aura surrounding him made him appear invincible - a pillar of strength she could always lean on.

Victoria approached Margaret with a carefully rolled parchment tube in hand. Her lips curved into a practiced smile. "Grandmother, I'm Victoria Dawson. Do you still recognize me?"

Margaret's welcoming expression hardened as her eyes narrowed. That wretched girl's face was permanently etched in her memory - the scheming homewrecker who'd tried to steal Liam years ago.

"Not particularly," Margaret replied with deliberate indifference.

Victoria remained unfazed. The old woman's Alzheimer's made this reaction perfectly understandable.

Her true objective wasn't Margaret's approval anyway. Tonight's birthday gala presented the perfect stage to showcase her brilliance before Liam and the entire Blackwood family.

Victoria intended to dazzle every guest with both her beauty and extravagant gift for Margaret.

"Bring it forward!" she commanded.

Servants swiftly arranged several tables into one long display surface at her instruction. The gathered aristocrats exchanged puzzled glances.

With theatrical flair, Victoria removed the tube's cap and extracted a thick scroll. She gestured for Cassandra to help unroll the massive artwork across the six-foot-five-inch surface.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as an exquisite ink wash painting was revealed in all its glory.

Victoria guided Margaret to her feet. "Grandmother, I know how deeply you cherish Solterra's traditional culture - your passion for classical artifacts and especially ink paintings."

"I went to extraordinary lengths to acquire this at auction. 'Ode to Autumn' is an authentic masterpiece by the renowned contemporary artist Isabella Grayson. May it bring you health and longevity."

The elite guests, all connoisseurs of fine art, immediately recognized the significance. They clustered around the painting, murmuring appreciatively.

Just as Victoria predicted, Margaret's interest was piqued. A genuine smile returned as she studied the sprawling artwork.

Isabella Grayson's skill was undeniable. Using only black ink, she'd captured autumn's essence with breathtaking vitality - the setting sun casting golden light over distant maple forests, a lone ferryman poling his boat across ink-wash waters.

The scene felt so alive, viewers could almost step into its tranquil beauty.

An elderly art collector exclaimed, "Good heavens! This is undoubtedly an original Grayson! Her works now fetch upwards of fifty million! Every piece is museum-worthy!"

"Who is this Isabella Grayson?" someone asked curiously.

Eager to showcase her knowledge, Victoria launched into an explanation. "Isabella Grayson is Solterra's most celebrated young artist. Her technique is utterly unique - she streams her creative process online."

"Each completed work is auctioned digitally, with all proceeds donated to charity. Though she never shows her face - only her hands and brush - she's become a legendary figure."

"Grayson seeks neither fame nor fortune. Her entire earnings go to philanthropic causes, earning praise from organizations worldwide. People collect her art not just for its beauty, but to contribute to her noble mission."

Evelyn, an art enthusiast herself, studied the painting intently before returning to Liam's side.

Margaret approached and whispered, "My dear, what do you think of the painting?"

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully. "The technique is masterful, but..."

She hesitated to continue.

"Speak freely," Margaret encouraged.

Leaning close, Evelyn murmured, "Grandmother, I don't believe this is authentic. It's an exceptional forgery, but a forgery nonetheless."

Margaret's eyes widened dramatically. "What?" she exclaimed loudly for effect. "It's a fake?"
###Chapter 43

Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment as Margaret's sudden outburst drew all eyes toward them.

Victoria had intended to publicly humiliate Evelyn. She gestured dramatically at the painting. "Even if this is a fake, I appreciate the thought. But please don't go around telling people it's genuine."

A stunned silence fell over the banquet hall.

Victoria's face drained of color before flushing crimson with rage.

"What would you know about art?" she spat at Evelyn. "Have you ever studied ink wash techniques? Have you even seen an original Isabella Grayson? Who gave you the right to call my painting fake?"

Evelyn felt trapped. If proven wrong, she'd become the laughingstock of the entire gathering.

But Margaret saw things differently.

Only true art connoisseurs could distinguish masterpieces from forgeries. With the accusation made, doubt had been planted in everyone's minds.

Even if Victoria produced receipts or certificates, they'd assume she'd been duped.

An avid art collector among the guests adjusted his spectacles and began examining the painting intently.

Meanwhile, Victoria rushed to Liam's side, clutching his arm dramatically. "Liam, you have to defend me! Evelyn has no right to call my gift fake! She knows nothing about art! This is deliberate humiliation!"

Liam remained impassive, even shaking off Victoria's grip with visible irritation. "I don't know anything about paintings. But since it's your gift for Grandmother, I'm sure she'll appreciate the gesture regardless."

Victoria stomped her foot in frustration, sensing Liam's changed attitude toward her. "This is different! Evelyn's trying to embarrass me on purpose!"

Cassandra came to Victoria's defense. "Evelyn's gone too far this time. She knows nothing about art yet presumes to judge it."

Penelope chimed in. "Exactly! If you're so knowledgeable, Evelyn, why don't you show us a real Isabella Grayson?"

Just as the murmurs against Evelyn grew, the examining guest slammed his palm on the table.

"This is indeed a forgery!" he declared.

Victoria froze in panic.

The collector removed his glasses. "The essence of 'Ode to Autumn' captures a perfect fall day with southern winds sweeping the landscape."

"The ferryman sails northward toward sunset. But here—" he pointed, "the wind blows from the south while the ferryman's coat flaps northward. Isabella would never make such an elementary mistake."

Victoria's defenders turned scarlet with embarrassment while others began whispering and laughing.

Margaret had only meant to embarrass Victoria. Discovering the painting was actually fake delighted her beyond measure.

"My granddaughter-in-law has an impeccable eye for art!" Margaret boasted.

Another elderly guest inquired, "Your granddaughter-in-law is an art appraiser?"

Margaret preened. "Of course! She was the one who identified the forgery!"

"How remarkable!"

Margaret couldn't resist showing off. "Evelyn's also an accomplished painter herself—masterful with both watercolors and oils. You should see her breathtaking work—"

Evelyn squeezed Margaret's hand urgently. "Grandmother, please—I'm just an amateur. Don't exaggerate my skills."

Overstating abilities would only lead to humiliation.

Furious at being exposed, Victoria noticed Evelyn's panicked expression and saw an opportunity for revenge.

"If you're such an expert," Victoria said sweetly, "why not demonstrate your skills for everyone? Consider it your gift to Grandmother."

"Brilliant idea!" someone shouted. "We'd love to see Mrs. Blackwood's talent!"

Margaret beamed. "I'll have the butler prepare paints and paper immediately."

Watercolors and oils were forgiving mediums where vibrant colors could mask amateur work. Abstract patterns could pass as intentional art.

Victoria quickly intervened. "Grandmother, I have proper ink and rice paper. Perhaps Evelyn could create an ink wash painting."

Evelyn shook her head frantically at Margaret, her face a mask of terror.

Margaret mistook this for mere nervousness. "Nonsense! You'll do wonderfully!"

Desperate, Evelyn turned pleading eyes to Liam, looking utterly pitiful.

His expression softened. "You truly don't know how to paint?"

"No," Evelyn whispered.

"Just paint as you do for Grandmother."

Evelyn lowered her head. "Those are just... doodles. I can't possibly—at best, they might impress a child."

Liam leaned closer to hear her trembling voice.

Their whispered exchange, heads bent together, appeared strangely intimate—like newlyweds oblivious to their surroundings.

"Do you want me to stop this?" Liam murmured.

"Please," Evelyn begged.

"You're certain?"

"Absolutely."

Liam straightened. "We won't be needing those materials after all."

"Don't you dare interfere!" Margaret snapped, dragging Evelyn forward. "Set everything up! My granddaughter-in-law will showcase her talent!"
###Chapter 44

Evelyn could only gaze at Liam with helpless confusion. Her stunning eyes shimmered with uncertainty and unease.

Liam felt his heart liquefy under her vulnerable expression. He never imagined Evelyn's lost look could affect him so profoundly.

He stepped closer, his lips brushing her ear as he whispered.

"Evelyn, everyone here is family or close friends. Truthfully, no one cares about painting authenticity or technical skill."

"This is just a performance for Grandmother's enjoyment. What matters is showing your affection for her. Paint whatever feels right - the rest is unimportant."

His reassurance settled Evelyn's nerves.

"Do you know how to replicate paintings?" he asked gently.

"I suppose," she answered hesitantly. "Copying styles comes easily to me."

"Then recreate one of Isabella's works," Liam suggested. "The displayed piece is a reproduction anyway."

Resigned, Evelyn selected a brush and dipped it in ink.

Her free hand glided across the paper in three deliberate strokes, fingertips caressing the surface with practiced care.

"Look!" someone exclaimed. "She's mimicking Isabella's preparatory ritual exactly!"

The crowd divided - some watched with rapt attention, others with barely concealed schadenfreude. A few guests remained engrossed in their conversations as piano music wove through the hall.

After studying "Ode to Autumn" intently, Evelyn made her first decisive stroke.

Artistically-inclined guests gasped. Her technique revealed extraordinary mastery - each movement precise, each stroke intentional.

Once begun, Evelyn never lifted her gaze again. Her hands moved with muscle memory, requiring no conscious thought for pressure or stroke width.

As she accelerated, the audience's astonishment grew. Some rubbed their eyes, disbelieving the emerging masterpiece.

Several guests pulled out phones, comparing Evelyn to streaming videos of Isabella Grayson at work.

Evelyn remained oblivious in her creative trance, unaware of the growing murmurs.

Liam observed silently, captivated by her focused beauty. In this moment, she radiated the irresistible magnetism of true talent.

"Holy hell!" someone shouted. "She is Isabella Grayson!"

"The mannerisms! The technique! Only Isabella could replicate this perfectly!"

"Check the video - both have that distinctive mole on their right hand!"

"Three years since her disappearance... They said she might be dead. No wonder her paintings skyrocketed in value."

"To think Isabella would be this young and breathtaking..."

Meanwhile, Victoria and the Blackwoods stood speechless, frantically comparing videos to Evelyn's performance.

The more they scrutinized, the more undeniable the truth became.

Evelyn painted until completion, automatically adding Isabella's characteristic poetic inscription and signature.

As she set down the brush and finally looked up, the sea of stunned faces sent panic coursing through her.

She turned to Liam desperately.

His furrowed brow and shocked expression twisted her stomach. Had she embarrassed him with poor work?

Before she could process the thought, several art enthusiasts rushed forward, eagerly introducing themselves with awestruck admiration.
###Chapter 45

"Oh my God! I can't believe I'm meeting you in person, Isabella Grayson! Your artwork changed my life!"

The elegant woman clutched her pearls as tears welled in her eyes. "All these years watching your painting tutorials... Those delicate hands could only belong to a woman."

"But the power in your brushstrokes!" A gentleman in a tailored suit interjected. "The raw masculine energy in your landscapes - I would've sworn you were a man!"

"Your ink wash technique is transcendental," another admirer gushed. "Every piece tells a thousand stories. I've spent hours decoding the hidden symbolism."

Evelyn Carter stood frozen, the champagne flute trembling in her hand. The crowd's adoration washed over her like a tidal wave, leaving her gasping for air.

Beside her, Margaret Thorn dabbed at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. She'd always sensed Evelyn's extraordinary talent, but never imagined her granddaughter-in-law was the reclusive artist whose works sold for millions.

Across the room, Victoria Dawson's manicured nails dug into her palms. Her plan to humiliate Evelyn had spectacularly backfired. Instead of exposing a fraud, she'd unveiled a genius.

The Blackwood family stood in stunned silence. Richard Blackwood adjusted his glasses repeatedly, as if the scene before him might change with each blink.

Just then, Ryan Sullivan approached Liam Blackwood with a phone. The military commander's expression remained unreadable as he studied the video playing on screen.

The footage showed slender fingers dancing across rice paper - three habitual strokes before the brush touched down. A distinctive mole adorned the right hand's knuckle.

"Sir," Ryan murmured. "There's no doubt. Mrs. Blackwood is Isabella Grayson."

Liam returned the phone with a terse nod. "Trace the account. Find out which galleries handled her auctions. And investigate every charity that received donations."

As Ryan departed, Evelyn finally processed the revelation. The hands in the video were unmistakably hers. The painting mannerisms - the way she tilted her wrist - mirrored her own movements exactly.

She turned to Margaret, finding joyful tears sparkling in the older woman's eyes. When she looked to Liam, his granite expression gave nothing away.

Nearby, whispers slithered through the crowd like snakes.

"An artist?" Penelope Hart scoffed. "With those prices? She must be laundering money."

Cassandra Blake sniffed. "Probably some marketing gimmick. No real talent could come from... her background."

Eleanor Blackwood clutched her husband's arm. "Richard, this can't be right. That... girl can't possibly be-"

"Look at the bids coming in for that piece she just painted," Richard interrupted. "Half a million already."

Eleanor's mouth worked soundlessly before she managed, "And she refused to sell? The foolish-"

"Precisely," Richard chuckled darkly. "If she's not Isabella Grayson, that refusal proves she's a con artist."

The rest of the evening passed in a haze. When the gala ended, Liam's driver escorted Evelyn back to her apartment.

During the ride, she pressed her forehead against the cool window, desperately searching her fractured memories. The idea that she might be this celebrated artist seemed impossible.

Isabella Grayson was generous, brilliant, revered. Evelyn couldn't reconcile that with the broken woman she'd become.

Something wasn't adding up. The pieces didn't fit. And the more she tried to force them together, the more certain she became - there had to be some terrible mistake.
###Chapter 46

Ryan Sullivan stood in Liam Blackwood's office, presenting his findings from the investigation.

"Mr. Blackwood, the account used by Isabella Grayson was registered under a public orphanage in Solterra."

"All donations and subscription revenue from her streams are deposited directly into this orphanage's bank account. However, the director confirmed she's never met Isabella in person."

"The art sales channel is equally unusual. She auctions paintings exclusively online."

"Every payment account traces back to different orphanages and charities across the country. Not a single penny has been touched by her."

"Isabella operates completely alone - no company, no team. During streams, she never speaks. Just paints."

"Her account went dark three years ago. Vanished without a trace."

Liam leaned back, eyes closed, fingers steepled. Ryan's report made him think of Evelyn Carter.

Who would have guessed such an ordinary florist hid such mysteries?

"Prepare the car," Liam finally said, his deep voice resonating.

"Where to, sir?" Ryan inquired.

A pause. Then, with unexpected softness: "I'm paying Evelyn a visit."

Twilight had faded from Varia Avenue when the black sedan pulled up. Streetlights cast golden pools on the pavement as pedestrian traffic swelled.

Evelyn had transformed her usual flower stall into something enchanting. Fairy lights twined through fresh greenery, creating a magical glow around her blooms.

The occasional customer paused to admire her arrangements.

"Long time no see, sis."

Evelyn's hands froze mid-arrangement at the familiar voice. Slowly, she set down the peonies and reached for her pruning shears instead.

Dominic Carter took an instinctive step back when he saw the glint of steel, though his smirk remained cocky. "Still holding a grudge? You already broke my leg last time. I still limp, you know."

Evelyn's expression didn't soften. "What do you want?"

"Mom's sick. She needs—"

"Already called me," Evelyn cut him off sharply. "I know it's another scam. I'll help her because she's my mother. But you? Not a cent."

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Come on, we're family!"

He forced a laugh. "I messed up bad this time, Evie. Your little shop seems to be doing well. Just help me out once more?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly, gripping the shears tighter as she stepped forward. Dominic retreated hastily.

"Being siblings doesn't mean I'm your personal ATM," she said coldly. "If you want forgiveness, turn yourself in for what you did to me. That's the only way."

Dominic scoffed. "You think I'm stupid enough to go to jail?"

Evelyn mirrored his cold laugh. "And you think I'm stupid enough to help my abuser?"

When words failed, Dominic switched tactics. "Fine. No money? Then no business!" He spread his arms dramatically. "I'll stand here all night scaring customers away. Let's see who dares buy from you!"

Evelyn wondered if madness ran in the Carter blood. Her mother's constant fake illnesses. Her father's drunken tirades. And Dominic - the worst of them all.

After trying to sell her to traffickers, he still had the gall to demand money.

Done arguing, Evelyn pulled out her phone.

Dominic chuckled. "Calling the cops? They won't bother with this."

Evelyn ignored him, dialing calmly. "Mr. Reeves? Dominic Carter owes you money, correct? He's at Varia Avenue now. I'll text you the location."
###Chapter 47

Dominic's face drained of color, his fear palpable. He clenched his jaw, glaring at Evelyn with barely contained rage before shrinking back instinctively.

"You think you're so clever, Evelyn! Just wait—I'll make you pay for this!" he spat out before turning on his heel and scurrying away like a frightened rat.

Evelyn tucked her phone away with a dismissive scoff. His empty threats meant nothing to her.

A short distance from the flower stall, a tall, commanding figure stood out effortlessly among the crowd. His presence alone demanded attention—sharp features, an aura of authority, and an effortless magnetism that made him impossible to ignore.

Ryan, standing beside him, murmured under his breath, "Mr. Blackwood, it appears Mrs. Blackwood has her own way of handling things."

Liam didn’t respond. Instead, he strode toward the stall with purposeful steps, Ryan following closely behind.

Evelyn had just settled back onto her stool, scissors in hand, ready to trim the next batch of roses when a pair of polished dress shoes came into view.

Assuming it was another customer, she rose with a practiced smile. "Hello, how can I—"

Her words died in her throat as her gaze traveled up to meet Liam’s piercing eyes. Her pulse spiked, erratic and uncontrollable.

What was he doing here on Varia Avenue?

Her eyes darted around, searching for any sign of military vehicles—was he here on official business?

Liam found her startled expression oddly endearing. His voice remained cool as he asked, "What’s the most beautiful flower you have?"

Evelyn blinked, snapping back to reality. She set the roses down, forcing professionalism into her tone. "Are these for a special woman? Or perhaps an elder?"

Liam didn’t hesitate. "For a woman."

A sharp pang of jealousy twisted inside her. She hadn’t realized her smile had faltered until it was too late.

There were countless florists in the city. Why come all the way here—unless it was deliberate?

She grabbed a bouquet of white zinnias and thrust them toward him. "These would suit your needs."

Liam accepted them without comment.

Even as his wife, Evelyn had no intention of giving him special treatment. "That’ll be twenty dollars," she stated flatly.

He handed her the exact amount without hesitation.

"Thank you," she said stiffly, nodding.

The distance between them felt wider than that of strangers.

Liam didn’t move after the transaction. Evelyn frowned. "Was there something else?"

His gaze swept over the crowded street, noting the curious onlookers. "We need to talk."

"Here?" she asked.

"Pack up. Close the stall."

His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn hesitated. "But I haven’t sold all the flowers yet. They won’t stay fresh overnight."

Liam slid his hands into his pockets, adopting a more relaxed stance. "I’ll buy them all."

The sheer absurdity of his words nearly made her laugh. She bit back a smirk, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

"Are you trying to imitate those overbearing CEOs from romance dramas?" she teased, her voice laced with playful sarcasm.

Liam’s expression darkened instantly, his intimidating aura enough to make anyone else cower.

Realizing she’d pushed too far, Evelyn quickly schooled her features into neutrality.

"I only sell flowers to people who actually need them," she said firmly. "There’s no reason for you to waste money just to have a conversation."

Liam turned to Ryan. "Stay here and sell the rest for her."

"Yes, sir," Ryan replied dutifully.

Evelyn stared, stunned.

Liam fixed her with a serious look. "Will you come with me now?"

The gravity in his voice made her uneasy. Whatever he wanted to discuss must be important.

Liam was always unreadable, his stoic expression enough to unsettle anyone.

"Fine," she relented.

After gathering her things and giving Ryan a quick rundown of prices, she followed Liam.

With Margaret’s birthday celebration over, it was time to address the elephant in the room—their loveless marriage.

Liam wouldn’t seek her out personally unless it was about one thing: their divorce.
###Chapter 48

The car ride was silent except for the hum of the engine. Liam broke the quiet first. "Would you prefer to go back to Blackwood Manor or your current apartment?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her purse. Her apartment was closer to the flower market where she worked. Besides, Blackwood Manor felt like Victoria's domain now - not hers.

"My place," she answered softly.

Fifteen minutes later, Liam parked outside a weathered brick building that had seen better decades. Evelyn stepped out, leading him through the dimly lit entrance.

Night had fallen completely. The hallway stretched before them like a dark tunnel, narrow enough that their shoulders nearly brushed the walls. Evelyn fumbled for her phone, the flashlight beam cutting through the gloom.

"The building management isn't... diligent about maintenance," she explained, embarrassment coloring her words.

Liam's sharp gaze took in the peeling wallpaper and flickering exit sign. The place was a dump.

At her door, Evelyn turned the key with practiced ease. Light flooded the small space as she flipped the switch, then hovered uncertainly in the doorway.

Liam crossed the threshold in three strides. The studio apartment couldn't have been more than 300 square feet, yet it held a certain charm. Neat. Lived-in. Surprisingly homey.

When Evelyn turned from closing the door, she found Liam holding out the bouquet of white zinnias.

"For you." His tone gave nothing away.

Evelyn's breath caught. She'd assumed the flowers were for Victoria. The unexpected gesture left her momentarily speechless, her pulse suddenly racing.

Liam's brow furrowed. "You don't like them?"

"No! I mean yes!" She accepted the bouquet hastily, cheeks burning. "They're perfect. Thank you."

She couldn't remember ever having a favorite flower before. Now she did.

Setting her bag down, Evelyn rushed to the kitchenette, digging through cabinets until she found a simple glass vase. The flowers looked almost too elegant for her modest home as she arranged them on the nightstand.

Meanwhile, Liam settled on her threadbare couch, his attention caught by the books scattered across the coffee table. He picked one up, flipping through pages filled with unfamiliar characters.

"Xyperian?" he asked when Evelyn returned with a glass of water.

She nodded. "I found it at the library. The title intrigued me. Strangely, I could read it."

Liam's eyes narrowed slightly. "You speak Xyperian?"

"I didn't think so, but..." Her shrug ended abruptly as her knee connected with the coffee table. Pain shot up her leg as she pitched forward.

Time seemed to slow. The water glass slipped from her fingers. Then suddenly she was sprawled across Liam's lap, the spilled liquid soaking through his trousers in a rapidly spreading stain.

Heat flooded Evelyn's face as she scrambled upright, nearly tripping in her haste. "Oh god! I'm so sorry!"

She grabbed tissues from the box, dabbing frantically at the wet fabric. "I didn't mean to— I wasn't looking where—"

"Evelyn." Liam's voice cut through her panic.

But the mortification had short-circuited her brain. She kept blotting, her movements growing more erratic.

Strong fingers closed around her wrists, stilling her. "I said enough."

His tone brooked no argument. Frozen in place, Evelyn finally looked up to meet his gaze. The intensity there stole her breath.
###Chapter 49

Evelyn's breath hitched as she locked eyes with the imposing figure before her. Electricity crackled in the charged silence between them.

Liam remained perfectly composed. Only the slightest flicker of heat betrayed his carefully controlled expression.

In contrast, Evelyn fidgeted like a nervous schoolgirl. A sudden realization struck her.

Wasn't this exactly how those scheming women in soap operas tried to seduce powerful men?

Liam's calm demeanor unnerved her.

Did he think she'd orchestrated this entire situation to seduce him?

Was that why his eyes held that barely concealed impatience?

Evelyn swallowed hard. She scrambled to her feet, putting distance between them. Bowing her head like a chastened child, she whispered, "I'm truly sorry."

Liam exhaled sharply and stood.

"I need to borrow your hair dryer."

"Of course." Evelyn gestured toward the bathroom, her cheeks flaming. "It's in the vanity drawer."

Liam strode past her without another word.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut, his ironclad composure shattered. He braced himself against the sink, eyes squeezed shut as he took several shuddering breaths. His Adam's apple bobbed violently.

Damn it all!

Since when had his self-control become so pathetic?

The whir of the hair dryer filled the small space for what felt like an eternity.

When Liam finally emerged, Evelyn stood frozen by the coffee table. A fresh glass of water sat beside the original, and someone had draped a protective cover over the adjacent sofa.

Liam resumed his seat and gestured to the wooden chair. "Sit."

"Yes, sir." Evelyn obediently dragged the chair opposite him, perching on the edge like a job applicant facing a stern interviewer.

Liam's commanding presence filled the modest apartment. He carried himself with such natural authority that he might as well have owned the place.

Unable to meet his piercing gaze, Evelyn blurted, "I'm ready whenever you are."

Liam's brow furrowed. "Ready for what?"

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "The paperwork. Aren't we discussing the divorce?"

"No." His response came sharp and final, leaving no room for argument. "Forget about divorce. We need to clarify your situation first."

"My situation?"

"Your identity."

Evelyn threw up her hands. "I'm Evelyn Carter. That's all there is to it."

"Then explain Isabella Grayson."

"How should I know? I don't remember!"

Jumping up, Evelyn retrieved a folder from her nightstand and thrust it at Liam. "Here's my DNA report."

Liam scanned the documents from Goodwill Hospital comparing Evelyn's DNA with her supposed relatives.

Evelyn explained, "I had no memories when I woke up in that hospital. The doctors said multiple plastic surgeries altered my appearance."

"They found my family through ID records, but couldn't confirm my identity visually. Hence the DNA test."

Liam's frown deepened as he examined the report. "Was this conducted under police supervision?"

"Absolutely," Evelyn insisted. "No one tampered with the samples. The officers took my blood directly to the lab, and I collected the results myself. It's legitimate."

Liam's gaze turned probing. "With your artistic talent, you could've earned a fortune. Why sell yourself to marry some old man for money?"
###Chapter 50

Evelyn felt a chill run down her spine at Liam's words. "What if I wasn't Isabella Grayson?" she challenged. "What if I was just an amateur who enjoyed learning from masters?"

Liam placed the DNA report aside, his lips curling into a teasing smirk. "Then you have an impressive collection of hobbies."

His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "You can replicate masterpieces. You claim to hate reading yet remember every word. Your scientific knowledge rivals experts. Foreign literature poses no challenge to you."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "So you still think I'm an Obsidian Circle spy?"

Silence stretched between them. Liam had always been meticulous in his assessments.

Everything about Evelyn contradicted her background. Her graceful movements spoke of rigorous training, her composure under pressure was unnatural. These weren't traits one developed casually.

After a moment's consideration, Evelyn proposed, "Why not wire me and send me to their headquarters? That would prove my innocence."

Liam's expression darkened at her naivety. He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Do you understand what Obsidian Circle does to failed operatives? If you were one of them returning empty-handed, they'd execute you. If you're not..." He let the implication hang.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Then arrest me. Better to eliminate a potential threat than risk national security."

A muscle twitched in Liam's jaw. "Must you always assume the worst?" His unusually gentle tone caught her off guard.

Before she could respond, a brilliant flash illuminated the room. Thunder cracked with deafening force.

Evelyn screamed, collapsing to her knees. Her hands flew to her ears as violent tremors wracked her body. Cold sweat drenched her clothes within seconds.

Liam reacted instantly, crouching before her and covering her hands with his own. "You're afraid of thunder?" His voice barely registered over her panic.

Another lightning strike plunged the room into darkness. The subsequent thunderclap shook the windows.

"Where are my headphones?" Evelyn gasped, scrambling toward the nightstand on unsteady legs.

As Liam moved to assist, another explosion of thunder sent her crashing into his chest. Instinct took over - she clung to him like a drowning woman to driftwood, her fingers digging into his shirt.

The storm raged outside, rain lashing against the now-closed windows. In the oppressive darkness, Evelyn's ragged breathing was the only sound between them. Liam's arms remained steady around her, an unexpected anchor in her terror.
###Chapter 51

Liam froze instantly. Evelyn was trembling violently, her body drenched in cold sweat.

Perhaps it was pity that made him do it, but Liam didn't resist when she clung to him. Without hesitation, he covered her delicate hands over her ears once more.

A moment later, he detected faint sobbing sounds. The soft whimpers came from the woman nestled against his chest - fragile and frightened, like an injured kitten abandoned in the wilderness.

Liam could tell Evelyn was genuinely terrified of the violent storm and deafening thunderclaps.

This was the first time a woman had ever embraced Liam like this. Evelyn's body felt incredibly soft against his, her subtle floral fragrance intoxicating his senses.

His body reacted instinctively to the intimate contact. Liam knew these thoughts were inappropriate, yet his traitorous body refused to obey. The surge of desire was overwhelming.

It was also the first time Liam had heard Evelyn cry. Her whimpers sounded eerily similar to Victoria's when she was a child.

A long-buried protective instinct, dormant for ten years, suddenly awakened within him.

When Victoria had returned earlier this year, her frequent crying fits and tantrums had only irritated Liam. He'd assumed his childhood affection had simply faded with time.

Yet now, with Evelyn in his arms, those forgotten feelings came rushing back.

The room remained pitch black. Outside, the storm showed no signs of abating.

The warm air between them grew thick with their synchronized rapid breathing and pounding heartbeats.

Gradually, Evelyn's trembling subsided. She rested her head against Liam's chest, listening to his steady heartbeat.

Then realization struck - she stiffened abruptly. She'd been clinging to his waist like a lifeline, even curling into his embrace.

Liam hadn't pushed her away, even helping cover her ears. Surely it was just gentlemanly courtesy.

Evelyn slowly withdrew her arms.

An unexpected emptiness filled Liam's chest when her warmth disappeared. Lowering his hands, he asked hoarsely, "Better now?"

Though she couldn't see his expression, his voice held no anger.

"I need my noise-canceling earbuds. The thunder will return."

"Why are you afraid of thunderstorms?"

Evelyn's voice quivered. "I... I keep having this nightmare where someone holds my head underwater during a storm, trying to drown me. It terrifies me."

Liam activated his phone's flashlight. They searched the bed area until he spotted high-end noise-canceling earbuds peeking from beneath a pillow.

Kneeling on the mattress, he carefully placed them in Evelyn's ears.

The moment the earbuds activated, Evelyn visibly relaxed. She quickly played loud music at maximum volume.

Curling up at the bed's edge, she wiped away residual tears.

Liam examined the light fixtures with his phone's light. "I'll check the circuit breaker," he said slowly.

With the earbuds blocking sound, Evelyn didn't respond.

As Liam moved toward the door, Evelyn suddenly lunged forward, grabbing his shirt. Her voice came out louder than intended, "Don't leave, Liam!"
###Chapter 52

Liam froze mid-step. The sudden tug on his shirt made him turn to face Evelyn in the darkness.

A brilliant lightning flash illuminated the room, revealing Evelyn's tear-streaked face. Her desperate expression tugged at his heartstrings.

That single glance melted Liam's resolve. He could feel his defenses crumbling.

Removing her earphones, Liam leaned close enough for his breath to caress her cheek. "I'm not leaving you. Just checking the circuit breaker."

Evelyn's cheeks burned at his proximity. His woodsy cologne wrapped around her like a warm embrace.

His deep, velvety voice sent shivers down her spine. Reluctantly, she loosened her grip on his shirt.

Seeing her distress, Liam gently stroked her hair. "Don't be scared. I'll return before you know it."

The tender gesture left Evelyn breathless. She remained frozen long after he left, fingertips brushing where his hand had been.

Her heart raced like a startled fawn. Then came the crushing realization - she was falling hopelessly for him.

But what future could they have? Liam had already chosen Victoria.

The door creaked open as Liam returned, phone pressed to his ear. "Distribute the flowers to staff with partners. Offer a day off for every bouquet sold."

"No, I'm staying put tonight." He ended the call with finality.

"The whole building's dark," he explained. "Lightning must've fried the main circuits. Crews will fix it by morning."

Evelyn had removed her earphones to listen. His words eased her anxiety, yet stirred deeper emotions.

"Did you ever consider..." she whispered, "that bullet could've killed me?"

Liam paused, surprised by her lingering doubt. He switched off her phone light and settled on the couch.

"They don't call me Eagle-Eye for nothing." His confident smirk appeared in the dark. "That hostage-taker made an ideal target. My aim never wavers."

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry at his arrogance.

"You knew about Victoria's schemes, didn't you?" The question hung between them.

A weighted silence. Then, simply: "Yes."

The confirmation crushed her. Of course Liam would excuse Victoria's transgressions. She alone held his heart.

Liam cleared his throat. "I regret hurting you that day."

"Just a scratch." Evelyn forced a smile. "Healed quickly."

The charged silence stretched until Liam checked his watch. "You should rest."

"And you?" Panic edged her voice.

"I'll stay till the storm passes." His tone brooked no argument. "Keep your music volume down."

"You'll sit there all night?"

"Don't worry about me." His voice softened. "Sleep."

After a hesitation, Evelyn ventured, "The bed's big enough... if you don't mind sharing?"
###Chapter 53

Liam fell silent.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She quickly stammered, "I swear I won't touch you in my sleep this time. I can even tie my hands if that makes you feel better."

Her fingers twisted in the sheets as Liam suddenly stood.

He moved toward the bed with purposeful strides.

Evelyn scrambled backward, curling into a tight ball on the opposite edge.

Without a word, Liam removed his shoes and settled onto the mattress.

She remained perched like a frightened bird at the foot of the bed.

The irony wasn't lost on her - she'd invited him here, yet now she trembled like a leaf.

Evelyn hated this contradiction within herself.

"Lie down," Liam's deep voice cut through the silence. "Let's talk."

How could mere words make her pulse race like this?

Her heart stuttered as she obeyed, barely daring to breathe. "About what?"

"Did you remove your earpieces?"

"Yes."

"Are you tired?"

"No. I usually stay up past eleven."

Liam's next question came measured and calm. "How did you meet my grandmother?"

The truth spilled easily from Evelyn's lips. "After waking with no memories, I was lost. When I saw an ad for caretakers at Silver Pines Retirement Home, it seemed like divine intervention."

"Margaret visited her friend there one afternoon. We connected instantly - she claimed it was fate. Soon after, I became her private caregiver."

The silence stretched before Liam spoke again. "You cared for her three years, yet we barely interacted. Why believe her when she said I wanted to marry you?"

Evelyn's throat tightened.

Self-awareness had never been her strong suit. So why had she trusted Margaret's words?

The painful truth? She'd fallen for Liam the moment their eyes met. Margaret's stories of his heroism only deepened her infatuation. When presented with this fantasy, reason had abandoned her.

She'd even foolishly believed her beauty could sway him.

Now she understood - their marriage was Margaret's doing. Her ignorance had destroyed Liam's chance with Victoria.

Guilt twisted in Evelyn's chest. "I'm sorry, Liam."

Despite her love for him, she wanted his happiness above all - even if it meant losing him.

"There's still time," she whispered, voice thick with unshed tears. "We can divorce tomorrow. I know Victoria has been waiting for you."

The dim lighting created an intimate confessional between them.

For the first time, Liam opened up. "I won't lie - I've always cared for Victoria. She was fourteen when she left. I was eighteen."

"That first love... it wrecked me when she disappeared. I never got to tell her how I felt."

Evelyn listened silently as Liam recounted his bittersweet history with Victoria. Hot tears soaked into her pillow as she bit her lip raw. She wouldn't let him hear her break.

How she envied Victoria - to be loved so deeply by such an extraordinary man, for so many years.

"Victoria returned two years ago," Liam continued. "But she'd changed - in appearance, in spirit. My feelings never progressed past that childhood affection. The woman she's become... she's a stranger to me now."

"I don't owe her anything. But I do owe you, Evelyn."

Her breath caught. She hastily wiped her cheeks. "Owe me what?"
###Chapter 54

Liam shifted his position, turning onto his side to face Evelyn directly. The dim lighting cast shadows across his sharp features.

His voice held a rich timbre that reminded Evelyn of late-night jazz radio hosts. Even the rhythm of his breathing seemed hypnotic.

"I married you against my will just to please Grandma," he confessed. "That was unfair and dishonorable."

Evelyn marveled at his self-awareness. Powerful men like Liam rarely acknowledged their mistakes, let alone apologized for them.

She mirrored his position, propping her head on one hand. "You must have women throwing themselves at you constantly," she murmured.

Liam's lips quirked. "No one's ever been brave enough to confess." His gaze intensified. "What about you? Any unrequited loves?"

"There is someone," Evelyn admitted, her pulse quickening. She longed to say it was him.

But fear sealed her lips. Liam's commanding presence intimidated most people - who would dare declare their feelings to such a man?

His eyebrows lifted slightly. "Does he return your affections?"

"No." Evelyn's voice grew quiet. "His heart belongs elsewhere. We could never be together."

"So that's why you agreed to marry me?" Liam deduced.

Evelyn gave a weak laugh. "What kind of reasoning is that?"

"Marriage isn't a game, Evelyn." Liam's tone softened. "Perhaps we should try making this work."

Her breath caught. Blood roared in her ears as her heart threatened to pound through her chest.

Had she imagined those words?

"W-what did you say?" Her voice trembled.

"Grandma wants us to stay married," Liam explained calmly. "We could attempt a real relationship. If it fails, we'll part ways amicably."

"You'd...accept my past?" The words tumbled out unevenly.

"Everyone has history they'd rather forget. You've grown beyond yours." His gaze remained steady. "You're not objectionable now."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "And Victoria?"

Silence stretched between them. Sweat dampened her palms as Liam's expression became unreadable.

After an eternity, he spoke slowly. "If my feelings for Victoria remain unchanged, I'll tell you."

Evelyn knew the truth - Liam only proposed this arrangement to honor Margaret's wishes. His heart still belonged to Victoria.

Yet hope blossomed in her chest. She turned away to hide the tears welling in her eyes.

Liam might never love her, but he was offering a chance. That was more than she'd dared hope for.

She knew the danger - every moment with him would deepen her affection. But like a moth drawn to flame, she couldn't resist.

Even if this ended in heartbreak, at least she'd have tried.

"Are you alright?" Liam's voice was gentle.

Evelyn couldn't trust herself to speak. "I need to sleep now," she managed. "Please...don't say anything more."

"Very well."

The room settled into heavy silence. Strangely, the storm outside no longer frightened her.

Evelyn didn't recall falling asleep. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows when she awoke to find Liam gone.

She hugged her knees to her chest, replaying last night's conversation. Had she actually agreed to his proposal?

How could she have forgotten something so important?

The question tormented her until her phone chimed with Liam's message:

"Your silence constitutes agreement. My schedule remains demanding, but I'll make time for us."

Evelyn's heart soared. She clutched her phone and rolled across the bed, grinning like a fool.

After several joyful revolutions, she reread the message.

Though devoid of romantic declarations, the words tasted sweeter than any confection.
###Chapter 55

Evelyn sat on the edge of the bed where Liam had slept last night. She inhaled deeply, catching the faint trace of his cologne on the sheets.

Memories of their intimate moments flooded her mind, making her cheeks flush.

For lunch, Evelyn made herself a quick bowl of ramen. The doorbell interrupted her meal.

Ryan stood at the doorway surrounded by floral arrangements. He handed her an envelope. "Afternoon, Mrs. Blackwood. The proceeds from the flower sale."

Evelyn examined the cash with surprise. "But there was a storm last night. How did they all sell?"

"General Blackwood had me distribute them at the military barracks," Ryan explained.

Recalling Liam's late-night call, Evelyn's lips curved into a smile as she accepted the money. "Thank you."

"General Blackwood also requested I drive you home today," Ryan added.

Evelyn froze.

Thoughts of Victoria made her reluctant to return to Blackwood Manor.

"Does Liam want me back at the estate?" she asked cautiously.

"Yes, Mrs. Blackwood. But the decision is yours. If you prefer, we can arrange alternative accommodations."

After a long pause, Evelyn declared, "We're going back - but not to Blackwood Manor."

Ryan raised an eyebrow. "Where then, ma'am?"

"The Blackwood Family Residence," Evelyn stated firmly.

If Liam was willing to try, so was she. She would win over his family's approval, no matter what it took.

Packing her belongings, Evelyn followed Ryan to the ancestral Blackwood home.

She braced herself for battle. For Liam, she wouldn't retreat again.

Entering the grand foyer, Evelyn expected disdain and criticism as before.

Instead, Cassandra - who had previously scorned her - greeted her with unsettling enthusiasm. The woman practically fawned over her.

"Are you staying with us, Evelyn dear?"

"Indeed, Cassandra. I hope we can coexist peacefully," Evelyn replied politely.

Cassandra only saw dollar signs. Now that she knew Evelyn was the renowned artist Isabella Grayson, her attitude had done a complete turnaround.

"No need for formalities! Winston, prepare Mrs. Blackwood's suite immediately!"

With a polite smile, Evelyn ascended the staircase with her luggage.

In a dimly lit storage room elsewhere, two shadowy figures conversed in hushed tones.

"Status report on the Foghunt?" a male voice demanded.

"Still in progress," a feminine voice responded.

"Three years of training and searching, and this is all you have to show?" The man's voice turned dangerous.

"Sir, Liam Blackwood is also searching. When he finds leads, I'll intercept them first."

"That woman you replaced was supposed to be some nobody. How did she become a famous artist?" he growled.

"It was... unexpected."

"Eliminate her if she becomes a problem."

"That's complicated now. She's Liam's wife."

A sharp slap echoed through the room. The woman stumbled but quickly righted herself.

"Pathetic! We invested heavily to steal that heiress's identity for you. Yet you left her alive, and now she's married to our target!"

"I'll dispose of her and marry Liam Blackwood as planned. Then I'll have access to Aldenria's classified-"

"That engineer was our only lead to identifying the target. Now we're searching blind," the man interrupted. "A needle in a goddamn haystack."

The woman bowed her head. "I won't fail you, sir. The mission will be completed."
###Chapter 56

A thick blanket of fog clung to the morning air, obscuring the weak spring sunlight that struggled to pierce through the heavy clouds.

Evelyn stirred awake to the sound of commotion outside her bedroom. She slipped into a cashmere sweater and stepped out into the hallway.

Servants bustled about, carrying furniture and boxes down from the second floor.

Eleanor and Richard stood in the grand foyer below, still in their silk pajamas.

"Why this sudden departure, Sebastian? You know how much your father and I value having our family together under one roof." Eleanor's voice trembled. "Can't you reconsider staying?"

Evelyn gripped the balcony railing, the cold metal biting into her palms as understanding dawned.

Cassandra swept into the foyer with her usual meddlesome energy. "Sebastian, Evelyn only returned yesterday, and you're already moving out? This speaks volumes about your feelings toward her." She crossed her arms. "We're supposed to be family. Must you be so heartless?"

Sebastian Blackwood and his wife Isabella exchanged glances, their polite masks slipping at Cassandra's accusation.

Isabella's lips curled in disdain. "How noble of you, Cassandra. You can tolerate living with just anyone." She adjusted her diamond bracelet. "But I come from proper breeding. My father chairs the literature department at Cambridge, and my mother performs with the London Symphony. I was raised with refinement, not to mingle with..." Her gaze flicked upward to Evelyn. "...certain elements."

She continued, her voice dripping with contempt, "My husband runs a Fortune 500 company. As his wife, I have standards to maintain. Living under the same roof as... that... would be utterly degrading."

With that final pronouncement, Isabella turned on her Louboutin heels and strode out, the sharp clicks echoing through the mansion.

Sebastian, ever the meek follower, mumbled hasty goodbyes before scurrying after his wife like a chastened puppy.

Evelyn's knuckles turned white against the railing. A bitter taste filled her mouth as humiliation burned through her veins.

Certain elements?

The words carved into her heart like shards of glass.

Below, Eleanor watched her youngest son depart, dabbing at her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief.

"Liam's always away on military assignments. Donovan vanished five years ago without a trace. And now Sebastian..." Her voice broke. "Our family is crumbling before my eyes."

Richard pulled his wife close. "Darling, some things are beyond our control. Let them go."

Eleanor sniffled. "Will Sebastian ever return if Evelyn remains here?"

Neither noticed Evelyn standing frozen on the balcony. Richard answered without hesitation, "He'll be back soon enough. Liam's clearly smitten with Victoria. The divorce is inevitable."

"How much longer must we endure this?" Eleanor wailed.

Cassandra tugged her mother's sleeve, nodding upward. "Mother..."

When Eleanor followed her gaze and saw Evelyn, the color drained from her face.

Richard coughed awkwardly. "Evelyn, darling, your mother's just upset about Sebastian leaving. I was only trying to comfort her. Pay no mind to my ramblings."

Evelyn forced a serene smile. "Of course," she murmured softly before retreating to her room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn's legs gave way. She slid down against the wood, silent tears streaking down her cheeks.

For the first time, she questioned whether her resolve was worth this torment.

In the following days, Eleanor and Richard maintained polite but distant civility. Cassandra and her husband Gregory treated Evelyn with surface-level courtesy—though everyone knew it stemmed from self-interest rather than genuine kindness.

A week later, Cassandra cornered Evelyn with an invitation.

"You simply must attend this gala my friend is hosting," Cassandra insisted, waving an embossed card.

Evelyn declined immediately.

Cassandra's eyes gleamed. "Think of Liam! You need to learn high society's ways if you ever hope to stand beside him." She leaned closer. "All his closest friends will be there. Don't you want to make connections?"

The unspoken threat hung between them—either conform to their world, or lose Liam forever.
###Chapter 57

Evelyn was finally persuaded. Cassandra helped her prepare for what she claimed was an important social gathering.

Only upon arrival did Evelyn realize this was no ordinary high-society event.

It was an exclusive black-market auction of rare artifacts, hosted aboard a luxurious private yacht. Dozens of illegal collectibles were being discreetly traded among the elite.

Her breath caught when she spotted the painting she'd replicated for Margaret's birthday displayed among the items.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she pointed at the canvas. "Explain this, Cassandra."

Cassandra's eyes sparkled with greed. "Look around, Evelyn. Every guest here spends fortunes on such acquisitions. Imagine the profit if our piece sells!"

"How did this even get here?" Evelyn demanded through clenched teeth.

Cassandra lowered her voice. "Grandmother received so many gifts that night. She'd never notice one missing. Besides, she accepted Victoria's invitation too."

Evelyn's fists tightened at her sides. "You stole it?" Each word dripped with barely contained fury.

"Not me!" Cassandra waved her hands defensively. "Gregory took it when no one was looking."

The truth crashed over Evelyn like icy waves. This wasn't a charity event - it was an underground marketplace for stolen treasures.

Seeing Evelyn's expression, Cassandra attempted damage control. "We could split the earnings. Sixty-forty in your favor?"

Evelyn's stony silence spoke volumes.

"Seventy-thirty then! My final offer."

"If I'm Isabella Grayson," Evelyn stated coldly, "every penny goes to charity. If I'm not, then this is fraud."

Cassandra scoffed. "You're practically penniless yet refuse easy money? Want to play saint? Fine. But you won't even claim credit for your good deeds. Are you insane?"

The venom spilled out. "What are you - some guardian angel? Saving men with your body and the poor with your money? Look where that got you - ruined reputation and empty pockets."

Evelyn flinched as the barb struck home. Cassandra knew nothing of her true past.

Without another word, Evelyn began packing the painting.

Cassandra grabbed her arm in panic. "Stop! I've paid the deposit! You'll cost me thousands!"

A salesman approached eagerly. "Interested in this Isabella Grayson original, madam?"

"This is my reproduction," Evelyn declared loudly. "It's not for sale."

The announcement drew curious onlookers.

Cassandra's face purpled with rage. "Experts authenticated this! I've paid the deposit! Either it sells or you cover my losses!"
###Chapter 58

The crowd erupted in whispers the moment the accusation was made.

Evelyn clutched the canvas tighter, her knuckles turning white as she glared at Cassandra. The woman was nothing but a gold-digger, obsessed with wealth and social standing.

But Evelyn stood her ground. "This has nothing to do with me, Cassandra. I painted this for Grandmother. You'll have to explain to the authorities how my work ended up here."

At the mention of police, Cassandra's face drained of color. She froze like a deer caught in headlights.

A smooth male voice suddenly cut through the tension. "Once we're in international waters, no government has jurisdiction over transactions aboard this vessel."

All heads turned toward the speaker - a distinguished man in his mid-thirties wearing a crisp white suit and gold-rimmed glasses. His entire demeanor exuded sophistication.

Evelyn felt an inexplicable chill when their eyes met. Her pulse quickened for reasons she couldn't comprehend.

Why did this complete stranger unsettle her so much?

Instinctively, she took a step back.

Cassandra, however, brightened immediately. "Dr. Whitmore! Did you come with Victoria?"

The doctor - Julian Whitmore - shook Cassandra's hand politely. "Indeed. She's currently browsing the jewelry collection."

As Cassandra glanced toward the jewelry display, Julian began approaching Evelyn.

Evelyn's breath hitched as he drew nearer. Those piercing eyes behind the glasses made her throat constrict with unease.

"We meet again, Evelyn," he said in a tone one might use with a cherished child.

"Do I know you?" Evelyn gasped.

Julian gave her a patient smile. "I'm your ex-boyfriend, Julian. Are you really going to pretend not to recognize me?"

Ex-boyfriend? Julian Whitmore? Evelyn was too stunned to respond.

She'd heard about her colorful dating history, but running into an ex like this?

Cassandra seized the opportunity. "Dr. Whitmore, you dated Evelyn before?"

Julian kept his gaze locked on Evelyn as he nodded with that same gentle smile.

Cassandra smirked. "How delightfully awkward - you're Liam's friend, Evelyn's ex, and Victoria's uncle!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "I'm married now," she blurted out.

Julian adjusted his glasses. "I'm aware. To my good friend Liam." His smile turned wry. "I suppose this is your way of getting back at me."

Evelyn shook her head vehemently. "No, I've lost my memories. I don't remember you."

"That's a rather convenient excuse," Julian replied skeptically.

Cassandra grew impatient with their reunion. She waited for Evelyn to be distracted before making a grab for the painting.

Their proximity made it easy. But Evelyn sensed the movement and swiftly moved the artwork behind her back, shooting Cassandra a warning look.

"Give it to me, Evelyn," Cassandra demanded through gritted teeth. "You'll only ruin it."

"It's not for sale," Evelyn stated firmly.

Cassandra looked ready to strangle her.

Then - BANG!

Chaos erupted as a gunshot rang out. Guests screamed, some running blindly while others dropped to the floor in protective crouches.

Julian immediately shielded Evelyn, pulling her down beside him. Cassandra yelped and followed suit.

Peering through the panic, Evelyn spotted masked figures storming in - pirates wearing animal masks and carrying state-of-the-art rifles. Their presence was terrifying.

One barked an order in Valtorian that most passengers couldn't understand: "Stay down with hands on heads if you value your lives."

A trembling woman stood up abruptly. "Please, I-" she began.
###Chapter 59

The woman's protest died in her throat as multiple gun barrels swung toward her.

A deafening volley of gunfire shattered the air. Screams erupted across the deck as the pirates fired mercilessly.

When the smoke cleared, only a bloody pulp remained where the woman had stood.

Evelyn felt her knees buckle. Julian's steadying hand on her shoulder was the only thing keeping her upright. She shrugged him off with a violent jerk.

"Stay still," Julian whispered urgently, his breath hot against her ear.

Swallowing hard, Evelyn lifted her gaze to the masked pirate leader.

He moved with predatory grace between display cases, examining stolen antiquities with a connoisseur's eye. When he spoke, his Valtorian accent curled around each word. "These waters belong to me now. Your jewels, your artifacts, your very lives are mine to claim."

The pirate's gloved fingers trailed over a golden chalice. "But trinkets mean nothing. Bring me the hydronium, and I'll grant you the mercy of a swift death."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Hydronium? Here?

"For every minute I'm kept waiting," he continued, tapping his watch, "another corpse will feed the sharks."

Julian's whisper cut through her panic. "What's he saying?"

Evelyn blinked. How did Julian know she understood Valtorian?

"Don't play dumb," he murmured. "You mastered eight languages by twenty-two. That brilliant mind of yours hasn't gone anywhere."

Eight languages? Twenty-two? Evelyn's head spun with fragmented memories.

The sharp report of a pistol cut through her confusion. Another hostage crumpled.

After the third execution, Evelyn couldn't stay silent. "Stop!" she called out in flawless Valtorian. "They don't understand you!"

The pirate leader's head snapped up. "Well, well. A cultured dove among pigeons." His masked face tilted. "Stand up, little translator. Unless you'd prefer I continue my count?"

As Evelyn rose, Julian grabbed her wrist. She wrenched free, meeting the pirate's gaze head-on.

The moment she stood, the pirate leader's posture shifted. He slung his rifle across his back with theatrical flair. "Bravery and beauty - a rare combination. Translate my demands accurately, and perhaps I'll spare that pretty neck."

Evelyn's voice shook as she addressed the hostages. "Stay calm. Don't move. They're after—"

Her words faltered as shadows detached from the ship's superstructure. Silent figures moved with lethal precision behind each pirate.

Steel flashed. Throats opened. Before the pirate leader could react, his men collapsed like marionettes with cut strings.

Only the leader remained standing, oblivious to the carnage behind him. "Why did you stop speaking?" he demanded, stepping closer.

The cold kiss of a blade pressed against his jugular answered for her.
###Chapter 60

The pirate captain's instincts screamed danger. He whirled around, scanning the dimly lit deck with narrowed eyes.

Two cold gun barrels pressed against his temples before he could raise his weapon. His breath hitched.

Suddenly, a squad of heavily armored soldiers stormed the ship. Their black tactical gear gleamed under the moonlight, radiating lethal authority.

Among them, Evelyn spotted a commanding figure who stood taller than the rest. His presence alone made the air feel heavier.

Her pulse quickened. Liam had come with the Aldenrian military forces. Again.

Whenever danger found her, he appeared like some dark guardian angel.

Though she knew he wasn't here for her, warmth still flooded her chest at the sight of him.

"Liam! You're here!" Victoria scrambled up from the deck, her voice shrill with relief. "Save me!"

Evelyn's brief moment of happiness shattered. She watched as Victoria stumbled toward Liam with desperate hope.

Liam held up a warning hand, his expression stern. "Stay back."

Victoria ignored him, her painted lips trembling. "You came for me!" she sobbed, rushing forward again.

As she passed the pirate captain, his arm shot out like a viper. In one fluid motion, he yanked her against his chest and pressed a curved dagger to her throat.

The entire deck froze. Even the waves seemed to still at Victoria's stupidity.

The blade bit into Victoria's perfect skin. A thin line of crimson appeared. Her face drained of color as terrified whimpers escaped her lips.

"L-Liam...help...kill him..." she stammered.

The pirate captain snarled in Valtorian, "Let me leave."

Liam took a threatening step forward. "What did he say?" His brow furrowed in frustration.

He glanced at Ryan, who shook his head. Then at Adrian, who also shrugged.

When Liam's gaze swept the deck, it landed on Evelyn. His eyes widened slightly - surprise, then something darker flickered across his features.

She looked different tonight. The moonlight caught the silver embroidery on her gown, making her glow like some ethereal creature.

But duty called. Liam tore his gaze away. "Can anyone translate?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

The pirate pressed the dagger deeper, repeating his demand in guttural Valtorian.

Victoria's screams pierced the night. "Liam! I'm dying! Shoot him!"

Evelyn's heart twisted as she watched Liam hesitate.

The pirate stood a full head taller than Victoria. At this range, Liam wouldn't miss.

So why didn't he shoot? Was he that afraid of hurting Victoria? Did he love her so much he'd risk everything?

If Evelyn didn't translate, the pirate might slit Victoria's throat right now.

Part of her wanted to let it happen. But she couldn't.

Swallowing her bitterness, Evelyn spoke. "He says if you let him leave, he'll give you all the treasure and release Victoria. He'll even offer you a gram of—"

Her voice cut off abruptly.
###Chapter 61

All eyes turned toward Evelyn with bated breath.

Ryan, Adrian, and the special forces operatives gaped at her in astonishment. Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined Evelyn could comprehend Valtorian.

Liam's reaction was most striking. Though his expression remained carefully neutral, the shock in his piercing blue eyes was unmistakable.

After collecting himself, he demanded sharply, "A gram of what?"

Evelyn hesitated, acutely aware this wasn't the place for sensitive discussions. "A gram of the rare element you've been searching for," she finally answered.

A calculating gleam flashed in Liam's eyes before he turned to the pirate captain. "Release her and hand over the item. Then you may leave unharmed."

Evelyn's heart twisted painfully at his words. Even now, he prioritized Victoria's safety above all else.

Swallowing her bitterness, she translated Liam's terms to the pirate leader.

The grizzled captain barked something in rapid Valtorian. "He demands a speedboat," Evelyn relayed.

Liam immediately ordered his men to prepare one.

As the pirate dragged Victoria toward the exit, every soldier kept their weapons trained on him. Evelyn followed closely, serving as reluctant interpreter between the two parties.

At the gangplank, the pirate leader suddenly spoke again. Evelyn translated the fragments she could understand.

Then, in one swift motion, the man produced a small black vial from his coat and hurled it toward Liam. The container spun through the air before landing perfectly in Liam's waiting palm.

Liam clutched the vial with white-knuckled intensity, his gaze burning into it.

"Are you really letting him go?" Evelyn asked bitterly. "Your men could easily take him down."

Liam seemed deaf to her words, his entire focus consumed by examining the vial's contents.

When he finally looked up, his voice was ice. "Tell him he's free to leave once Victoria is safe."

The stark contrast between his tender concern for Victoria and cold indifference toward Evelyn cut deeper than any blade.

He wouldn't risk Victoria's safety for anything—not even when eliminating this threat was well within his power.

As Liam made his choice, disappointment crashed over Evelyn in waves.

She delivered his final message mechanically before fleeing toward the cabins without a backward glance.

Cassandra and Julian intercepted her near the stairwell.

Cassandra brandished the damaged painting like a weapon. "Evelyn! What the hell happened to this? It's ruined!"

Evelyn feigned innocence. "Is it? I wouldn't know. Those pirates terrified me so badly I can barely stand. I need to lie down."

Julian rushed forward, grasping her arm. "Are you hurt? Let me check—"

She wrenched free. "Dr. Whitmore, you're a stranger to me. Kindly keep your hands to yourself."

With that, she disappeared into an empty stateroom.

Cassandra frowned at the closed door. "What's her problem? She looked ready to cry. Was she really that scared?"

Julian's eyes darkened with pain. "She's always been strong... but fragile too."

Cassandra merely snorted and tossed the ruined painting aside.
###Chapter 62

The pirate leader shoved Victoria aside and scrambled onto the speedboat, disappearing into the horizon.

Victoria pressed a hand to her bleeding neck as she stumbled toward Liam.

"Liam!" she cried, her voice trembling. "Order your men to shoot! He's still within range—we can take him out now!"

Instead of complying, Liam gripped her wrist and pulled her hand away to inspect the wound.

"It's shallow," he said coolly. "You'll live."

Victoria's eyes flashed with fury. "He's getting away! Shoot him!"

Ignoring her, Liam turned to Ryan. "Patch her up."

Helpless, Victoria could only watch as the pirate vanished into the distance. She stomped her foot in frustration before whirling back toward Liam.

But he was already walking away, his men trailing behind him.

"Liam!" she called, hurrying after him. "Aren't you going to stay with me? I could have died!"

He didn’t spare her a glance.

Ryan sighed and stepped forward. "Ms. Dawson, let me tend to your wound."

Victoria glared at him. "No! I want Liam!"

Liam finally stopped, exhaling sharply before grabbing her arm and dragging her toward the infirmary.

"Fine," he snapped. "I'll do it myself."

Ryan watched them go, shaking his head. What a headache.

Ten minutes later, Liam finished bandaging her wound and led her to a guest cabin.

As he stepped out, he nearly collided with Julian Whitmore.

The two exchanged a silent nod.

"You're here," Liam said flatly.

Julian gave a strained smile. "Victoria insisted."

Liam rubbed his temple. "She's spoiled. And you're to blame."

Julian leaned against the wall with a helpless shrug. "Not me. My late brother and his wife doted on her. I had no say."

Liam mirrored his stance, tilting his head back. "I'm married now. If you still want her, take her."

Julian hesitated. "I know. But your wife is my ex."

Liam's expression darkened.

A sharp, inexplicable pang twisted in his chest.

Julian continued carefully, "Even though I'm not her real uncle, we're still family. Besides, you've always cared for her. I wouldn't fight you over a woman."

He sighed. "Victoria talked about you nonstop while we were in Solterra. I knew she loved you. That's why I ended things three years ago."

Liam's jaw tightened.

Julian added, "She was brilliant, beautiful—the most captivating woman I'd ever met. I never imagined she'd end up as your wife."
###Chapter 63

Liam's fingers tightened into fists inside his coat pockets. Though struggling to maintain composure, his voice remained casual as he inquired, "Was this before her memory loss?"

"She's faking the amnesia," Julian stated with conviction. "This whole act of forgetting everything is just a ploy to avoid acknowledging me. All because she never got over our breakup years ago."

Evelyn's words echoed through Liam's mind. He remembered asking if she'd ever been in love before. Her response had been heartbreaking - she'd loved someone whose heart belonged elsewhere. A love that was never meant to be.

Was Julian that man?

Liam drew a sharp breath. An invisible weight pressed against his chest, making it difficult to breathe. After a tense pause, he remarked, "Her talents don't match her family background and experiences."

Julian chuckled darkly. "Absolutely. She's in a league of her own. You can't define her by her origins."

"True enough." Liam met Julian's gaze with unsettling sincerity. "I'd appreciate your blessing."

His tone was light, but the challenge in his eyes was unmistakable.

Julian's eye twitched violently as he stared at Liam. "Excuse me?"

"I didn't inform you about our marriage because we haven't had the ceremony yet. Given our long friendship, I was hoping you'd wish us well," Liam explained smoothly.

Julian's face drained of color. Caught off guard, he stammered, "You were utterly devoted to Victoria before. You're not the type to change affections easily. She's my niece. How can you expect my approval?"

Liam knew Julian's objections had nothing to do with Victoria. This confirmed he'd need to watch Julian carefully.

"As adults, we learn love doesn't always follow ideals. My grandmother chose Evelyn for me. Now that we're married, I intend to honor that commitment," Liam said meaningfully.

Julian fell into brooding silence, his expression darkening.

Liam gave his shoulder a patronizing pat. "Duty calls. We'll catch up later."

Forcing a stiff smile, Julian managed, "Of course."

Adjusting his glasses, he watched Liam depart with barely concealed fury glittering in his eyes.

The night sky glittered with stars above the cruise ship, their brilliance cutting through the darkness.

Hunger finally drove Evelyn from her cabin toward the dining area. As she walked the corridor, she overheard three women gossiping about Liam.

"I never imagined General Blackwood would be so striking in person! The rumors didn't do him justice."

"Same! I expected some grizzled old military man, not that gorgeous specimen. He's absolutely breathtaking! I feel safer knowing he's protecting us."

"With Aldenria's military technology, we've nothing to fear. Remember when they launched the Phantom-X missile? The whole world trembled."

"But people have died onboard already. It's terrifying. I just want to go home."

"We won't reach port soon. The military's interrogating everyone. They're searching for something important."

"What could it be?"

"No idea, but they questioned me earlier. I was completely confused."

"Me too! How long will this take? There are thousands onboard."

"Probably days."

Evelyn frowned as she trailed behind them. If security was questioning passengers, why had she been overlooked?
###Chapter 64

The morning sunlight streamed through the windows as Evelyn Carter entered the dining hall. She selected a delicate porcelain teacup from the counter, its floral pattern reminding her of better times. The buffet spread offered an array of colorful fruits and pastries, which she carefully arranged on her plate.

With her breakfast balanced in one hand and steaming tea in the other, she turned toward her private quarters. The scent of bergamot from her Earl Grey tea mingled with the crisp morning air.

Just as she reached her door, Evelyn froze. Liam Blackwood stood there, his raised fist paused mid-knock. Their eyes met, and an electric tension crackled between them despite the awkward silence.

"Let me help you with that," Liam offered, already reaching for her teacup.

Evelyn instinctively pulled back. "I've got it, thank you."

But Liam's military reflexes were quicker. Before she could protest further, the teacup had changed hands. The warmth of his fingers briefly brushed against hers, sending an unexpected shiver down her spine.

Swallowing her pride, Evelyn turned to unlock the door. She could feel Liam's presence behind her, solid and unyielding as a fortress wall.

Inside, Liam placed the teacup on the small dining table with deliberate care. His sharp eyes swept across the room, taking in every detail from the unmade bed to the open book on the nightstand.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork. Being alone with him always set her nerves on edge - a confusing mix of apprehension and something far more dangerous.

For seven endless days, she'd ached for his presence. Now that he stood before her, all she felt was the sting of betrayal.

"That's hardly enough for breakfast," Liam observed, nodding at her modest plate.

Evelyn speared a strawberry with unnecessary force, refusing to meet his gaze as she chewed.

Liam's expression darkened. He settled into the chair opposite her, his muscular frame making the furniture seem suddenly inadequate. "Are you planning to ignore me all morning?"

The audacity of his question made the fruit turn to ash in her mouth. She washed it down with a scalding sip of tea, her golden-brown eyes finally lifting to challenge him.

Something flickered in Liam's stormy gaze at her defiance, but he remained silent, waiting.

Evelyn wanted to scream at him, to demand answers. But one look from those piercing gray eyes could still render her speechless. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I thought Hawkeye never missed his mark."

Liam's brow furrowed. He clearly expected anger about the escaped pirates, not this... whatever this was. The realization that Evelyn might be jealous of Victoria hadn't even crossed his tactical mind.

"Leaving one alive was strategic," he explained patiently. "They'll lead us straight to their nest. How else would we recover all the stolen goods?"

Evelyn's fork paused mid-air. Was this his plan all along? To track them back to their stronghold?

The pieces clicked together with sudden clarity. She stabbed another piece of fruit, her lips pressed into a thin line. "You're worried about accidentally hitting Victoria, aren't you?"

Liam actually laughed, the sound rough and unexpected. "What does she have to do with any of this?"

Evelyn's fork made tiny holes in the apple slice until it resembled Swiss cheese. She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, determined not to reveal the storm of emotions beneath her calm exterior.

Leaning forward suddenly, Liam rested his elbows on the table. "How do you know Valtorian? It's a dying language from a war-torn country."

The question caught Evelyn off guard. She didn't know why she understood Valtorian any more than she knew why her hands sometimes moved as if painting invisible canvases in the air.

Perhaps from serving international clients? A professional courtesy to make them feel at home?

The explanation made logical sense, but something told her it wasn't the whole truth. She couldn't share even this much with Liam though.

Her eyes darted to the watermelon slices. In a sudden burst of courage, she picked one up and extended it toward him. "Would you like some?"

The moment the words left her lips, Evelyn stiffened, shocked by her own boldness.
###Chapter 65

Did Evelyn just offer to feed Liam with her own fork?

Her cheeks burned at the realization. She must be losing her mind.

Snapping back to reality, Evelyn forced a stiff smile. Her entire face screamed awkwardness as she began withdrawing her hand. "I'm sorry, I didn't realize—"

Before she could pull away, Liam caught her wrist and guided the watermelon piece to his lips.

Evelyn's breath hitched as she watched his mouth touch the fork she'd just used. Was this... an indirect kiss?

Heat flooded her face. Her pulse raced. Every muscle in her body tensed.

Liam chewed the fruit calmly, his expression unreadable. "Sweet. Though the portion was disappointingly small."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, staring at her lap. She couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze.

"I... forgot I'd used that fork," she murmured, fingers twisting in her lap.

The admission made Liam freeze. What had been an innocent act suddenly felt charged. Electricity crackled along his skin.

His throat went dry. Against his will, his gaze dropped to Evelyn's pink, parted lips.

She bit her lower lip, the blush spreading to her ears.

This reaction confused him. Evelyn had worked in the underground world. She'd been with countless men. Yet here she was, blushing like an untouched maiden.

The contradiction fascinated him.

Clearing his throat, Liam feigned nonchalance. "I don't mind. Unless... you're disgusted I used your fork?"

Evelyn's head snapped up. "No! Not at all!"

Flustered, she speared another fruit piece and offered it to him.

Watching her crimson cheeks, Liam was reminded of Victoria in her youth. These comparisons came more frequently lately.

The silence stretched uncomfortably.

Then Liam's expression darkened. "Evelyn," he said quietly, "did that pirate reveal anything else? Are you keeping secrets?"

Evelyn swallowed her bite of food and set down her fork. After sipping her tea, she leaned closer.

"He had one gram of hydronium," she whispered, glancing at the neighboring cabin. "Stolen from a chemical engineer. There's another gram aboard—with a second engineer."

Liam's jaw tightened but he remained silent.

Thinking he hadn't heard, Evelyn leaned in further. Her warm breath brushed his ear as she murmured, "He said surrendering it was pointless. Without the engineers, the hydronium's useless."

Liam's eyes fluttered shut. Not from the gravity of her words—but from her proximity. That whisper of breath ignited sparks across his skin.

An inconvenient heat pooled low in his abdomen.

Unaware of the fire she'd kindled, Evelyn frowned at his reaction. "What's wrong?"

The tension between them crackled like live wires.
###Chapter 66

Liam struggled to compose himself before meeting Evelyn's gaze again. His eyes lingered on the exposed skin above her collarbone where her pajama top had slipped.

When Evelyn leaned closer to pass him the salt, she didn't notice how her loose neckline gaped open. The delicate curve of her breasts became visible through the thin fabric.

Liam forcefully averted his eyes, his breathing turning uneven. His lips parted slightly as he fought for control.

This unfamiliar sensation unsettled him. The more he tried to suppress it, the stronger it grew. He prided himself on discipline, yet here he was, completely unraveled.

"Is that everything?" Liam's voice dropped to a rough whisper.

"Yes, that's all," Evelyn replied absently.

Liam reached out to gently guide Evelyn back to her seat. He desperately needed to change the subject, but her luminous eyes held him captive. Her flawless skin glowed in the lamplight, her lips slightly parted.

Heat flooded his face as he stared at her mouth. His Adam's apple bobbed with a hard swallow that did nothing to cool the fire in his veins. Was he losing his mind? Since when did he lust after Evelyn?

He rationalized it - he was a healthy man, and Evelyn was his wife. These thoughts were natural, weren't they?

Suppressing his nerves, Liam spoke in that same low tone. "Mind if I stay here tonight?"

The unspoken implication hung heavy between them.

Evelyn blinked at him in surprise. The intensity in his gaze made her pulse quicken. This wasn't the controlled man she knew.

"Are all the other cabins occupied?" she asked.

Liam's breathing grew labored. "They are, but that's not why I'm asking."

Did she truly not understand? How could someone so perceptive miss his meaning?

Evelyn noticed the change in Liam's demeanor - the restrained energy, the darkening of his eyes. But she dismissed it. They'd shared a bed countless times before without incident. His loyalty to Victoria would keep him in check.

She glanced at the spacious bed. "Of course you can stay," she agreed easily.

Liam exhaled in quiet satisfaction. "Finished with dinner?" he asked.

Evelyn set aside her plate. "Yes."

"Going to shower?"

"Already did." She absently adjusted her slipping pajama top. "You should though."

Liam clenched his fists, fighting the urge to touch her. Had his self-control weakened? Was that why these forbidden thoughts plagued him?

Yet he'd never experienced this with anyone before. Were these mere physical urges, or something deeper? The possibility terrified him.

Abruptly, he stood and headed for the bathroom. A cold shower would clear his head. It always did.

Evelyn settled into bed with a book. Thirty minutes later, the bathroom door swung open. She looked up and froze.

Liam stood there wearing only a towel slung low on his hips. Water droplets glistened on his toned chest and abs. His damp hair curled slightly at the ends. Every sculpted muscle stood out in sharp relief.

The sight stole her breath. He looked positively sinful.
###Chapter 67

Evelyn quickly grabbed her book again, her cheeks burning as she glanced nervously around the room.

Yet she couldn't help stealing glances at Liam's sculpted physique.

She buried her face behind the book, her voice trembling for the first time. "W-why didn't you get dressed first?"

Liam towel-dried his damp hair before tossing it aside. He moved toward her with deliberate steps.

"Would've had to take them off again later," he murmured in that deep, gravelly voice that sent shivers down her spine. "Too much trouble."

The implication made Evelyn's breath catch. Her wide, innocent eyes met his smoldering gaze before she quickly looked away.

"Why must you sleep... like that?" she stammered, fingers tightening around her book.

Liam studied her flustered expression with sudden realization. Julian had claimed her amnesia was fake. Was this shyness another act?

As he pondered, Evelyn pointed urgently to the wardrobe. "There are clean clothes in there. You should... put something on."

A wry smile tugged at Liam's lips. He'd misread the situation entirely. Evelyn hadn't even considered the intimate implications.

With an exasperated sigh, he retrieved pajamas from the wardrobe. When he returned, Evelyn had already turned away, curled into a defensive ball.

He understood her unspoken message and wouldn't push her.

That explosive argument when she'd tried sleeping on the floor still haunted him. Demanding intimacy now would make him the worst kind of hypocrite.

Liam shoved those thoughts aside as he switched off the lights. Moonlight spilled through the curtains, painting silver streaks across their tense silence.

Their breathing sounded unnaturally loud in the dark room, each breath heavier than normal.

After a prolonged silence, Liam finally spoke. "Do you know Julian?"

Evelyn stiffened, clutching the blankets tighter. When she finally answered, her voice was barely audible. "We met today. I don't really know him."

Liam exhaled in quiet relief, though he couldn't explain why. He let the matter drop.

The prolonged silence made Evelyn fidget. Desperate to break the tension, she blurted out, "Are you going after those pirates?"

"No."

"Then... did you board that ship to rescue Victoria?"

"No." His voice grew distant. "We didn't expect pirates on this mission. Or familiar faces. Especially not yours."

Evelyn hadn't expected to be on that ship either. Cassandra had tricked her, but she kept that to herself.

"Was it about the hydronium then?" she ventured.

Liam closed his eyes. Some secrets weren't his to share. "It's late. Sleep."

"Goodnight," Evelyn whispered, understanding his boundaries.

The night stretched endlessly for Liam, his body thrumming with restless energy. No matter how he tried, he couldn't quiet the hunger gnawing at him.

Sleep remained elusive as he waged war against his own desires.
###Chapter 68

The sharp rapping at the door shattered the morning stillness.

Liam's eyes flew open, immediately darting to Evelyn's serene sleeping form beside him. Careful not to disturb her, he slowly peeled back the covers.

His bare feet touched the cold floorboards.

Moving with practiced stealth, he made his way to the door.

"General Blackwood—" Ryan Sullivan began, but Liam silenced him with a finger to his lips and a warning glare.

Ryan blinked in surprise. Since when had the notoriously brusque general become so... considerate?

Liam glanced back at Evelyn's undisturbed figure before slipping through the doorway, closing it with barely a click.

Ryan's mouth fell open at the uncharacteristic gentleness.

Once outside, Liam kept his voice barely above a whisper. "Do you know what time it is?"

Ryan checked his watch—7:15 AM. The general was usually doing push-ups by now. But he wisely kept that observation to himself. "We located the chemist, sir."

A spark ignited in Liam's dark eyes.

"Give me two minutes," he said, already turning back toward the bedroom.

Ryan stood frozen in the hallway, utterly perplexed. The general's behavior around Evelyn Carter made no sense—if he disliked her so much, why did they keep sharing a bed?

Five minutes later, Liam emerged in full dress uniform, the crisp lines accentuating his broad shoulders as he strode toward the interrogation room.

Inside sat a frail-looking elderly man with wild white hair and thick-rimmed glasses that magnified his tired eyes. After an hour of questioning, he looked ready to collapse—until Liam entered.

The old man immediately straightened in his chair.

"General Blackwood," he rasped, "take the hydronium. I want nothing in return. Just let me live."

Liam picked up the dossier and took the seat opposite. "Dr. Hart, the hydronium is merely the beginning. I want information about 'Wright'—and how to find her."

Benjamin Hart adjusted his glasses with trembling fingers. "Where should I even begin?"

Liam tapped the small black glass vial on the table. "Start with how you obtained this."

"Frederick was my colleague for thirty years. I saved his life during the Solterra incident, and he repaid me with this." Benjamin's voice cracked. "His last gift before they killed him."

"Who's Frederick?"

"M's personal assistant. The only person who ever saw her face." Benjamin swallowed hard. "Now he's gone."

Liam's entire body tensed. "M?"

Ryan immediately flipped open his notebook, pen poised.

Benjamin gave a humorless laugh. "Yes, Cassandra Wright—the genius behind hydronium. A brilliant young woman, barely out of university."

Liam's expression darkened with disbelief. Every lead had pointed to an elderly scientist—not some prodigy girl.

Ryan leaned forward menacingly. "You'd better be telling the truth, old man."

Benjamin adjusted his glasses nervously. "I swear it! I never met M myself, but Frederick spoke of her constantly."

He took a shaky breath before continuing. "Frederick was our institute's top researcher—published groundbreaking papers, won international awards. Yet he resented being assistant to a girl half his age."

Benjamin pointed at the vial. "That's why he stole two samples of hydronium from her lab. Kept one, gave me the other." His fingers trembled around the glass. "Three days later, they found his body floating in the Aldenrian harbor."
###Chapter 69

"Our goal was straightforward," Benjamin Hart confessed, adjusting his thick glasses nervously. "We aimed to research this chemical and create the most powerful bioweapon in existence. Global recognition was all we sought."

His fingers trembled as he continued. "But we never anticipated its value would skyrocket to five billion dollars per vial. Every nation covets it. What began as a scientific breakthrough became our death sentence."

"Frederick lost his life because of this," Benjamin whispered, his voice cracking. "Yesterday, I barely escaped bandits myself. I can't keep it anymore—take it, please."

Liam Blackwood studied the frail researcher, struggling to reconcile the image of the infamous "Winkler" with this trembling young woman before him.

Ryan Sullivan's pen scratched across his notepad as he fired questions. "Where is Cassandra Wright from?"

"Solterra," Benjamin answered.

"Her age?"

"I'm uncertain. But Frederick mentioned she synthesized the first hydronium batch at nineteen. The compound bears her name."

"Family?"

Benjamin shook his head. "With that level of secrecy? Even her relatives likely don't know her occupation."

Ryan pressed further. "Besides Frederick, who's seen her? Any photographs?"

A bitter laugh escaped Benjamin. "Photos? Impossible. Frederick was merely an assistant, yet all his records were erased. Imagine what they did to Cassandra's files."

"Her current location?" Ryan demanded.

Benjamin's gaze darted nervously. Liam noticed the shift immediately, leaning forward. "You know where she is."

The researcher exhaled shakily. "Geniuses like her are rare treasures. Solterra guards her identity fiercely."

"Frederick's jealousy proved fatal," Benjamin continued. "He leaked her existence and hydronium's formula. Suddenly every nation wanted both the chemical and its creator."

"Three years ago, Solterra relocated Cassandra." Benjamin's voice dropped. "During transit, attackers struck. She vanished. Forty-eight hydronium vials disappeared with her."

The news struck Liam like a physical blow. His chest constricted. The person he'd hunted for years—gone. Another brilliant mind extinguished too soon.

Ryan recovered first. "How do you know she's dead?"

"Someone of Cassandra's caliber?" Benjamin removed his glasses, polishing them absently. "Solterra implanted a microchip to monitor her vitals and location."

"When the attack occurred," he explained, "trackers traced her to the Maldiac Ocean's depths. The chip registered no life signs. They must have killed her and weighted the body."

Liam examined the vial in his hands, watching the colorless liquid swirl. His jaw tightened. "Your research findings?"

The question hung heavy in the air as Benjamin hesitated, his fate balancing on his next words.
###Chapter 70

Benjamin nodded hesitantly. "Yes. But the chemical composition is beyond my comprehension. Without Ms. Wright's formula, this substance is completely useless."

Liam studied Benjamin with sharp military precision before rising abruptly, the vial clenched in his fist. He turned to Ryan with decisive authority. "Name his price. I'm acquiring this immediately."

Before Benjamin could protest, Liam had already exited the room with purposeful strides.

Panic flashed across Benjamin's face as he scrambled to his feet. "Wait! Payment isn't necessary—"

But Ryan cut him off with professional seriousness. "Market valuation places this at five billion dollars per vial. You may name any amount below that threshold."

Benjamin's hands trembled visibly. The sum was unimaginable for a retired researcher with mounting medical bills for his wife. He'd considered selling the sample discreetly during the cruise, never dreaming of such astronomical figures.

Hesitantly, he raised a single finger. Surely one million wouldn't be excessive?

"One billion? Accepted with gratitude," Ryan responded immediately.

"No! That's far too generous!" Benjamin waved his hands frantically.

Ryan adjusted smoothly. "Ten million then? Aldenria thanks you for this patriotic contribution." He produced official documents with practiced efficiency. "Present these at military headquarters within seventy-two hours for payment processing."

Benjamin stood speechless as Ryan departed with military precision.

At dusk, the luxury liner returned to Aldenrian waters, docking beneath twilit skies. Passengers disembarked in orderly fashion.

When Evelyn followed Cassandra onto the pier, her breath caught at the imposing sight before her.

Two disciplined columns of special forces stood at perfect attention, their black tactical gear creating an intimidating corridor. The air vibrated with unspoken authority.

Nearby, Victoria and Julian waited beside a sleek black limousine. Cassandra moved to greet Julian casually while Evelyn fumbled for her phone to summon a ride.

The rhythmic cadence of polished boots on concrete made her turn—only to see Victoria dart past with theatrical enthusiasm.

"Nate!" Victoria clung to Liam's arm with practiced affection. "It's been ages! I can't bear to be apart again so soon."

Evelyn's chest constricted painfully. She lowered her gaze, the sting behind her eyes betraying her as she pretended to study her phone screen.

Cassandra approached with Julian. "Victoria, Liam has pressing military obligations. He can't entertain personal engagements."

Julian smirked. "Why not accompany him to base? I'm sure he'd appreciate the company."

Victoria brightened instantly. "Perfect! I've always wanted to tour your weapons facility, Nate!"

Liam's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds. He peeled Victoria off with visible irritation. "Enough. Stop this undignified display."

Nearby, Ryan and Adrian exchanged disapproving glances at the spectacle. The general's formidable reputation was being compromised by this childish behavior.

Cassandra checked her watch. "Evelyn, it's getting late. We should ride back with Dr. Whitmore."

Evelyn numbly noted the fifteen-minute wait time on her ride-share app. Anything to escape this painful scene. "Fine," she murmured, moving toward Cassandra.

Julian's smile turned triumphant as he opened the passenger door.

"Evie."

The unexpected endearment froze everyone in place. That deep, familiar voice—Liam's voice—had never sounded so tender.

Evelyn turned slowly, heart pounding. Surely she'd misheard?

Liam shoved Victoria aside with uncharacteristic roughness and closed the distance between them. His large hand enveloped hers as he murmured, "Last night you mentioned wanting to observe field exercises. The 101st Airborne is drilling at dawn."

Evelyn blinked in confusion. She had no memory of such a conversation.

Julian slammed the car door shut, his expression thunderous. "With your schedule, that would be highly inconvenient."

Liam's grip tightened possessively as he pulled Evelyn against his side. "No obligation supersedes my wife's requests. If I can't honor simple promises, what kind of husband would that make me?"

The deliberate emphasis on "wife" hung in the air like a challenge.

Julian's jaw clenched while Evelyn's pulse raced erratically. Liam's palm burned against hers, sending disorienting warmth through her body. She couldn't decipher his sudden change, but she wouldn't undermine him publicly.

The tension between the two men became palpable.

"And what of Victoria's plans?" Julian demanded coldly.
###Chapter 71

Liam's voice was steady as he spoke. "I'll need you to escort her home. She made quite a spectacle at the military base earlier, and now the entire research division holds a grudge against her. This is beyond my control."

Victoria immediately rushed to his side, her cheeks flushed with irritation. "Liam, I refuse to go home! I want to stay and watch the training exercises!"

His expression remained unyielding. "You're returning with your uncle. I won't have your grandparents worrying about you."

With that final statement, he guided Evelyn toward the heavily armored military vehicles waiting nearby.

Victoria watched through narrowed eyes as the impressive convoy departed with Evelyn and Liam at the forefront. Her lips pressed into a thin line of displeasure.

Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. A dangerous glint flashed briefly in her eyes before she schooled her features.

Cassandra offered an awkward smile. "Well then, Victoria, shall we take your uncle's car back?"

Ignoring Cassandra completely, Victoria ground out through clenched teeth, "Julian, drive me to headquarters immediately."

Julian's response was ice-cold. "I have surgeries scheduled tomorrow. Take a taxi."

He turned on his heel and left without another word.

Cassandra stood frozen in confusion. Weren't Victoria and Julian supposed to be close? Why this sudden chill between them? And since when did Victoria address her uncle so formally?

Julian drove off alone while Victoria hailed a cab to follow Liam's convoy.

Left standing alone, Cassandra could only stare in bewilderment at the unfolding drama.

Inside the military vehicle heading toward the border regions, Evelyn shifted uncomfortably in her seat. Her gaze remained fixed on the passing landscape outside the window, wondering when Liam would finally stop the car.

Anywhere near public transportation would be ideal - she could easily make her way back to Blackwood Manor from there.

Yet even as they left Aldenria behind, Liam showed no signs of stopping.

Summoning her courage, Evelyn turned toward him. Liam's sharp profile was striking in the afternoon light, his aristocratic features undeniably handsome.

His military posture never wavered, his tall frame radiating an intimidating aura of authority that kept others at a distance.

After gathering her thoughts, Evelyn ventured cautiously, "Are we truly going to the border?"

Liam seemed to snap out of his thoughts, turning to meet her gaze. His voice softened slightly as he asked, "Do you want to go?"

Evelyn nearly laughed at the absurdity of the question. They were already miles beyond city limits - what choice did she have now?

While the frontier held no appeal for her, being with Liam did. If he genuinely wanted her company, she would gladly follow.

But this wasn't about her - she recognized the petty rivalry between Liam and Julian. His actions weren't motivated by affection.

After a long silence, Evelyn finally spoke. "Liam, you know I have amnesia. To me, Julian is just a stranger. There's nothing between us. You don't need to worry about... betrayal."

"Betrayal?" Liam's eyes darkened, his expression unreadable.

"You and Julian don't get along, do you?" Evelyn pressed, her heart aching. She looked away, unable to meet his piercing gaze. "Was it really necessary to call me 'Eve' and spin those stories just to spite him?"

A bitter smile touched Liam's lips. He leaned back against the seat, his tone clipped. "Why? Are you concerned for him?"

"I—" The words caught in Evelyn's throat.

It was Liam she worried about. She hated seeing him torture himself with words he didn't mean, actions that went against his nature.

But the confession remained unspoken. The silence stretched between them.

Liam turned his head slightly, his eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. "You may not want to go," he murmured, "but someone seems determined to follow."
###Chapter 72

Evelyn understood perfectly well that Liam was subtly reminding her about Victoria chasing after them.

Memories of the tender moments between Liam and Victoria at the military base flooded her mind, accompanied by Liam's constant care and attention toward Victoria. A sharp pang of jealousy twisted her heart.

She lowered her gaze, refusing to speak another word.

Liam studied her melancholy profile, his dark eyes growing stormy as his brows furrowed slightly.

An uneasy feeling settled in his chest. Was she really that reluctant to be with him? Was she thinking about Julian again?

After a brief internal battle, Liam couldn't bear seeing her distressed any longer. "Where would you like me to drop you off?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn bit her lip as a wave of sadness crashed over her. So he was letting her go after all.

"Anywhere is fine," she murmured.

From the front passenger seat, Ryan quickly interjected, "Madam, we're on the highway - we can't just stop here."

Adrian, who'd been focused on driving, added, "Why don't you come with us to the military base for a few days? Many people there miss you, especially the research team. They keep asking when you'll visit again."

Since her memory loss, Evelyn had only heard affection from her grandmother. Hearing that people at the base cared about her made her face instantly brighten.

She leaned forward with a smile. "Really?"

Adrian nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely. Dr. Reynolds mentions you often."

Seizing this opportunity to escape the awkward situation, Evelyn declared, "Then I'll go see them!"

Adrian grinned. "This time, Madam, I'll teach you proper self-defense. No tricks like last time."

Evelyn scoffed playfully, her mood lifting. "So you admit you were messing with me before?"

Having interacted with Evelyn several times now, Adrian found her gentle yet resilient. He chuckled. "My apologies for that. But I promise - whatever you want to learn, I'll teach you properly."

Evelyn sighed. "But I'm not strong enough."

"Strength can be built," Adrian reassured. "First, you need to increase your protein intake-"

"Focus on driving." Liam's sharp command cut through the car.

His tone carried unmistakable authority. Adrian immediately straightened. "Yes, General Blackwood."

The sudden shift in atmosphere made Evelyn tense. She sensed Liam's jealousy radiating through the car.

Leaning back, she pulled out her phone and began scrolling silently, her earlier cheerfulness gone.

Then she felt warm breath near her ear. "If you want to learn self-defense, I'll teach you."

Evelyn startled, turning to look at the man beside her. Liam's profile remained stern, his gaze fixed straight ahead.

But she hadn't imagined it - he'd definitely whispered those words.

Learning from Adrian would have been simple - just training. But any physical contact with Liam made her pulse race uncontrollably.

After a moment's hesitation, she declined politely. "No thank you, I've changed my mind."

"Fine," Liam replied flatly.

He said nothing more, closing his eyes as if to rest.

Unseen by Evelyn, his hands clenched into fists. A strange tightness constricted his chest, making it hard to breathe.

This unfamiliar discomfort put him in a foul mood.
###Chapter 73

The Aldenrian military headquarters stood at the borderlands, a fortress of steel and secrets.

Evelyn Carter had never set foot in this heavily guarded weapons facility before. The armored convoy rolled through multiple checkpoints before stopping before a gleaming skyscraper that pierced the twilight sky.

Following Liam Blackwood's imposing figure, she entered the elevator that whisked them silently to the penthouse level. Her fingers twitched nervously against her thigh as the numbers climbed.

The conference room doors slid open to reveal two dozen uniformed figures standing at rigid attention. "General Blackwood!" they chorused as one, their voices bouncing off the glass walls.

Evelyn's eyes darted across the assembly - white lab coats mixed with military dress uniforms, technical specialists in jumpsuits, and others wearing insignias she couldn't place. The entire defense leadership seemed present.

Liam took his position at the head of the obsidian conference table without ceremony, his expression unreadable as granite.

Adrian Castillo gently guided Evelyn to an adjacent lounge. "Mrs. Blackwood, the General has urgent matters to discuss. Please make yourself comfortable." He placed a steaming cup of coffee before her.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, watching the door close behind him.

After scrolling through her phone for twenty minutes, restlessness took hold. Why was she waiting like some obedient pet? The thought soured in her stomach along with growing hunger.

The fading sunlight painted the compound in molten gold as Evelyn slipped outside. The sprawling base stretched before her like a small city, all concrete and steel.

Hunger gnawed at her as she wandered unfamiliar paths. Despite having visited once before, the maze of identical buildings disoriented her. Shadows lengthened between the structures.

She found herself in a deserted recreation area, the basketball court's net flapping in the evening breeze. An unnatural chill ran down her spine despite the warm air.

Fumbling for her phone, Evelyn hovered over Liam's contact. But no - he was in that important meeting. She pocketed the device with a sigh.

The rustling came from behind. Evelyn whirled around, heart hammering. Darkness had fallen quickly, transforming bushes into looming shapes.

Something was wrong. She turned to retreat when a figure detached itself from the shadows.

The attack came without warning. A powerful shove sent her crashing onto the asphalt. Cold metal pressed against her collarbone.

"Help!" The scream tore from her throat as she fought against the weight pinning her down. The knife flashed downward.

Instinct made her grab the blade. White-hot pain seared through her palms as the steel bit deep.

The assailant growled, forcing the weapon downward. Evelyn twisted desperately, but the knife found its mark - a burning line across her upper chest.

As the attacker raised the blade again, Adrian's shout cut through the night. "Halt!"

The shadowy figure hesitated, then melted into the darkness between buildings.

Evelyn lay gasping, tears mixing with blood on her shirt. The stars above blurred as her body shook uncontrollably.

Pain anchored her to consciousness. That familiar terror - the brush with death - left her soul feeling scraped raw.

Adrian's panicked face appeared above her. "Mrs. Blackwood! Stay with me!" He lifted her carefully, sprinting toward the medical wing. His arms trembled around her. "Just hold on!"

She closed her eyes, clinging to his voice like a lifeline. The world narrowed to the pounding of his footsteps and her own ragged breathing.

In the sterile medical bay, Evelyn floated in a haze of antiseptic and bandages. The adrenaline crash left her mind eerily clear, replaying the attack in vivid fragments.

Then - pounding footsteps in the corridor. The door burst open with enough force to rattle the frame.

Liam stood in the doorway, chest heaving, his usually impeccable uniform disheveled. His eyes locked onto Evelyn's with an intensity that stole her breath.
###Chapter 74

Liam's expression was stormy, his eyes dark with barely contained fury. His breathing came in ragged gasps as he struggled to regain control.

Evelyn had never seen the usually composed general in such a state of distress. The sight froze her in place.

From the moment Liam burst into the hospital room, he hadn't spoken a single word.

Swallowing hard, Evelyn broke the silence first. "I should thank Adrian for arriving when he did. The doctors say I'll recover completely."

Still, Liam remained silent, his chest rising and falling rapidly beneath his uniform.

The intensity of his gaze made Evelyn shiver. An invisible aura of danger radiated from him, making the air feel thick.

Hesitantly, she raised her bandaged hands. "The attacker went for my heart with a knife. I had to block with my hands. The blade only grazed me - the doctor said it's superficial."

Liam's fists clenched at his sides, knuckles cracking ominously. The sound sent chills down Evelyn's spine.

This side of Liam terrified her.

The irony wasn't lost on her - here she was, the injured party, trying to calm her furious husband instead of receiving comfort.

Despite her attempts, his anger showed no signs of abating. Fear prickled along her skin.

Tears welled in her eyes as her voice dropped to a whisper. "I didn't mean to worry you... This wasn't my choice..."

Unable to contain himself any longer, Liam suddenly pulled her into a crushing embrace, his arms locking around her like steel bands.

Only when he felt the warmth of her body against his did his breathing begin to steady.

Evelyn gasped at the sudden contact, her hands hovering awkwardly in the air.

He'd never held her like this before - as if trying to fuse their bodies together through sheer force.

Through the thin hospital gown, she could feel every hard plane of his chest pressed against her. The contact sent her pulse racing.

Pain flared from her wound, but she bit her lip, too confused by his behavior to protest.

This level of intimacy between them felt foreign.

After what felt like an eternity, Liam's low voice rumbled near her ear. "Forgive me."

Evelyn's heart stuttered. The pain became unbearable. "Liam," she whispered, "you're hurting me."

He released her immediately, scanning her body with frantic eyes. "Where else are you injured?"

When she gestured toward her side, Liam reached for the hem of her gown.

Alarmed, Evelyn blocked his hand and recoiled. "What are you doing?"

"I need to see the damage," he insisted, his face etched with concern.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. "That's not necessary! The doctors already treated it. It's just a surface wound."

Liam pressed, "Did it affect your-"

"NO!" Evelyn cut him off, her face burning. "The doctor assured me there won't even be a scar."

The wound's proximity to more intimate areas made the conversation unbearably awkward. Recognizing this, Liam finally relented.

His voice turned deadly serious. "Spies are expected in an army of thousands. But whoever dared attack my wife on my own territory will pay with their life."

The possessive way he said "my wife" sent Evelyn's heart into a wild flutter.
###Chapter 75

Regaining his composure, Liam recognized he'd reacted too strongly. His emotions had gotten the better of him.

He rose to his feet, clearing his throat. "Tell me," he demanded in a grave tone, "what details do you recall about your attacker? Male or female?"

Evelyn furrowed her brow in concentration before shaking her head. "All black clothing - hat and mask completely concealed their face."

"Height? Build?" Liam pressed.

Before Evelyn could respond, a shrill voice cut through the tension.

"Liam! There you are!" Victoria burst into the hospital room, her eyes wide with feigned concern. "The entire place is swarming with security! What on earth happened?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, suddenly finding the hospital blanket fascinating.

Victoria's attention snapped to Evelyn, her gasp theatrically loud. "Good heavens, Evelyn! You're injured?" Her saccharine tone dripped with false sympathy. "However did this happen? Does it hurt terribly?"

"I'm fine," Evelyn replied flatly.

Turning back to Liam with exaggerated worry, Victoria pressed, "Liam darling, what's going on here?"

"An ongoing investigation," Liam answered tersely.

Victoria blinked rapidly. "Evelyn, did you anger someone important?" she inquired with faux innocence.

Evelyn's jaw tightened. "Who exactly would I have offended?"

"Oh, who knows?" Victoria trilled. "My uncle mentioned how before you ensnared Liam, you were quite... active in the dating scene. You must have stepped on plenty of toes with that attitude of yours."

Heat rose in Evelyn's cheeks, but she remained silent under Liam's watchful gaze. The humiliation burned like acid in her throat.

Victoria continued gleefully, "Perhaps it's an old flame from the base? Someone you scorned who can't bear seeing you married to our dear Liam."

Evelyn's hands clenched the sheets. "What makes you say that?"

Victoria's laugh tinkled like breaking glass. "Well, it certainly couldn't be one of Liam's enemies. Everyone knows his feelings about you. Why would they target you?"

Through gritted teeth, Evelyn managed, "Ms. Dawson, with that vivid imagination, you should consider writing fiction."

Victoria opened her mouth to retort, but Liam's expression darkened dangerously.

His hand shot out, gripping Victoria's wrist with bruising force. "Outside. Now," he growled, the barely contained fury making his voice vibrate.

Victoria winced but managed a saccharine smile at Evelyn. "Do rest well, darling. Liam and I will just—"

"Move." Liam practically dragged her from the room before she could finish.

Alone again, Evelyn pulled the blanket over her head, silent sobs wracking her body. Her past clung to her like a second skin - dirty, shameful, unworthy of a man like Liam.

What had she been thinking? A man of Liam's stature could never truly care for someone like her. The realization carved hollow spaces in her chest.

Meanwhile, Liam shoved Victoria against the corridor wall with enough force to make her gasp.

"Ow! Liam, that hurt!" Victoria whined, rubbing her wrist dramatically.

Liam paced like a caged predator, running a hand through his hair. "What the hell was that display?" he demanded through clenched teeth.

Victoria blinked innocently. "Whatever do you mean?"

"Your complete lack of basic human decency," Liam snapped. "That woman was attacked, and you're making snide remarks?"

Victoria pouted. "I was just stating facts. Everyone knows about her... colorful past."

Liam's eyes turned glacial. "One more word about Evelyn's past, and I'll have you removed from this facility. Permanently."

Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a fish. For the first time, genuine fear flickered in her eyes as she recognized the dangerous glint in Liam's gaze. This wasn't the childhood friend she could manipulate - this was Commander Blackwood in full wrath.
###Chapter 76

Liam's expression turned thunderous as fury radiated from his entire being.

"Exposing people's past mistakes, exploiting their vulnerabilities, and ridiculing them to their face - is this how you were raised to behave?"

Victoria's eyes widened with feigned innocence. "I merely suggested her attempted murder might relate to previous romantic entanglements."

His voice dropped to an arctic chill. "You could have stated that simply instead of delivering an unsolicited character assassination."

Victoria's lower lip trembled. "Liam, I know I overstepped. The words just tumbled out. Please don't be angry with me."

The blatant lie made his jaw clench. Every calculated word had been designed to wound Evelyn.

Liam seized her wrist, marching toward the field hospital exit. "I'm arranging your immediate return home. Don't come back."

Victoria dug in her heels. "Liam, I just arrived! I want to stay with you."

"Your presence isn't required."

"Let go of me!" Victoria's struggles proved useless against his iron grip.

When tears suddenly spilled down her cheeks, nearby soldiers paused mid-patrol. Wrenching free, she demanded, "Tell me truthfully - are you falling for Evelyn?"

The question struck Liam like a physical blow. His pulse stuttered with unexpected panic.

In his momentary distraction, Victoria twisted away. Backing up several paces, she wiped her face with dramatic flair. "How could you betray me like this?"

Liam's patience snapped. "What nonsense are you spouting now?"

"Since we were children, there was always something between us!" Her voice cracked theatrically. "An unspoken understanding! I've remained pure for twenty-five years, rejecting countless suitors for you!"

She continued bitterly, "And you? You married that scheming socialite just to please your grandmother. Now you're actually developing feelings for her? That innocent act is just another one of her manipulations!"

"Liam, don't you see? She ensnared every ex-lover the same way - including my uncle! He only escaped when her true nature emerged!"

The accusations sent white-hot anger coursing through Liam's veins. "Have you finished?"

Victoria's tears flowed freely now. "Why do you think I'm so harsh with Evelyn? I'm trying to protect you from her web of lies before it's too late!"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I can't bear to watch her destroy you financially, emotionally, romantically..."

An unfamiliar ache spread through Liam's chest at her words, leaving him strangely unsettled.

"I'm not in love with Evelyn. Nor will I ever be. Now go home before you cause more damage."

Before he could stop her, Victoria darted toward the barracks.

"I'll stay in my quarters and reflect!" she called over her shoulder. "You won't even know I'm here!"

Watching her retreating figure, Liam massaged his temples as a migraine began pulsing behind his eyes.

What had happened to the sweet girl he'd known before her decade abroad? Had that person completely vanished?
###Chapter 77

The silver moonlight draped the world in a hushed glow.

Only the whispering leaves disturbed the silence outside the hospital. Liam Blackwood slipped into the ward with practiced stealth.

Abigail Foster, Evelyn's caregiver, started to rise from her chair. A subtle gesture from Liam stilled her movements. Understanding immediately, she exited without a sound.

Evelyn lay sleeping, her chest rising and falling in steady rhythm. Liam settled into the chair beside her bed, his watchful gaze tracing her delicate features.

Even in sleep, her beauty shone through - porcelain skin untouched by makeup, long lashes casting shadows on her cheeks. There was an ethereal quality to her resting expression.

Evelyn possessed both remarkable resilience and extraordinary talent.

Liam struggled to reconcile this vision of innocence with the possibility of deception. Was his judgment failing him, or was Evelyn simply that skilled at concealment?

The hours slipped by unnoticed. Liam remained at her bedside until the first hints of dawn colored the sky, finally departing around 4:00 am.

When Abigail returned for the morning shift, she helped Evelyn freshen up and change into clean clothes. Breakfast arrived promptly, along with the day's medication.

Between treatments, Evelyn buried herself in books to pass the time. Yet her thoughts kept circling back to Liam's absence since she'd seen him leave hand-in-hand with Victoria.

She pretended indifference, but the weight of his absence grew heavier with each passing hour.

On the third night, a nightmare jolted Evelyn awake.

Her body trembled, sheets damp with sweat. Gasping for air, she reached blindly for the bedside table. Her fingers brushed against something unexpected - a still-warm coffee cup.

The movement caught Abigail's attention. "Mrs. Blackwood, you're awake! Would you like some water?"

"Whose coffee is this?" Evelyn sat up abruptly, staring at the steaming cup.

"General Blackwood's," Abigail replied softly.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Liam was here?"

"Mrs. Blackwood, he's come every night since your admission. Arrives around eleven and stays until nearly dawn."

The revelation struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

"General Blackwood never rests during his visits. I worried about his exhaustion, so I started making coffee," Abigail added casually.

Evelyn's pulse raced. Without thinking, she threw back the covers. "Where is he now?"

Abigail gestured toward the window. "It's nearly five. He just left."

Evelyn scrambled for her slippers and bolted for the door. Abigail grabbed a cardigan and hurried after her. "Mrs. Blackwood, please! The morning chill-"

For three days, Evelyn had believed Liam indifferent to her condition. The truth left her reeling.

Emotion overwhelmed her. She needed to see him now, needed to understand. The pre-dawn mist clung to the hospital grounds as she burst outside.

Streetlights cast pale circles on the empty pavement. A cool breeze stirred the fog, but there was no sign of Liam.

Abigail caught up, draping the cardigan over Evelyn's shoulders. "It's too early, and the fog's too thick. You'll catch cold."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes. "Abigail... does he really come every night?"

"Without fail," Abigail confirmed. "I've worked every night shift, and he's never missed a visit."

Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper. "Then why only when I'm asleep? Why not during the day?"
###Chapter 78

Abigail Foster gently rubbed Evelyn Carter's back, playing the role of a comforting mother figure.

"Mrs. Blackwood, please don't be so distressed. General Blackwood is swamped with military affairs. He's been completely immersed in reorganizing the training schedules."

"After the incident you experienced, the entire base has heightened security measures. Every soldier is being thoroughly vetted. He simply can't abandon his responsibilities during daylight hours."

"He's sacrificing his precious sleep just to stay by your side at night. Believe me, General Blackwood cares deeply about you."

Evelyn seemed to find some solace in Abigail's words. She nestled into the nurse's embrace like a child seeking comfort. "Do you truly think someone like me matters to him?"

Abigail continued her gentle patting. "Mrs. Blackwood, though we've only known each other briefly, I can see you're a wonderful person. Why would you doubt yourself?"

It appeared Evelyn had found someone to open up to. Clutching Abigail's shoulder, she confessed tearfully, "Abigail, I love him so much. What should I do?"

The nurse smiled affectionately and sighed. "Oh darling, he's your husband! Of course you love him! If you're worried about him losing sleep to care for you, why not focus on recovering faster?"

"That way you can return to the residence and General Blackwood can finally get proper rest."

"But my hand injury hasn't fully healed," Evelyn sniffled, pulling back slightly. "Returning home now would be inconvenient."

Abigail's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Your hand looks perfectly fine to me. You're managing meals without any trouble."

"Yes, but I need to keep the wound dry and I can't change the bandages alone," Evelyn explained, looking troubled.

"Oh, is that all?" Abigail chuckled. "Bathing and dressing changes only take about fifteen minutes. I'm certain General Blackwood can spare that much time for you."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink as she lowered her gaze. The thought of asking him for such intimate help overwhelmed her. She murmured shyly, "He can't possibly..."

Abigail looked surprised. "Why ever not?"

Taking Abigail's arm gently, Evelyn began leading her back toward the hospital building.

As they walked, she spoke softly, "Abigail, I want to go home. Would you come every evening to help me with bathing and dressing changes? I'll pay you extra."

"But my salary comes from General Blackwood. It wouldn't be proper to accept additional payment," Abigail protested.

"Does that mean you agree?" Evelyn asked hopefully.

"Mrs. Blackwood, if you don't wish to trouble the General, then it's only right that I assist you," Abigail conceded.

Evelyn couldn't contain her joy. Her heart already raced at the thought of returning to Liam. "Thank you so much, Abigail."

At first light, Evelyn packed her belongings excitedly. She changed into her own clothes and hurried back to the military residence.

Approaching the building, she noticed armed guards stationed at the entrance - security had indeed been tightened. Recognizing her, the soldiers saluted respectfully and let her pass.

Reaching the apartment door, Evelyn took a deep breath before entering the code and pushing it open.

Inside, she found Liam in the process of buttoning his crisp dress shirt, his chest still partially exposed. Her sudden entrance clearly startled him.

Evelyn's face burned as her gaze inadvertently lingered on his bare skin.

Flustered, she immediately lowered her head and turned away, awkwardly closing the door behind her.

With her back to Liam, Evelyn felt a heavy weight in her chest realizing he'd only rested two hours before preparing for work again.

Regaining his composure, Liam continued fastening his buttons before breaking the silence. "Why have you returned?"

"I'm better now," Evelyn replied, slowly turning to face him.

With only two buttons secured, Liam approached and gently took her injured hand. "Has the wound scabbed over yet?"
###Chapter 79

Liam's presence enveloped Evelyn as he drew near, his masculine scent mingling with the faint aroma of his shampoo.

Her pulse quickened unexpectedly, fingers twitching with the sudden urge to withdraw.

But Liam captured her hand firmly, unwinding the gauze to inspect the injury. The sutures remained intact on her palm, the wound still raw without any signs of healing.

His expression darkened instantly.

A pang of guilt shot through Evelyn, making her attempt to pull away, but Liam's grip only tightened.

With meticulous care, he rewrapped the dressing before casually suggesting, "This needs to stay dry. I could assist with bathing and changing bandages. What do you think?"

Heat flooded her cheeks as she murmured, "Abigail's already helping me."

"Just say the word if you need anything. And don't leave the manor until we apprehend the suspect. If you must go anywhere, inform me first - I'll arrange security," Liam advised, his voice laced with concern.

Warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest as she watched his skilled fingers secure the bandage. She found herself wishing the gauze could stretch endlessly between them.

"Are you leaving?" Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet his. The way he'd bent his head in concentration while tending to her wound had cast some inexplicable spell over her.

"Soon," came his deep, velvety response.

"You've barely slept two hours. Aren't you exhausted?"

Liam paused, only now understanding why she'd appeared so soon. Releasing her hand, he turned away to finish buttoning his shirt.

"I'm not that fragile."

"But you're not invincible either. Even machines need maintenance," Evelyn countered stubbornly.

With effortless grace, Liam shrugged into his cardigan, the simple action making Evelyn's breath catch.

He moved to the nightstand, collecting his phone and watch before retrieving a handgun from the drawer and securing it at his waist.

Evelyn stood motionless, absorbing every precise movement. When he finally turned to leave, he paused to gently ruffle her hair.

"Rest. Call if you need me."

The moment the door closed behind him, an odd emptiness settled in Evelyn's chest. Liam had barely departed, yet she already ached for his return.

Benjamin Hart arrived at headquarters to collect payment for the hydronium sale.

After Liam signed the necessary documents, finance handed Benjamin a ten-million-dollar check.

Tears welled in the older man's eyes as he stared at the check. "My wife... she'll get the treatment now."

Liam approached Benjamin. "Dr. Hart, your decades at Solterra have given you unparalleled expertise. How would you like to join Aldenria's premier military research facility?"

Benjamin gaped at Liam, taking several moments before responding, "At my age? You'd really have me at the nation's top armory?"

"Skill knows no age. Your capabilities are what matter to me," Liam stated firmly.

Removing his glasses, Benjamin wiped his eyes. "General Blackwood, I won't disappoint you. I'll dedicate everything to Aldenria's defense."

Liam leaned casually against the desk, hands in pockets.

"One more question." His brow furrowed. "Why does hydronium evaporate upon air exposure?"

Benjamin sighed, replacing his glasses with a grave expression.

"The compound's inherently unstable. Only Cassandra Wright truly understands its properties. Weaponizing it... that's impossible without her knowledge."
###Chapter 80

"I trust you and Dr. Reynolds from Aldenria can collaborate to resolve this issue and unlock hydronium's full potential," Liam said.

Benjamin nodded earnestly, though internally, he wasn't confident.

At noon, Adrian walked into the cafeteria, tray in hand.

Unsure of Evelyn's preferences, he decided to sample a bit of everything. The tray quickly piled high with enough food to last days.

As Adrian turned to leave, he nearly collided with Liam and Ryan.

"General Blackwood, good afternoon," Adrian greeted.

Liam gave a curt nod in acknowledgment.

Ryan eyed the overflowing tray and smirked. "Hungry much? Planning to feed an army?"

Adrian shrugged. "Had no idea what Mrs. Blackwood likes, so I grabbed options. Didn’t realize the portions were this generous."

Ryan chuckled. "Judging by Mrs. Blackwood’s figure, she probably sticks to salads and lean proteins—definitely not this carb overload."

Adrian shoved the tray toward Ryan. "Since you’re the expert, you handle her meals from now on."

Ryan hesitated, but before he could take it, Liam smoothly intercepted the tray.

"I’ll take care of it," Liam stated, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Both men gaped. The idea of their commanding general playing delivery boy was absurd.

"Sir, I’ve got this," Ryan blurted.

Adrian reached for the tray. "General, we were joking. I’ll learn her preferences—"

Liam ignored them, grabbing utensils before striding out.

Ryan and Adrian stood frozen, watching their general disappear down the hall.

Ryan turned to Adrian, baffled. "Did he just… personally deliver lunch?"

Adrian nodded slowly. "Yeah. Yeah, he did."

Ryan frowned. "Since when does General Blackwood do errands?"

"Maybe he wanted to see her."

"You think he’s into Mrs. Blackwood?"

Adrian smirked. "Can you blame him? She’s charming, witty—nothing like that manipulative childhood friend of his."

Ryan groaned. "Ugh, Victoria. That fake baby voice and constant waterworks? I’d rather listen to nails on a chalkboard."

Adrian slung an arm around Ryan’s shoulders. "Exactly. If Liam wanted her, he’d have married her years ago. Now come on—we’ve got a mole to catch, drills to prep, and paperwork taller than you."

Ryan groaned again. "Right. Let’s eat first—I need fuel for this nightmare."
###Chapter 81

The door hinges groaned as it swung open, startling Evelyn from her novel.

Her eyes widened when she saw Liam stepping inside with a tray of food.

"You're delivering meals now?" Evelyn rose from her bed, setting her book aside.

"Adrian was busy so I volunteered." Liam's deep voice resonated through the quiet room.

He arranged the dishes meticulously on the table before casually checking the nightstand drawer. Finding nothing of interest, he shut it with a quiet click.

Evelyn's breath caught at the mountain of food before her. The portions could feed three people easily.

Liam's lips curved as he approached. "Consider it Adrian's way of apologizing for yesterday's incident."

She bit her lip, giving him a helpless look. "This is too much. I'll never finish all this alone."

His expression turned serious. "Wasting food is unacceptable."

Evelyn blinked, taken aback by his stern tone.

After an awkward pause, she gestured to the empty chair. "Have you eaten yet?"

"Not yet." Liam deliberately checked his watch.

Evelyn pushed the silverware toward him eagerly. "Please join me. There's more than enough."

After a brief hesitation, Liam accepted the utensils and settled into the chair.

Evelyn started to rise. "Let me find another set of—"

His hand closed around her wrist, warm and firm. "This is fine. We can share."

Her pulse jumped at the contact. "O-okay."

Liam's gaze dropped to her bandaged fingers. "Need assistance?"

She quickly scooped up some scrambled eggs. "I can manage."

As she ate, Liam watched with quiet satisfaction before joining her. He shifted closer to accommodate the shared tray, his movements graceful yet purposeful.

The silence between them grew thick. Evelyn picked at her food self-consciously, hyperaware of his presence.

Noticing her hesitation, Liam wrapped a chicken leg in a napkin and placed it before her.

Evelyn stared at the massive portion with dismay.

"Eat." His command brooked no argument.

She shook her head. "I'm not really—"

"You need protein to heal." His tone softened. "Unless you'd prefer I feed you?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. "It's just...too big."

Liam pressed the drumstick into her hand. "Eat what you can. I'll finish the rest."

Resigned, she took a small bite. "Isn't this...unhygienic?"

Liam set down his fork with a clink. He leaned in suddenly, closing the distance between them.

Evelyn froze, the chicken halfway to her mouth.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he murmured, eyes glinting with amusement. "We've shared far more intimate things than a meal. Why the hesitation now?"

Her entire body flushed scarlet. The drumstick trembled in her grip as she ducked her head to take another bite.

Liam chuckled, brushing a thumb across her heated cheek. "You're blushing."

"N-no I'm not." The lie came out breathless.

Deciding to spare her further embarrassment, Liam returned to his meal. To her surprise, Evelyn found herself finishing the entire piece of chicken.

When she set down the bone, sticky fingers hovering uncertainly, Liam disappeared into the bathroom. He returned with a damp cloth and gently cleaned each of her fingers.

Evelyn watched, mesmerized by his unexpected tenderness.

A quiet laugh escaped him as she chewed, her cheeks puffing adorably.

"Something on my face?" she asked around a mouthful.

Liam wiped a nonexistent smudge from her chin. "All clean now."

"Thank you," she mumbled.

He handed her a clean fork. "Have some more."

"I'm full."

After a beat, Liam pushed the vegetable dish toward her. "I don't care for greens. Help me with these?"

Evelyn's heart skipped. This felt strangely domestic. "Alright."

She speared some broccoli, the earlier awkwardness fading. Somehow, finishing that chicken in front of him had broken some invisible barrier between them.

The quiet companionship felt...nice. Surprisingly so.
###Chapter 82

The delightful dinner eventually came to an end.

After finishing their meal, Liam instructed Evelyn to rest while he carried the empty tray downstairs.

Outside the dormitory, Ryan and Adrian spotted General Blackwood descending with the used dishes.

Ryan nudged Adrian's elbow. "The General took quite some time with that meal."

"Perhaps Ms. Carter enjoys savoring her food slowly," Adrian suggested quietly.

"He seems unusually relaxed today."

As Liam approached them, Adrian muttered, "That's about to change."

Liam stopped before his subordinates.

"General Blackwood," they greeted simultaneously.

His expression darkened as he handed over the tray. "Wash this thoroughly."

"Yes, sir."

Adrian carried the tray while walking beside Ryan, both trailing behind their commanding officer.

"Any progress on identifying the perpetrator?" Liam demanded in his characteristic stern tone.

"We've narrowed it down to twelve potential suspects. The investigation remains ongoing," Ryan reported.

"What about the research project?" Liam continued as they walked.

"We've hit multiple obstacles. Even Dr. Hart, our newest team member, is struggling with the calculations," Ryan admitted.

Liam's face clouded over as he quickened his pace. "Has the lightspeed bullet program been repaired?"

"The system keeps getting hacked by an unknown source. Progress is moving at a snail's pace."

"When's the scheduled drill?"

Ryan hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. "Well..."

Liam's patience was wearing thin. Each unresolved issue felt like another weight pressing on his shoulders.

"Out with it," he snapped.

"We received orders from command. The drill's postponed indefinitely after explosives were discovered at the site." Ryan's voice carried clear disappointment.

Liam stopped abruptly, his broad shoulders visibly tense under the burden of responsibility. Both subordinates recognized their General's mounting pressures but could offer little relief.

Adrian cleared his throat nervously. "General Blackwood, there's one more matter requiring your attention."

After the string of bad news, one more problem hardly seemed to matter.

"Speak," Liam commanded.

"Ms. Dawson visited the research facility again. She had... altercations with several professors. It escalated to the point where..." Adrian trailed off.

Liam pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling sharply. Victoria's constant disruptions were becoming intolerable.

"What happened?" he demanded through gritted teeth.

"She struck Dr. Reynolds in the eye with a glass bottle."

Liam's hands clenched into fists. Among all his pressing concerns, Victoria's childish outbursts were the most infuriating.

"Restrain her and arrange immediate transport back to Aldenria," he ordered angrily.

Adrian swallowed hard before explaining, "General, Ms. Dawson anticipated your reaction. She's gone into hiding. We haven't located her yet."

The thought of Victoria's arrogant presumption made Liam's blood boil. He stormed toward the office building, his subordinates scrambling to keep pace.

Night had fallen when the wall clock chimed 11:55 pm.

Evelyn fought against heavy eyelids. Abigail had helped her with evening medications and prepared her for bed hours ago, but sleep remained elusive.

Her thoughts kept circling back to Liam - worrying about his relentless work schedule and its toll on his health. The concerns kept her wide awake despite her exhaustion.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. Evelyn sprang from bed and rushed to the entrance, flinging the door open with hopeful anticipation.
###Chapter 83

It was Adrian.

He handed Evelyn a steaming cup of chamomile tea. "Mrs. Blackwood, you should rest. General Blackwood mentioned he might be working late tonight."

Evelyn accepted the ceramic mug, her fingers brushing against the warmth. A pang of disappointment twisted in her chest. "Thank you," she murmured.

"Of course."

She stared at the swirling steam before asking, "How did you know I was still up?"

Adrian shifted uncomfortably. "I wasn't spying, I swear. The General noticed your lights were still on from his office. He asked me to check on you."

Evelyn's breath caught. She stepped back from the balcony railing. "Liam can see my apartment from his office?"

Wiping his brow, Adrian explained, "The military headquarters has a direct line of sight to the officer's quarters. When every other window went dark hours ago..." He trailed off meaningfully.

A small smile tugged at Evelyn's lips. The thought of Liam watching over her sent warmth through her body that rivaled the tea. She clutched the mug tighter, torn between wanting him home and knowing his work was important.

"Adrian," she ventured carefully, "what exactly is keeping Liam so busy?"

The lieutenant hesitated. "The training exercises were canceled due to... complications. And Ms. Dawson caused another incident that required damage control."

At Victoria's name, Evelyn's grip tightened on the mug.

She couldn't understand why Liam continued cleaning up after that woman's messes. The leniency bordered on indulgence.

Adrian continued cautiously, "There are details I can't share, Mrs. Blackwood. But between the canceled drills and the Azurium crisis..." He rubbed his temples. "Just yesterday, Ms. Dawson contaminated an entire batch. Eighty million dollars' worth, ruined in seconds."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up.

"We managed to secure replacement materials," Adrian continued, "but they arrived pre-contaminated. Now the entire research team is working around the clock trying to purify it. If they can't..." He shook his head. "We'll have to purchase more or send it overseas for processing. General Blackwood—"

"Wait." Evelyn downed the rest of her tea in one gulp. Setting the mug down with a clink, she grabbed a sweater from the back of a chair.

Adrian blinked. "Mrs. Blackwood?"

"I know how to purify Azurium." She shrugged into the sweater and flipped off the lights. "Take me to the lab."

Adrian scrambled after her as she marched toward the door. "With all due respect, our top scientists have been working on this for a week. How could you—"

Evelyn cut him off with a determined stride. "I don't know how I know. But when you described the problem, the solution just... appeared in my mind." She turned fierce eyes on him. "Don't you think it's worth trying?"

Adrian remembered the poisoning incident months ago - how Evelyn had improvised an antidote when trained medics froze. Even Dr. Reynolds had been impressed by her instincts.

Without another word, he followed her to the car. As they sped toward military headquarters, Evelyn stared out the window, her mind racing with chemical equations she couldn't possibly know.

But one thought burned brighter than all others: Tonight, she would lift this burden from Liam's shoulders. Whatever the cost.
###Chapter 84

The research facility hummed with activity even in the dead of night.

Evelyn Carter's sudden appearance in pajamas and a cardigan sent a ripple of surprise through the room. Liam Blackwood's expression darkened as he approached her.

"Didn't I tell you to rest?" His voice was sharp, but concern flickered beneath the sternness.

"Is the sample in Research Building Five?" Evelyn asked urgently, ignoring his question.

Liam frowned. "What's going on?"

She met his gaze, her voice low but determined. "Adrian mentioned you couldn't purify the Azurium. I want to try."

Liam's glare shifted to Adrian, who immediately shrank back, guilt written all over his face. Instead of ensuring Evelyn rested, he had spilled their struggles, riling her up.

"You think you can do it?" Liam asked, skepticism lacing his tone.

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. "I know the methods, but I can't promise it'll work. You've been stuck for a week—let me try."

His eyes dropped to her bandaged hands. "With those?"

She gave an awkward smile. "Or, if you're feeling generous, I wouldn't say no to two assistants."

Despite the exhaustion weighing on him, Liam felt an unexpected lightness at her persistence. The impossible suddenly seemed a little less daunting.

"How long will this take?" he asked.

She shrugged. "No idea."

He checked his watch. "It's late. Rest first. We'll try tomorrow."

"I'm already here," she countered stubbornly.

The onlookers gaped. The usually unyielding General Blackwood was negotiating—calmly—with a woman in pajamas.

Liam turned to Ryan. "Call Dr. Reynolds. Get two assistants prepped and ready for another round."

Ryan nodded and hurried off.

Taking Evelyn's hand, Liam led her out, the team trailing behind. The convoy sped toward Research Building Five.

Dr. Ethan Reynolds was already waiting, his face lighting up when he saw Evelyn.

"Mrs. Blackwood! It's you?"

She nodded politely. "Hello, Dr. Reynolds."

His smile faltered when he noticed her injuries. "Your hands—"

"Minor," she dismissed. "I just need help with the finer work."

Just then, Benjamin Hart adjusted his glasses, studying her. "Aren't you the woman who synthesized Delphius on the cruise?"

Ethan nudged him. "That's Mrs. Blackwood."

Benjamin paled. "Apologies, ma'am."

She waved it off. "Dr. Hart, right? Perfect. You two can assist me."

Ethan gestured. "This way, Mrs. Blackwood."

There was a quiet confidence in her movements now, a stark contrast to her usual hesitance about her past. Liam watched, intrigued, until Ryan murmured, "Sir... do you really think she can do it?"

Liam exhaled. "After a week of failure, what's one more attempt?"

"But if she ruins the sample like Victoria did—"

"She won't." His certainty silenced further doubts.

The research building buzzed with murmurs—some dismissive, others curious. Liam ignored them, settling into a chair to wait.

Thirty minutes later, the elevator doors slid open. Ethan rushed out, trembling with excitement.

"General Blackwood—we did it! It's pure!"

Liam's eyes snapped open. For a second, he wondered if he'd dreamed it. But the exhilaration around him was real.

Ryan and Adrian nearly tackled Ethan in their excitement. "You're serious? It worked?"

Ethan nodded wildly. "Mrs. Blackwood cracked it in half an hour. She even isolated two rare derivatives and outlined potential applications—"

Adrian cut him off. "Point is, we succeeded. Now maybe we can sleep."

The room erupted in stunned chatter.

Liam stood slowly, his chest tight with something he couldn't name.

Evelyn had done the impossible.

Again.
###Chapter 85

The scientists and researchers were utterly stunned.

Several professors fumbled for their phones, frantically searching: "How many people have successfully extracted pure Azurium?"

One chemistry professor rushed to Liam, his voice trembling with excitement. "General Blackwood, my research shows fewer than ten individuals worldwide have achieved this."

"Moreover," he continued, adjusting his glasses, "it's classified technology in advanced nations. They're profiting from this knowledge while keeping it strictly guarded."

Liam's sharp gaze focused. "Names?"

"The sources don't disclose identities," the professor admitted, wiping his brow.

Evelyn's demonstration left the room electrified. Executives swarmed Liam, firing questions like bullets.

"How is Mrs. Blackwood more skilled than our top Aldenrian scientists?"

"General, where did your wife acquire such advanced techniques?"

"She solved the Azurium poisoning last time too. This can't be coincidence - she must have hidden credentials!"

Liam's jaw tightened. "You're asking me? Who should I ask?"

"But-"

"Enough." His command sliced through the chatter. "We've achieved a breakthrough. Everyone, get some rest."

As the crowd dispersed, murmurs still filled the air.

The elevator dinged. Evelyn emerged, her movements graceful despite her injuries.

Before Liam could reach her, the scientists mobbed Evelyn like starstruck fans.

These normally reserved academics transformed into eager students, their eyes alight with curiosity.

Evelyn answered each question patiently, her humility disarming. The exchange grew more animated by the minute.

Liam exchanged a glance with Adrian. Understanding immediately, Adrian intervened.

"Professors, it's late. Mrs. Blackwood needs rest for her recovery. Perhaps continue this discussion when she's recovered?"

Reluctant goodnights followed. The scholars escorted Evelyn out respectfully.

The car ride passed in heavy silence. Neither spoke.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Liam removed his jacket, selecting sleepwear from the wardrobe.

"Rest now," he said softly before heading to the shower.

Evelyn perched nervously on the bed's edge. While others celebrated, Liam's demeanor had grown increasingly somber.

She sensed his suspicion mounting again.

As Liam reached the bathroom door, Evelyn's voice stopped him cold.

"Liam Blackwood."

He froze, back still turned.

Fingers tracing her bandages, she whispered, "Are you angry?"

He turned slowly, meeting her gaze. "You always use my full name. I'm your husband - shouldn't that bother me?"

Evelyn blinked, then shook her head. "Not that. I meant... about the Azurium."
###Chapter 86

Liam approached Evelyn with an intense gaze that sent shivers down her spine.

Without warning, he leaned in closer.

Evelyn instinctively recoiled, losing her balance and tumbling backward onto the bed. Her heart pounded violently against her ribs.

Liam kneeled on the mattress, caging her between his arms as he stared down at her.

His masculine scent enveloped Evelyn, making her breathing uneven. A mix of nervousness and confusion swirled within her.

"Tell me, darling," Liam murmured with dangerous playfulness, "Do you prefer to be on top or beneath me?"

"That's not what I meant at all!" Evelyn's face drained of color. Why did his teasing words carry such underlying seriousness?

"You've been... distant ever since I left the lab." Evelyn swallowed hard. "You barely speak to me anymore."

Liam's lips curved into a smirk. "The successful extraction of pure Azurium saved me millions and advanced our technology. Why wouldn't I be pleased?"

"Then is it my identity you doubt again?" Evelyn challenged. "Is that why you're acting this way?"

"My doubts about you never ceased," Liam hummed in response.

Evelyn frowned, shooting him a displeased look while trying to decipher his expression.

Seeing her distress, Liam softened his tone. "Stop overthinking. I'm not unhappy. Quite the opposite—I'm thrilled. But I need time to process everything you've revealed, understand?"

Evelyn shook her head in confusion.

"No matter. Get some rest." Liam gestured to the clock. "It's already one in the morning."

Evelyn sighed. "I can't sleep."

Liam's eyes darkened with promise. "Perhaps some... physical activity would help tire you out? After I shower?"

Evelyn immediately squeezed her eyes shut, cheeks flaming. "I'm exhausted."

Liam's lips pressed into a thin line as he stood, frustration evident in his movements. Her constant rejections stung—who was she saving herself for?

The sound of running water filled the room as Liam showered. When he returned, the lights were off and Evelyn appeared asleep. He slipped into bed, maintaining careful distance between them.

Previously, sharing a bed with Evelyn hadn't affected him. Now, his desire for her grew more unbearable each night.

Another sleepless night awaited him.

Morning sunlight streaming through the curtains roused Evelyn from sleep.

She rubbed her eyes, blinking away sleep's remnants. The other side of the bed lay empty, sheets neatly folded.

Without Liam's presence, an odd emptiness settled in Evelyn's chest—an unpleasant sensation she couldn't shake.

After completing her morning routine and changing from pajamas, Evelyn left the room, her hair cascading freely over her shoulders.

She nearly collided with Victoria, who leaned casually against the hallway wall.

Victoria crossed her arms, exuding confidence and authority.

Evelyn regarded her with wary curiosity.

Victoria clicked her tongue mockingly. "Impressive. You're the camp's newest celebrity."

Evelyn ignored the barb. "He's not here if that's who you're waiting for."

Victoria snorted. "Who said I wanted Liam? I was waiting for you."

Evelyn froze.

Victoria seeking her out? Nothing good could come from this. Evelyn braced herself for whatever schemes the other woman might have concocted.
###Chapter 87

Evelyn shot Victoria a frosty glare. "What do you want?"

Victoria shrugged with fake innocence. "Just curious when you'll finally sign those divorce papers for Liam."

Brushing past her, Evelyn kept her voice steady. "There won't be any divorce."

With a mocking laugh, Victoria blocked Evelyn's path again. "Do you honestly believe you deserve to stand beside him? Look at yourself. You're nothing but an embarrassment to the Blackwood name. Liam's heart belongs to me. You're just the unwanted third wheel."

Evelyn took a calming breath before responding. "Three years ago, Margaret demanded Liam marry me. He chose to wait for your return instead."

Victoria's confident smirk faltered.

"Yet," Evelyn continued, "a full year passed between your return and our wedding. If he loved you, why didn't he marry you then? Why choose me instead?"

"That's—" Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a fish.

"Because he never intended to marry you," Evelyn finished for her.

Victoria stomped her designer heel. "Lies!"

"If he still loved you, he would've divorced me by now," Evelyn pointed out logically.

Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Has he ever said he loves you?"

"No," Evelyn admitted truthfully, just wanting this conversation to end.

A triumphant gleam lit Victoria's eyes. "Exactly. No man wants damaged goods."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. Why was she even entertaining this childish exchange? Arguing with Victoria was exhausting.

Turning on her heel, Evelyn marched toward the elevator.

Victoria followed like a persistent shadow.

Inside the confined space, Evelyn pressed the lobby button, staring fixedly at the descending numbers.

Victoria leaned casually against the mirrored wall, her eyes glinting dangerously. "Running somewhere?"

Evelyn remained silent.

"Can't stand being alone?" Victoria taunted. "Going to find some random man to comfort you?"

Evelyn's fists clenched until her healing palm wound throbbed. "Watch your mouth, Victoria. Don't test me."

Victoria arched a perfectly plucked brow. "Truth hurts, doesn't it?"

Evelyn felt white-hot anger rising.

For someone from high society, Victoria possessed shockingly poor manners. Her arrogance knew no bounds.

The elevator dinged open and Evelyn rushed out, crossing the marble lobby with quick strides.

Suddenly, Victoria grabbed Evelyn's arm, pulling her close to whisper something vicious.

Evelyn's face drained of color. Enough was enough. Her hand flew through the air, connecting with Victoria's cheek in a sharp crack.

The sound echoed through the grand lobby.

Pain shot through Evelyn's reopened wound. Tears pricked her eyes as she trembled with rage.

Instead of anger, Victoria wore a victorious smirk.

That expression sent chills down Evelyn's spine. She turned and practically ran toward the exit.

Victoria gave chase like a predator.

Evelyn burst through the glass doors onto the front steps. At the bottom stood two uniformed soldiers, their backs to her.
###Chapter 88

In a flash, Victoria materialized before Evelyn. With calculated precision, she seized Evelyn's wrist and dramatically flung herself backward.

"Help!" Victoria shrieked as she tumbled down the staircase. Her body collided with the marble statue at the base with a sickening thud.

Crimson blood immediately gushed from Victoria's temple.

"Murder!" she wailed, crawling toward the guards with theatrical terror. "Save me! Evelyn's trying to kill me!"

The soldiers rushed to assist Victoria while gaping at Evelyn in stunned silence.

Evelyn stood frozen. Was Victoria framing her again?

She recognized Victoria's manipulative patterns. But this time, the scheming woman had taken it to dangerous extremes.

Clutching her bleeding forehead, Victoria trembled behind the protective wall of soldiers. "Call the police!" she sobbed pathetically. "Evelyn's attempting to murder me!"

A crowd quickly gathered around the spectacle.

Everyone recognized Evelyn but dared not confront her directly or summon authorities.

Meanwhile, in a speeding vehicle, Adrian ended his phone call with grim urgency.

He turned to Liam in the backseat. "General Blackwood, urgent situation. Ms. Carter is in trouble."

Liam snapped his documents shut. "Explain."

"Ms. Carter allegedly assaulted Ms. Dawson. Now Ms. Dawson demands police intervention," Adrian reported.

Liam's fist clenched, his expression darkening. "Turn us around."

Adrian checked the time. "But sir—"

"Now." Liam's voice carried lethal calm.

"Yes, General." No one disobeyed Liam Blackwood's orders.

The thirty-minute journey condensed to fifteen as they raced back to base.

A tense standoff unfolded outside the dormitories.

Two armed factions faced off—soldiers in black tactical gear shielding Evelyn while police in brown uniforms prepared to make an arrest.

Officer Damian Reeves sneered, "Know your place! National defense is your job. Criminal investigations are ours."

The soldiers stood firm. "Without General Blackwood's direct order, no one touches Ms. Carter."

Victoria stomped her foot in frustration. "Are you blind? I'm the one Liam loves! We grew up together—we're practically family! You should be protecting me from this murderer!"

The soldiers ignored her protests. "Our orders are clear—protect Ms. Carter at all costs."

Evelyn felt both protected and overwhelmed by their loyalty.

Damian assessed Victoria's injury and the soldiers' defiance. Annoyance twisted his features.

"Anyone resisting arrest will face additional charges," he declared.

Police officers cocked their weapons in unison.

"Secure Ms. Carter," the soldiers commanded, forming an impenetrable shield around Evelyn as they retreated.

Damian growled, "You're not going anywhere."

The lead soldier warned, "General Blackwood will have your badge if you lay one finger on Ms. Carter."

Damian scoffed, puffing out his chest. "I've always found Blackwood insufferable. This is my jurisdiction. Lawbreakers face consequences—no exceptions."

Tension crackled in the air like live electricity.

Then a voice like thunder split the standoff: "Who dares threaten what's mine?"
###Chapter 89

All heads snapped toward the commanding voice.

Liam Blackwood stormed forward, his military boots striking the marble floor with thunderous purpose. His trusted lieutenants - Ryan Sullivan and Adrian Castillo - followed closely behind, their expressions mirroring their commander's fury.

"General Blackwood!" The soldiers immediately straightened their postures, their weapons held at perfect attention. The mere presence of their leader reinvigorated their resolve.

Evelyn Carter had remained composed throughout the confrontation, but the moment her eyes met Liam's, her carefully maintained facade cracked. Tears welled up in her hazel eyes, her fingers trembling at her sides.

Her mind raced with chaotic thoughts. False accusations meant nothing. Strangers' opinions didn't matter. But the possibility of Liam's misunderstanding - that terrified her beyond measure.

Liam stood like an immovable force before Damian Reeves, his broad shoulders casting a shadow over the police officer. The sheer intensity of his presence made Damian unconsciously take half a step back.

Damian cleared his throat. "General Blackwood, we have a clear case of attempted assault here. I'm simply performing my duty to arrest the perpetrator. Order your men to stand down and hand her over."

Liam's icy gaze shifted to Victoria Dawson, who stood trembling beside the officer.

Victoria seized the opportunity, her voice breaking with theatrical sobs. "Liam! She tried to kill me! You've always stood for justice - you can't protect a criminal!"

With a single motion, Liam extended his arm, stopping Victoria's advance by pressing his palm against her forehead. His darkening expression made her recoil instantly.

Ryan and Adrian moved with military precision, intercepting Victoria and pulling her back.

"You don't understand!" Victoria wailed. "She's dangerous! You can't let your personal feelings cloud your judgment!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but the words caught in her throat. How could she articulate the truth when Victoria's silver tongue twisted every fact?

Damian smirked. "Justice must be served impartially, General. That's why I must take her into custody today."

Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Victoria Dawson, drop these charges. Now."

Victoria wiped her tears dramatically. "I can't! Not when my life was in danger! She belongs behind bars!"

"That's not what happened," Evelyn finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper but carrying undeniable conviction.

Liam turned toward her, his stern expression softening slightly at the sight of her tear-filled eyes. The mixture of defiance and vulnerability in her gaze struck him deeply.

In the past, Liam would have moved heaven and earth to protect Victoria. She'd been his childhood companion, his responsibility. But now... now his protective instincts had shifted entirely toward Evelyn.

"Ryan," Liam commanded without breaking eye contact with Evelyn, "pull the surveillance footage."

Before Ryan could respond, Damian interjected, "I've already reviewed the tapes. They clearly show Ms. Carter pushing Ms. Dawson in the lobby. Unfortunately, the cameras at the entrance seem to be malfunctioning."

"Malfunctioning?" Liam's laugh held no humor. "There are no technical failures under my command."

Damian blinked in confusion.

Liam continued sharply, "Ryan, summon the IT team immediately. With full diagnostic equipment."

"On it, sir." Ryan turned on his heel and disappeared down the corridor.

"Adrian," Liam called next.

"At your service, General." Adrian stepped forward smartly.

"Fetch me a chair."

Adrian nodded and departed with military efficiency.

Damian forced a smile. "That's unnecessary, General. I'm perfectly comfortable standing while we-"

Liam ignored him completely.

When Adrian returned with an ornate chair, Damian attempted to sit, only for Liam to take the seat himself. The police officer's face flushed with embarrassment.

"This isn't about your comfort," Liam said coldly, crossing his legs as he settled into the chair like a king holding court. "We're going to get to the bottom of this. Properly."
###Chapter 90

Liam let out a thoughtful hum. "Bring a chair for Evelyn."

Adrian nodded immediately. "Right away, sir."

Victoria blinked rapidly, her mouth slightly agape.

Rosalind gasped as Adrian carried the chair toward Evelyn with surprising gentleness. He even adjusted it for her before she sat down. Evelyn herself seemed taken aback by the courtesy.

Victoria stomped her designer shoe in frustration. "Liam! I'm the injured party here! Have you no compassion?"

Liam didn't even glance her way.

Within minutes, a team of IT specialists arrived with their equipment. They efficiently set up their workstation and connected to the projection system, beginning the process of recovering the surveillance footage.

Ryan approached Rosalind with visible pride. "Our military base has the finest tech team in all of Aldenria. They can crack the most sophisticated encryption systems - retrieving some security footage is child's play to them."

Victoria's confidence began to waver. She pressed a hand to her forehead dramatically and leaned against a nearby soldier. "Liam darling, I feel faint. The pain is unbearable. Won't you please take me to the hospital?"

Liam remained as unmovable as a marble statue.

The lead technician soon announced, "General Blackwood, we've successfully recovered the footage. It's ready for viewing."

"Project it," Liam commanded.

The white lobby wall illuminated with the video playback. The timestamp showed the dimly lit corridor where Evelyn and Victoria had exited the elevator moments before the incident.

The footage clearly showed Victoria clinging to Evelyn's arm, whispering something in her ear. Evelyn suddenly turned and slapped Victoria across the face.

Victoria immediately burst into theatrical tears, pointing an accusing finger. "See how vicious she is? She attacked me without provocation!"

Gasps rippled through the gathered crowd.

Only Liam remained stone-faced, his gaze fixed on Evelyn's bandaged hand. A muscle twitched in his jaw.

That strike must have reopened her wound. Was she in pain?

The last time he'd seen her strike someone was when Dominic had betrayed her.

The video continued to the crucial moment at the stairwell. The crowd watched as Evelyn appeared to push Victoria down the short flight of stairs.

Victoria pointed triumphantly at the screen. "There! The evidence speaks for itself! She deliberately pushed me! Even if it was only six steps, that's clearly assault! She should face criminal charges!"

Damian cleared his throat smugly as he approached Liam. "Well, General? Care to comment?"

Liam had nothing to say to the officer.

Instead, he turned to the technicians. "Rewind and play it again in slow motion."

Victoria's face flushed with anger. "What are you trying to pull, Liam?"

Evelyn sat stiffly in her chair, unconsciously picking at her bandage as she watched the screen.

No one dared disobey Liam's command.

The footage replayed frame by frame.

Every subtle movement became painfully clear.

The crowd's murmurs grew louder with each passing second.

Damian's confident smirk faltered, replaced by visible discomfort.

The slowed footage revealed the truth: Victoria had grabbed Evelyn's wrist and used it to propel herself down the stairs. The manipulation was undeniable.
###Chapter 91

Victoria's face drained of color as confusion twisted her features.

The crowd erupted in murmurs when they realized Evelyn had been falsely accused. Their angry gazes turned toward Victoria like daggers.

Victoria rushed to Liam's side, clutching his arm desperately. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she pleaded, "Liam, please let me explain."

Liam shook her off violently. "Save your explanations for Inspector Reeves."

"It wasn't intentional, Liam!" Victoria sobbed hysterically.

"Ryan, remove her," Liam commanded coldly before turning away.

Evelyn rose slowly, her eyes filled with gratitude and longing as she watched Liam's retreating figure.

He disappeared as quickly as he'd appeared, leaving Evelyn no chance to thank him.

Ryan approached Damian with military precision. "Inspector Reeves, please take the woman who falsely accused Mrs. Blackwood into custody and vacate the premises immediately."

Victoria ran to Ryan, tears staining her cheeks. "Ryan, please! Tell Liam to give me one more chance!"

Ryan's expression hardened. "Ms. Dawson, General Blackwood already gave you the opportunity to drop this. You chose to waste it."

Victoria opened her mouth but no words came out.

Damien scowled and barked, "Fall back!"

Within moments, all police officers lowered their weapons and withdrew.

Ryan called after them pointedly, "Inspector Reeves! Don't forget to take Ms. Dawson with you."

Damien turned back with a scowl, grabbing Victoria's arm roughly. "You're coming to the station."

Victoria shot Evelyn a venomous glare before being dragged away.

Adrian approached Evelyn quietly. He checked his watch before explaining, "My apologies, Mrs. Blackwood. General Blackwood has a crucial meeting in Miston by noon. He's racing against time now."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn - she'd disrupted his important duties.

She nodded contritely. "Please convey my gratitude to General Blackwood and my apologies for interfering with his schedule."

Adrian looked surprised by the formality between husband and wife.

"Of course." He turned and jogged to catch up with Liam.

After ensuring the police departure, Ryan returned to Evelyn's side. "Mrs. Blackwood, the General has never been late to anything before. Not once in fifteen years of service. Yet he delayed this critical meeting for you."

Guilt washed over Evelyn, but greater than that was her worry about potential repercussions Liam might face.

"I'm so sorry..." she murmured.

Ryan smiled gently. "No need for apologies, Mrs. Blackwood. The General will return tonight."

With that, he sprinted after Liam.

Witnesses to the incident approached Evelyn with words of comfort and support.

After thanking them, Evelyn retreated to her room and locked the door.

She'd planned to meet with the professors about the Azurium project, but after the day's events, academic discussions were the last thing on her mind.

Evelyn waited for Liam all night, finally succumbing to exhaustion near dawn.

In her half-asleep state, she felt gentle fingers brushing her hand.

Blinking awake, she found Liam's handsome face inches from hers. He was carefully rewrapping the bandage on her palm with surprising tenderness.

Her heart stuttered at his touch, electricity sparking where their skin met.

This wasn't a dream. Liam had truly returned.

Her pulse quickened beneath his ministrations.

"Liam? You're back?" Evelyn murmured sleepily, her soft voice caressing his ears in the quiet room.
###Chapter 92

Evelyn's soft voice sent a shiver down Liam's spine.

He kept his gaze lowered, afraid he wouldn't be able to resist pulling her into his arms.

"Yes, I just returned," Liam murmured as he carefully wrapped the bandage around her hand. "There's some dried blood near the wound. Did you apply the ointment?"

Evelyn remained still, glancing sideways at her injured hand. "Abigail helped me earlier."

"What did Victoria say to you?" Liam's voice darkened.

Evelyn tensed, her face paling.

Liam frowned. "You can't tell me?"

She turned to him slowly, tears glistening in her eyes. "I don't want to talk about it."

Victoria's words had cut too deep.

Evelyn didn’t know how to face the past she couldn’t remember. The accusation that she had once been cruel, heartless—capable of something unspeakable—haunted her.

Victoria had claimed Evelyn had terminated a pregnancy at seven months. That she was a murderer. A monster.

Liam had his suspicions about what Victoria had said, so he didn’t press for answers.

"It's still dark outside. Try to get some rest," he said gently, tucking her hand beneath the blanket.

Evelyn discreetly wiped her tears with her other hand. "Are you really sending Victoria to prison?"

Liam exhaled in frustration. "The Hoffis family won’t let anything happen to her. She’ll be out within a day."

Evelyn frowned in confusion.

Liam studied her tenderly before lying down beside her. "Do you know who the Hoffis family is?"

She nodded. "They're the wealthiest family in Aldenria."

Liam hummed in agreement. "The Hoffis family is one of the richest in the world, and the most powerful in our country."

"Victoria’s grandfather, Archibald, has close ties to the President. And Victoria is his favorite granddaughter. Do you think he’d let anything truly bad happen to her?"

Evelyn turned to him, curiosity flickering in her gaze, silently urging him to continue.

Liam wasn’t usually talkative, but under her expectant stare, he found himself wanting to share more.

He sighed. "Archibald adores her, but he was also strict. Victoria never had a normal childhood. From the moment she could walk, she was being tutored—mathematics, arts, subjects I’ve never even heard of. She had over a hundred tutors just for extracurriculars."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Did she ever have time to just… be happy?"

Liam let out a quiet chuckle. "Her only happiness back then was me. Her grandfather liked me, so he allowed me to take her out sometimes."

"Back then, Victoria was brilliant, sweet, and obedient. At fourteen, she was accepted into a prestigious university abroad. Her parents and uncle moved with her, and after that… we lost contact."

"Three years ago, her parents died in an accident. When Archibald went to retrieve them, all he found were two gravestones. He never even got to say goodbye."

"Now, he’s poured all his hopes into Victoria. But she’s let him down in ways he never expected."

Evelyn began to understand Liam’s conflicted feelings toward Victoria. Softly, she asked, "Are you disappointed in her too?"

Liam’s expression darkened. "Yes. Without Archibald’s guidance, she changed completely. She abandoned her studies, became reckless, selfish—turned into the person she is now."

Evelyn studied him closely, noticing the way his eyes dimmed with regret. It was clear how much he had once cared for Victoria—and how deeply her betrayal had wounded him.

As memories resurfaced, Liam’s chest grew heavy. He closed his eyes, letting the emotions wash over him.

The breeze from the window rustled the curtains—and tugged at Evelyn’s heart.
###Chapter 93

The police station stood eerily quiet at 4:00 am, the darkness swallowing any signs of life.

Victoria Dawson stormed out with Julian Whitmore, slamming the car door of the sleek black Mercedes behind her.

She yanked the seatbelt across her chest with visible irritation. "What took you so damn long?"

Julian's lips curled in a mocking smile. "Private jets don't fly themselves, darling."

"Did Grandfather find out?" Victoria rolled her eyes dramatically.

"He did." Julian exhaled sharply through his nose.

"Whatever. Take me to the compound." She crossed her arms petulantly.

Julian's knuckles turned white against the steering wheel, tendons standing out on his neck. "Final warning, Victoria. Lay one finger on her and I'll end you."

Victoria's eyes burned with fury. "This is your fault! If you'd eliminated her when you had the chance, I wouldn't be in this mess!"

Julian barked a humorless laugh. "The mask is slipping, isn't it? You can't keep up the act anymore."

"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Victoria hissed.

"Two years was all it took for her to outclass you completely. Back then she was just a naive girl clinging to Liam's arm. Now? She knows exactly when to hold back. Unlike you - still throwing tantrums like a spoiled child."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms, her gaze turning lethal. "I've seduced princes and billionaires. None could resist me."

Julian started the engine with a derisive snort. "Liam isn't like your usual prey. Try those cheap tricks on him and you'll only push him further away."

She kicked the dashboard violently, earning a disgusted side-eye from Julian before he deliberately looked away.

"Why didn't you tell me that bitch paints and speaks six languages?" Victoria spat. "She's working alongside Liam now! What other surprises does she have?"

Julian smirked. "Her talents are... extensive. Even I don't know the full extent."

"You raised her!" Victoria accused.

"After she went abroad, she enrolled at Solterra's most prestigious university under a pseudonym. Like her parents, I only saw her once a year. We know nothing about her actual studies or work."

"She might as well have vanished off the grid," Julian added dryly.

Victoria's eyes narrowed to slits as she stared at the passing streetlights. "If I don't eliminate her soon, Liam will fall for her completely."

Though Julian didn't catch the muttered words, his warning came sharp and clear: "Harm one hair on her head and I'll skin you alive."

Victoria scoffed. "Have you forgotten your mission?"

Silence.

"Shall I remind you?" she taunted.

Julian's jaw tightened. "Assist you in marrying Liam Blackwood to infiltrate Aldenrian military intelligence. Locate Cassandra Wright and secure additional hydronium supplies."

"Good dog," Victoria sneered.

Julian suddenly swerved, slamming the brakes. In one fluid motion, his hands closed around Victoria's throat, eyes blazing with murderous intent. "My mission doesn't require Cassandra's death. Touch her again and I'll personally send you to hell."

Victoria clawed at his wrists, face purpling as oxygen deprivation set in.

Only when her struggles weakened to feeble twitches did Julian release her.
###Chapter 94

Victoria gasped for air, her throat burning as she finally regained her breath after the violent coughing fit. The fear that gripped her made her shrink back against the car seat, not daring to provoke Julian further.

Julian kept his eyes on the road, his voice eerily calm as he spoke.
"You're banned from the base. My father insists I take you home." His fingers tightened around the steering wheel. "And she is never to appear before my parents again. Ever."

"Why?" Victoria whispered, her voice trembling.

Julian scoffed. "Elderly people trust their instincts more than facts. Margaret Thorn is proof of that. They wouldn’t believe a DNA report if you shoved it in their faces."

Victoria rolled her eyes. "That senile old bat is just confused."

Julian shot her a chilling glare, his stomach twisting with unease.
Some people shone like polished silver, no matter the circumstances. Others couldn’t hide their tarnish, no matter how hard they tried.

Dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky in soft hues of gold.

Evelyn stirred restlessly, her chest itching unbearably beneath the bandages. She twisted in bed, fingers twitching toward the irritating spot, but the thick gauze denied her relief.

Liam woke to her movements, blinking sleep from his eyes as he studied her. "What's wrong, Evie?"

The unexpected nickname sent a jolt through Evelyn, snapping her fully awake. She stared at him, wide-eyed, pulse racing.

The air between them thickened as their gazes locked.

Liam realized his slip too late—his carefully guarded affection laid bare. He cleared his throat, sitting up straighter. "Are you in pain?"

Evelyn nodded, brows knitting together. "It itches."

Her small, breathy complaint sent heat rushing through Liam’s veins. He shifted, suddenly aware of his body’s traitorous reaction.

Swallowing hard, he forced his voice steady. "Where... exactly does it itch?"

Evelyn pointed hesitantly to the side of her chest, confusion flickering at his strained expression. "Here."

Liam wrestled his composure back. "It could be healing... or infection. Let me check."

Evelyn froze.

His brow arched. "Problem?"

"It's... embarrassing." Pink stained her cheeks.

Right now, Liam cared only about her injury. She was human. So was he. What was the big deal?

He wasn’t some creep.

His expression turned stern. "I’m your husband. When will you stop treating me like a stranger?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "It’s not that, I just—"

She feared his disgust. Feared his rejection.

The words died in her throat.

After a long pause, she exhaled sharply and sat up. Turning away, her fingers moved to the first button of her pajama top.
###Chapter 95

Liam's breath hitched as Evelyn began to undress before him.

His self-control shattered instantly at the sight.

The silk nightgown slid down Evelyn's shoulders, pooling at her narrow waist. Her thick chestnut hair tumbled over her bare skin like a waterfall, offering tantalizing glimpses of the smooth flesh beneath.

Just the sight of her bare back was enough to undo him completely.

This was exquisite torture - the kind Liam found himself craving despite the agony.

Evelyn tossed her hair over one shoulder with unconscious grace, baring more of that maddening skin. Liam's throat went dry, his pulse hammering against his ribs.

He must have been out of his mind to volunteer to check her wound.

With deliberate movements, Evelyn reached behind her back and unfastened her bra.

Heat flooded Liam's body like wildfire. His breathing turned ragged, his heart pounding so hard he feared it might burst from his chest.

Every subtle movement she made sent fresh waves of desire crashing through him.

Oblivious to Liam's torment, Evelyn remained focused on her original request. "Could you check the wound for me?" she murmured shyly.

The bra came loose, but Evelyn kept it pressed against her chest as she turned slightly toward him.

Liam swallowed hard, painfully aware of the growing tightness in his pants.

From this angle, he could see the swell of her breast peeking out from the pink lace edge of her bra.

The sight nearly undid him. His fingers trembled as he reached to adjust the bra strap, forcing himself to focus on the bandage covering her injury.

The wound had healed well, forming a neat scab near the curve of her breast. "It's scabbed over," Liam managed in a rough voice. "I'll get you some anti-itch cream."

He practically leapt from the bed.

The door slammed behind him as he fled like a man possessed, his rapid footsteps fading down the hallway.

Evelyn blinked in confusion before sighing and tending to her own bandage before dressing.

Ten minutes later, a knock interrupted her thoughts.

Adrian stood at the door holding a small tube. "Madam, General Blackwood asked me to deliver this cream for your healing wound."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Where is he?"

"General Blackwood went training with Ryan and the others," Adrian replied.

Evelyn glanced at the clock - barely past five, the sky still dark. Since when did Liam train at this hour?

"Thank you," she said politely, accepting the ointment.

The morning passed without any sign of Liam. When Adrian delivered lunch, Evelyn couldn't resist asking, "Liam left in his pajamas this morning. Hasn't he returned to change?"

Adrian cleared his throat. "After training, the General showered at the barracks and went straight to work in his uniform. He asked me to inform you he won't be joining you for meals today."

Evelyn studied the medicine tube with growing puzzlement.

Something was definitely off about Liam's behavior today.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn's brow creased in concern. "What's wrong with him?"

Adrian looked equally confused. "No idea, but he's probably swamped with work."

With a quiet thanks, Evelyn shut the door behind Adrian.

Ryan had delivered her lunch earlier, while Adrian brought dinner.

"Madam," Adrian had said, "General Blackwood won't be returning tonight. He instructed you to rest early."

The news left Evelyn speechless.

By noon the next day, Evelyn had exhausted all reading material in her quarters.

Boredom gnawed at her. She considered visiting Liam but hesitated to interrupt his work. The research building seemed like a better alternative.

As she debated, a sharp knock startled her.

Another of Liam's assistants, no doubt.

Evelyn rushed to open the door, finding an unfamiliar officer standing at attention.

"Good afternoon, Madam," the stranger greeted.

Only Aldenrian military personnel had dormitory access.

Evelyn nodded cautiously.

"General Blackwood requested I escort you to Building Seven," the officer explained. "He wishes to discuss something important."

"Building Seven?" Evelyn's fingers tightened on the doorframe.

"Headquarters for our cybersecurity division," came the crisp reply.

Cybersecurity?

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn grabbed her jacket and followed the officer.

As they exited the dorms, two guards snapped to attention. "Lieutenant Commander!"

The officer nodded. "At ease. I'm escorting Madam to Building Seven. No need for backup - it's just across the quad."

"Yes, sir!" The guards chorused.

Evelyn relaxed slightly at the confirmation of his rank. Any lingering doubts evaporated as they walked.

But the path grew increasingly isolated. The trees thickened into dense woods, the paved walkway narrowing to a dirt trail.

Evelyn stopped dead.

The lieutenant commander turned. "Problem, Madam?"

Alarm bells rang in Evelyn's mind. She knew Building Six's location - Building Seven should be adjacent.

Why were they heading toward the forest?

Ignoring his question, she fumbled for her phone, fingers trembling as she dialed Liam.

She took three shaky steps backward.

Liam answered instantly. "Evelyn? What's wrong?"

"Did you send someone for me?" she whispered urgently.

His voice turned razor-sharp. "Negative. Give me your location."

Evelyn scanned the clearing. "There's an old storage shed here with red markings-"

The phone was ripped from her grasp.

Evelyn spun and sprinted toward the tree line.

"You disappoint me, Evelyn Carter," the officer sneered. "Did you truly believe you could escape your duty to Obsidian Circle?"

Evelyn froze mid-step, blood turning to ice. Slowly, she turned to face him.

The man's lips curled into a predatory smile but he made no move to chase her. The distance between them felt like the only safety.

"Years of training," he hissed, "countless resources expended to place you beside Liam Blackwood. Your mission was simple - uncover Cassandra Wright's location and secure the hydronium formula."

Evelyn's breath came in shallow gasps.

"Instead," his voice dropped to a venomous whisper, "you betrayed us. Not only failed your mission, but fell for that bastard general."

Evelyn's hands trembled violently. "I-I'm part of Obsidian Circle?"
###Chapter 97

The vice-captain's lips curled into a mocking sneer. "The Obsidian Circle doesn't forgive traitors. You slipped away once, but your luck ends today."

Evelyn's face drained of color. Her vision swam, and she stumbled back, her mind reeling.

The cold glint of a gun appeared in his hand, aimed directly at her heart.

She couldn't process it. A spy? Sent by the Obsidian Circle to steal secrets from Liam before her memory vanished?

He advanced slowly, the barrel unwavering.

"Liam is starting to suspect me," he hissed. "Soon, he'll uncover that I was the one who tried to kill you before. My cover is blown—and yours will be too."

His voice dripped with venom. "You'll die either way—by our hands or his."

Self-loathing coiled in Evelyn's chest like a serpent.

She could accept being cruel in her past. She could bear the shame of corruption and start anew.

But a spy? That stain would never fade. A criminal. An enemy to both Liam and their country.

The thought of dying by his hand shattered her.

"Just do it," she whispered, hollow.

The click of the hammer echoed in the silence.

She shut her eyes, surrendering to the darkness. No second chances for someone like her.

A gunshot cracked through the air.

Evelyn flinched—but no pain came.

Instead, strong arms wrapped around her, pulling her against a familiar warmth. Liam's scent enveloped her, cedar and steel.

Tears blurred her vision as she went limp in his embrace.

"Why didn't you run?" His voice was rough with frustration.

She stayed silent.

"General Blackwood—he's dead," Adrian reported from somewhere nearby.

Liam's breath fanned over her ear, his pulse wild against her skin. The fate of a traitor meant nothing to him—not when terror still clawed at his throat.

Evelyn closed her eyes again. Soon, that would be her. She couldn't bear the thought of Liam being the one to pull the trigger.

She didn't dare imagine tomorrow.

Liam frowned, sensing her unnatural stillness. Gently, he pushed her back to study her face—pale, tear-streaked.

"Were you scared?" he asked, softer now.

Her tears fell harder. Still, no words came.

Without another sound, he lifted her into his arms and carried her to the waiting car.

——

The hospital cleared her, but Evelyn barely registered it. Back in her dorm, she burrowed under the blankets, craving oblivion.

Liam didn't notice her silence. Duty called him away.

First, he dissected the spy's background. Then, he replayed the surveillance footage, frame by frame.

Evelyn had been running toward safety—until the traitor's words froze her in place. Her expression had crumbled after that.

Something icy slithered down Liam's spine.

By evening, he couldn't stay away any longer. He needed to see her.

But as he stepped out, Adrian rushed up, breathless. "General Blackwood—Madam Carter is gone. She left this."

A letter.

Liam's jaw tightened as he snatched it. The neat script inside was painfully formal:

Dear General Blackwood,

Thank you for your care these past days. I know you're busy, so I won't impose further. I've recovered enough to return home.

Forgive me for leaving without notice.

His fist clenched, crumpling the paper. A cold smile twisted his lips.

General Blackwood.

Since when had she ever called him that?

The entire note reeked of distance.

In this age, she could've called. Texted. Yet she chose a damn letter.

Adrian shifted nervously. "Sir, maybe she took a later flight. I can check the airport—"

"No." Liam strode back inside, tossing the letter into the trash.

"But Madam—"

"She's nobody," Liam cut in, voice flat. "Her presence or absence changes nothing."

He returned to his paperwork, but Adrian hesitated.

Nobody?

Then why had Liam nearly torn the base apart when she was attacked? Why had he barely slept while tending to her injuries?

Adrian didn't dare ask. He retreated quietly.

The moment the door shut, Liam dropped the facade. The documents fell from his hands as he sagged into his chair, eyes closing against the ache in his chest.

It hurt.

——

Ten days later.

3 AM. Somewhere in the office, Adrian and Ryan slumped over the couch.

"How long has it been?" Adrian mumbled, eyes shut.

"Ten days," Ryan groaned. "Ten. Straight."

"Feels like a decade," Adrian moaned, sitting up suddenly. His tired eyes gleamed. "Don't you think the General's been... off since Madam left?"
###Chapter 98

Ryan still had his eyes shut tight. "True. At lunch today, General Blackwood stared at that chicken drumstick on his plate for ages. Didn't touch a single bite."

Adrian looked baffled. "General Blackwood never wastes food."

Ryan nodded. "Exactly. He gave it to me instead."

The memory made his mouth water again.

Adrian leaned in closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "What if I go to Aldenria and bring Ms. Carter back?"

"Forget it." Ryan rubbed his eyes. "Have you ever seen newlyweds go ten days without calls or texts? Probably no feelings there."

Adrian nervously checked the hallway before whispering, "Ryan, listen to this."

Ryan caught his tension and snapped his eyes open, leaning forward. "What?"

"That letter Ms. Carter left for General Blackwood? Got tossed in the trash immediately." Adrian's voice was barely audible.

"No surprise there." Ryan arched an eyebrow.

"But yesterday I found it in his desk drawer." Adrian grinned.

Ryan's eyes widened as Adrian nodded excitedly.

The two exchanged knowing looks. Something was definitely up with Liam.

Ryan suddenly sat upright. "Wait—didn't General Blackwood's aunt send an invitation yesterday? Should we tell him?"

Adrian grimaced. "You want to die? He said to reject anything from that aunt immediately."

Ryan kicked Adrian's shin. "Idiot! This could be our excuse to get him back to Aldenria. Maybe he'll go this time."

Adrian's eyes lit up with realization.

They scrambled to their feet and rushed to the office.

After knocking, they entered cautiously.

Liam stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders outlined by the city lights. The very air around him felt heavy.

"General Blackwood," they chorused.

Without turning, Liam's deep voice rumbled, "You should be resting."

Adrian nodded quickly. "Yes, sir."

Ryan shot him a glare before speaking up. "General, about your aunt—"

Liam cut him off sharply. "Don't mention her."

They both swallowed hard.

Liam's aunt was notoriously meddlesome. Normally, even hearing her name gave him migraines.

Ryan gathered his courage. "She's returning from her travels. Hosting a banquet tomorrow night. Wants you there."

Adrian held his breath, expecting an explosion.

Silence.

Liam's gaze drifted toward Aldenria's direction. Were the stars as bright there? Was Evelyn asleep by now?

The two subordinates exchanged glances. This was the first time Liam hadn't erupted at his aunt's mention.

At Blackwood Manor...

"Evelyn, come here please," Eleanor called.

Evelyn set down her book and joined Eleanor on the living room sofa. "What is it, Mother?"

Eleanor studied Evelyn closely. Over time, she'd realized Evelyn was gentle to a fault—the type who'd let others walk over her.

She couldn't help worrying. "Evelyn, Liam's aunt returns tomorrow. No matter what she says, stay calm. Don't provoke her."

Evelyn frowned. "Who is she exactly? Why does everyone fear her?"
###Chapter 99

"She's truly formidable!" Eleanor sighed with resignation.

Evelyn's brows knitted together in unease.

Seeing Evelyn's lack of self-preservation instincts, Eleanor felt compelled to warn her again. "Even Liam steers clear of her. Her return will undoubtedly stir up trouble in the family once more."

Curiosity and concern warred within Evelyn.

Eleanor's irritation grew palpable. The two women sat in heavy silence, neither initiating conversation.

Evelyn attempted to break the tension. "Mother, I noticed you've been tending to the greenhouse. Would you like some assistance?"

Eleanor's expression brightened. "Oh yes! The flowers are in full bloom now. If you're free, could you help cut some for the vases? We can arrange them throughout the house later."

Evelyn smiled warmly. "I'd be happy to. How many vases will we need?"

"They're already prepared in the greenhouse. Come, I'll show you." Eleanor instinctively grasped Evelyn's wrist, leading her forward.

A profound warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest.

She knew her marriage to Liam would ultimately end in either divorce or death - an inevitable conclusion. Yet while they remained wed, she desperately craved his family's acceptance.

As they stepped outside, a convoy of military vehicles screeched to a halt before the manor.

Eleanor gasped with delight. "Oh heavens! It's my son's convoy!"

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed. She stood frozen as Liam's armored vehicle came to rest.

Ryan and Adrian emerged first.

Every muscle in Evelyn's body tensed. Her breathing turned shallow, palms growing damp with perspiration.

Then Liam descended.

Ten days apart, and now they stood mere feet from each other.

He looked devastatingly handsome as ever, his chiseled features glowing under the afternoon sun.

"Hello, Mother." Liam's deep voice carried warmth as he embraced Eleanor.

Though he'd spotted Evelyn the moment his vehicle approached, he now deliberately avoided her gaze.

Eleanor patted his arm in disbelief. "What brings you home now? Don't you know your aunt arrives tomorrow? Your siblings left with their spouses this morning. Why return today?"

Liam shrugged casually. "I'm aware of her arrival. Just happened to have a mission in Aldenria."

Eleanor sighed. "How unfortunate."

At that moment, Evelyn approached and offered a formal greeting. "General Blackwood."

To Eleanor, their marriage remained one in name only, so the distant address didn't surprise her.

A shadow crossed Liam's features as he studied Evelyn.

The formal salutation in her letter had unsettled him, but hearing it in person - so cold and detached - shattered something within him.

His response came clipped and icy. "Hello."

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, terrified that meeting his eyes might unleash her tears.

Eleanor tugged Liam toward the house. "Is this a demanding assignment? How long will you stay?"

"Just a few days. Routine matters." Liam noticed Evelyn wasn't following. Instead, she'd turned toward the greenhouse alone. His eyes tracked her solitary figure retreating across the lawn.
###Chapter 100

The moment Liam stepped into Blackwood Manor, maids immediately appeared with silver trays bearing tea and delicate pastries.

He settled into an armchair across from Eleanor, making polite conversation. Yet his attention kept drifting toward the arched doorway leading to the gardens.

Eleanor noticed his distraction immediately. "Liam, darling, is something troubling you? Are your men still waiting outside?"

"No, Mother. I dismissed them earlier." He forced his attention back, lifting the porcelain cup to his lips.

An exquisite floral aroma filled his senses. Liam paused mid-sip, savoring the unexpected flavor.

Eleanor smiled knowingly. "Do you approve? Evelyn selected this particular blend. It's quite rare - she insists the water temperature must be precisely seventy degrees Celsius to avoid bitterness."

Just hearing Evelyn's name made Liam's pulse quicken. He carefully set down the cup. "You two seem to be getting along well."

Eleanor sighed wistfully. "That girl has such a pure heart. Gentle yet determined, capable of mastering anything she sets her mind to. It's difficult to reconcile such innocence with the darkness in her past."

Liam stiffened, unwilling to revisit those painful memories. "Where is she now?"

"Trimming roses in the greenhouse. The blooms are particularly spectacular this season. I thought we might arrange some for the grand hall."

Liam drained his tea abruptly and stood. "I'll assist with the cuttings."

Eleanor's teacup clattered against its saucer. "Excuse me?"

Before she could process this unprecedented offer, Liam had already disappeared through the French doors.

Eleanor leaned back against the silk cushions, watching her son's retreating figure with bewilderment. Had she heard correctly? Liam volunteering for gardening?

Her battle-hardened son, who once killed an entire bed of orchids by "watering" them with whiskey, now wanted to arrange flowers? Had military life finally driven him mad?

In the greenhouse, golden sunlight streamed through the glass ceiling, illuminating rows of vibrant blossoms. The air hung heavy with their perfume.

A wrought-iron table stood in the corner, surrounded by wicker chairs and shaded by a large striped umbrella.

Evelyn sat beneath it, surrounded by freshly cut flowers. Her delicate fingers moved with precision as she trimmed stems and arranged them in crystal vases.

The sound of approaching footsteps made her heart stutter. She looked up, then immediately sprang to her feet when she recognized the imposing figure.

Liam entered with deliberate steps, his gaze sweeping across the floral displays while pointedly avoiding looking at Evelyn.

"Do you require something, General Blackwood?" Her voice trembled slightly.

He moved closer, examining the blooms. A large hand reached out to touch a perfect crimson rose. "Mother wants flowers for the hall."

Evelyn hastily resumed her work. "Just give me a moment. I'll finish these quickly."

As she worked, Liam finally allowed himself to study her.

Had she lost weight in the ten days since he'd last seen her? Were they not feeding her properly at the manor? Had someone been mistreating her?

He took the seat opposite her, stretching his long legs casually. His hand came down heavily on a cluster of delicate peonies.

Evelyn gasped and grabbed his wrist. "Please don't crush them!"

Liam seized the opportunity to capture her hand in his.

She tried to pull away, but his grip was unyielding. With clinical precision, he examined her palm, frowning at the faint scar where her wound had healed.

Evelyn's breath came in shallow gasps. "General Blackwood, you mustn't—"

"First it's 'General,' now 'General Blackwood,'" he interrupted coldly. "What's next? Will you start calling me 'Your Excellency'? Are you that determined to end our marriage?"
###Chapter 101

Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation as her private thoughts were exposed. She instinctively lowered her gaze, unable to meet Liam's piercing stare.

Liam's grip on her wrist tightened momentarily before he released her with visible frustration. "If you want out of this marriage, just say it," he snapped. "I won't chain you to me. But don't play these childish games to provoke me."

Tears pricked at Evelyn's eyes as she bit down hard on her lower lip. The metallic taste of blood mingled with her unshed tears. Leaving Liam was the last thing she wanted, yet she saw no way to bridge the chasm between them.

She was drowning in the weight of a past she couldn't escape, a past that threatened to define her present. Each day felt like another battle in a war she couldn't win, her spirit slowly crumbling under the pressure.

Liam's anger faltered as he noticed the silent tears tracing paths down Evelyn's pale cheeks. His expression softened, regret flashing in his stormy eyes. "Talk to me," he urged, his voice dropping to a gentler tone.

When Evelyn remained silent, Liam's jaw clenched. He watched as another tear escaped her lashes, and something inside him twisted painfully.

A sudden urgency propelled him forward. In two quick strides, he closed the distance between them and pulled Evelyn into his arms. Her petite frame trembled against his chest, her face still hidden from view.

The sensation was achingly familiar. Liam hadn't felt this particular brand of heartache since he'd comforted another weeping woman years ago. "What's wrong?" he murmured into her hair.

Evelyn fought to control her breathing, but the tears kept coming. The cruel irony of her situation overwhelmed her - the man holding her might one day be the cause of her destruction.

At a loss, Liam simply tightened his embrace, one hand cradling the back of her head. Evelyn stiffened in surprise at the unexpected intimacy.

Strangely, the warmth of his body against hers seemed to stem the flow of her tears. She stood frozen, arms limp at her sides, acutely aware of the rapid thudding of her own heartbeat.

Beneath her ear, Liam's pulse raced just as frantically. Was it her imagination, or was he as affected by this closeness as she was?

Liam inhaled deeply, the floral scent of Evelyn's shampoo filling his senses. The tension that had plagued him for weeks began to melt away in her arms. The restless emptiness that had haunted him dissipated in this quiet moment.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed as she became aware of how perfectly she fit against him. The embrace felt dangerously intimate, sending her heart into overdrive.

"I'm... I'm okay now," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "You can let go."

Liam hesitated before reluctantly loosening his hold. Evelyn stepped back, her wide, tear-filled eyes searching his face with visible confusion.

The lingering warmth of his body left her strangely unsettled. In Evelyn's world, embraces like this were reserved for lovers, not estranged husbands in troubled marriages.

Under her intense scrutiny, Liam cleared his throat awkwardly. "What upset you?" he pressed. "Was it what I said earlier?"

A sudden realization struck Evelyn - she'd never seen Liam comfort Victoria this way, no matter how dramatically she cried. Yet he'd held Evelyn simply because she'd shed a few silent tears.

"Why did you hug me?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.
###Chapter 102

Liam froze mid-step when he heard the question. After a brief hesitation, he responded smoothly, "Thought it might help with those tears of yours."

A gentle voice suddenly cut through their moment. "Are my flower arrangements ready yet?"

Evelyn scrambled back to her workstation, grabbing her shears. "Nearly finished, Eleanor."

Eleanor entered and saw the untouched flowers. Empty vases still littered the floor, waiting to be filled.

She turned to Liam with confusion. "Liam, didn't you say you'd—"

"Mother, you should rest. We've got this covered," Liam interrupted loudly, deliberately cutting her off.

He swiftly guided Eleanor out with an arm around her shoulders. When he returned, Evelyn was meticulously trimming stems.

Liam picked up another pair of shears and sat opposite her. He studied her technique before silently joining in. The fragrant, peaceful atmosphere made time slip away unnoticed.

Evelyn glanced up and spotted Liam's completed arrangement. A smile tugged at her lips.

The deep crimson roses stood in perfect military formation, as precise as his soldiers' parade lines. The rigid symmetry amused her.

Noticing her suppressed laughter, Liam's mood lightened. "That bad?"

Evelyn resumed her work. "Your mother would love knowing you did this."

"Think it's passable?"

She nodded. "It's actually quite striking."

Liam studied her rosy cheeks, realizing she outshone the blooms. For the first time, he found flower arranging unexpectedly engaging.

Later that evening, Liam stood on his balcony after showering, dressed in relaxed gray loungewear. The night sky stretched clear above him.

The door creaked open. Evelyn entered quietly, closing it behind her before turning to face him.

Despite the spacious room, their gazes connected instantly. Liam immediately sensed her tension.

He stepped inside from the balcony, closing the distance. Evelyn's pulse quickened with each of his steps.

She blurted out, "Everyone seems nervous about your aunt's return tomorrow. Shouldn't you leave for Blackwood Manor like Gregory and the others?"

"Aren't you afraid of her?" Liam countered.

"I've never met her. Why is everyone so terrified?"

"She's not frightening—just insufferably meddlesome," Liam explained.

"Worse than Victoria?" The words escaped before Evelyn could stop them.

Liam stiffened, and Evelyn immediately backtracked. "Sorry, shouldn't have mentioned your childhood friend like that."

Shoving his hands in his pockets, Liam sounded almost amused. "After what she did to frame you, I'd expect harsher words than 'annoying.'"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard by his reaction.

"Oh," she mumbled awkwardly, instinctively stepping back.

Suddenly, Liam advanced, planting a hand against the door beside her head. Evelyn flattened against the wood, breath catching as she stared up at him.
###Chapter 103

Liam's eyes burned with an unsettling intensity, radiating an icy aura that made the air around him drop several degrees.

With barely concealed irritation, he demanded, "You vanished after leaving a cryptic note. That's hardly proper behavior. Don't I deserve an explanation?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. The truth about her possible ties to Obsidian Circle couldn't be revealed.

Aldenria's military compound wasn't just any base—it specialized in advanced weapons development and housed the nation's most classified armory.

As someone who might be a spy, Evelyn knew lingering there was dangerous.

If classified information leaked, she'd be the prime suspect. That accusation was something she'd avoid at all costs.

Her abrupt departure had been fueled by sheer panic, her mind too scrambled to formulate a proper farewell.

"I..." Evelyn's voice faltered.

Liam couldn't tear his gaze from her lips. Every slight movement sent his pulse racing. His throat went dry with the overwhelming urge to kiss her.

He forced himself to swallow before asking, "What did Sullivan tell you that made you flee like that?"

Evelyn's spine stiffened as she met his gaze, her nervousness plain in her wide eyes. Liam immediately noticed her discomfort.

"General Blackwood, actually—"

"Change how you address me," Liam interrupted smoothly, his voice dripping with dangerous charm.

Evelyn's resolve softened slightly. There was no mistaking it—Liam was deliberately teasing her.

"Liam," she murmured softly.

A satisfied smile curved his lips. "Better."

Evelyn tensed again. Her heart was on a rollercoaster, soaring and plummeting with each turn. That single word of approval made heat flood her cheeks.

Liam noted the pink tinge coloring her face. Though inexperienced with women, he knew Evelyn was unique—the only one who flushed at his slightest intimate gesture.

Watching her fluster ignited his mischievous side. The more she withdrew, the stronger his urge to tease grew.

Yet Liam recognized this game was counterproductive. If continued, they'd accomplish nothing, and he might push her away entirely. Deciding to retreat, he slowly removed his hand from the doorframe.

"I don't play guessing games. Speak plainly," he stated.

Evelyn nervously twisted her shirt hem. The dilemma tore at her—would confessing now demonstrate honesty or complicate matters further?

But if Liam discovered the truth independently, the fallout would be catastrophic. The inevitable confrontation couldn't be avoided.

Summoning every ounce of courage, Evelyn whispered, "Liam, before my amnesia... I was a spy for Obsidian Circle, and—"

Liam's expression hardened instantly, his gaze turning glacial. "Did Sullivan tell you this?" he interrupted sharply.

Evelyn nodded.

"And you believed him?" Liam pressed.

"Because he was one too. I botched a mission, and the Circle sent him to eliminate me," she explained.

Liam exhaled in visible relief, his eyes softening with empathy. "So these past weeks, you've been silently suffering with this, overanalyzing everything, hiding away at home?"

Another nod. Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes, threatening to spill over.
###Chapter 104

Liam guided Evelyn to the vanity and motioned for her to take a seat.

He settled onto the edge of the bed, his expression turning grave. "Evelyn, without concrete evidence, it's always better to maintain healthy skepticism."

Evelyn looked confused. Liam realized how sheltered she must have been.

Perhaps her amnesia had shielded her from understanding the darker aspects of human nature.

"My instincts tell me you might be connected to Obsidian Circle, but it's just speculation without proof," Liam explained patiently.

"Did the informant you eliminated lie?" Evelyn asked.

"He wasn't the one who attacked you earlier. I've analyzed the surveillance footage thoroughly. Their builds don't match."

"Also, a vice-captain who always carries a firearm wouldn't switch to a knife for an assassination," Liam countered.

Evelyn was startled by his thorough investigation.

"The vice-captain might be getting framed. If he's really with Obsidian Circle, he'd move quickly to eliminate you," Liam continued.

"I thought maybe I was the spy," Evelyn whispered.

"That possibility still exists," Liam admitted.

Evelyn's heart, which had begun to calm, clenched again at his words. Her head snapped up, worry clouding her eyes as she stared at him.

Noticing her distress, Liam quickly added, "Just professional paranoia. I've always been curious about your past, but haven't uncovered anything definitive yet."

Evelyn searched his face. "Liam, if I was a spy before my amnesia... would you kill me?"

The question startled him. Gazing into her clear eyes, he felt a sharp pain in his chest at the thought.

"Go shower and stop overthinking," he deflected.

His silence spoke volumes. Evelyn understood the unspoken answer.

"Alright," she replied quietly.

An emptiness filled her chest as she retrieved her pajamas from the walk-in closet and headed to the bathroom.

Lost in thought, Liam lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

Perhaps seeing Evelyn had eased his mind, or maybe exhaustion from endless workdays finally claimed him. He drifted into sleep unnoticed.

When Evelyn emerged from her shower, she found Liam already asleep. She approached the bed silently and slipped in beside him.

As she settled, she couldn't help but study his peaceful face. His breathing was even, his handsome features relaxed in sleep.

Her fingers itched to trace his strong brows, but she clenched her fist and pulled back. Instead, her gaze traveled to his straight nose and firm lips.

Overcome with emotion, she nearly leaned in to kiss him. But doubt held her back.

She felt too tainted, too unworthy for someone like Liam.

Their marriage might appear strong outwardly, but inside it felt hollow. She wondered how long this fragile union could last.

Closing her eyes, Evelyn tried to ignore the ache in her chest.

The next morning at Blackwood Manor, Evelyn woke near noon. Thankfully, the staff handled all chores, and Richard and Eleanor gave them space.

By the time Evelyn rose, it was past eleven, with no sign of Liam. After freshening up, she ventured downstairs.

The living room buzzed with activity as several guests exchanged gifts. "Richard, Eleanor, these are for you. This one's for Gregory, this for Maxwell, this for Sebastian, and this for Liam. Donovan ran away years ago, so nothing for him."
###Chapter 105

"Guess where I've been? Over fifteen countries this trip! Absolutely spectacular!" A woman in her early fifties gushed with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Her animated chatter filled the room like a bustling marketplace. Evelyn approached the gathering hesitantly. Liam noticed her discomfort and patted the empty space beside him on the sofa.

Grateful for his thoughtfulness, Evelyn settled next to him. Her gaze immediately caught on an elegant young woman seated opposite - poised, refined, and studying Evelyn with intense scrutiny.

During those first awkward minutes, Evelyn observed the entire Blackwood family enduring the middle-aged woman's endless monologue with practiced patience.

The woman, adorned in expensive jewelry that clinked with every movement, exuded wealth. As she casually sipped her water, her eyes landed on Evelyn beside Liam.

Her perfectly manicured eyebrows shot up. Without waiting for introductions, she gestured dramatically toward the young woman beside her.

"This is Genevieve Prescott, from the distinguished Prescott family. My goddaughter, and the perfect match I've selected for Liam," Beatrice Thornton announced proudly.

Evelyn felt the air leave her lungs, though no one else seemed surprised by the declaration.

"You know the Prescotts, don't you? Real estate moguls, old money. But let's focus on Genevieve here. She's the complete package - cultured, educated, accomplished."

"Graduated top of her class from Cambridge. Fluent in four languages. Hosts the most exquisite dinner parties in the city."

"And personality? Impeccable. Makes that Victoria Dawson look like common trash in comparison."

"So Liam, darling, aren't you thrilled with the bride I've chosen for you?" Beatrice trilled, oblivious to the tension thickening the air.

Liam finally seized the opportunity to speak. Leaning slightly toward Evelyn, he said firmly, "Aunt Beatrice, allow me to introduce my wife, Evelyn Carter."

Beatrice's expression transformed instantly, her face freezing in shock before twisting into displeasure.

Turning to Evelyn, Liam continued, "Evelyn, this is Beatrice Thornton - my father's younger sister."

"Pleasure to meet you," Evelyn offered politely.

Beatrice scoffed, crossing her arms as her critical gaze swept over Evelyn from head to toe.

"Is this some joke? Why wasn't I informed about this marriage? Living together before proper wedding arrangements? She doesn't even look like she comes from good stock," Beatrice sneered.

"Liam, you should really get to know Genevieve instead." Beatrice launched into another monologue, completely disregarding the uncomfortable atmosphere.

Richard Blackwood finally intervened. "They're legally married, Beatrice. The civil ceremony was two months ago."

Genevieve's carefully composed mask slipped, revealing her displeasure.

Beatrice gasped dramatically. "What? A secret wedding? First Gregory, then Sebastian, now Liam? Am I already dead and nobody told me?"

"I've handpicked every single one of these goddaughters as perfect wife material! Richard, Eleanor, this is completely unacceptable!"

Eleanor quickly interjected, "Beatrice! Liam's grandmother chose his bride. We couldn't interfere."

"Mother's been ill for years! She's lost her senses. Can she even judge character properly anymore? Have you all gone mad too?" Beatrice produced a lace handkerchief and dabbed at nonexistent tears.

Evelyn watched the theatrics unfold with fascination. Liam sighed deeply, anticipating what would come next. Suddenly, warm hands covered Evelyn's ears from behind.

Her heart stuttered at the unexpected contact, her body tensing at Liam's proximity. He didn't want her to hear Beatrice's inevitable cruel remarks about their marriage.
###Chapter 106

Liam's hands covered Evelyn's ears, but fragments of Beatrice's monologue still reached her. The older woman was dramatically recounting exaggerated tales from the past.

"Back when you were all climbing career ladders, I was the one raising these boys. Alexander used to come home crying from school - bullied so badly he'd wet himself. Every night, I'd rock him to sleep with stories."

"Donovan went through that awful phase after his first breakup. The boy nearly jumped off the penthouse balcony! Who talked him down? Me, that's who."

"Sebastian always had expensive tastes even as a child. Designer this, limited edition that - I spoiled him rotten because that's what family does!"

"And let's not forget Liam here - the rebellious phase where he'd skip classes, get into street fights, run with the wrong crowd. Who straightened him out? This woman right here."

Beatrice jabbed a finger toward Liam. "And you, little Liam, refused to wean until you were three. Every morning after Eleanor left for work, you'd toddle after me crying for your bottle."

Liam inhaled deeply, shutting his eyes as if praying for patience. Evelyn bit her lip to suppress laughter. Now she understood why the Blackwood brothers dreaded their aunt's visits.

Their childhood skeletons were being paraded out one humiliating story at a time. It was excruciating.

Beatrice continued with theatrical flair. "Remember when Victoria studied abroad? You were grown men, yet moped around like lost puppies. Started drinking, smoking - completely fell apart."

"I pulled you all back from the brink. And this is the thanks I get? Cold shoulders and ingratitude!"

Richard sighed heavily, having heard these tales countless times. "Beatrice, must we revisit ancient history? The boys are married men now. These stories only embarrass them."

"Married? They'll always be my boys. Do you know why I never married? Devoted my life to raising them! And how do they repay me? Ignoring my carefully selected matches!"

She glared pointedly at Evelyn. "Since you two rushed into marriage without proper courtship, maybe a quick annulment would be best."

Liam pretended not to hear, but Evelyn's smile tightened. She gently removed Liam's hands from her ears.

"Dinner is served," Winston announced smoothly.

Perfect timing. Richard and Eleanor rose gratefully. "Excellent. Let's eat."

Liam clasped Evelyn's hand as they moved toward the dining room, Beatrice's disapproving gaze burning into their backs.

As everyone settled, Genevieve began pouring drinks. When she reached Liam and Evelyn, she offered their glasses with practiced grace. "Liam, Ms. Carter, your wine."

Beatrice beamed. "Such impeccable manners. A true lady."

Liam leaned back, fixing Genevieve with an icy stare. "If you're using my given name, you'll address my wife as Evelyn. Basic etiquette, surely?"

Both women's smiles faltered under his glacial tone. Genevieve forced a strained smile. "Evelyn, your wine."

Evelyn felt warmth spread through her chest at Liam's defense. She nodded acknowledgment to Genevieve, though the meal passed uncomfortably with Beatrice's ceaseless commentary.

The older woman revisited every childhood embarrassment - from first steps to teenage rebellions - with relentless enthusiasm. Each story more cringe-inducing than the last.
###Chapter 107

Beatrice couldn't stop boasting about how she single-handedly raised the Blackwood brothers.

A sudden commotion outside drew everyone's attention. Gregory, Maxwell, and Sebastian rushed in with their wives, faces etched with concern.

"Where's Father? Is he alright?" they demanded urgently.

Beaming, Beatrice answered, "Your father's right here, enjoying his lunch."

Richard looked puzzled at his sons' anxious expressions. "What's all this about?"

Gregory shot Beatrice a furious glare. "Aunt Beatrice told us you'd suffered a stroke and died at home."

Richard slammed his fist on the table. "Bea! Must your jokes always sound like curses? Wishing death upon me now?"

Beatrice hurried to Richard's side, clutching his arm. "Richard darling, it was just harmless fun. Don't be cross with me."

An uncomfortable silence fell over the room. Eventually, everyone was reluctantly seated for lunch.

Beatrice proceeded to criticize each Blackwood family member as "ungrateful wretches."

Evelyn grew weary after just two rounds of these accusations.

She couldn't fathom how many times the Blackwoods had endured Beatrice's tirades to become so fearful of her.

After the meal, Beatrice forbade anyone from leaving, herding the entire family into the living room for forced conversation.

Sitting close to Liam, Evelyn whispered, "Is it true Beatrice raised you and your brothers?"

Liam leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Not exactly. Our family's always had staff since Grandmother's time."

"As children, each of us had our own nanny. Aunt Beatrice never worked - she just... observed us growing up from the sidelines."

"Your father certainly indulges his sister," Evelyn remarked.

"That he does," Liam agreed.

Evelyn playfully whispered, "Are you pleased with the bride she chose for you?"

Liam's brow furrowed. "Don't take it seriously. This is her fifth goddaughter. She's determined to matchmake all of us."

Their intimate exchange didn't go unnoticed. Sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, whispering like lovers, they presented a picture of marital bliss.

Yet everyone knew Evelyn and Liam's marriage lacked genuine affection and was headed for divorce.

Their sudden closeness baffled the room. The couple seemed oblivious to the attention they'd drawn.

A flash of jealousy crossed Genevieve's face before she forced a sweet smile. "Liam and Evelyn seem so close suddenly!"

Evelyn immediately put distance between them, cheeks flushing at the realization of their proximity.

Beatrice gave Evelyn a disdainful look. "What's so special about it? Liam's heart belongs to Victoria Dawson."

"I don't even know where this woman came from. Mother bungled the match - they'll be divorced soon enough."

Liam's expression darkened at Victoria's mention, making Evelyn uneasy.

The family's unanimous expectation of their impending divorce cast a shadow over Evelyn.

Isabella sneered, "Beatrice, you don't know the half of it. She's just the nurse who cared for your mother. Her background is-"

Before she could finish, Liam cut in sharply. "Isabella, who gave you permission to disrespect my wife in my presence?"
###Chapter 108

Isabella Sinclair recoiled as Liam Blackwood shielded Evelyn Carter protectively. "Liam, I-I didn't mean to overstep," she stammered, her fingers twisting nervously.

Evelyn's breath caught at Liam's unexpected defense. For the first time, the Morrison family's judgmental stares didn't pierce her skin like daggers.

After enduring Sebastian and Isabella's constant condescension, this small victory tasted sweeter than she'd imagined.

Beatrice Thornton's shrill voice cut through the tension. "That woman was my mother's nurse? Disgraceful! With her questionable reputation and gutter origins, Liam, surely you can do better!"

Liam's knuckles turned white as he surged to his feet. "Repeat those words," he growled, his military bearing making the threat palpable.

Beatrice collapsed onto the sofa, her arrogance evaporating under Liam's volcanic glare. This wasn't the composed nephew she knew - this was the decorated general few dared cross.

On the sidelines, Genevieve Prescott's lips curled in triumph. Evelyn's humble background only reinforced her own superiority. The charity artist didn't belong in their world.

Yet Evelyn reached for Liam's arm, her touch feather-light. "Please," she murmured, "let's resolve this calmly." She couldn't afford to alienate Beatrice further - not when she had to navigate these gilded halls daily.

Sebastian and Isabella exchanged amused glances, reveling in the familial discord.

Liam's glacial stare pinned Beatrice in place, though she attempted nonchalance. "I-I'm just speaking truths!"

With a frustrated exhale, Liam threaded his fingers through Evelyn's. "We're leaving."

Evelyn shook her head minutely. Fleeing would only validate Beatrice's accusations. She needed to stand her ground.

Liam read her hesitation and reluctantly sat, though tension radiated from him like heat waves. The room collectively held its breath - even Richard and Eleanor knew better than to provoke their son further.

Beatrice, sensing the shift, adopted a new tactic. "Genevieve graduated from Cambridge with honors in Fine Arts. Her designs have won international acclaim. Tell me, Evelyn, where did you study?"

The question hung like a guillotine. Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She recognized this game - the subtle undermining disguised as polite inquiry.

Before Liam could erupt, rapid footsteps echoed through the grand hall.

Cassandra Blake burst in, clutching a rectangular package. "Gregory! Help me with this," she commanded her husband.

As Gregory Lynch unfurled the canvas, Cassandra's eyes sparkled with vindication. She'd never forgiven Beatrice for destroying her marriage and pushing Gregory toward her goddaughter.

Gasps filled the room as the signature "Isabella Grayson" became visible in the corner.

"Beatrice," Cassandra announced triumphantly, "meet Inkwell - the philanthropic artist whose works sell for millions. This piece would've fetched seven figures if not for the corner damage."

Beatrice's jaw dropped. Genevieve's perfect complexion paled.

Isabella shot to her feet. "Cassandra, this is absurd! Another forgery, just like Victoria Dawson gave Vera!"

The air crackled with tension as all eyes swung between the disputed masterpiece and its alleged creator. Evelyn stood very still, her pulse hammering - the truth of her identity balanced on a knife's edge.
###Chapter 109

Cassandra couldn't resist teasing, "Oh come now, can't stomach the thought that Evelyn might actually be more talented than you?" She held up the painting proudly. "I had this authenticated by three different art experts. It's a genuine Isabella Grayson original."

"Evelyn's artwork has raised millions for charity," she added with a smirk.

Gregory nodded in agreement. "Absolutely authentic."

Isabella's face flushed crimson with anger, but no retort came to mind. Evelyn shifted uncomfortably at Cassandra's bold claims about her uncertain past.

From his corner, Liam allowed himself a small smile. Finally, someone in the family was acknowledging Evelyn's gifts.

Beatrice huffed indignantly. "Genevieve is classically trained, unlike some amateur who happens to sell paintings for ridiculous sums."

Cassandra arched an eyebrow. "Even 'amateurs' can command millions. I wonder if your precious goddaughter's work could fetch even pocket change."

Beatrice opened and closed her mouth like a fish out of water.

Gregory chuckled as he carefully rolled the canvas. "These days, universities churn out graduates by the thousands, but real talent?" He shook his head. "Most can't even land proper jobs. Their creations are just vanity projects!"

Beatrice's hands clenched into fists. Then her gaze landed on the grand piano in the corner, and her expression brightened.

"Genevieve is also an accomplished pianist," Beatrice declared haughtily.

She practically dragged Genevieve to the piano bench. "Why don't you play something for us, dear?"

Without a trace of humility, Genevieve gave a theatrical bow. "Allow me to delight you with my skills."

Her fingers danced across the keys in a technically proficient but emotionally flat performance.

Coming from a family of musicians with perfect pitch, Isabella rolled her eyes in disdain.

The less musically inclined guests offered polite applause when she finished.

Beatrice clapped enthusiastically. "Wasn't that spectacular? Genevieve is truly exceptional!"

Richard and Eleanor joined the lukewarm applause while others barely managed polite smiles.

Isabella scoffed loudly. "That's a Grade 5 piece at best. Any child with two years of lessons could play it better." She tilted her head mockingly. "Why not attempt 'Piano Concerto No. 3' if you're so talented?"

Genevieve's smile faltered. "I've heard your mother is quite the virtuoso. Perhaps you'd care to demonstrate that piece for us? I'd love to learn from a master."

Isabella shrugged. "I'm mediocre at best. Can't tackle the world's hardest pieces." She shot Genevieve a pointed look. "Though with all of Beatrice's boasting, I assumed you could. My mistake."

"I—" Genevieve stammered.

Beatrice looked flustered. Her plan to upstage Evelyn had somehow turned into a confrontation with Isabella.

Redirecting, Beatrice sniffed, "Even if Genevieve can't play advanced pieces, she's still infinitely more cultured than someone like Evelyn who probably can't even read sheet music."

Evelyn found herself suddenly thrust into the spotlight, unsure how to respond.

Liam's expression darkened. "Aunt Beatrice, are you deliberately targeting my wife tonight?"

"Nonsense, Liam! I'm merely suggesting Evelyn play something simple." Beatrice's eyes gleamed with malice. "Surely she can manage 'Happy Birthday'? Even I could play that by ear, and I've never had a lesson in my life!"
###Chapter 110

Evelyn's palms grew damp with nervous perspiration. Cassandra glided past Liam, flashing him a knowing smile that promised everything would be fine.

With gentle insistence, Cassandra took Evelyn's trembling hand. "Come now, Evelyn. Let's perform a birthday melody for her."

"I can't, Cassandra," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Leaning closer, Cassandra's breath tickled Evelyn's ear. "No need to fret. The piano's automated system has the song programmed. Just place your hands on the keys - I'll handle the rest." Her grip tightened slightly. "You mustn't let Beatrice believe you're incapable."

Before Evelyn could protest, she found herself being guided toward the grand piano. Her desperate glance toward Liam went unanswered; he remained seated on the velvet sofa, observing the scene with quiet confidence in Cassandra's plan.

For the first time in three years of memory loss, Evelyn's fingertips brushed against the ivory keys. A strange familiarity coursed through her, as if her hands remembered what her mind had forgotten.

Cassandra discreetly activated the piano's pre-recorded function. "See? Even if you don't press properly, the music will play automatically," she whispered.

Just then, Isabella rose abruptly from her chair. "Wait a moment!"

All eyes turned as Isabella strode purposefully toward the piano.

With deliberate motion, Isabella removed a thick volume of sheet music from the piano rack. "Select any composition from this collection," she commanded, "but not the birthday song." Having spoken, she casually disabled the recording feature with a practiced flick of her wrist.

Cassandra's expression darkened. "Isabella, must you be so cruel? What has Evelyn ever done to deserve such treatment?"

Isabella arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Cruel? I'm merely asking her to play something elementary - even 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' would suffice."

"You're deliberately humiliating her!"

"Think what you will."

As their argument escalated, Evelyn had already begun leafing through the music sheets. To her astonishment, the notes made perfect sense - her fingers instinctively knew their corresponding positions on the keyboard.

Selecting the final piece in the collection, she positioned her hands. Though her mind remained blank, muscle memory took over.

The room filled with a hauntingly beautiful melody. Cassandra and Isabella's quarrel ceased mid-sentence, both women turning toward the piano in shock.

A profound silence enveloped the grand hall as every guest stared in disbelief. Evelyn's slender fingers moved with impossible grace across the keys, the tempo building with passionate intensity while her posture remained flawlessly composed.

Isabella rushed to examine the sheet music, her face paling when she recognized it - the most technically challenging piano piece in the world. Even her own mother, a concert pianist, struggled with this composition. Yet Evelyn played it with effortless mastery.

Genevieve's cheeks burned with humiliation. She lowered her head, the stark contrast between Evelyn's current performance and her earlier struggles painfully obvious.

As the final notes faded, thunderous applause erupted. Evelyn stared at her own trembling hands in wonder, unable to comprehend how her body remembered what her mind had forgotten.

When she turned, Richard and Eleanor beamed with unrestrained pride, their hands red from vigorous clapping.

But it was Liam's reaction that mattered most. His intense gaze held depths of emotion she couldn't decipher, yet the admiration shining through was unmistakable.

Cassandra approached with undisguised amazement. "Evelyn! You've been hiding this incredible talent? That was the most difficult piano piece in existence!" She shook her head in disbelief. "All my worry for nothing - you're absolutely brilliant!"

Beatrice's sour expression darkened further. "Hardly impressive," she muttered bitterly, unable to mask her jealousy.
###Chapter 111

Evelyn spun on her heels, her lips curling into a mocking smile as she addressed Beatrice. "Aunt Beatrice, is it truly so impossible for you to admit that I'm more accomplished than your precious Genevieve?"

Beatrice opened her mouth but no words came out, her face flushing with indignation.

Liam rose from his seat with deliberate slowness, his movements controlled as he reached for Evelyn's hand. "Come," he said quietly. "Let's retire to our chambers."

Though unsettled, Evelyn allowed herself to be led away, her fingers trembling slightly in his grasp.

Behind them, Cassandra launched into another heated argument with Beatrice.

Isabella was practically vibrating with rage. She stormed over to the sofa where Sebastian sat transfixed and delivered a sharp kick to his shin. "Had enough entertainment? Move your ass!"

Startled from his reverie, Sebastian scrambled after his furious wife.

Maxwell and Penelope exchanged bewildered glances, struggling to reconcile the virtuoso pianist they'd just witnessed with the same Evelyn they'd dismissed as unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Richard was whispering excitedly to Eleanor. "Who knew our Evelyn possessed such extraordinary talent, darling? My mother truly had impeccable taste!"

Eleanor nodded, her eyes wide with wonder. "Absolutely astonishing. Not only is she the renowned Isabella Grayson, but to play like that? It's beyond comprehension."

Richard shook his head in amazement. "I suspect this is merely the tip of the iceberg, my dear. Her musical and artistic gifts are extraordinary, particularly the latter."

"As the famous Isabella Grayson, she's never exploited her talents for personal gain. I believe these are simply her passions," Eleanor mused.

"Does she have other professions?" Eleanor inquired.

"I'm uncertain, but those vile rumors about her past must be fabrications. Someone clearly manufactured them!"

Eleanor's expression darkened. "Undoubtedly malicious lies. Evelyn is an exceptionally gifted and beautiful young woman. The notion that she would manipulate men for money is preposterous."

Richard's voice turned steely. "From this moment forward, anyone who dares slander Evelyn will answer to me."

Liam closed the bedroom door with deliberate care while Evelyn stood frozen in the center of the room, her mind racing. How could she possibly explain this to him?

Liam turned to face her, planting his hands on his hips. He drew a deep, steadying breath, but awe still coursed through his veins.

His gaze lifted to the ceiling as he exhaled sharply. Once again, Evelyn had left him utterly dumbfounded.

The depth of her talent and mystery was unfathomable. If Evelyn ever regained her full memories and personality, the revelation might send shockwaves through their entire world.

"Liam..." Evelyn's voice was small as she nervously twisted her fingers together.

He studied her intently before pressing two fingers to his temple, uncertain how to begin this conversation.

"This was my first time touching a piano in three years," Evelyn confessed quietly. "I didn't even know I could play."

Liam lowered his hand, his expression grave. "Natural talent can accelerate progress in painting. Some prodigies create masterpieces within a year or two of study."

Evelyn nodded cautiously.

"But piano is different," Liam continued. "It demands years of disciplined practice to develop muscle memory. The piece you played was technically demanding, yet you executed it flawlessly. This suggests you've played since childhood."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Me? Since childhood?"

"Undoubtedly."

"Do you honestly think my parents would have bought me a piano?"

"They lacked both the means and the foresight."

"Then how could I have learned? We were impoverished."

Liam grasped her shoulders firmly, leaning in with sudden intensity. "Perhaps you should retake the DNA test with the Carter family."

Evelyn's pulse quickened as a fragile hope blossomed in her chest. What if she wasn't Evelyn Carter? What if she could leave that sordid past behind forever?

"I'll contact my family immediately," she agreed without hesitation.

Liam's grip tightened slightly. "This time, I'll accompany you. We can't afford any mistakes."
###Chapter 112

Evelyn noticed Liam's cautious demeanor and tilted her head. "Liam, the previous DNA results seemed quite convincing. Why did you still doubt I wasn't Evelyn Carter?"

Admiration flickered in Liam's gaze. "A woman who can't boil water suddenly masters oil painting, plays Chopin flawlessly, and arranges flowers like a professional."

"Not to mention her expertise in quantum physics and fluency in four languages. She devours scientific journals like romance novels."

"Such a woman might not be aristocracy, but she'd never come from poverty either."

Evelyn realized Liam's reasoning was impeccable. His mind worked differently - he saw beyond surface appearances.

Most people judged her based on rumors, labeling her as some gold-digging social climber.

Yet Liam had always treated her with dignity. Never once had he used her past against her.

She stepped closer, her pulse quickening as she met his stormy eyes. "Liam, what if—"

He lowered his gaze. "Hmm?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. Her palms grew damp. Gathering courage, she prepared to confess what she'd buried for months.

Her voice barely above a whisper, she began, "If...I wasn't really Evelyn Carter—"

Liam's jaw tensed at her hesitation. "Go on."

"Would you...Could you ever—"

The words lodged in her throat. Her heart hammered against her ribs. The unspoken question burned her tongue.

Could you love me? Just a little?

Heat flooded her cheeks. The confession died on her lips, replaced by a safer question. "Would you help me find my real family?"

Disappointment shadowed Liam's features. Not the question he'd anticipated.

He cleared his throat, looking away. "Naturally."

His phone buzzed abruptly.

Liam checked the screen and excused himself to the balcony. Evelyn barely registered his muffled conversation.

When he returned thirty seconds later, tension radiated from his rigid posture.

"I need to go." He grabbed his car keys from the console.

Evelyn understood the implication - personal business. "What happened?"

"Victoria overdosed." His voice was gravel as he brushed past her.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

However Liam felt about Victoria now, the urgency in his movements betrayed lingering attachment.

Victoria still occupied sacred space in his heart. Disillusionment hadn't erased twenty years of love.

The door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn stood frozen, the chill seeping into her bones. She squeezed her eyes shut.

A bitter laugh escaped her. What had she been thinking?

She blinked back moisture, staring at the ceiling until the ache subsided. Then reached for her phone with trembling fingers.
###Chapter 113

Evelyn dialed her mother's number with trembling fingers.

The line rang endlessly. Just as she was about to give up, the call connected. A cacophony of slot machines and raucous laughter assaulted her ears.

"Harder! Faster! Goddamn it, I'm coming!"

"Hello? Who's this?" Dorothy's voice cut through the noise.

Evelyn flinched at her mother's crude language. She swallowed hard before responding. "It's me, Mom. Evelyn."

Dorothy Simmons' tone instantly transformed into sickly sweetness. "Oh, my precious girl! How are you? Is that old geezer treating you well?"

Evelyn hadn't disclosed her marriage to Liam. As far as her family knew, she was still working as a caretaker at Shadowmire.

"We're fine," Evelyn murmured.

Dorothy launched into a dramatic sigh. "I'm not doing well at all, darling. My blood pressure's through the roof, sugar levels are crazy high. And this damn rheumatism - I can't sleep through the night anymore."

"That worthless drunk you call a father keeps beating me when he staggers home. Oh Evelyn, life's so hard for me here."

"Your idiot brother's disappeared with mountains of debt. Hasn't given me a single penny to survive."

"I can't even get out of bed to work with this pain, Evelyn. Your father's no help either, always drowning in liquor. I don't know how much longer I can take this!"

"Oh, Evelyn—"

Evelyn couldn't stomach another word. "I understand, Mom. I'll wire you some money."

"Bless you, sweetheart!" Dorothy's voice turned gleeful.

"There's something else, Mom."

"No need to be shy. What is it?"

"Could you come to the hospital with me?"

Dorothy's voice sharpened. "Are you sick?"

"Mom, I—" Evelyn's throat closed up.

Dorothy had always praised Evelyn for being obedient and kind. She doted on Evelyn precisely because of these qualities.

If Evelyn mentioned the DNA test outright, Dorothy would never agree. After all, why would she let go of such a dutiful daughter who funded her lifestyle?

Evelyn quickly changed tactics. "Mom, the doctors think I might have a hereditary immune disorder. They need to run genetic tests on us to confirm."

"My poor baby! How did this happen?" Dorothy burst into theatrical sobs.

Her distress seemed genuine. Whether she mourned for Evelyn's health or her potential loss of income remained unclear.

"I'll text you the hospital address. We can schedule an appointment."

"Of course, darling. Get treated immediately!" Dorothy urged with sudden enthusiasm.

"I will, Mom. Goodbye." Evelyn ended the call.

Meanwhile, Dorothy retreated to a shadowy corner of the casino. She perched on a stool, lighting a cigarette with practiced fingers.

A memory surfaced - that wealthy man who paid handsomely for information about Evelyn.

Salivating at the thought of another payout, Dorothy scrolled through her contacts.

"Dr. Whitmore? Is that you?"

"Speaking," Julian answered.

"My daughter Evelyn just called—"

Dorothy proceeded to relay every detail of Evelyn's situation, her voice barely audible over the casino's din.
###Chapter 114

Liam's sports car screeched to a halt outside Wright Manor's gated entrance. He barely remembered turning off the engine before sprinting toward the grand double doors.

The opulent parlor held three figures - an elderly couple seated on a velvet Chesterfield sofa, and a brooding man standing by the marble fireplace.

"Liam?" Julian Whitmore straightened in surprise. "What brings you here at this hour?"

Liam's chest heaved as he struggled to catch his breath. He managed a curt nod. "Archibald. Margaret."

Margaret dabbed at her red-rimmed eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. "I called him. Our granddaughter just tried to take her own life! How much longer will you keep playing the tyrant?"

Archibald's face darkened. "Must you always interfere? Liam has responsibilities - a wife waiting at home! Do you ever consider the consequences?"

"I consider Victoria's life!" Margaret shot back, her voice breaking. "That's all that matters now!"

The old man's hands trembled with suppressed rage. "You're impossible!"

Liam stepped between them. "What happened to Victoria?"

"A scratch on her wrist," Archibald grumbled. "The drama queen will live."

Margaret pointed an accusing finger. "This is your doing! Grounding her for weeks? Cutting her off from Liam? She's loved him since they were children!"

She turned pleading eyes to Liam. "The psychiatrist says she's severely depressed. All she talks about is ending her life. After losing our son and daughter-in-law, must we lose Victoria too?"

Julian remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"Enough!" Archibald bellowed. "Must you air our family troubles in front of company?"

Margaret's lips trembled. "You brought him into this family, not I!"

Seeing the argument escalating, Liam interjected. "Where is she?"

"Upstairs," Archibald relented. "Two physicians are with her."

Without another word, Liam took the grand staircase two steps at a time.

The master bedroom smelled of antiseptic and despair. Victoria lay propped against silk pillows, her bandaged wrist resting on the duvet. When she saw Liam, fresh tears spilled down her hollow cheeks.

He pulled a chair to her bedside. "Victoria..."

"You came," she whispered hoarsely. "I thought you'd forgotten me."

Liam's jaw tightened. "What were you thinking?"

Her fingers plucked at the blanket. "What's left for me? My parents are gone. My grandparents despise me. And you..." A sob caught in her throat. "You chose Evelyn over me."

"This isn't about Evelyn," Liam said firmly.

"Isn't it?" Her voice rose hysterically. "Everything changed when she appeared! You used to care about me!"

Liam exhaled sharply. "Look at your actions, Victoria. Destroying eighty million in research? Framing innocent scientists? Nearly giving Margaret a heart attack with your schemes?"

Her face went deathly pale. "I only did those things because-"

"Because what?" Liam cut in. "Because you couldn't accept that I love someone else?"

With a wail, Victoria threw off the covers and bolted for the balcony. Liam caught her arm just as she reached the railing.

"Let me go!" she shrieked, struggling against his grip. "I want to die!"

Liam hauled her back inside as she collapsed against him, her body wracked with violent sobs. The two physicians rushed in, their faces etched with concern.

In that moment, Liam realized with chilling clarity - this wasn't love. This was obsession. And it would destroy them all if it continued.
###Chapter 115

The medical team rushed forward immediately. They comforted Victoria while addressing Liam, "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Wright is in an extremely fragile state right now."

"It would be best if you avoid further upsetting her. Perhaps hold her and provide some comfort."

Liam hesitated for a brief moment, his chest tightening as he watched Victoria's shoulders shake with sobs.

He finally pulled her into an embrace. "Don't cry now, and please don't do anything reckless again."

Victoria buried her face against his chest, her voice breaking. "Have you forgotten, Liam? That day at the airport when I left Aldenria, you made me promise never to forget you or love anyone else! You swore you'd wait for me in Aldenria until I returned!"

Her nails dug into his sleeves. "You said you'd wait your whole life for me. Now I've come back, yet you refuse to marry me..."

The memory of their painful separation flooded Liam's mind as vividly as if it were yesterday. How could he ever forget the agony of parting with his first love?

Yet now, standing here with Victoria, he felt none of the old emotions - no attraction, no nervous flutter, not even the faintest spark of desire.

Perhaps people's hearts truly change with time. Or maybe he was simply an unfaithful bastard.

Gently stroking her hair, he spoke in the tone one might use with a younger sister. "I'm sorry, Victoria."

Liam ended up spending the entire day at Wright Manor to keep Victoria company.

That night, he texted Evelyn: "Won't be coming home tonight. Get some rest."

Evelyn had anticipated this outcome. Despite her mental preparation, a heavy weight settled in her chest. Sleep eluded her that night.

The next morning found Evelyn waiting outside the hospital entrance under the oppressive midday sun, her heart leaden.

Dark clouds loomed overhead, the air thick with humidity. Not a single breeze stirred the stagnant atmosphere.

Dorothy leaned against a pillar nearby, her patience wearing thin. "Who are we waiting for, dear? We should go inside before the queues get longer."

Evelyn remained silent, the light in her eyes dimmed to embers.

Eventually, a sleek black sedan pulled up. Ryan and Adrian stepped out, approaching Evelyn with respectful nods. "Mrs. Blackwood."

Dorothy, unable to hear clearly from her position, grew curious about these imposing men treating her daughter with such deference and moved closer.

Evelyn's hope had already withered. "Where's Mr. Blackwood?" she asked weakly.

"Mr. Blackwood couldn't make it, so he sent us to accompany you instead."

With a quiet nod, Evelyn turned and walked into the hospital, Dorothy hurrying after her in confusion.

Ryan and Adrian flanked Evelyn throughout the examination, particularly during the blood test. They revealed their identities to the attending physician, warning against any mistakes in no uncertain terms.

After the blood draw, the two men remained to oversee the testing process while Evelyn and Dorothy stepped outside. Rain had begun to fall, the cold droplets soaking into the pavement.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her constricted chest. "It's raining, Mom," she murmured.

Dorothy glanced skyward. "Doesn't look like it'll stop soon."

"I feel feverish. I think I'll walk in the rain for a while. You should take a cab home."

"W-what?"

Before Dorothy could react, Evelyn had already stepped into the downpour.

"You'll catch your death, foolish girl!" Dorothy called after her, but made no move to stop her daughter.

As the rain soaked through Evelyn's clothes and hair, her body grew numb with cold. Her vision blurred, though she could still make out the vague shape of the path ahead.

Tears mixed with raindrops on her cheeks. Each heartbeat sent fresh waves of pain through her chest.

She told herself this was just the rain's doing. Nothing to do with Liam at all.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn walked alone through the pouring rain for two hours to return to Blackwood Manor. By the time she arrived, her body trembled with exhaustion.

After a hot shower, she collapsed onto the bed with damp hair. Only sleep could silence the tormenting thoughts of Liam.

She didn't leave her room all day, her appetite gone. When midnight came, she awoke burning with fever. The realization of her illness struck like lightning.

Her fingers hovered over her phone to call Liam when she noticed his text notification. Her heart pounded as she opened it.

"My heart still belongs to Victoria," the message read.

Those five words stabbed through Evelyn's chest like jagged glass.

Tears blurred her vision as she slammed the phone down. Tilting her head back, she wiped the escaping tears with trembling fingers.

She drew a shuddering breath, holding it until her lungs burned. But the pain only intensified, breaking her fragile composure.

Biting her lip until she tasted blood, Evelyn swallowed the sobs clawing at her throat. Minutes passed before the storm inside her subsided.

With shaking hands, she typed her reply. "Understood. File the divorce papers whenever convenient. Just inform me."

"I can proceed whenever you wish. The decision is yours."

His words turned her blood to ice.

What kind of cruel game was this? Her love meant so little? Had she wasted years on this sham marriage?

She powered off her phone and stumbled toward the medicine cabinet.

Her knees buckled the moment her feet touched the floor. The world spun violently as she crashed onto the hardwood.

A sharp cry escaped her lips as pain radiated from her palms. Fresh tears joined the cold sweat on her face.

Her physical agony paled against the crushing weight in her chest. The darkness of despair threatened to swallow her whole.

Somehow, she dragged herself back to bed. Pulling the covers over her head, she surrendered to oblivion.

Medicine no longer mattered. In this abyss of suffering, death might bring the only true relief.

Meanwhile, Liam emerged from the guest bathroom in fresh clothes.

Victoria had just finished deleting the incriminating messages. She continued her charade, carefully blow-drying his phone.

A triumphant gleam flashed in her eyes as she handed it back. "Good as new, Liam. I took care of it for you."

He checked the device briefly before pocketing it.

"That clumsy maid! Spilling my bathwater all over you. Grandmother will dismiss her tomorrow."

Liam shook his head. "No need. Just wet clothes, nothing more."

"If you insist."

"I should return home." Worry gnawed at him - leaving Evelyn alone all night might have triggered her anxiety.

Victoria sprang forward, clutching his arm. On cue, tears spilled down her cheeks. "Don't leave me, Liam! How will I survive without you?"

"Victoria..." His brow furrowed in frustration.

Margaret entered at the commotion, wringing her hands. "Please, Liam. As a personal favor. Stay a while longer? I fear what she might do if you leave now."

Exasperation colored his voice. "What Victoria needs is professional medical care, Mrs. Hoffis."
###Chapter 117

"Liam, please don't go..." Victoria's desperate pleas echoed through the grand hallway.

Margaret clung to Liam's arm, her heart breaking for her granddaughter's distress.

Ryan and Adrian had finally secured the DNA results after personally supervising the blood analysis. The samples hadn't been compromised - only authorized medical staff had handled them.

They rushed back to Blackwood Manor immediately, the sealed envelope burning in Ryan's pocket. Evelyn needed to see this with her own eyes.

She sat motionless on the balcony chair, a cashmere shawl draped over her slender shoulders. The evening light painted her pale face with golden hues as she accepted the documents.

A crisp autumn breeze swept past, but Evelyn's hands remained steady. With deliberate movements, she broke the seal and unfolded the report.

Her eyes scanned the page once. Twice. Then she carefully refolded it, her expression unreadable. "Inform Mr. Blackwood that nothing has changed," she said quietly. "I'm Evelyn Carter. That's all. He can stop his investigations now."

Ryan and Adrian exchanged disappointed glances. "Yes, Mrs. Blackwood," they replied in unison.

A sudden coughing fit wracked Evelyn's fragile frame.

"Madam, you're unwell," Ryan said urgently. "Shall I call Dr. Whitmore?"

"It's nothing. Leave me." Evelyn leaned back, closing her eyes against the fading sunlight.

Adrian hesitated. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood has been-"

Evelyn raised a hand. "No more explanations, please."

They withdrew silently, leaving her alone with the twilight.

Evelyn drew her knees to her chest, burying her face in the soft fabric of her dress. Her shoulders trembled slightly as silent tears fell.

The evening breeze carried away her quiet sobs.

For three days, Evelyn remained in her rooms, barely touching the meals the staff brought. When she finally emerged, she knew there was one last visit she needed to make before leaving this place.

With careful hands, she applied rouge to her ashen cheeks.

At Wright Manor, she found Margaret sitting in the garden, staring blankly at the roses.

"Grandmother," Evelyn called softly.

Margaret turned slowly. "Who... who are you?"

Evelyn's smile faltered. She turned away quickly, pressing a hand to her mouth. How had Margaret's condition deteriorated so rapidly since their last meeting?

Swallowing her grief, Evelyn knelt before the older woman. "I'm Evelyn, Grandmother. Your youngest granddaughter-in-law."

"My youngest... which grandson was that again?"

Evelyn's heart clenched. Had she forgotten Liam too?

"His name is Liam," Evelyn whispered.

"Ah yes, Liam. And you said you were...?"

Evelyn didn't answer. Instead, she took Margaret's wrinkled hands in hers, memorizing their warmth as tears spilled down her cheeks.

In this moment, memory seemed more precious than life itself.

If she died tomorrow, at least she would live on in the hearts of those who loved her. But to be forgotten by someone who once cherished her...

That pain cut deeper than any blade.

"Take care of yourself, Grandmother," Evelyn managed through her tears. "I'll always love you, whether you remember me or not."
###Chapter 118

The golden hues of sunset faded into inky darkness as evening descended.

Evelyn Carter had spent every waking hour with Margaret in Shadowmire Island. Exhaustion weighed heavily on her shoulders as she returned to Blackwood Manor, her illness still lingering.

Dragging her feet across the marble foyer, a venomous voice sliced through the silence. "Well, well, if it isn't our little fraud finally gracing us with her presence."

Evelyn turned to face Beatrice Thornton, who stood with one manicured hand clutching a phone, the other perched arrogantly on her hip.

"The legendary artist Ms. Grayson just posted her first video in three years," Beatrice sneered. "She explained her mysterious disappearance was due to a prolonged illness. How convenient for imposters like you to hide behind such excuses."

Beatrice thrust her phone forward, the screen displaying a young woman with striking features. Disgust twisted Beatrice's face as Evelyn glanced at the verified Isabella Grayson account.

"I never claimed to be Isabella," Evelyn said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Before Beatrice could retort, Cassandra Blake's crisp tones interrupted. "Aunt Beatrice, surely you're not naive enough to believe everything you see online? Accounts can be hacked, identities stolen."

Cassandra moved gracefully toward Evelyn, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Why don't we settle this properly? Have one of Evelyn's paintings authenticated by the National Art Institute?"

Beatrice's lips curled. "Nonsense! The real Isabella Grayson has shown her face to the world. Your little charade is over, fraud."

Cassandra's fingers twitched at her sides, her usually composed features darkening with anger. Evelyn gently caught her wrist. "It's not worth it, Cassandra. Let her believe what she wants."

"I trust you completely, Evelyn," Cassandra murmured, giving her arm a comforting squeeze.

Evelyn offered a tired smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Thank you."

Cassandra studied Evelyn's pale complexion with concern. "You look dreadful. Have you seen a doctor about your illness?"

"I'm fine, really," Evelyn lied smoothly. "Just need some rest." She turned toward the grand staircase without another word.

Beatrice's mocking voice followed her. "I heard Victoria Dawson attempted suicide over unrequited love. Liam's been keeping vigil at her bedside. No wonder our little fraud here is sick - her meal ticket is slipping away."

Cassandra whirled on her aunt. "You'd sell your soul to see Liam divorce Evelyn and marry your precious goddaughter, wouldn't you?"

"What's wrong with Genevieve? She's infinitely better than this con artist!" Beatrice shot back.

Evelyn tuned out their bickering and ascended to Liam's study. Sitting at his mahogany desk, she drafted divorce papers with clinical precision on his computer.

The printer hummed as it produced two copies. Evelyn signed both without hesitation, her signature steady despite the tremor in her hands.

For fifteen agonizing minutes, she stared at her phone's contact list, her thumb hovering over Liam's name.

Finally, with a deep breath that did nothing to calm her racing heart, she pressed call.

He answered on the second ring. "Evelyn." His voice, usually so commanding, carried an unfamiliar note of guilt.
###Chapter 119

Didn't Liam worry Victoria would be jealous when he used that affectionate nickname for Evelyn?

Evelyn shut her eyes tightly, her voice trembling as she whispered, "Can you come home soon?"

Liam hesitated. "Victoria is—"

Evelyn interrupted sharply. "Never mind. Just send someone to pick me up. There's something I need to give you."

Liam's curiosity was piqued. "What is it?"

A heavy silence stretched between them before Evelyn finally exhaled. "Divorce papers."

The line went dead silent. The suffocating tension could be felt even through the phone.

Evelyn's chest constricted painfully. Each breath felt like swallowing shards of glass.

After what felt like an eternity, Liam's voice came through, firm and decisive. "I'll be there immediately."

Was he that eager to end their marriage?

"Fine," Evelyn forced out before ending the call.

She slumped back in her chair, letting her phone clatter to the floor. Her entire body felt drained, the migraine pounding behind her eyes becoming unbearable.

The tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, tracing hot paths down her pale cheeks.

Meanwhile, Liam strode back into the living room from the balcony, his expression grim. "Archibald, I must return home immediately. There's an urgent matter."

Victoria immediately dropped the fruit she was holding and rushed to cling to Liam's arm, fresh tears springing to her eyes. "No! You can't leave me, Liam! Please!"

Archibald rose angrily. "Let him go, Victoria! He's already wasted enough time indulging your tantrums! Have you no shame? The man has a wife and responsibilities!"

Margaret frowned at her granddaughter's distress. "Take Victoria with you, Liam. She'll behave better by your side."

"Don't be ridiculous, woman!" Archibald snapped.

"I don't care! I need Liam! I can't live without him!" Victoria sobbed hysterically, her grip tightening.

Liam took a deep breath and forcibly peeled her fingers away. Turning to the private physicians, his voice turned icy. "Restrain her if she attempts self-harm. Administer IV fluids if she refuses nourishment. Sedate her if necessary. Under no circumstances is she to be left unattended."

Victoria froze in shock. Even the doctors looked taken aback.

Liam's glare intensified. "Am I understood?"

The physicians quickly nodded. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood."

Without another word, Liam shoved Victoria toward the medical staff and strode out.

Victoria struggled violently, breaking free to chase after him.

Archibald's face darkened with fury. "Victoria Hoffis! If you take one more step, consider yourself disinherited!"

By the time Victoria reached the doorway, Liam's car was already speeding away.

She whirled back, stomping her foot. "Why didn't you help me, Grandfather? I'm your only heir, and you let him leave!"

Archibald massaged his temples, caught between his hysterical granddaughter and stubborn wife. The situation was becoming intolerable.

From the upstairs landing, Julian observed the scene with quiet amusement. He had to admire Victoria's performance.

The girl might lack education and talent, but she certainly knew how to manipulate a situation.
###Chapter 120

Evelyn retreated to her bedroom with the signed divorce papers in hand.

She curled up on the balcony chair, arms wrapped tightly around her knees. The evening sky darkened as she waited for Liam's return, her chin resting on her folded arms.

Exactly sixty-three minutes later, the bedroom door clicked open.

Every muscle in Evelyn's body tensed at the sound.

The door shut with finality. Heavy footsteps echoed through the silent suite.

Liam's breathing came in ragged bursts, unnaturally loud in the stillness. He strode onto the balcony and braced himself against the railing, his piercing gaze fixed on Evelyn.

Four days apart had hollowed her cheeks and drained the color from her skin. The sight made his fingers tighten around the metal rail until his knuckles turned white.

Why couldn't this stubborn woman take proper care of herself?

Evelyn's shadowed eyes lifted from the twilight horizon to meet his. "Thank you for coming." She unfolded her legs and planted her feet firmly on the ground.

Liam turned his face away, drawing a deep breath that did nothing to ease the vise around his heart. "Why now?" he demanded.

Now?

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips as she nudged the documents across the glass table. "I've signed already. Review them at your leisure."

The railing groaned under Liam's grip, veins standing out along his forearms. Each heartbeat sent fresh waves of pain radiating through his chest. "Victoria tried to kill herself. That's why I—"

"Spare me the explanations." Evelyn cut him off sharply. "I refuse to play the other woman any longer."

"You were never the other woman!" Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous growl. "You're my wife."

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the fabric of her blouse as her smile turned sardonic. Was she really?

Everyone knew Liam and Victoria shared a childhood bond deeper than marriage vows. What was Evelyn if not an inconvenient obstacle?

Besides, Liam had promised to tell her if his feelings for Victoria remained. Since he wouldn't broach the subject, she would. She'd borne the pain long enough.

"Let's end this, Liam." Her voice held steady despite the tremor in her hands.

Agony lanced through Liam's chest. He turned toward the night sky, drawing ragged breaths that did nothing to calm the storm inside. The railing trembled beneath his white-knuckled grip.

This wasn't what he wanted. Yes, he'd promised to respect her decisions—but not this one. Never this.

The ache persisted, sharp and unrelenting.

When Liam turned back, his gaze burned into Evelyn. "Margaret will be devastated," he said softly.

The mention of his grandmother shattered Evelyn's composure. Tears welled instantly. "She doesn't remember me anymore," she choked out.

Liam stiffened. Seeing Evelyn's tears turned the pain in his chest to molten lead.

He'd known Margaret's condition would deteriorate. Had prepared for it.

Yet watching Evelyn's silent suffering made him want to crush her against his chest and never let go.

Instead, he schooled his features into careful neutrality. "Is this really because of Margaret's condition? Or is this punishment for my staying with the Dawsons these past days?"
###Chapter 121

Evelyn regained her composure with a sharp inhale. "That's enough, Liam. We've already settled everything. Let's just end this meaningless marriage."

The words hit Liam like a physical blow, his chest tightening painfully.

He forced a bitter smile, striding to the table to pick up the divorce papers.

As he flipped through the documents, Evelyn silently placed a black pen beside them. "Sign it and we'll get the certificate at city hall tomorrow. I don't want to drag this out - I'm relocating to the coast."

Liam's fingers froze. The coast? She was really cutting all ties?

Frustration burned through him as he scanned the pages without reading a single line.

With a scoff, he tossed the papers down. "This is unacceptable. It needs revisions."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "What's the issue? No children involved, I'm waiving alimony - these terms favor you. What exactly is the problem?"

Liam's eyes darkened. "That's precisely it. If word gets out I left my ex-wife with nothing, what would that say about me?"

Evelyn nearly laughed at his wounded pride. After a beat, she shrugged. "Fine. Write me a check then."

But Liam suddenly grabbed her wrist, yanking her up from the chair. "Are you that desperate to be rid of me?" he growled.

The irony wasn't lost on Evelyn.

After his obvious affection for Victoria and that damning text message, shouldn't he be celebrating their split? Unless this was all some twisted performance for his mistress?

Meeting his gaze squarely, she said, "Maybe I am."

The words visibly wounded him. Just then, his phone rang.

Liam released her to answer, his expression shifting as he listened. "Understood. On my way." He ended the call and moved toward the door.

Evelyn watched silently, her heart sinking with each step. When his hand touched the doorknob, he paused abruptly.

Normally, he'd never explain himself. But something made him turn back. "Emergency at base. We'll discuss this later." The door clicked shut behind him.

Alone, Evelyn collapsed into the chair, pressing her palms to her aching eyes.

Who knew divorce could hurt this much?

Even knowing Liam didn't love her, their marriage had persisted through circumstance - a gilded cage slowly rusting shut around her.
###Chapter 122

The pale moonlight filtered through the dense canopy, casting eerie shadows across the balcony.

Evelyn Carter twisted restlessly beneath her silk sheets before finally succumbing to exhaustion. But peace remained elusive.

Tiny droplets of sweat formed on her forehead as her breathing became erratic. In the suffocating darkness, she found herself wandering through an unfamiliar void. An icy wind clawed at her exposed skin, raising goosebumps along her arms.

From the abyss, disembodied voices whispered like ghosts in an ancient tomb.

"Evelyn, help us! It's so cold... Run, Evelyn! Don't turn back!" The desperate pleas tore at her heart with each syllable.

She ran blindly through the endless night, her senses overwhelmed by primal terror as something monstrous pursued her.

The sinister chant echoed through the void: "Kill her... Kill her, and the fortune is yours... Kill her!"

A shadowy figure materialized before her, its glowing eyes piercing the darkness. Bloodstained hands reached for her throat, squeezing the life from her-

Evelyn jolted awake with a gasp, her fingers flying to her neck. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows, banishing the nightmare's remnants.

She scoffed at the absurdity. Imagining her parents begging for help? In reality, they only ever contacted her for money.

Shivering from cold sweat, she threw off the covers. After grabbing fresh clothes, she headed for the shower.

Thirty minutes later, dressed in casual attire, she descended the grand staircase. The murmur of voices from the living room made her pause.

"You mustn't take such risks again, Victoria. How would I face your grandparents if something happened?" Eleanor Blackwood's worried voice carried clearly.

Victoria Dawson offered a reassuring smile. "Don't fret, Mrs. Blackwood. I've learned my lesson. Besides, Liam has been wonderfully attentive these past days. His company has been most comforting."

Eleanor sighed. "This is all Margaret's doing. She never should have forced those two together when there's no love between them. None of this would be happening otherwise."

Victoria lowered her voice conspiratorially. "I don't believe Grandmother intended this. Someone's been manipulating her."

Eleanor offered an awkward smile, unwilling to speak ill of Evelyn in her own home.

Spotting Evelyn on the stairs, Victoria raised her voice deliberately. "Liam told me he's only staying married out of concern for Grandmother's health. Once she passes, he'll divorce Evelyn and make me his wife."

"We all know the truth, yet you keep endangering yourself," Eleanor sighed.

"Not anymore," Victoria chirped.

Eleanor patted Victoria's hand. "We must be patient. Though prolonging this situation isn't fair to Evelyn."

Victoria's brow furrowed. "Liam will make proper arrangements for her."

"I should hope so," Eleanor murmured.

Unnoticed by Eleanor, Victoria's eyes flashed with irritation at her unexpected defense of Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's hands clenched into fists. The confirmation that Liam Blackwood planned to divorce her after Margaret's death struck like a physical blow.

Suppressing her anguish, she continued downstairs. Victoria sprang up with theatrical surprise. "Good morning, Evelyn!"

Eleanor's head snapped toward the staircase, but Evelyn ignored them both, making straight for the front door.

As her fingers touched the handle, her phone rang. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

Behind her, Victoria watched Evelyn's retreating form with triumphant glee shining in her eyes.
###Chapter 123

Evelyn's phone vibrated with an unknown number. She hesitated before answering, greeted by a trembling female voice.

"Hello? Evelyn? It's Rosalind. Do you remember me?" The voice cracked with emotion.

"Rosalind?" Evelyn's confusion made Victoria stiffen nearby, her ears straining to catch every word.

"I'm sorry for calling out of the blue. Your mother gave me your number. I...I have nowhere else to turn." Rosalind's voice broke.

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone vanished from her grasp. She spun around to find Victoria clutching it with white knuckles.

Victoria's hand shook as she abruptly ended the call. "Forgive me, Evelyn," she whispered. "But Liam and I...we're meant to be together."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed at Victoria's bizarre behavior. Swallowing her anger, she extended her palm. "Give. It. Back."

Eleanor Blackwood frowned at the scene. "Victoria, what on earth? Evelyn was speaking with someone!"

Victoria forced a smile. "I-I just needed to apologize properly. Their marriage was never real since Liam chose—"

Disgust twisted Evelyn's features as she snatched her phone back. Victoria reached for it but stopped, realizing she couldn't prevent Rosalind from reaching out.

Phone secured, Evelyn stormed out of the Blackwood residence, desperate to escape Victoria's toxic presence.

Outside the gates, she immediately redialed. Rosalind answered with gut-wrenching sobs.

"Please Evelyn," she begged. "We've spent everything on Dad's cancer treatments. The medical bills...we're drowning. I need that money back."

Evelyn's heart ached at the raw pain in Rosalind's voice. Though the memories were gone, the anguish felt real.

"I'm sorry, I don't remember you. I lost my memories, but I want to—"

"How can you forget?" Rosalind's voice shattered like glass. "We were inseparable! I helped you through everything—homework, chores, even shared my allowance when you were broke!"

"Remember ninth grade when you dropped out? You got so sick working odd jobs. I nursed you back to health and gave you twenty thousand for hospital bills."

"In college, I worked three jobs to save another twenty thousand—all for you! And now when I need help, you pretend not to know me?"

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face. If Rosalind spoke truth, she deserved every ounce of this pain.

"Which hospital is your father at? I'll come immediately," Evelyn said urgently.

Though startled by the offer, Rosalind provided the address. Evelyn rushed back inside, changed clothes, and grabbed her purse with frantic energy.

Victoria watched her departure with ice in her veins. This meeting couldn't happen—she'd make sure of it.
###Chapter 124

Evelyn made a quick detour to the organic market before heading to the hospital. She carefully selected a premium fruit basket filled with exotic fruits.

The oncology ward was easy to find with Rosalind's precise directions. The sterile hospital smell hit her nostrils as she stepped off the elevator.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn lightly rapped on the door marked 407. When no answer came, she cautiously pushed it open.

Six occupied beds lined the cramped room. Evelyn's eyes darted between the patients, unsure which one was Rosalind's father.

Suddenly, a petite woman with vintage cat-eye glasses appeared from behind a curtain, clutching a stainless steel water bottle.

Judging by her youthful appearance, Evelyn guessed this must be Rosalind. She offered a tentative smile. "Rosalind Fairchild?"

The woman froze, then nodded slowly. "That's me. And you are...?"

"I'm Evelyn Carter."

Rosalind's eyes widened as she studied Evelyn's face intently. Evelyn set the fruit basket on the bedside table, noticing the frail man sleeping in the adjacent bed.

Not wanting to disturb him, Evelyn gestured toward the hallway. "Shall we talk outside?"

Rosalind snapped out of her trance. She placed the water bottle down and adjusted the privacy curtains before following Evelyn out.

They stood by a large window overlooking the hospital gardens. After an awkward silence, Rosalind spoke first.

"What's this charade about? Do you really think pretending to have amnesia will make your debts disappear?" Her voice dripped with venom.

Evelyn sighed. "I know how this sounds, but I genuinely don't remember the past three years."

Rosalind adjusted her glasses with a scoff. "Did you get hit by a truck or something?"

"The doctors said I had extensive facial reconstruction," Evelyn explained.

Rosalind scrutinized her face skeptically. "Impossible! Your features look completely natural. The subtle changes - softer jawline, fuller cheeks - they make you look younger. Like you've mastered every current beauty trend."

Evelyn gave a tired smile. Despite her doubts, the DNA results confirmed she was Evelyn Carter.

Rosalind pulled out her phone, displaying transaction records. "See these? These are all the times you begged me for money."

"You took over $40,000 in transfers and another $20,000 in cash."

"I trusted our friendship. Didn't even ask for an IOU. If you have any decency left, start repaying me. Even small installments would help."

Evelyn's heart sank as she scrolled through the records. She handed the phone back with trembling fingers. "I'm so sorry, Rosalind. I was a terrible friend."

Rosalind's expression remained stony. When Evelyn reached for her purse, Rosalind watched warily as she asked, "How much are your father's medical bills?"

Rosalind hesitated. "$20,000 so far. He needs an operation that'll cost around $200,000."

"Plus we owe $300,000 to relatives who helped us."

"Let me make a call." Evelyn stepped away, leaning against the wall as she dialed. Her entire body tensed with nervous energy.

"Evelyn?" Liam's voice came through immediately, surprise evident in his tone.

"It's me," she whispered.

The line went silent for a beat too long. Evelyn broke the tension first. "Can we-"

"I'm swamped with work right now. The divorce papers will have to wait. We'll discuss this later," Liam said curtly before the line went dead.
###Chapter 125

Evelyn hurried to clarify, "This isn't about the divorce. I just need to talk to you for a moment."

"Go ahead." To her astonishment, Liam's voice had lost its earlier iciness, softening noticeably.

Evelyn glanced at Rosalind, whose face was etched with anxiety and solemnity. Steeling herself, she took a deep breath before asking, "Could I withdraw six hundred thousand dollars from your account? I swear I'll pay you back."

Liam responded immediately, "No need for repayment. It's your card. Use it however you wish."

"Thank you, Liam." Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest, yet an uneasy guilt still gnawed at her despite his reassurance.

The line fell silent again. Sensing the palpable tension, Evelyn moved to end the call when Liam suddenly spoke.

"Is something wrong?" His voice carried genuine concern.

Evelyn hesitated, reluctant to burden him with her troubles when he was already swamped with work. "It's nothing serious. I can manage," she asserted.

Liam simply hummed in response.

Just as her fingers hovered over the end call button, his voice stopped her. "Wait."

Confused, Evelyn asked, "Was there something else?"

After a brief pause, Liam's voice dropped to a softer tone. "Tell me if it becomes too much to handle."

Evelyn agreed and disconnected, an unexpected loneliness settling over her. She hadn't anticipated how deeply this simple phone call would stir her wounded heart.

On the other end, Liam stared out the window with a heavy sigh. His subordinates exchanged surprised glances behind him - never had they seen their commander interrupt an important meeting for a phone call.

They speculated it must have been Harrison Pierce calling, and satisfied with this explanation, quietly waited for the meeting to resume.

Meanwhile, Evelyn approached Rosalind, bank card in hand. "I'm repaying your hundred thousand with interest," she stated firmly. "And I'm lending you another five hundred thousand to cover your father's medical bills and family debts."

Rosalind's eyes widened in disbelief. Tears welled as Evelyn continued, "Truthfully, I'm borrowing this money myself and will need to repay it. Let's draft an IOU for the five hundred thousand."

Overcome with emotion, Rosalind covered her trembling lips. Finally, her father could have his surgery. Not only was Evelyn repaying her with interest, but offering this substantial loan to relieve her family's burdens.

After knowing Evelyn for years, this compassionate act seemed completely at odds with the selfish Evelyn Carter she remembered.

"Thank you," Rosalind choked out between tears. "I'll never forget this kindness. Let me write that IOU immediately."

As Rosalind hurried to the ward, Evelyn wrestled with lingering guilt. When Rosalind returned with the signed document, Evelyn completed the transfer without hesitation.

With her worries eased, Rosalind pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace, her body shaking with quiet sobs. Evelyn returned the hug gently before asking, "Could we... start over?"

"You've really lost your memories?" Rosalind searched Evelyn's face doubtfully.

Evelyn met her gaze with earnest sincerity. Rosalind's teary face broke into a smile as she nodded. She'd never wanted to befriend the old Evelyn Carter, but this woman before her was different.

"Absolutely. A fresh start," Rosalind affirmed, her smile radiant with gratitude.
###Chapter 126

The clock chimed noon as Evelyn Carter stepped through the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor. She'd deliberately timed her return to avoid running into Victoria Dawson.

Yet fate had other plans. Victoria was waiting in the grand foyer, perched on the antique chaise like a spider in its web.

"Welcome home, Evelyn," Victoria cooed, her saccharine smile not reaching her cold blue eyes.

Evelyn suppressed a shudder at the false warmth in Victoria's voice. She forced a polite nod, acutely aware of Liam's family watching their exchange.

"Evelyn dear, could you join us?" Eleanor Blackwood gestured toward the sitting area.

After exchanging pleasantries with Richard and Cassandra, Evelyn found herself seated between Victoria and the elder Blackwoods. The air hummed with unspoken tension.

Eleanor kept wringing her hands. Richard cleared his throat repeatedly. Cassandra kept biting her lip. Something was clearly wrong.

When Eleanor hesitated for the third time, Evelyn leaned forward. "Is there something you need to tell me?"

Eleanor's strained smile faltered. She nudged Richard. "Perhaps you should explain."

Richard's eyebrows shot up before he turned to Cassandra. "Your sister can explain better."

Cassandra looked like a deer caught in headlights. Watching the Blackwoods' awkward dance, Evelyn's stomach twisted. Were they about to ask for a divorce?

"Just say it," Evelyn said softly, bracing herself. "I can handle the truth."

After an uncomfortable silence, Cassandra finally spoke. "Victoria has been diagnosed with severe clinical depression. Her doctor says it's quite serious."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. She'd seen Victoria's "symptoms" firsthand - perfectly timed tears when Liam was around, disappearing when he left.

Cassandra continued, "She's been living with her grandparents, but Margaret travels constantly and Archibald is always at the office. Julian works long hospital shifts..."

Realization dawned. "You want Ms. Dawson to move in here," Evelyn stated flatly.

The relieved nods around the room confirmed her suspicion. Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. This was Victoria's latest scheme to drive her out of Blackwood Manor.

Seeing Evelyn's expression, Eleanor rushed to explain. "Liam's hardly ever home anyway. It won't disrupt your life. Victoria just needs companionship."

Evelyn bit back a bitter laugh. The decision had clearly been made without her. "Do whatever you think is best," she murmured.

Victoria's triumphant smile sent chills down Evelyn's spine. "I knew Evelyn would understand," she purred, flashing a look of pure malice when no one else was watching.

Evelyn's blood boiled, but she kept her composure. She wouldn't give Victoria the satisfaction of seeing her break. Not when Liam remained oblivious to Victoria's manipulations.

That night, Evelyn locked herself in her room and opened her laptop. She ordered every book on psychology, marital conflict, and dealing with toxic people she could find.

For the next fortnight, Evelyn became a scholar of human behavior. She emerged only for meals, her arms always laden with highlighters and notebooks.

While Victoria played the fragile invalid by day and schemed by night, Evelyn studied. She memorized manipulation tactics, learned to recognize gaslighting, and practiced counterarguments.

The battle lines had been drawn. Evelyn Carter wasn't about to surrender her marriage without a fight.
###Chapter 127

Evelyn Carter furrowed her brows as she flipped through the psychology textbooks. Certain passages sparked a strange sense of recognition, as if she'd encountered them in some forgotten past life. The words seemed to imprint themselves deeper in her mind this time around.

The Blackwood household staff exchanged astonished glances whenever they passed the study. Their whispers carried through the halls like autumn leaves.

"Ms. Carter must have been top of her class. She's devoured at least two hundred psychology volumes in two weeks!"

"I saw her reading by moonlight last night. Do you think she's preparing for the clinical psychology licensure exam?"

"Her concentration is terrifying! She didn't even notice when I dusted around her yesterday. Nearly jumped out of her skin when she finally looked up from those books."

Evelyn remained unaware of the household chatter. What surprised her more was Victoria Dawson's uncharacteristic behavior during her intensive study period.

The woman who'd once been a constant thorn in her side now moved through Blackwood Manor like a perfect angel. Victoria had transformed into the epitome of grace and humility in everyone's eyes.

She massaged Richard and Eleanor's shoulders after dinner. Presented rare medicinal herbs from her family's private reserves. Distributed designer gifts to Liam's siblings with calculated generosity.

Even the staff received her favors - an extra day off here, a designer scarf there. The entire household sang Victoria's praises, a chorus Evelyn could never hope to join.

Rubbing her tired eyes one evening, Evelyn emerged from the study when Winston announced dinner. She descended the grand staircase to find Victoria already arranging silverware with practiced elegance.

"Mr. Blackwood," Victoria cooed as she served Richard an ornate soup bowl, "this is my special truffle-infused wild mushroom consommé. I prepared it myself this afternoon."

Richard accepted it with a pleased nod. "Remarkable! I had no idea our Victoria possessed such culinary talents. Any man would be fortunate to call you his wife."

Eleanor beamed in agreement. "Absolutely perfect wife material!"

Evelyn kept her eyes on her own soup, the steam curling before her face.

Victoria's lips curved in triumph as she turned to Evelyn. "I heard you've been burying yourself in psychology texts. Planning to take the licensing exam?"

Evelyn set down her spoon with deliberate calm. "Since I'm between opportunities, I thought I'd expand my knowledge. Unlike you, Ms. Dawson, I don't have the luxury of scheming to replace Beatrice in the kitchen."

The dining room froze. Beatrice Cook, the head chef, suddenly realized Victoria's constant kitchen "help" had subtly eroded her position over weeks. The entire family now preferred Victoria's dishes to hers.

Eleanor cleared her throat. "Victoria simply enjoys cooking. She's not trying to take anyone's job."

Evelyn flashed a brilliant smile, matching Victoria's saccharine tone. "In that case, Ms. Dawson, I'd love to sample your coq au vin, bouillabaisse, and ratatouille tomorrow. Surely that's not too much to ask?"

Beatrice nearly choked suppressing her laughter at the request for three notoriously labor-intensive dishes.

Victoria's knuckles whitened around her napkin. The flush creeping up her neck betrayed her struggle to maintain composure.

Before she could respond, Winston's voice carried from the foyer. "Mr. Blackwood! You've returned!"

The family erupted in excitement, chairs scraping as they rushed to greet Liam. Only Evelyn remained seated, methodically finishing her soup.

Her heart fluttered at Liam's return - she'd missed him terribly, even dreaming of him most nights. Yet now, surrounded by the happy chaos, she felt only a quiet melancholy settling in her bones.
###Chapter 128

Unrequited love was often described as an internal battlefield. At this moment, Evelyn Carter understood that sentiment all too well.

Her entire being ached for Liam Blackwood, yet fear and conflict held her captive. She couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze directly, yet her eyes stole countless glances at him from the shadows.

She knew another woman held his heart, and the knowledge was a blade twisting in her chest. She despised it, resented it—yet she couldn’t bring herself to walk away.

She had longed for his return, yet when he finally stood before her, she feigned indifference, as if her carefully constructed calm could dull the pain of loving someone who didn’t love her back.

The moment Liam stepped into the living room, Victoria Dawson rushed forward, her voice bright with excitement. "Liam!"

Caught off guard, he found himself trapped in her embrace. She clung to him, her arms tight around his waist, irritating him instantly.

His brow furrowed as he reached behind himself, prying her fingers loose. But Victoria only tightened her grip. "I missed you so much," she murmured.

"Liam, why didn’t you tell us you were coming home today?" Eleanor Blackwood smiled warmly at him.

Liam greeted the gathered family politely, each one beaming at him with affection.

His gaze darkened when he didn’t immediately spot Evelyn among them. A quick sweep of the room revealed her in the dining area, seated at the table, her head bowed as she quietly sipped her soup.

She treated his return with the indifference of a stranger.

All she had to do was lift her eyes, just slightly, and she would see him. But she refused.

Disappointment coiled in his chest, sharpening his irritation. He pushed Victoria away, but she persisted, standing on her toes to loop her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him.

Ryan Sullivan, who had followed Liam inside, yanked her back forcefully. "Ms. Dawson, please keep your distance. General Blackwood is injured!"

The room erupted in concern. Voices overlapped as everyone bombarded him with questions—where was he hurt? How serious was it?

Evelyn’s spoon froze mid-air. Her heart clenched. Instinctively, she lifted her head to look at him—

Only to see Victoria tearfully patting his chest, her voice trembling with worry. "Liam, where does it hurt? Is it bad?"

The sight was too much. Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, her throat tight.

But the moment she looked away, Liam’s eyes found her. All he saw was cold detachment.

Was she truly so unaffected, even now?

Amid the chaos, Liam barely registered who was speaking to him. "I'm fine," he said curtly.

"Would you like to join us for dinner?" Eleanor asked.

Liam exhaled faintly. "No. I need to rest."

Victoria immediately latched onto his arm. "Let me help you upstairs."

"That won’t be necessary." He brushed her off coldly and strode past them toward the staircase.

As he left, Victoria glanced back at Evelyn, still silently stirring her soup, and Liam’s icy dismissal. A smirk curled her lips.

Things between them had reached a breaking point.

Her act—the feigned depression, the suicidal threats, the careful manipulation—had worked perfectly.

Ryan followed Liam upstairs, stepping into the study first. The moment they entered, both men froze.

Ryan gaped. The room was a disaster—books and papers strewn everywhere, open volumes scattered across the desk, pages marked with frantic notes. It looked like the workspace of someone cramming for an exam.

Liam slowly walked over, flipping through one of the books. Psychology?

His frown deepened as he scanned the shelves. Many of these weren’t his. His gaze caught on the titles:

Best Ways to Handle Toxic People
The Key to Overcoming Nasty People
Foundations of Psychology

A smirk tugged at his lips.

Ryan cleared his throat. "General Blackwood, should I clean this up?"

"No." Liam didn’t want to disrupt whatever she was working on. "Let’s go to the bedroom."

But when they entered his room, they were met with another surprise.

The space was immaculate—except for the bed, which was buried under a mountain of unopened books.

Ryan finally understood why Evelyn was so sharp. She studied relentlessly.

They retreated to the balcony, where Liam briefed Ryan on their next steps. As they spoke, the bedroom door burst open.

Evelyn rushed in, oblivious to their presence.

She moved like a child caught misbehaving—flustered, hurriedly gathering the books from the bed and stacking them neatly on the shelf. She wiped her brow, scanned the room, then snatched a stray book from the armchair and shoved it into place.

After smoothing the bedding, she bolted out as quickly as she’d come.

She never noticed the two men watching her from the balcony.

Ryan chuckled. "Mrs. Blackwood’s in a hurry. Probably off to clean the study next. She’s adorable."

Liam shot him a glare so cold Ryan immediately straightened. "Apologies, General. That was out of line."

Liam leaned back in his chair, brooding.

Ryan had called Evelyn adorable.

Why did that bother him so much?
###Chapter 129

Midway through dinner, Evelyn suddenly recalled the chaos she'd left in both the study and bedroom. Her heart skipped a beat as she rushed upstairs to tidy the mess. After restoring order, she descended to finish her meal.

Where had Liam and Ryan vanished to after going upstairs? Was Liam avoiding sharing a room with her because Victoria was present? Perhaps he'd chosen the guest room instead.

That seemed probable.

Returning to the dining table, Evelyn found it deserted. Everyone had finished eating and left. She sat down heavily, picking at her now-cold food without tasting it, her mood as heavy as lead.

In the living room, Victoria set down her phone with dramatic urgency. "Mrs. Blackwood!" she gasped. "Adrian just informed me Liam took a bullet to the shoulder last night!"

"They only removed it this morning, but Liam refused hospitalization and insisted on coming home."

Eleanor's hands flew to her mouth, tears springing to her eyes. "Last night? A gunshot wound?"

She dropped everything and rushed upstairs, sobbing hysterically. "My baby boy!"

Victoria followed close behind, her face a mask of concern.

In the dining room, Evelyn's hands froze around her silverware. A violent tremor ran through her body. Her heart ached with sudden, sharp worry. An unnamed fear coiled tight around her chest.

When she looked up, both Eleanor and Victoria had disappeared upstairs. Her chest constricted painfully. She desperately needed to see Liam, to assess his injury with her own eyes.

After dinner, Evelyn avoided returning to their bedroom immediately. Unable to bear witnessing any intimacy between Liam and Victoria, she wandered into the moonlit garden instead.

She lingered outside until exhaustion crept into her bones, the night air doing little to calm her racing thoughts.

Pushing open the bedroom door, she found the lights on but the room empty.

Evelyn dragged her feet across the threshold, collapsing onto the bed with a heavy sigh.

Where was Liam at this hour? The clock showed well past midnight.

Her stomach twisted at the thought of him in Victoria's room. What exactly was their relationship? Some modern polyamorous arrangement?

The idea made her physically ill, a cocktail of grief and anger churning inside her.

Suddenly, the balcony doors slid open with a whisper.

Evelyn's head snapped up in confusion.

Liam stepped through the glass doors, closing them firmly behind him before drawing the curtains. He wore simple silk pajamas that did nothing to diminish his commanding presence.

From behind, she admired the breadth of his shoulders, the precise cut of his military-short hair. Even injured, he exuded effortless magnetism.

Nervous tension strung her body tight. She swallowed dryly, words sticking in her throat.

Liam turned after securing the curtains. He adjusted the air conditioning with a remote before leaning against the dresser, his dark eyes pinning her in place.

When their gazes locked, Evelyn's breath hitched. Her eyes traced from his injured shoulder up to his striking features.

He'd been shot yesterday. Had surgery this morning. Should be in a hospital bed. Why had he insisted on coming home?

Worry propelled her words before she could stop them. "Does it hurt?"

Finally looking at him. Finally speaking. A ghost of a smile touched Liam's lips.

Danger was his constant companion. Blood and pain were familiar acquaintances. Never before had he admitted weakness or feared mortality.

Yet now, he craved her concern. So he let his voice go soft and vulnerable. "It hurts. Terribly."

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the bedsheets. Every fiber of her being urged her to inspect his wound. But hesitation rooted her to the spot.

Liam's intense gaze burned into her. At a loss for words, she looked away sharply, her pulse hammering in her throat.
###Chapter 130

Liam moved with deliberate slowness as he approached the bed, sinking onto the opposite side where Evelyn sat. Their backs remained turned to each other, the distance between them charged with unspoken tension.

He braced his elbows against his knees, fingers pressing into his temples as he exhaled sharply through his nose. The air between them felt thick enough to slice.

Evelyn hadn't spoken beyond that single question. The silence stretched like a live wire between them.

After what felt like an eternity, Liam's deep voice cut through the stillness. "Why did Victoria move in?"

A humorless smile twisted Evelyn's lips. "She's been here nearly three weeks now."

"You didn't object?"

"It wasn't my place to stop her."

The silence returned, heavier this time. Liam flexed his fingers against his thighs before trying again. "Are you still planning to take that certification exam?"

"No."

"Are you... comfortable living here?"

"It's fine."

"Has Victoria been giving you trouble?"

The questions hung between them like accusations. Each clipped response from Evelyn drove the knife deeper. Liam had hoped to bridge the gap between them, but she remained as distant as ever.

"I'm going to shower." Evelyn rose abruptly, disappearing into the walk-in closet without another glance.

Liam checked his watch - nearly midnight. He'd been waiting for hours just to see her, only to be met with this glacial indifference.

When Evelyn emerged thirty minutes later, steam curling from her damp hair, Liam hadn't moved. His broad shoulders slumped forward as if carrying an invisible weight. Even without seeing his face, Evelyn could feel the exhaustion radiating from him.

Concern flickered through her. "Liam," she said softly, "you just had surgery yesterday. You should be resting."

He straightened slowly, those piercing dark eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her breath catch.

"How did you know about that?" His voice held a note of something like hope.

Evelyn's gaze dropped. "I overheard Victoria talking to Adrian."

A bitter smile twisted Liam's lips. Even Victoria cared enough to check on him. But Evelyn? She'd only asked because she'd happened to hear a conversation.

The silence stretched again as Evelyn glanced around the room. "Do you need to take any medications? Have you taken them yet?"

"Already did," came the flat response.

"What about your wound dressing? Has it been changed?"

Liam simply watched her, those dark eyes tracking every microexpression that crossed her face.

"Maybe you could help me with that." He gestured toward the medical supplies on the shelf, though the dressing wasn't due to be changed until morning.

Evelyn hurried to gather the supplies, her hands trembling slightly as she arranged them on the bed. "You'll need to tell me what to do."

With practiced ease, Liam peeled off his shirt one-handed.

When Evelyn looked up, iodine swab in hand, her breath hitched. The golden planes of his chest and abdomen stretched before her, every muscle defined like carved marble. Heat flooded her cheeks as her pulse kicked into overdrive.

She stood frozen, the cotton swab forgotten in her hand, her gaze tracing the contours of his body against her will.

Liam watched the blush spread across Evelyn's face, the way her eyes darkened with unconscious desire. A slow, knowing smile curved his lips as the temperature in the room seemed to climb several degrees.
###Chapter 131

Evelyn's eyes remained fixed on Liam's bandaged shoulder, her gaze refusing to wander elsewhere. A strange warmth spread through her body as her fingers trembled slightly.

The silence in the room was so profound she could hear her own pulse thundering in her ears.

Something was different about Liam too. She could feel his intense stare burning into her, his ragged breathing matching the rhythm of his rising chest. Perhaps due to the pain, he sat rigidly still, unmoving.

Evelyn had to step closer as he remained seated on the bed, causing his gaze to drop uncomfortably to her chest. She shifted her position slightly.

"I'll remove the bandage now. Tell me if it hurts," Evelyn murmured softly, concern lacing her voice.

Liam responded with a low hum, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly.

Evelyn carefully peeled the dressing from his wound, wincing as it stuck to his skin. She worked with both hands, terrified of causing him more pain.

Without realizing it, she leaned forward and blew gently on the exposed injury.

She didn't know that the slight discomfort from removing the bandage meant nothing to Liam. But her breath against his skin sent waves of restless energy through him.

Evelyn carried a delicate, intoxicating scent. Strands of her hair brushed against his face and shoulders, sending Liam into internal turmoil. His hands clenched into tight fists.

When the bandage finally came off, Evelyn saw the wound still weeping blood. Though stitched, the sight made her stomach clench. The thought of how close the bullet had come to his heart brought tears to her eyes.

After disinfecting with iodine, she applied fresh medication and replaced the dressing. As Liam turned to look at her, she quickly lowered her head, letting her hair curtain her face while she fought back tears.

Liam's dark gaze devoured Evelyn's profile, like twin abysses threatening to swallow her whole.

He felt no physical pain. Only the feather-light touch of her fingertips tracing his skin, making every muscle tense. His heartbeat accelerated wildly.

While she focused on his wound, he became lost in watching her.

Time slipped away as they existed in this warm, intimate space. Yet beneath the surface lurked an unnameable tension.

Liam fought desperately against his impulses, knuckles whitening. The fear of frightening her kept him in check. His mind had been chaos since Evelyn first mentioned divorce.

For weeks, work could sometimes distract him from thoughts of her. Matters of state could temporarily push her from his mind.

But at night, in the silence, she consumed him. Her delicate features and liquid eyes filled every corner of his consciousness.

He wondered if his attraction stemmed from her resemblance to Victoria in her youth. Had his preferences remained unchanged after all these years?

Yet he found himself admiring Evelyn's intellect, her talents, her gentle spirit even more. Was this love? Liam wasn't certain.

After finishing the bandage, Evelyn cleared the medical supplies from the bed. When she turned back, his scorching gaze trapped hers.

Her heart stuttered. Why was he looking at her like that? Flustered, she grabbed his shirt and thrust it toward him. "You should dress. The air conditioning is too strong—you'll catch cold."

As Liam reached for the garment, his hand suddenly closed around her wrist, pulling sharply. Evelyn gasped as she tumbled forward.

The moment she collided with his chest, Liam's arm snaked around her waist, flipping her onto the bed beneath him.
###Chapter 132

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as Liam pinned her beneath him. His muscular frame hovered inches above her, the heat radiating from his body making her pulse race.

His forearm braced against the mattress, caging her in. The scent of his cologne - something woodsy with a hint of spice - filled her senses. Their gazes locked, and for a moment, the world narrowed to just the two of them.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn whispered, her voice trembling. The words came out barely audible, her throat suddenly dry.

Liam's dark eyes burned with intensity. His breath fanned across her lips, sending shivers down her spine. Every inch of him pressed against her felt like fire through the thin fabric of her nightgown.

A war raged inside Evelyn. Logic screamed this was wrong - their marriage was temporary, his heart belonged to another. Yet her traitorous body arched toward him, craving his touch.

She watched, mesmerized, as Liam's Adam's apple bobbed. His gaze dropped to her lips, his own parting slightly. The anticipation was torture.

When he finally closed the distance, Evelyn's eyes fluttered shut. His lips brushed hers - featherlight at first, then more insistent. The kiss sent sparks through her veins, her fingers twisting in the sheets.

Just as Liam deepened the kiss, a sharp knock shattered the moment.

"Liam? Are you awake?" Victoria's voice carried through the door.

Liam growled low in his throat, his frustration palpable. He rested his forehead against Evelyn's, breathing heavily as he fought for control.

Evelyn turned her face away, cheeks flaming. The abrupt interruption left her disoriented, her heart still pounding from their almost-kiss.

With obvious reluctance, Liam rolled away and grabbed his phone. "I'm sleeping," he snapped into the voice message. "Stop disturbing me."

Evelyn burrowed under the covers, her stomach churning. She heard Victoria knock again. "Liam, maybe you should move to the guest room. I can take care of you if you're not feeling well."

Liam's fingers flew across his screen. Evelyn saw the word "Leave" appear before he deleted it. Instead, he sent a more measured response: "Victoria, my injury isn't serious. Please go to your room and let me rest."

"Goodnight, Liam," Victoria called sweetly.

Evelyn curled into herself beneath the blankets, bitterness rising in her throat. Why did men always fall for women like Victoria? She knew exactly what game Victoria was playing, yet Liam still treated her with kindness.

The sheets rustled as Liam settled back onto the bed. The space between them felt charged with unspoken words and unfinished business. Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, willing her racing heart to calm.

Somewhere in the darkness, Liam sighed. The sound was heavy with frustration and something else Evelyn couldn't name. She didn't dare move, didn't dare breathe too loudly.

The night stretched before them, thick with tension and what might have been.
###Chapter 133

Evelyn remained perfectly still, pretending to sleep with her back turned to Liam. Her fingers crept up to trace her lips, still burning from the memory of his unexpected kiss.

A hollow ache spread through her chest, tangled with confusing threads of longing and sorrow. All night she'd agonized over why Liam had kissed her.

Was it just a moment of impulse? Or something more primal? The first seemed impossible given his injuries, while the second felt equally unlikely considering his usual restraint.

Liam made no further moves, simply turning off the light and settling on his side of the bed, his breathing soon evening out into sleep.

Evelyn couldn't begin to guess what thoughts swirled behind those closed eyelids.

Morning came with persistent knocking. Through half-lidded eyes, Evelyn saw Liam rise to answer the door before joining the others for breakfast.

Shaking off sleep, she dragged herself up, a dark cloud hanging over her as she prepared for the day.

Dressed in her usual elegant style, she descended the stairs - only to freeze at the sight of her least favorite people gathered around the breakfast table.

There sat Liam's meddlesome aunt Beatrice with her goddaughter Genevieve, alongside Victoria and her scheming uncle Julian. The scene appeared civil, but Evelyn sensed the tension crackling beneath like a live wire.

Not wanting any part of their poisonous games, Evelyn turned on her heel toward the front door.

As she reached the foyer, she caught Liam watching her from the corner of his eye. His expression darkened as she hesitated only a moment before stepping outside.

The breakfast before Liam turned to ash in his mouth. He knew this gathering wasn't about his recovery - every person here had their own agenda.

...

In the manor's sun-drenched gardens, golden light bathed every blossom and leaf in warmth.

Evelyn lounged lazily on the stone bench in the pavilion, soaking in the fresh air and gentle breeze. Despite her empty stomach, she felt oddly at peace.

A man's voice shattered the tranquility. "Skipping breakfast, Evelyn?"

She startled upright, her mood souring instantly when she saw Julian approaching. Dressed impeccably as always, he looked every inch the distinguished doctor.

Evelyn had no patience for either Julian or his niece. She offered a noncommittal hum and stood to leave.

Julian moved quickly, catching her wrist.

Evelyn turned with a scowl, her voice icy. "Dr. Whitmore, unhand me."

But Julian held tight, his breathing growing ragged. "Please Evelyn, we need to talk."

"I have nothing to say to you."

"Our past—"

"Don't," Evelyn cut him off sharply. "That past means nothing to me. You're a stranger."

Julian's grip tightened as his other hand seized her free arm, pulling her closer. "Let me go!"

His voice turned venomous. "How long will you keep lying to yourself? Liam has always loved Victoria. Marrying you was just to please his grandmother. When will you face the truth?"

Tears welled in Julian's red-rimmed eyes. "I've loved you desperately all these years. Why won't you see that?"
###Chapter 134

Evelyn was stunned by Julian's raw display of emotion. The tears streaming down his face revealed depths she'd never imagined.

For a man like Julian Whitmore to break down like this - the intensity of his feelings must be overwhelming.

As shock coursed through her, Evelyn studied the subtle tremble of Julian's lips, the way his fingers twitched at his sides, trying to decipher the storm raging behind his eyes.

Before she could process anything, Julian suddenly yanked her into a crushing embrace.

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled violently against his iron grip. "What are you doing? Release me this instant!"

Julian only held tighter, burying his face in the crook of her neck. His voice came out ragged, broken. "I love you so damn much. Why must you always be so cruel? Before the amnesia...after...it never changes."

Despite her frantic efforts, Evelyn couldn't break free. His arms were like steel bands, squeezing the breath from her lungs. She could feel the sharp ache in her shoulders from the pressure.

His love felt like a prison.

Finally going limp, Evelyn stood frozen like a porcelain doll. Through clenched teeth, she hissed, "Dr. Whitmore, if you don't release me right now, I'll scream this hospital down."

"Evelyn, I love you," Julian whispered desperately against her hair. "Give me one chance. Just one."

Her heart remained cold, untouched. "I don't love you."

"Divorce Liam. Be with me." Julian's voice turned feverish. "I'll make you happier than he ever could. I'll-"

A powerful force wrenched Julian away mid-sentence, sending him sprawling onto the linoleum floor.

Evelyn stumbled back in shock. When her vision cleared, Liam stood between them like an avenging angel, his expression thunderous, eyes glinting with lethal ice.

Julian rose slowly, brushing imaginary dust from his lab coat with deliberate calm. "Just catching up with an old flame. No need for theatrics."

Evelyn had never seen Liam like this - the aura of violence around him could have frozen hell itself. Despite being the wronged party, guilt twisted in her stomach like she'd been caught in some sordid affair.

Liam's glacial gaze locked onto Julian. "Your version of catching up involves assault? Shall I book you a suite?" he asked, voice dripping with venom.

Instead of rising to the bait, Julian smirked, his tone saccharine. "That would be lovely, actually."

Hot tears pricked Evelyn's eyes. She'd thought Liam came to rescue her, only to be humiliated further. How could he suggest something so degrading?

Her heart sank like a stone.

Did he truly believe she'd welcome such advances? That she deserved this?

In a flash, Liam had Julian pinned against the wall, his grip brutal. "Touch her again," he growled, "and I'll break every bone in your body."

Despite the sweat beading on his forehead, Julian maintained his mocking smile. "Funny," he taunted, "you didn't seem to remember having a wife when you were cozying up to Victoria."
###Chapter 135

The words hit Evelyn like a dagger to the chest, each syllable twisting deeper with every beat of her aching heart. The pain was so visceral she could taste copper in her mouth, as if she'd bitten through her own tongue.

She blinked rapidly, refusing to let even a single tear fall. Not for Liam. Never again for Liam.

She'd long known about his complicated history with Victoria. She'd forced herself to ignore their lingering touches, their whispered conversations. But hearing someone else voice the truth made it impossible to keep pretending.

Liam hadn't denied the accusation. When Victoria had threatened suicide, he'd caught her in that dramatic embrace, murmuring reassurances under the doctor's supervision.

He considered it a humanitarian act, devoid of emotion. In his mind, he'd broken no vows, betrayed no trust.

Yet Julian's words shattered Liam's composure. His eyes turned glacial as he spat, "You and Victoria make quite the pair. Two peas in a pod."

Julian looked genuinely startled.

Liam released his grip on Julian and seized Evelyn's wrist instead, storming away with barely contained fury. Tears blurred Evelyn's vision as she stumbled after him toward the car. His fingers dug into her flesh like iron manacles.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Victoria approached with outstretched hands. "Liam, where have you been? I've been—"

He shoved her away with such force she crashed to the marble floor.

The entire household froze. Servants rushed to help Victoria while shooting Liam disapproving glances for his uncharacteristic outburst.

Liam ignored them all. Without breaking stride, he dragged Evelyn upstairs, his grip unrelenting.

The tension in the bedroom was suffocating. Evelyn's pulse pounded in her ears as Liam slammed the door so hard the walls shook.

The moment he released her wrist, she scrambled backward until her shoulders hit the wall. She'd never seen him like this - a storm given human form, every muscle coiled with barely restrained violence.

His lips curled into a mirthless smile when he noticed how far she'd retreated. "So this is why you're leaving?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. His accusation made no sense.

He advanced with deliberate steps, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "You haven't even filed for divorce yet, and already you're throwing yourself at your ex?"

Her hands balled into fists. "That's rich, coming from you."

"We did nothing wrong," Liam stated coldly.

A bitter laugh escaped her. The absurdity of his double standards would be funny if it didn't hurt so much.

His expression darkened. In three strides he had her pinned against the wall, his forearm braced beside her head. "You're the one who demanded loyalty. And now I find you in another man's arms?"

Fear and fury warred in Evelyn's chest. No woman truly in love could remain indifferent after discovering her husband's texts professing love for another woman.

For Margaret's sake, she'd turned a blind eye. And now he dared accuse her? For one platonic hug with Julian?
###Chapter 136

Evelyn's entire body trembled with fury as hot tears streaked down her flushed cheeks. She bit down on her lower lip until she tasted blood, trying to suppress the searing pain that lacerated her heart like shards of broken glass. At this moment, she wished Liam would disappear from her life forever.

"Liam Blackwood, you monster! Release me this instant!" Evelyn's voice cracked with raw emotion as she thrashed against his iron grip.

In her blind rage, she'd completely forgotten about the still-healing wound on his shoulder. The more she struggled, the tighter his hold became, his face betraying no sign of discomfort despite the fresh blood soaking through his dress shirt.

With terrifying strength, Liam slammed her against the wall, knocking the breath from her lungs. A sharp jolt of pain shot up her spine, forcing a gasp from her parted lips. Wide-eyed with shock, Evelyn stared up at him through her tears, suddenly rendered speechless by the primal fury radiating from his towering frame.

He loomed over her like a predator cornering its prey, making her feel impossibly small and fragile beneath his smoldering gaze. Fear, anger, and confusion warred within her as fresh tears threatened to spill.

Liam's voice came out in a dangerous growl, each word dripping with venom. "You belong to me, Evelyn. Until those divorce papers are signed, you're still my wife. Betray me again, and I'll make sure you live to regret it."

Her blood ran cold at his threat, the tears freezing on her lashes.

"Is this your idea of revenge?" he continued, his breath hot against her face. "Running to another man because you're not satisfied? Don't play the innocent with me."

His cruel words struck deeper than any physical blow could. With a choked sob, Evelyn shoved against his chest with all her strength.

"You're disgusting!" she spat, her voice shaking with barely contained rage. "If I wanted satisfaction, the last place I'd look is—"

Her words were abruptly cut off as Liam crushed his mouth against hers in a punishing kiss. He pinned her wrists above her head with one hand while the other gripped her waist painfully tight.

Evelyn whimpered against his brutal assault, her lips and tongue aching from his relentless onslaught. His scorching breath burned her skin as he devoured her, showing no trace of the tenderness she'd once known.

She twisted her head desperately, but his iron grip held her immobile. Trapped between the cold wall and his burning body, she felt like a butterfly pinned to a board, helpless against his wrath.

Tears streamed down her face as she endured his violent affection, the saltiness mingling on their joined lips. Gradually, the taste of her suffering seemed to penetrate Liam's rage. His kiss softened, then stilled altogether as he pulled back slightly.

Evelyn slumped the moment he released her, her legs giving out beneath her. Liam caught her effortlessly, drawing her limp form against his chest where she sobbed like a wounded animal.

"I hate you," she whispered brokenly between shuddering breaths. "I've done nothing to deserve this cruelty. Why are you torturing me like this?"

Liam held her closer, one large hand cradling the back of her head as he rested his chin atop her hair. His own eyes shone with unshed emotion as he realized how completely this woman had shattered his legendary self-control. The normally unflappable general had been reduced to a possessive, emotional wreck by the mere thought of losing her.
###Chapter 137

Evelyn found herself trapped in Liam's strong embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks uncontrollably.

With each passing second, her inner turmoil intensified. She pressed her palms against Liam's chest, suddenly hearing his sharp intake of breath.

Startled, she glanced up at his shoulder. Crimson stains were spreading across his pristine white shirt.

All her resentment evaporated instantly like morning mist. "You're hurt!" she gasped, her voice shaking.

Liam ignored his injury, keeping his firm grip on her shoulders. "Stay away from him," he commanded sternly.

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes widened as she met Liam's intense gaze.

He lowered his head, his eyes tracing her swollen lips from their earlier kiss. A wave of guilt washed over him.

"I want to stay away too," Evelyn countered, "but he clings to me just like you are now. I've fought with all my strength but can't break free. What should I do?"

Her words weren't just about Julian - they were directed at Liam too. As she spoke, Liam loosened his grip slightly and stepped back.

Despite her explanation, Liam chose to trust her completely. "Why didn't you scream for help?" he asked calmly.

Evelyn wiped her tears, pouting. "He's shameless, but I must protect my dignity. Imagine if the whole household saw us like that. The gossip would never end."

Liam fell silent.

As Evelyn moved past him to get the first aid kit, she muttered, "You're so quick to judge. Accusing me of betraying our marriage while you're no better."

"You—" Her words were cut off as Liam suddenly kissed her again. Her heart raced uncontrollably, cheeks flushing with mixed emotions.

"How dare you treat me this way?" she protested. "You're still entangled with Victoria yet refuse to divorce me."

"You forbid me from doing things you do yourself. That's crossing the line."

Despite her complaints, her hands were gentle as she approached with medical supplies. Her clear eyes held tender concern.

"Sit down. Let me check your wound."

Liam felt no physical pain, but his emotions were in turmoil. His intense gaze lingered on Evelyn's flushed face, making her pulse quicken.

That single impulsive kiss had awakened something primal in him. The memory of her soft lips was intoxicating.

"Sit down, let me—" she began, but his scorching stare made her words falter.

Her dewy eyes became the spark that ignited Liam's suppressed desire. In one swift motion, he pulled her close again.

One arm encircled her waist while the other cradled her head as he claimed her lips passionately.

Evelyn gasped. Her lips still tingled from their first kiss, now throbbing with renewed intensity.

Was he teasing her again?

She pushed against his chest, but this time his kiss left her dizzy and enchanted. Her resistance melted like snow in spring.
###Chapter 138

Evelyn melted into Liam's embrace, her body surrendering completely to his touch.

His lips moved over hers with exquisite tenderness, each caress sending waves of pleasure through her. The kiss deepened, stealing her breath and thoughts alike.

The warmth of his body pressed against hers. The softness of his lips was intoxicating, a sensation she craved more of with each passing second.

She arched against him, the thin fabric of their clothes doing nothing to disguise the heat between them.

A quiet whimper escaped Evelyn's throat as her skin tingled with desperate need. The air between them crackled with unspoken desire, a fire slowly building to an inferno.

Liam's fingers trailed down the column of her neck, eliciting a sharp gasp. Reality came crashing back as she blinked up at his face - blurred yet devastatingly handsome.

Her chest rose and fell rapidly as she struggled to process what was happening.

His grip tightened possessively, the raw intensity in his touch startling her awake.

"No! Stop this!" Evelyn shoved against Liam's chest with surprising strength. He stumbled back, giving her just enough space to dart past him and flee through the door.

Liam exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. His pulse hammered wildly in his veins.

Evelyn collapsed against the study door the moment it closed behind her. Her legs gave out as she slid to the floor, trembling uncontrollably.

Her mind whirled with chaotic thoughts. She pressed shaking fingers to her swollen lips, still feeling the ghost of his kiss.

Had she lost her mind? Had he? What had possessed him to act this way?

The memory of his hands on her body, his lips claiming hers with such fierce possession - it felt like some forbidden dream. Even in her wildest fantasies, she'd never imagined this.

Evelyn buried her face in her knees, wishing she could scream away the confusing emotions.

She spent hours hiding in the study, attempting to lose herself in books. But the words blurred before her eyes, her concentration shattered.

When the maid came to summon her for dinner, Evelyn claimed she wasn't hungry. Facing Liam was impossible. The embarrassment burned too brightly.

From dawn until twilight, she remained sequestered. Another knock came at the door.

"I'm still not eating," she called out weakly.

Her phone buzzed twice. Evelyn fished it from her pocket, heart stuttering at Liam's name on the screen.

"Open the door."

Her fingers flew across the keyboard. "I can't see you right now."

The humiliation was too much. Her emotions were too raw, too exposed.

Outside, Liam clenched his phone until his knuckles turned white. He drew a shuddering breath, eyes burning with frustration.

There was no denying it now - he'd fallen hopelessly for Evelyn. But her heart remained an impenetrable fortress.

Did any man truly matter to her? Her ex-husband, former lovers, even him - her current husband. None seemed capable of breaching those walls.
###Chapter 139

The relentless knocking finally stopped.

Evelyn remained in the study until midnight. Hunger gnawed at her stomach, making her feel lightheaded after not eating all day.

When the house fell silent, she crept out. The kitchen downstairs beckoned with promises of food.

Cooking had never been her strength. Her attempts usually ended in disaster.

After searching every cabinet, she found nothing prepared. With a sigh, she grabbed two eggs, planning to boil them.

Footsteps echoed behind her.

She spun around to find Liam approaching. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she instinctively stepped back.

"Why are you still awake?" Evelyn felt like a child caught sneaking cookies before dinner.

Liam moved with quiet precision, turning off the stove before she could react.

"I—" Her stomach growled loudly, cutting off her words. The water hadn't even begun to boil yet.

Without speaking, Liam removed the eggs from the pot. "You dislike yolks. Will two egg whites suffice?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. He remembered such small details about her preferences.

"I could always make more," she offered softly.

Liam cracked the eggs with practiced ease. Evelyn watched, confused by his sudden culinary demonstration.

His expression remained unreadable, his movements efficient yet graceful. The air around him felt cool and detached.

Evelyn didn't dare interrupt. She simply observed as he transformed simple ingredients into something more.

He whisked the eggs with water, strained the mixture, and set it to steam. Then he retrieved steak and greens from the refrigerator.

Evelyn's eyes widened as more ingredients appeared. She never imagined a military man like Liam could cook so skillfully.

Her stomach protested loudly. She licked her lips without thinking, then stepped closer. "Are you hungry too? Is that why you're cooking?"

"Not hungry," Liam replied while searing the steak. Rosemary and garlic filled the air, making her mouth water.

Her gaze fixed on the sizzling meat. "Are you... making this for me?"

Silence. Then he held up two spice jars. "Black pepper or cayenne?"

"Cayenne!" The answer burst from her before she could stop it.

"Wait outside," he instructed, his tone firm yet not unkind.

Evelyn obeyed immediately, fleeing to the dining room.

She pressed cool hands to her burning cheeks. Why did he remain so composed while she turned into a flustered mess? That morning's intimate moment replayed in her mind, making her pulse race.

Liam emerged carrying three dishes: pepper-crusted steak, silky egg custard, and fresh greens.

He set them before her and took the opposite seat. The table's width provided comfortable distance between them.

An awkward silence settled.

Evelyn picked up her fork hesitantly. She glanced at Liam, who sat with one arm resting on the table, watching her with intense focus.
###Chapter 140

Evelyn's cheeks burned under Liam's intense gaze. "Would you... like some too?" she stammered, gesturing toward her plate.

Liam remained silent, shaking his head slightly. The tension between them grew thicker as Evelyn nervously bit her lower lip and looked away.

After taking a steadying breath, she tentatively tried a piece of the perfectly seared steak. The rich flavors exploded on her tongue, followed by the delicate smoothness of the egg custard. With each bite, she became more impressed by Liam's culinary mastery.

Midway through her meal, his deep voice shattered the comfortable silence. "You don't want to share a room with me tonight?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her food. The question caught her completely off guard. She hadn't even considered sleeping arrangements - she'd been avoiding Liam all day, uncertain how to face him after everything.

What shocked her most was his directness, the complete lack of shame or hesitation in his question.

A bitter smile played on Liam's lips as he watched her tense reaction. "I can move to the guest room," he offered quietly.

"No!" The word burst from Evelyn's lips before she could stop it, startling them both.

Liam's brow furrowed slightly, his expression a mix of confusion and something else she couldn't quite identify.

The truth was, Evelyn feared Victoria might visit during the night. The mere thought of that betrayal made her physically ill. She couldn't endure that pain again.

"Alright," Liam agreed, a hint of warmth coloring his tone.

Blushing furiously, Evelyn kept her eyes downcast as she added in a whisper, "But... please don't touch me tonight, Liam."

Her heart hammered painfully against her ribs as she spoke, the awkwardness nearly suffocating.

Liam's hand clenched into a fist at her words, a flash of hurt crossing his features before he schooled them back to neutrality. Her blunt rejection stung more than he cared to admit.

He simply nodded in response.

Relieved by his acceptance, Evelyn finally relaxed - until the screech of chair legs against the floor startled her. She looked up just in time to see Liam striding away, his broad shoulders tense as he disappeared up the stairs.

Had she upset him? The thought gnawed at her.

Though her memories were gone, Evelyn knew she wasn't some naive virgin. If Liam could accept her complicated past, she wanted to create beautiful new memories with him. But first...

She needed a full medical examination. Liam had mentioned her history of STDs, and Rosalind had hinted at expensive treatments. While she'd experienced no symptoms in years, for Liam's sake, she wanted to be certain before taking that step.

After finishing her meal, Evelyn tiptoed into their bedroom. Liam lay motionless on the bed, his breathing deep and even. Unsure if he was asleep or pretending, she moved silently, turning off the lights before slipping into the bathroom.

Thirty minutes later, freshly showered, she carefully slid into bed beside him. Listening to his steady breathing, a quiet happiness filled Evelyn's chest. She didn't dare hope for too much - just that Margaret would live to 120, giving her and Liam fifty years together as husband and wife.
###Chapter 141

The morning sun cast golden rays across the hospital entrance where Evelyn stood waiting. Her fingers tapped nervously against her purse strap until Rosalind appeared, cheeks flushed from running.

"Sorry I'm late," Rosalind panted, bending over to catch her breath.

Evelyn steadied her with a gentle hand. "I arrived too early. You didn't need to rush."

As Rosalind straightened, her gaze traveled up the sterile hospital facade. "Are you ill?" she asked between breaths.

Evelyn shook her head.

When Rosalind had recovered, she lowered her voice. "Then why meet at a hospital?"

Leaning in, Evelyn's cheeks turned pink. "I need to check if my old condition has returned." She twisted her fingers together. "I couldn't face this alone."

Rosalind's eyes widened in surprise.

The awkward silence stretched until Evelyn confessed, "I've been married for months. My husband knew my medical history, so we never... until last night—"

"You're married?" Rosalind's voice cracked with disbelief.

Evelyn nodded.

Rosalind's expression darkened. "So after one night together, you're rushing to a gynecologist?"

Evelyn glanced around before giving a sheepish nod.

Suddenly, Rosalind pinched Evelyn's nose.

"Ow! What—"

"Natural," Rosalind declared. "No implants."

Before Evelyn could react, Rosalind squeezed her cheeks and peered at her teeth. "All real." Then her hands moved toward Evelyn's chest.

Evelyn jumped back, arms crossed. "What are you doing?"

Rosalind's voice remained steady. "Small but real."

Evelyn gaped at her.

"I knew from the start," Rosalind said quietly. "You're not Evelyn."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Rosalind looked away, guilt lining her features. "I needed money for my father's treatment. When you pretended to be Evelyn and helped, I let it happen. But I always knew."

Evelyn grabbed Rosalind's wrist. "I've done two DNA tests at top hospitals. How can you be so sure?"

Tears welled in Rosalind's eyes. "Because the real Evelyn was selfish since childhood. We video-called until three years ago. No amount of plastic surgery could change her nature. You're nothing like her."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "My husband doubted me too, but his people supervised the second test."

Rosalind squared her shoulders. "Then let's see whose truth wins."

Inside the hospital, Evelyn's hands trembled during the blood draw, Rosalind's words echoing in her mind.

The doctor gestured to the examination table. "Remove your pants and lie down."

Heat flooded Evelyn's face as shyness overwhelmed her.
###Chapter 142

Even though they were both women, Evelyn still felt uncomfortable. The doctor turned and noticed her frozen posture.

"You're not moving at all," the doctor observed with amusement.

The physician smiled knowingly. "I reviewed your medical records earlier. You've had this examination before. Why are you acting like a nervous schoolgirl now?"

Evelyn bit her lip self-consciously as she slowly removed her pants. Following instructions, she positioned herself on the examination table.

Her cheeks burned with embarrassment. Unable to bear the vulnerability, she turned her face away and shut her eyes tightly.

The doctor positioned herself between Evelyn's legs, beginning the examination with the speculum. Suddenly, the instrument clattered to the floor.

"You had a previous infection," the doctor said with a frown. "Was it from a blood transfusion?"

Evelyn's eyes flew open at the serious tone. Fear gripped her heart. "I...I don't remember. Has my condition returned?"

The doctor chuckled unexpectedly. "You can get dressed. No further examination is necessary."

Confused, Evelyn scrambled off the table. "Doctor? What's wrong? Why stop now?"

Removing her gloves, the physician explained while walking toward the door, "You're still a virgin. This exam would rupture your hymen. Without sexual history, there's no need. Wait outside for your bloodwork."

Evelyn stood rooted to the spot, shock rendering her immobile. The revelation hit her like a physical blow.

Rosalind had claimed she wasn't Evelyn. Now medical evidence confirmed her virginity. What did this mean? How had everything become so twisted?

After an agonizing wait, the test results arrived. The doctor reviewed them with a puzzled expression.

"Young lady," she began, "are you certain you're at the right clinic?"

Evelyn twisted her fingers anxiously. Rosalind placed a comforting arm around her shoulders.

"Just tell us straight," Rosalind urged.

The doctor tapped the papers. "Your hymen remains intact. No history of intercourse means no gynecological issues. All other tests are clean - no gonorrhea, no syphilis. You're perfectly healthy."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes. For years she'd carried shame about her supposed promiscuous past. The imagined sins had poisoned her self-worth.

She'd endured endless humiliation, believing herself tainted. Now came the stunning truth - she'd never been intimate with anyone.

Overwhelmed, Evelyn collapsed into Rosalind's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. Years of pent-up anguish poured out in wrenching cries.

The startled doctor stepped back. Rosalind quickly apologized and guided her distraught friend from the room.

Outside, other patients mistook Evelyn's tears for tragic news, casting pitying glances their way.

Only when they reached the hospital exit did Evelyn regain composure. She accepted the tissues Rosalind offered, wiping her swollen eyes.

"So," Rosalind said gently, "now you believe you're not Evelyn Carter?"

The last tear dried as determination hardened Evelyn's features. Her voice came out razor-sharp. "Keep this between us."

Rosalind blinked in confusion. "Don't you want to tell your family?"

Evelyn crushed the tissue in her fist. "If I'm not Evelyn Carter, then who am I? And who orchestrated this elaborate deception?"
###Chapter 143

Rosalind's question caught Evelyn completely off guard.

Evelyn watched as Rosalind closed her eyes and drew a deep breath, her fingers tightening around the armrests of her chair. The air between them grew heavy with unspoken tension.

"If I'm not truly Evelyn Carter," Rosalind continued in a measured tone, "then the Carters aren't my real family. By that same logic, the Blackwoods aren't truly my in-laws either."

"Rosalind, you—" Evelyn's voice caught in her throat as she studied the woman before her. The usual hesitation and self-doubt that normally clouded Rosalind's features had vanished, replaced by a steely determination that seemed to radiate from within.

Despite the amnesia that had stolen her past, Rosalind's transformation was undeniable. She sat straighter, her gaze sharper, as if shedding an invisible weight she'd carried for years.

Rosalind reached across the table and grasped Evelyn's hand with surprising strength. "Evelyn," she said softly, "I need you to keep this between us."

The intensity in Rosalind's eyes left Evelyn breathless. She found herself nodding before she'd even processed the request. "Of course."

"There's something else," Rosalind continued, lowering her voice. "Ever since I lost my memory, I've felt... manipulated. Like invisible strings are pulling me in directions I don't understand. I need to uncover the truth, which means I can't afford any mistakes."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Do you think the Carters are involved?"

Rosalind hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. "They don't have that kind of power... but I can't completely rule them out either."

"What about the Blackwoods?" Evelyn ventured.

A dry chuckle escaped Rosalind's lips. "What possible motive would they have?"

Evelyn had to concede the point.

Rosalind's expression grew more serious. "The first DNA test was supervised by police. The second had military observers from Aldenria present. If both could be falsified..." She let the implication hang in the air.

Evelyn squeezed Rosalind's hand in reassurance. "Listen to me. Whether you're Rosalind Fairchild or someone else entirely, you're my friend. Whatever you need, I'm here."

Rosalind pulled her into a tight embrace. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

Their dinner lasted well into the evening. It wasn't until nearly eight when Evelyn finally returned to Blackwood Manor. The grand estate blazed with light, its crystal chandeliers casting intricate patterns across the marble floors.

Three figures occupied the sitting room. Evelyn's gaze went immediately to Liam, who lounged on the sofa with uncharacteristic casualness, one arm draped along the backrest, his long legs stretched out before him.

The moment Liam spotted Evelyn, his relaxed posture stiffened. A shadow crossed his features, his jaw tightening almost imperceptibly. He'd been home for two days now, and Evelyn had expertly avoided him—holing up in the library or inventing errands that took her out of the house.

Eleanor's gentle voice broke the tension. "Evelyn, darling! Have you eaten?"

"Yes, thank you," Evelyn replied smoothly, crossing to greet her mother-in-law. "I had dinner with a friend."

Beatrice Thornton sat stiffly beside Eleanor, her arms crossed. When she spoke, her voice dripped with smug satisfaction. "Do you know where I've been these past few days, Evelyn?"

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Eleanor mentioned you traveled to Solterra."

"Not for pleasure," Beatrice snapped. "I went to find Ms. Grayson. And I told her all about your little charade. She's furious—planning to sue you for identity theft."

Liam's entire body went rigid, his eyes darkening as they fixed on Beatrice.

Eleanor gasped. "Beatrice! Have you lost your mind? Why would you conspire with outsiders against family?"

"Family?" Beatrice spat the word like a curse. "This impostor manipulated my brother into marriage with her schemes. Then she had the audacity to claim she's some famous artist—when everyone knows she's nothing but a—"

"That's enough!" Liam's voice cracked like a whip, cutting Beatrice off mid-sentence.

Eleanor looked ready to argue further, but one glance at Liam's thunderous expression silenced her. The air in the room grew thick with unspoken accusations and mounting tension.
###Chapter 144

Liam's face remained eerily composed.

Evelyn paid no attention to Beatrice's accusations. Her focus had always been solely on Liam.

"Beatrice," Evelyn said coolly, "I never claimed to be Isabella Grayson, nor have I exploited her reputation for personal benefit. What legal grounds does she have to sue me?"

A mocking smile curled Beatrice's lips. "Oh, you're unaware? Cassandra spent a fortune restoring that worthless painting of yours. She even sold it for five million dollars."

Evelyn's fists clenched as anger constricted her chest. This outcome was completely unexpected.

She had deliberately destroyed that painting, yet Cassandra somehow found an expert to restore it - and sold it at an exorbitant price.

Evelyn had been monitoring this mysterious Isabella Grayson who appeared out of nowhere. Initially, she assumed the artist would fade into obscurity.

But Isabella had capitalized on her sudden fame - endollarsing products, attending high-profile events, everything except continuing her painting livestreams or charity work.

While Evelyn couldn't confirm the woman's true identity, she knew one thing for certain - this imposter was a fraud.

"Then I'll await Ms. Grayson's legal notice," Evelyn replied calmly.

Turning to Eleanor, she added, "Excuse me, I'll retire to my room now."

As she turned away, Evelyn's gaze briefly brushed against Liam's chiseled profile. His expression remained indifferent - no glance, no acknowledgment.

A crushing weight settled in Evelyn's chest. She couldn't understand why Liam's attitude toward her had shifted so dramatically. His behavior oscillated unpredictably between warmth and icy detachment.

Their relationship had become increasingly strained, yet Evelyn couldn't pinpoint the cause. Not a single word had passed between them this entire encounter.

Upon reaching her bedroom, Evelyn froze at the sight before her. Two maids were methodically packing Liam's belongings, the door left slightly ajar.

An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her lungs. The pain wasn't physical, but a deep, aching emptiness that left her limbs numb with shock.

They'd been married over four months. Despite their rocky start, they'd never slept separately. Why now?

"Madam," one maid greeted politely, "We're transferring Mr. Blackwood's belongings to the adjacent guest suite."

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "Carry on." She turned and exited swiftly.

Leaning against the hallway wall, Evelyn tilted her head back, blinking away hot tears. Each breath came labored, as if the air itself had turned to lead.

Then - footsteps. That familiar, measured cadence that resonated deep in her bones.

Evelyn hastily wiped her eyes, composing herself just as Liam reached the landing.

He approached with an inscrutable gaze. Evelyn's pulse quickened as his imposing frame loomed before her.

Meeting those enigmatic dark eyes, she managed a fragile smile. "Liam, why are you doing this?"

His expression remained glacial. "I'm simply granting your wish."

The words struck like a physical blow. Tears welled despite Evelyn's efforts to contain them.

Her wish? Did this man truly understand nothing of her heart?

He wanted distance between them, yet had the audacity to frame it as her desire.

Lowering her head to hide her anguish, Evelyn whispered hoarsely, "Thank you."
###Chapter 145

Evelyn's grateful words scraped against Liam's eardrums like nails on a chalkboard. The air between them turned glacial, his frosty expression dropping the temperature to subzero levels.

Their gazes locked in silent combat, neither willing to break first.

"Liam, I decorated the guest room specially for you." Victoria's saccharine voice sliced through the tension as she emerged from the hallway. She latched onto his arm with possessive familiarity.

Liam remained stone-faced, peeling her fingers off with deliberate coldness before striding toward the guest room without a word.

Victoria shot Evelyn a triumphant smirk over her shoulder, her victory dance cut short when Evelyn fired back, "How proud can you be about Liam sleeping in your guest room?"

The barb hit its mark. Victoria's face froze in comical shock, unprepared for Evelyn's direct attack.

Liam paused mid-step, his shoulders tensing as he threw a questioning glance at Victoria.

"Nate, darling," Victoria simpered, forcing a laugh that sounded like broken glass, "Evelyn's clearly misinterpreting my intentions."

Disgust flashed in Liam's stormy eyes before he disappeared into the guest room, slamming the door so hard the frame rattled - leaving Victoria gaping at the closed door.

Evelyn didn't spare her another glance. Retreating to the master suite, she realized for the first time how cavernous the room felt without Liam's presence. The emptiness mirrored the hollowness in her chest.

Something vital was missing.

That night, sleep eluded Evelyn as thoughts of Liam tangled with revelations about her true identity. The path forward loomed treacherous, but at least now she had direction. No more wandering in confusion - she would uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

Morning found Evelyn mechanically preparing for the day. Descending to breakfast, she found the Blackwood dining table overflowing with family members, including Sebastian and Isabella who'd returned unexpectedly. The lively chatter died the moment she appeared.

Beatrice's sly grin set Evelyn's nerves on edge. Something unpleasant was brewing.

"Evelyn, come sit-" Eleanor began gesturing to the chair beside Liam, only to find Victoria already planted there like a territorial cat.

Eleanor awkwardly pointed to a distant corner. "You can sit next to Isabella."

Isabella crossed her arms with theatrical disdain. "Not beside me. You'll ruin my appetite."

Snickers rippled through the gathering as they watched for Evelyn's reaction.

Liam's jaw clenched around his breakfast, his grip on the cutlery turning his knuckles white.

Evelyn's hopeful glance toward him shattered against his icy indifference. The man who once defended her now regarded her with utter contempt.

The ache in her chest surprised her with its intensity as she took the isolated seat at the table's far end. When the staff served breakfast, the disparity became painfully clear - while others enjoyed lavish spreads, Evelyn's plate held two sad pieces of dry toast.

Beatrice preened under the attention. "No need to stare. I personally arranged your special breakfast."

All eyes swiveled to Evelyn's meager meal, the unspoken message clear: she was no longer welcome at the Blackwood table.
###Chapter 146

Before anyone could speak, Evelyn shoved her teacup aside with a sharp clatter. "Beatrice," she demanded, her voice trembling with suppressed rage, "if you have issues with me, say it to my face. These underhanded tactics are beneath you."

The audacity of Beatrice's attack stemmed from one simple fact - Liam had moved out of their shared bedroom last night. She was convinced the entire household now shared Liam's apparent disgust toward Evelyn.

With a sweeping gesture at the gathered family, Beatrice sneered, "It's not just me who can't stand you. Everyone here despises a fraud like you. Have you no self-awareness?"

Richard's voice cut through the tension. "Beatrice, that's enough."

"Stay out of this, Richard," Beatrice snapped. "Today we're cleansing the Blackwood family of this trash. We can't let her continue living here, tarnishing our reputation."

Her eyes gleamed with malicious triumph. "I've already contacted the Art Council's appraisal team, along with media reporters. And of course, our legal team will be present to file charges."

The announcement sent murmurs through the room - some shocked, others visibly excited.

Liam's knuckles turned white around his silverware, veins protruding like cables beneath his skin. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees, though Beatrice remained oblivious to the storm brewing beside her.

Growing more emboldened, she continued, "I've even arranged for the real Isabella Grayson to appear in person. By day's end, Evelyn Carter will be exposed as a fraud and thrown out of Blackwood Manor."

"Let the world see the scheming gold-digger for what she really—"

A deafening crash silenced her. Every head swiveled toward Liam as his chair toppled backward. The fury radiating from him was palpable, his gaze so intense it pinned Beatrice in place like a predator sighting prey.

"If living with my wife displeases you," Liam growled, each word dripping with menace, "then leave. No one's stopping you."

The room collectively held its breath. They'd all assumed Liam's move to the guest room signaled marital discord. Yet the protective way he said "my wife" now suggested otherwise.

Even Richard dared not intervene as Liam's wrath filled the dining room.

Beatrice paled, still not comprehending her misstep. "Liam, I'm trying to help you! Why are you turning on me?"

Sebastian chose that moment to speak up. "Can't you see Aunt Beatrice means well? You're Aldenria's military leader - a decorated war hero. How can you let some woman blind you to reason?"

His voice took on a sneer. "She crawled out of the slums, trading on her looks to climb social ladders. Married into wealth just to—"

"Enough." Liam's voice cracked like a whip, silencing Sebastian mid-sentence.

In the heavy silence that followed, Liam circled the table to stand before Evelyn. When his fingers intertwined with hers, Evelyn looked up with tentative hope. After a night of despair, this small gesture of solidarity mended something fractured in her heart.

Perhaps Liam didn't completely hate her after all.

"Let's go," he murmured.

Evelyn hesitated. "Where?"

"Anywhere you want. Anywhere but here."
###Chapter 147

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes, an unexpected warmth spreading through her chest.

Even if Liam's words might be lies, they still made her heart flutter uncontrollably.

Yet the undeniable truth remained - he had moved out of their shared bedroom.

This man truly mastered the art of emotional manipulation, swinging between tenderness and indifference.

Evelyn slowly withdrew her hand, shaking her head. "I'm staying right here."

Liam's piercing gaze never left Evelyn as he gestured toward Beatrice's scowling face. "Living with a viper like her is exhausting. Either you match her venom, or she'll crush you beneath her heel."

Beatrice shot up, hands planted on her hips. "You insolent boy! How dare you speak to me like that?"

Liam remained fixated on Evelyn, completely ignoring Beatrice and everyone else present.

A slow, confident smile curved Evelyn's lips as she met Liam's concerned eyes. "Don't worry. I can be twice as vicious as her when needed."

Liam's brow furrowed, momentarily baffled by her unexpected response.

Just then, Winston rushed in breathlessly. "Sir, the courtyard is swarming with reporters and lawyers-"

Before he could finish, Isabella jumped up eagerly. "Show them in immediately!"

Beatrice added excitedly, "Escort them to the east wing reception hall. We'll join them once Ms. Grayson arrives."

Winston hurried out to comply.

Liam's eyes narrowed dangerously as he turned to Beatrice. "Is this your idea of coercion?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

Beatrice paled, her body stiffening with fear. She turned to Richard with trembling lips. "Richard, control your son! He's defending this wretched woman against his own aunt! She's clearly bewitched him!"

Richard snorted dismissively. "Look at your own actions first. Evelyn remains Liam's wife. Inviting outsiders to humiliate her? As family, you've crossed every line!"

Isabella interjected, "Beatrice only has the family's best interests at heart."

Sebastian quickly added, "Exactly, Father. Aunt Beatrice is helping Liam by removing this trash before she destroys our family."

Sebastian and Isabella had always despised Evelyn. Now they seized the chance to kick her when she was down.

Maxwell and Gregory remained neutral with their wives, wisely avoiding taking sides in this explosive situation.

Victoria watched the unfolding drama with barely concealed delight.

Winston reappeared, announcing, "The guests have been seated in the east wing. Ms. Grayson has arrived with her entourage."

Despite being family patriarch, Richard found himself powerless, trapped between his daughter-in-law and sister.

Beatrice marched up to Evelyn triumphantly. "There's no escape now. You'll apologize to Ms. Grayson and beg for mercy. Otherwise, prepare for jail!"

"If you confess to impersonating her and selling counterfeit paintings," Beatrice continued, "return the five million dollars, and issue a public apology - perhaps she'll show leniency."

Cassandra suddenly spoke up angrily. "Let's face them together, Evelyn. You have nothing to fear."

The thought of returning the money clearly pained Cassandra as she pulled Evelyn forward.

Evelyn had no intention of fleeing. This confrontation might finally reveal her true identity.

Liam stepped forward, gripping Evelyn's arm firmly. "You don't have to go. Stay here with me."

To his surprise, Evelyn gave him a determined smile and gently freed herself. With resolute steps, she followed Cassandra.

Fearing she'd be bullied, Liam immediately pursued them, his protective instincts in overdrive.
###Chapter 148

The others quickly abandoned their meals and hurried after them.

The side wing's grand reception hall was where the Blackwoods hosted their most prestigious events. The cavernous space glittered with crystal chandeliers and polished marble floors.

A crowd had already gathered - press photographers with their lenses poised, legal teams in sharp suits, art connoisseurs from prestigious institutions, and even several celebrated critics. Isabella Grayson and her assistant were the first VIPs to arrive.

Isabella froze at the unexpected spectacle. She'd anticipated a private family meeting, not this circus of flashing cameras. Turning on her heel, she made to leave immediately.

But fate intervened after two steps. Evelyn Carter stood blocking the exit, having just entered through the arched doorway.

"Ms. Grayson?" Evelyn called out, recognition flashing across her features from their prior video confrontation. "Leaving so soon?"

Isabella spun around, her displeasure evident.

At the mention of her name, reporters swarmed like sharks to blood, cameras whirring as they encircled both women.

Evelyn stepped forward with unshakable confidence. "I'm Evelyn Carter. The woman who replicated your work. My sister-in-law then sold the forgery for five million."

Isabella's eyes narrowed as she studied the striking woman before her. A cold sweat formed at her temples. "So it was you?"

"Indeed." Evelyn's smile never wavered.

Isabella swallowed hard, forcing nonchalance into her voice. "Consider the matter closed. Return the proceeds, and I'll donate them to charity instead of pressing charges."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Did this pretender truly believe such a feeble offer would suffice?

Meanwhile, art professors and critics pushed through the crowd to fawn over Isabella. Their obsequious compliments hung thick in the air.

Isabella accepted their adulation with practiced grace, shaking each hand while stealing glances at Evelyn.

The Blackwood family arrived en masse but remained spectators at the periphery.

Beatrice Thornton swept forward, her smile saccharine. "Isabella darling! I'm Beatrice Thornton - your hostess today. You're even more radiant in person!"

Isabella forced a smile. "Ms. Thornton, the pleasure is mine. Your reputation precedes you."

Beatrice preened before gesturing dismissively at Evelyn. "This impostor here actually had the audacity to-"

"I'm aware," Isabella interrupted coolly.

Beatrice lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "My legal team stands ready. Crush her publicly. Better yet, see her imprisoned."

Isabella's gaze turned calculating as she signaled her lawyers forward.

The legal team descended on Evelyn, rattling off potential charges as cameras captured every moment.

Evelyn remained unshakable, her posture regal amidst the storm.

Suddenly the doors burst open. Ryan Sullivan entered with a cadre of armed soldiers, his voice cutting through the chaos like a blade. "Who dares harass General Blackwood's wife? Have you all lost your minds?"

The room collectively held its breath.

Isabella gripped Beatrice's arm, her nails digging in. "You said the General requested my help! Why wasn't I told she's his wife? Why is the military involved?"

Beatrice paled. "I never imagined he'd deploy troops over some woman!"

Evelyn's heart swelled at the show of force, yet concern quickly followed. This spectacle would fuel endless gossip.

She turned to find Liam Blackwood watching with stormy eyes. Approaching him, she placed a gentle hand on his arm. "Liam, don't wield your rank as a weapon. This is my battle to fight."

Beatrice's panicked whisper carried. "I never thought he'd mobilize the army for her!"

Evelyn met Liam's gaze steadily. "Let me stand on my own merits today."
###Chapter 149

Liam Blackwood gazed into Evelyn Carter's crystalline eyes and noticed an undeniable transformation. The self-assurance radiating from her gaze was magnetic, her former hesitation completely vanished.

No matter the outcome, Liam resolved to stand firmly behind Evelyn. He would be her unshakable pillar of support.

"Very well," Liam responded, exchanging a meaningful glance with Ryan Sullivan.

Ryan immediately understood, directing the soldiers to withdraw beyond the doorway.

Isabella Grayson's confidence wavered visibly. Turning to the press, she announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your efforts today. I've decided to drop all accusations regarding Ms. Carter allegedly plagiarizing my work and selling it for five million dollars under my name."

Beatrice Thornton's face darkened as she seized Isabella's arm. "What are you doing?" she hissed. "This wasn't our agreement!"

Isabella whispered urgently, "Can't you see? General Blackwood clearly supports his wife. I can't risk his displeasure."

Beatrice scoffed, "Afraid he'll abuse his authority? With all these reporters here? Don't be ridiculous - he wouldn't dare."

The journalists immediately pressed forward. "Ms. Grayson, even if you're withdrawing your complaint, art fraud remains a criminal offense. Shouldn't this still be reported to authorities?"

Beatrice eagerly interjected, "Absolutely it should! Five million dollars isn't pocket change - this is serious fraud!"

The crowd erupted in agreement.

"Police involvement is necessary!"
"This can't be swept under the rug!"
"Identity theft or not, the buyer was defrauded!"
"This is clearly criminal!"

Several reporters discreetly activated live streams, their viewer counts skyrocketing as Isabella's fans flooded the broadcasts. Comments poured in faster than anyone could read.

Operating covertly, the journalists avoided engaging with viewers, fearing the Aldenrian soldiers might confiscate equipment or worse - provoke the powerful figures present.

Evelyn approached Isabella with a serene smile. "There's something I've been meaning to ask you."

Isabella stiffened. "Go ahead."

"You claim to be Isabella Grayson," Evelyn began, "yet you refused to show your face for years. You anonymously livestreamed your painting process while donating all proceeds to charity."

Her voice grew sharper. "Then after three years' absence, you reappeared - no longer painting publicly, but selling artwork commercially, endollarsing products, and attending paid events exclusively. Tell me - did you continue your charitable donations?"

Isabella remained silent, her discomfort palpable.

Her assistant snapped, "Stop moralizing! Isabella donated when her family was wealthy. Now that they've fallen on hard times, she's entitled to profit from her talent!"

Evelyn pointed directly at Isabella, addressing the cameras deliberately. "I'm not moralizing. I'm stating facts - this woman is an impostor."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Legal representatives rushed forward. "Ms. Carter! Such defamatory statements are actionable!"

The room buzzed with whispered speculation.

Liam couldn't tear his eyes from Evelyn. Her confidence was mesmerizing, her transformation striking.

In the shadows, Victoria Dawson observed everything, her stomach twisting as she recognized the raw adoration in Liam's gaze. Her worst fears were materializing.

Evelyn addressed the crowd calmly. "This isn't defamation."

Beatrice stepped forward aggressively. "Isabella has social media accounts and artworks as proof! Not only are you the fraud here, but now you're slandering her? Prepare for prison!"

Evelyn retrieved her phone calmly. "I'm placing a call. Listen carefully, and everything will become clear."

"What call?" someone demanded.

Evelyn didn't respond. As the line connected, she activated speakerphone.

Reporters surged forward, recording devices at the ready.
###Chapter 150

The phone rang four times before a woman answered in Solterran. "Hello? Who's calling?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she gripped the phone. She steadied her breathing and responded in flawless Solterran. "Good afternoon, Mrs. Winslow. Do you recognize my voice?"

Agatha Winslow gasped audibly. "Is that... Isabella?"

"You remember." Relief flooded Evelyn's veins.

She'd spent days tracking down the orphanage director's number. The real Isabella Grayson had registered her social media account under the director's name years ago.

If Evelyn truly was Isabella, they would have spoken often by phone. It was a gamble that paid off.

Agatha's voice cracked with emotion. "How could I forget? My dear child! Where have you been these three years? Are you well? When you vanished without word, I feared the worst..."

Several attendees understood Solterran, their eyes widening at the conversation. Yet skepticism lingered in their sideways glances.

The impostor calling herself Isabella paled dramatically, her assistant's face turning sheet-white beside her.

Evelyn cut in gently. "I'm well, Mrs. Winslow. But tell me - why can't I access the orphanage's public account anymore?"

"That wasn't me!" Agatha exclaimed. "Someone hacked it - this fraud using your name to scam donations! I wanted to expose her but lacked proof."

"I understand. Thank you." Ending the call, Evelyn addressed the room in Aldenrian. "Many of you understood that conversation. This number is publicly listed on Solterra's orphanage website - feel free to verify."

The fake Isabella lashed out desperately. "Your husband commands Aldenria's military! He could easily pressure someone to lie for you!"

Evelyn's expression hardened. She'd hoped to resolve this peacefully, but this woman kept dragging Liam's name through the mud. No more mercy.

Her gaze turned glacial. "Enough theatrics. The truest proof lies in skill. With so many art experts present, why don't we settle this with a live painting demonstration?"

"Exactly!" Cassandra Blake and Gregory Lynch chimed in. "Let your talent speak for itself!"

Before the impostor could respond, Richard and Eleanor Blackwood directed staff to set up two painting stations with fresh canvases and supplies. Their faith in their daughter-in-law shone through.

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes at their unwavering support.

"The one refusing to paint is clearly the fraud!" Cassandra shouted, sparking a chorus of agreement from reporters.

Livestream viewers skyrocketed into the tens of thousands.

"Who's the real Isabella Grayson?" reporters asked their audiences. "Comment your guesses while we await their artwork!"

The impostor's face drained of color as she scanned the sea of expectant faces - reporters, the Blackwoods, art appraisers. Cornered, she began sweating visibly.

Beatrice Thornton patted her shoulder with false confidence. "Even if Evelyn can paint, she's just copying others. Show everyone who's superior."

The challenge hung in the air like a guillotine's blade.
###Chapter 151

Before "Isabella Grayson" could react, Evelyn Carter had already picked up the brush. Though her memories were gone, she refused to rely on past works. With instinctive grace, she smoothed the paper and began painting.

"Those are definitely Isabella's hands! I'd recognize those elegant fingers anywhere," one viewer gasped.

"No doubt about it! That fluid motion is unmistakable. She's the real deal," another agreed excitedly.

"Three years since we last saw Isabella create. What magic will she show us today?" someone whispered in awe.

"Support Isabella! The charities must be celebrating her return already," a fan cheered.

Reporters watched Evelyn with rapt attention, visibly moved by the overwhelming support in the live chat. In their hearts, they'd already accepted her as the true Isabella Grayson, honored to witness this historic moment.

Victoria Dawson seethed silently. Trapped under the cameras' glare and branded an impostor by netizens, "Isabella" found herself forced to recreate a painting she'd only ever copied before.

As both women painted, the appraisers studied their progress closely. When they glimpsed "Isabella's" nearly finished work, their brows furrowed in disapproval before turning to Evelyn's canvas. The moment they saw Evelyn's painting, their eyes widened in shock.

The reporters seized the moment, addressing their audience: "Can our viewers identify the real Isabella from these two artworks?"

"Obviously the fake is just copying old works. She's memorized them so well they've become soulless replicas," one commenter scoffed.

"I knew she was fake! The moment she revealed her face, the live streams and charity work stopped," another pointed out.

"Both are stunning, but Evelyn's work has undeniable life and energy," a viewer praised.

"Case closed then. Evelyn must be the real Isabella. Who knew she'd be this adorable?" someone concluded.

Indeed, Evelyn's sweet, heart-shaped face only enhanced her charm on camera.

Finishing her piece, Evelyn set down her brush and glanced up - straight into Liam Blackwood's intense gaze. The depth in his eyes sent warmth flooding through her chest. Flustered, she quickly looked away.

As spectators gathered to admire Evelyn's work, "Isabella" completed hers. Comparing both paintings, the appraisers declared Victoria an impostor. Though technically perfect, her work lacked the authentic spark of true artistry, merely tracing a previous piece.

Evelyn's depiction of Blackwood Manor's gardens, however, took their breath away - every petal and leaf rendered with photographic precision.

"The evidence is clear. Ms. Evelyn Carter is the real Isabella Grayson. What do you have to say for yourself?" The lead appraiser turned sternly to the impostor.

Refusing defeat, Victoria snapped, "How dare you call me fake? My work is flawless!"

"Isabella's creations are spontaneous, never repeating. Yours looks machine-printed - completely contrary to her style." The appraiser's voice turned icy. "Clearly you've practiced this specific piece endlessly to achieve such empty perfection."

Victoria paled. When she looked for her assistant, the woman had mysteriously vanished.
###Chapter 152

The assistant lunged for the exit, only to be blocked by Aldenrian military personnel.

"Defamation charges could be filed against you," the lawyer warned sharply.

The appraiser scoffed. "Worry about yourself. That woman committed fraud."

Panicked, the imposter shoved through the crowd in a desperate escape attempt. Spectators watched as she barely made it three steps before being seized by waiting soldiers.

"Unhand me! I'll sue you all!" Evelyn Carter thrashed violently against their grip.

"Save your breath. We'll deliver you to the authorities personally," Ryan Sullivan countered coldly.

Within minutes, both the fraudster and her accomplice were hauled into an armored vehicle, disappearing toward the police station.

The gallery buzzed with conflicting reactions.

Beatrice Thornton's face darkened with shock. Sebastian Blackwood and Isabella Sinclair exchanged uneasy glances before reluctantly acknowledging Evelyn as Isabella Grayson.

Meanwhile, the art world erupted. The legendary Isabella Grayson's unexpected return after years of absence sent waves through the community. Her latest masterpiece, "Verdant Awakening," became the most sought-after piece overnight.

To everyone's astonishment, Evelyn refused monetary bids. "Donate to Aldenria's orphanages instead," she proposed. "The most generous contribution wins the piece."

Cassandra Blake grabbed her arm urgently. "Have you lost your mind?" she hissed. "That painting you sold me appraised at six million! This authenticated piece could fetch fifteen million easily!"

Evelyn's serene smile never wavered. "Consider donating your restoration profits too, Cassandra."

"That's my money!" Cassandra spat.

"I'm being polite because we're family," Evelyn said softly, though her steel-gray eyes flashed dangerously. "Shall we involve lawyers?"

Cassandra recoiled. Beneath Evelyn's gentle demeanor burned an unshakable resolve that promised ruthless consequences.

Swallowing her greed, Cassandra yielded. "Fine. I'll make the donation." She recognized the strategic value of aligning with Evelyn's public goodwill.

The bidding war escalated wildly. "Ms. Carter!" a reporter shouted. "My livestream shows a seven million bid!"

Numbers skyrocketed—eight million, ten million, then twelve. Sebastian stood frozen while Isabella clutched her pearls in shock. The Morrisons and Beatrice gaped at the spectacle.

Evelyn addressed the highest bidder graciously. "Your generosity touches me. Present the donation receipt, and the painting is yours."

The bidder fumbled for their phone. "I'll have finance wire it immediately!"

Then a commanding voice cut through the chaos. "One hundred million."

Gasps filled the room as all heads turned. Liam Blackwood stood there, his piercing gaze locked on Evelyn.

Their eyes met. Evelyn's breath caught. Confusion and disbelief flooded her senses as her pulse quickened inexplicably.
###Chapter 153

Liam approached Evelyn with quiet admiration as he studied her painting of his garden. "I'm offering fifty million for this masterpiece," he murmured, his voice low and sincere. "Any particular cause you'd like the donation to support?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise, her fingers tightening around the paintbrush. "Any foundation helping underprivileged children would be wonderful."

Their gazes locked as Liam turned to Ryan. "Arrange a fifty million dollar contribution to rural education initiatives in Valtoria."

While Ryan hurried to execute the order, Evelyn carefully rolled up her canvas and presented it to Liam.

"On behalf of those children, thank you," she said softly, her eyes shimmering with emotion.

As Liam accepted the painting, the stern lines of his face relaxed into an uncharacteristic smile.

The gathered crowd exchanged puzzled glances, whispers spreading about the nature of Evelyn and Liam's unusual connection.

Meanwhile, social media exploded with breaking news.

Isabella Grayson, the legendary artist, had resurfaced after three years to expose an imposter and auction her latest work for charity. The revelation sent shockwaves through both the art world and philanthropic circles.

A bold reporter pushed forward. "Ms. Grayson! Could we get a statement? Are you originally from Solterra or Aldenria? Was your disappearance related to General Blackwood?"

"Did you know about the imposter all along? When can we expect your next exhibition?" another journalist shouted.

The media swarm closed in around Evelyn, cameras flashing. Overwhelmed, she instinctively stepped back, unaware of the Blackwood family watching the scene with mixed reactions.

Seeing Evelyn's discomfort, Liam exchanged a glance with Ryan, who immediately signaled security to restrain the press.

Seizing the moment, Liam grasped Evelyn's hand and guided her through a discreet side exit, leaving Ryan to manage the chaotic scene.

"That's all for today," Ryan announced firmly. "As confirmed, Ms. Evelyn Carter is indeed Isabella Grayson. Further questions will be addressed at a later time."

Frustrated, the reporters turned their attention to the Blackwoods, bombarding them with inquiries. The family struggled to maintain composure while concealing their true feelings.

In the commotion, Victoria noticed Evelyn and Liam's disappearance and rushed to find them.

The garden stood empty when she arrived. Furious, she crushed a rose in her palm, its petals scattering to the ground.

She hadn't anticipated the organization sending such an incompetent imposter. That fool had embarrassed herself spectacularly in front of the real Isabella Grayson.

If this continued, Victoria feared her own deception might be exposed.

"You should have died when I first had the chance," she hissed to the absent Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Liam led Evelyn to the conservatory, where orchids bloomed in profusion. Gently withdrawing her hand, Evelyn looked up at him with nervous anticipation.

"Why bring me here?" she asked.

"Privacy for our conversation," Liam explained, leaning against a marble pillar, his intense gaze never leaving her face.

"Have your memories returned?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Yet you seemed certain of being Isabella earlier," he observed.

A small smile touched Evelyn's lips. "When one person calls you Isabella, it might be a mistake. When the whole world insists you're Isabella Grayson..." She trailed off meaningfully.

"Sometimes your art speaks for you," Liam said quietly. "Like fingerprints on canvas."
###Chapter 154

Liam found himself lost in Evelyn's luminous gaze, where hope shimmered like morning dew. Her delicate features belied an iron will that radiated quiet strength.

The prolonged silence made Evelyn fidget. "Could you investigate Isabella Grayson for me?" she asked abruptly. "I need to know the truth behind this identity."

"I've already tried," Liam admitted, running a hand through his hair. "Whoever created that persona covered their tracks impeccably."

Evelyn's fingers twisted in her lap. "Are you absolutely certain there's nothing more to find?"

"The only concrete evidence we have is your voice recordings with charity organizations," Liam explained. "Agatha Winslow already confirmed you're Isabella Grayson."

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest when sudden doubt clouded her expression. She studied Liam's face carefully. "Can I trust you?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Liam's lips twisted into a humorless smile. "What do you think?"

Evelyn hesitated, then shook her head. Too many strange occurrences had happened since her memory loss. Blind trust wasn't a luxury she could afford.

Her suspicions only grew when she recalled the second DNA test conducted under Liam's supervision.

Determination hardened Evelyn's features. Until she uncovered the truth about her identity, she would rely on no one.

"Let's get a divorce, Liam." The words hung in the air between them, calm yet final.

Liam froze, his expression turning glacial. Unseen by him, Evelyn's heart clenched painfully at her own words, yet she remained resolute in her quest for answers.

"I want to return to Solterra," she added softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Liam's hands curled into fists, his chest constricting painfully. He tilted his head skyward, drawing a shaky breath. "I'll take you there," he offered gently, deliberately avoiding the divorce topic. "When do you plan to return to Aldenria?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "I don't know. It could be months. Years." A pause. "Maybe I won't return at all."

The timeline stretched uncertainly before them. Recovering her identity or memories might take days - or a lifetime.

Turning away, Liam exhaled sharply, each breath like shards of glass in his lungs. The pain was excruciating.

In the heavy silence, Evelyn ventured, "Should we finalize the divorce before I leave?"

"Stay." The single word slipped out before Liam could stop it.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock, her gaze fixed on his rigid back.

Suppressing the ache in his chest, Liam turned and grasped Evelyn's arm. Tears glistened in his eyes as he pleaded, "Please, Evelyn. Don't go. I'll give you anything you want."

Evelyn stood frozen, utterly bewildered. The intensity in Liam's gaze suggested feelings she hadn't anticipated. Though inexperienced in love, she recognized the raw emotion burning in his eyes.

Yet his messages had clearly stated his heart belonged to Victoria Dawson. Why then was he begging Evelyn to stay?

A chilling thought occurred to her - perhaps Liam feared her stay in Solterra would reveal her true identity. After a long moment, she squared her shoulders. "What I want is my freedom."
###Chapter 155

Liam's face fell instantly. His fingers loosened their grip on Evelyn's arm as he took several steps back, his gaze dropping to the floor.

Evelyn couldn't comprehend his sudden change in mood, but she didn't care anymore. Her heart had already broken into pieces when she received that devastating text from Liam.

She no longer wanted to remain his wife - not when she knew he planned to marry Victoria immediately after Margaret's passing.

"Don't worry about upsetting Grandma, Liam. Her illness has erased all memory of me. Let's not delay this any longer and proceed with the divorce," Evelyn said quietly, swallowing the lump in her throat.

With visible pain in his voice, Liam asked softly, "Is this really what you want?"

"It is," Evelyn confirmed, her heart aching as tears threatened to spill.

For three long years, she had loved Liam with every fiber of her being. Whenever he visited Margaret, she would watch their interactions from a distance, lost in her own fantasies.

She had studied everything about him - probing Margaret for details about his preferences, his passions, his quirks, his past triumphs.

Her love for him never wavered, not even in her wildest dreams. But when she finally married him, she discovered his heart belonged to another.

Their marriage lacked the joy and fulfillment she had imagined. Seeing Liam's affection for Victoria twisted her heart with pain.

It was then Evelyn truly understood the agony of unrequited love within a marriage.

After a heavy silence, Liam asked solemnly, "Are you absolutely certain about this?"

Avoiding his gaze to hide her tears, Evelyn replied calmly, "I made this decision long ago. I've simply found the right moment to act."

Liam said nothing, merely lifting his eyes to the ceiling with a deep sigh.

Evelyn continued, "I trust you'll respect my choice. Let's end this peacefully."

With those final words, she turned to leave. But after only a few steps, Liam's unexpected response stopped her cold. "I can't simply accept your decision," he confessed.

Evelyn froze, struggling to contain her tears as sharp pain pierced her chest.

Liam was pushing her to the edge. He didn't love her, yet refused to let her go. Why cling to a marriage devoid of real affection?

She couldn't even perform basic household tasks or contribute financially. The hope of having children together seemed distant. They slept in separate beds, denying her even the warmth of his presence at night.

Tears streaming down her face, Evelyn steeled herself and spoke with icy resolve, "Then I'll file for divorce through legal channels."

She wiped her tears and marched forward, only for Liam to grab her arm again. His voice trembled with pain and regret as he reached for her.

Furious, Evelyn whirled around and violently shook off his grip. Through her tears, she cried out, "Enough! What do you want from me?"

Shocked by her outburst, Liam fell into heavy silence.

With anguish consuming her, Evelyn demanded, "What did I do to deserve this torment?"

"Who's tormenting whom here?" Liam countered, his eyes reddening with frustration as he rejected her accusation.

Wiping her tears, Evelyn shot back, "I married you for love, but you saw it differently. You claimed to respect me, promised to build a life together, yet your heart belongs to Victoria!"

"Whenever she calls, you come running. You even let her move into our home! Am I supposed to share my husband with another woman?"
###Chapter 156

Evelyn's voice trembled with desperation as she pleaded, "I'm begging you, Liam. Please... don't let my love for you turn into regret. I can't take this anymore—"

Before she could finish, Liam grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms.

Pressed against his chest, Evelyn stiffened, her pulse racing. The sudden closeness left her breathless.

Liam inhaled the delicate floral scent of her hair, the pain in his chest easing. For the first time in weeks, he wanted to hold her like this forever.

His lips brushed her ear as he whispered, "You married me because you loved me. And I... I want a future with you. Every word I said was true."

He exhaled shakily. "Yes, I cared for Victoria once, but that's over. I understand women, Evelyn. But if my presence hurts you, tell me. Just don't say 'divorce' again."

The word alone felt like a blade twisting in his ribs.

Maybe it was the warmth of his embrace or the raw honesty in his voice, but Evelyn's tears spilled over. "But you love her," she choked out. "You still love Victoria."

Liam cradled her face, pressing a kiss to her damp hair. "Never. I never loved her. At most, we were like siblings."

Evelyn clenched her fists, shoving against him. "Liar! You told me you loved her!"

Afraid she'd slip away, Liam tightened his hold. "I didn't. Stop this."

"You did!" Her voice cracked. "You texted me confessing your love for her! You said we should end things! You're a liar, Liam! A cheater!"

His grip loosened in shock. Gently, he wiped her tears with his thumbs. "You're right. I've been terrible. But show me that message, sweetheart."

"I deleted it!" she sobbed.

"Was it the day you asked for divorce papers?"

At her nod, realization dawned. "That day, a maid at Wright Manor spilled water on my phone. Victoria took it to dry—she must've sent that text. God, she's relentless."

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes widened.

Liam was mesmerized by the way her lashes glistened, her cheeks flushed from crying. She looked heartbreakingly beautiful.

Unable to stand her distress, he pulled her close again, resting his chin atop her head. Relief washed over him—now he understood why she'd wanted to leave.

"Don't cry," he murmured. "Let's talk this through. We've both been hurting each other without realizing it."
###Chapter 157

Evelyn finally regained her composure as she met Liam's intense gaze. His fingertips traced delicate patterns along her flushed cheeks, sending shivers down her spine.

"Were we really set against each other?" she whispered, voice trembling.

When Liam nodded solemnly, Evelyn tried to form another question. But the words caught in her throat like tangled vines.

With a heavy sigh, Liam cupped her face firmly. "Next time you're upset, don't immediately file for divorce. Talk to me first, understand?"

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she nodded obediently. Seeing her submission, Liam felt tension drain from his shoulders, his thumb brushing away a stray tear.

An electric silence crackled between them. Evelyn fidgeted with her sleeves, gaze darting everywhere before landing on Liam's bandaged shoulder.

"Does your wound still hurt?" she asked softly, unaware of how Liam's eyes darkened as they dropped to her parted lips.

His quiet hum of reassurance made Evelyn exhale in relief.

"We should go back," she suggested abruptly, nearly tripping over her own feet in her haste to escape the intimate moment.

As she turned, Liam's strong hand encircled her wrist. "Evelyn." His voice held a warning that made her pulse race.

In the greenhouse's floral-scented air, Liam's breathing grew ragged. He pulled her close until their bodies aligned perfectly.

Just as his lips descended toward hers, Evelyn stiffened. The realization struck like lightning - they stood in Eleanor Blackwood's prized greenhouse, where anyone could discover them.

"Stop! We can't-" Evelyn pushed against Liam's chest with surprising strength, breaking free. Without looking back, she fled toward the manor, her cheeks burning.

Liam watched her retreat, an ache spreading through his chest. Her rejection felt like salt in an unhealed wound.

Meanwhile, Evelyn burst into the grand parlor where Victoria Dawson held court with the Blackwoods. The sight of that perfect blonde head tilted toward Richard Blackwood made Evelyn's blood boil.

"There you are," Victoria cooed, rising gracefully. "Have you seen Liam anywhere?"

Memories of Victoria's manipulations flashed through Evelyn's mind - the stolen phone messages, the whispered lies. No more games.

Evelyn advanced like a storm. "Stop stealing my husband's phone to send me fabricated messages, Ms. Dawson." Her voice cut through the room. "Trying to break a marriage is despicable."

Victoria's porcelain complexion paled. "I don't know what you're-"

The gathered Blackwoods gasped. Only Isabella Sinclair remained unfazed, her smirk venomous. "No mistake here. Everyone knows Liam prefers Victoria."

Evelyn turned her icy gaze on Isabella. "Are you a parasite, Isabella?"

"How dare you!" Isabella shot up from her chair.

"Then why are you so invested in my husband's affections?" Evelyn countered coolly.

Isabella gestured wildly. "It's obvious! The whole family knows!"

"Enough, Isabella." Victoria grasped her ally's arm, adopting a wounded expression. "Let's not cause more drama."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. This battle was far from over.
###Chapter 158

Isabella Sinclair pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn Carter, her voice laced with venom. "Don't let your artistic fame inflate your ego. You're not even in the same league as Victoria!"

"She's the only suitable match for the general of Aldenria's military. You? You're insignificant!"

Evelyn clenched her fists, rendered speechless by such irrational hostility. She wasn't accustomed to dealing with such unreasonable behavior.

The tension shattered when Liam Blackwood entered. His icy glare dropped the room's temperature instantly. Everyone stiffened under his presence, including Isabella, whose arrogance wavered. Yet she clung to her belief - that Liam's heart belonged to Victoria, and he would always protect her.

Defying expectations, Liam strode directly to Evelyn and pulled her into a protective embrace. Evelyn tensed momentarily before cautiously meeting his gaze.

"Listen carefully, Isabella," Liam declared, his voice steel. "Whether you accept it or not, Evelyn will be my one and only wife."

Isabella gaped in shock, casting nervous glances toward Victoria. The other Blackwoods mirrored her astonishment, betrayal creeping into their expressions.

Victoria's eyes welled with tears as she stared at Liam with wounded betrayal.

Liam turned to Victoria, his tone unyielding. "Let me be clear, Victoria. I'd only marry you if I truly loved you. There's no romantic connection between us."

"To put it plainly, our relationship has always been sibling-like."

His expression darkened. "But I'm deeply disappointed in you. Your behind-the-scenes scheming has become unacceptable."

Cassandra Blake and Penelope Hart gasped, their shocked gazes darting between Liam and Victoria, struggling to process this revelation.

"That's not true! Why are you turning against me?" Victoria cried desperately, stamping her foot.

Meanwhile, Maxwell Blackwood and Penelope exchanged hushed whispers while Sebastian Blackwood and Isabella stood dumbfounded.

What was happening? Why would Liam describe his relationship with Victoria as familial? And what schemes was he referring to?

No one understood completely, but the implications hung heavy in the air.

"Leave immediately, Victoria," Liam commanded.

"No! I suffer from severe depression, Liam! Would you rather see me lose my mind?" Victoria shrieked, stomping again in defiance.

Evelyn sighed softly and gently tugged Liam's sleeve. Sensing her cue, he leaned down. "What is it?"

Tilting her head slightly, Evelyn whispered, "I've been studying psychology recently, particularly depressive disorders. From what I observe, Victoria may be feigning her condition."

After brief consideration, Liam asked, "She refuses to leave. Any suggestions?"

"I have an idea, but will you regret it later?" Evelyn sought confirmation.

Liam shook his head, a faint smile touching his lips. "Your call."

Satisfied, Evelyn nodded. The others watched their intimate exchange in astonishment, witnessing what appeared to be a couple deeply in love.

At that moment, it seemed impossible that Liam harbored feelings for Victoria. His gaze, brimming with devotion, remained fixed solely on Evelyn.
###Chapter 159

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she timidly proposed, "We could walk upstairs holding hands." Her real motive was crystal clear - to make Victoria seethe with jealousy by showcasing her closeness with Liam.

"You want us to hold hands?" Liam's eyebrow arched in that infuriatingly attractive way, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine.

Realizing her plan might backfire, Evelyn hastily explained, "I just want Victoria to understand she's lost this game and retreat gracefully."

What happened next stole her breath away. Liam suddenly closed the distance between them, his warm breath tickling her ear as he murmured, "Hand-holding won't make nearly enough impact."

Before she could process his words, his lips claimed hers in a kiss so tender it made her knees weak. The gathered crowd gasped audibly, their shocked expressions screaming disbelief - was this really the same cold, unapproachable General Blackwood they knew?

As if the kiss wasn't startling enough, Liam suddenly swept her off her feet. Instinctively, Evelyn's arms flew around his neck, her face nestling against his broad chest despite her racing heart.

Though she'd initiated this charade to provoke Victoria, Evelyn hadn't anticipated how Liam's unexpected actions would send her own heart into overdrive.

Under the watchful eyes of the assembled guests, Liam carried Evelyn upstairs with effortless grace, the bedroom door swinging shut behind them with finality.

Downstairs, Victoria stood trembling with barely contained fury, yet no one dared offer the seething woman comfort.

Cassandra leaned toward Gregory, whispering conspiratorially, "Do you think Liam's actually fallen for Evelyn?"

"With her beauty, talent, and kindness? Any man would be lucky to have her," Gregory chuckled, casting a meaningful glance toward the fuming Victoria.

"But Liam's always been so steadfast. How could his feelings change so suddenly?" Cassandra mused aloud.

Gregory's gaze flickered to Victoria before replying, "Interestingly, Evelyn bears an uncanny resemblance to how Victoria looked in her youth. That gentle demeanor is strikingly similar too. It's no wonder Liam would be drawn to her."

"Really? What did Victoria look like back then? Do you have photos?" Cassandra's curiosity was piqued.

Gregory swiftly produced his phone, scrolling through his gallery before revealing an old group photo. Cassandra's eyes widened as she took in the image of the Blackwood brothers with a young Victoria - a chubby-cheeked girl with sparkling eyes and an angelic smile.

"My god! She's the spitting image of Evelyn, especially when she smiles! Seems Liam's had a type since childhood," Cassandra remarked, handing the phone back.

Suddenly, Gregory blurted out, "You don't think... could Evelyn actually be Victoria?"

Cassandra smacked his arm sharply. "Have you lost your mind? The Dawsons watched Victoria grow up. You think they wouldn't recognize their own daughter?"

Their bizarre exchange drew curious glances from nearby guests. Flushing, Gregory quickly waved off the attention. "Pay us no mind - just idle speculation!"

Meanwhile, in the bedroom, Liam had barely set Evelyn down before she scrambled away, putting distance between them. "Put me down! You're still recovering," she protested, though her voice lacked conviction.

Ignoring her weak protests, Liam gently deposited her onto the bed. She lay there breathless - golden hair fanned across the sheets, cheeks flushed pink, eyes shimmering with a mixture of shyness and something darker, more primal.

In that moment, Evelyn Carter had never looked more irresistibly alluring.
###Chapter 160

Liam's strong arms caged Evelyn against the bed, his heated gaze burning into hers. His throat worked as he swallowed hard, the air between them thick with unspoken desire.

"Let me up," Evelyn whispered, her voice trembling.

"Oh, Evie..." Liam's deep voice curled around her like smoke, rich with need.

Hearing the intimate nickname, Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed. Every nerve in her body buzzed with anticipation. She knew exactly what he wanted.

Before she could protest, Liam closed the distance, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. A soft gasp escaped her, and he took advantage, deepening the kiss with possessive hunger.

The intensity left Evelyn dizzy. She melted into the sensation, her fingers tangling in his hair as she surrendered.

Liam tilted her head, his fingers threading through her silken strands as he kissed her harder. Their breaths mingled, the room growing hazy with passion. Evelyn's quiet moans only fueled Liam's desire, his lips trailing down her throat, making her knees weaken.

When his hand slid beneath her shirt, reality crashed over Evelyn. Her heart hammered as she stared at the ceiling. She caught his wrist firmly. "Liam, we can't."

He froze, desire warring with restraint. With a ragged breath, he pulled back, burying his face in the crook of her neck.

"But I need you, Evie," he rasped, his voice rough with longing.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. The hard press of his body against hers sent a thrill of fear through her.

"I—I'm scared," she admitted shakily.

Liam let out a dark chuckle. She could have just said she wasn't ready—not given him such a flimsy excuse.

He doubted someone with her past experiences would truly fear intimacy. Even with amnesia, desire didn't just vanish.

Propped above her, Liam brushed his lips against her ear. "Don't worry. I'm clean. You're safe with me."

Evelyn blurted, "Me too."

Liam smirked, pressing a kiss to her neck. His warm breath sent shivers down her spine. "I know. I trust you."

His lips lingered, teasing. Evelyn squirmed. "What are you doing?"

"Picking up where we left off," he murmured, fingers working at her buttons.
###Chapter 161

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she stopped Liam's advancing hand, hastily rebuttoning her blouse. "We should stop."

Confusion clouded Liam's striking features as he studied Evelyn's flushed face. She couldn't bring herself to meet his intense gaze, the air between them crackling with unspoken tension.

A dark thought crossed Evelyn's mind - would a man like Liam ever want someone with her complicated medical history? Three bouts of that particular infection weren't exactly dinner conversation material.

She ran through the possibilities: either he was madly in love with her, or completely convinced of her clean bill of health. Given their rocky relationship, the latter seemed far more likely.

"Liam," Evelyn asked softly, "is there something you're not telling me?"

His piercing blue eyes flickered momentarily before he answered, "No."

With his extensive resources and the meticulous work of his two most trusted operatives, Liam was absolutely certain about the DNA results.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her mood plummeting as she looked away. "I don't want to do this."

An icy sensation spread through Liam's chest, dousing his earlier passion. He carefully put distance between them, wrestling with emotions he couldn't articulate.

Perched on the edge of the bed, Liam released a heavy sigh. Minutes stretched as he struggled to find the right words, the courage to voice his thoughts evaporating.

Evelyn straightened her clothes while watching Liam closely. His inner turmoil was palpable - she'd bet her favorite paintbrushes he was hiding something.

"You always say we should be close," she reminded him gently. "As husband and wife, shouldn't we be completely honest with each other?"

Yet the words stuck in Liam's throat like stubborn glue. His intense stare bored into Evelyn, who grew increasingly frustrated with his silence.

"Fine," she snapped, standing abruptly. "I don't want to be near you right now. I'm going to my room."

She'd barely taken two steps when Liam caught her wrist, spinning her around to face him.

Liam looked devastatingly handsome as always, his military bearing giving him an air of unapproachable authority. For such a powerful man, those three simple words - "I love you" - seemed impossibly difficult.

What if he finally said them, only for Evelyn to reply, "I don't love you. My heart belongs to Julian"?

Evelyn saw the conflict in Liam's eyes and felt a flicker of hope. She just wanted honesty - and in return, she was prepared to trust him with the truth about her mysterious past.

Together, they could unravel everything. She waited patiently, giving him time.

"This is your room. I'll leave," Liam finally said.

Evelyn's temper flared. She moved behind him and shoved his broad back with both hands. "Go then! I don't want to see you!" Despite her words, her voice held more hurt than anger.

Her weak push barely budged the solidly built soldier, but Liam obediently walked toward the door. As Evelyn moved to slam it shut, he caught the frame.

"Are you angry?" he asked solemnly.

"No," Evelyn muttered.

"You seem upset."

"How would you feel in my position?"

Liam fell silent. She'd rejected his advances, then ordered him out of her room - it was enough to bruise any man's ego.

Watching Evelyn's stormy expression, Liam wondered if she'd somehow sensed his secret. "I-" he began, then stopped.
###Chapter 162

Evelyn slammed the door shut with more force than necessary. "Don't come looking for me today! I need space!" Her voice carried through the thick wood.

Liam remained motionless outside, his lips pressed into a thin line. Seeing Evelyn upset stirred conflicting emotions within him - a peculiar mix of affection and frustration.

Inside, Evelyn leaned heavily against the door, her fingers gripping the frame. She loved Liam deeply, yet doubts clouded her mind. The words she wanted to say to him lodged stubbornly in her throat.

After what felt like hours, Evelyn finally turned the doorknob. The hallway stood empty. Her heart sank as she searched the house, finding no trace of him. With a heavy sigh, she retreated to her room.

Days passed without word from Liam. He skipped meals, avoided their shared spaces, and spent nights elsewhere. Evelyn waited in his study until exhaustion claimed her, only to wake alone.

Late one night, Evelyn clutched a pillow to her chest, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. Where was he? Why hadn't he reached out? She resisted the urge to text him, annoyed that he'd taken her request for space so literally.

The next afternoon, sunlight bathed the winding mountain road. Few vehicles traveled this stretch between cities. In the backseat of a luxury car, Liam stared absently out the window, his expression unreadable.

Ryan gripped the steering wheel while Adrian sat shotgun. Both men exchanged confused glances. Their commanding officer had traveled hours to complete military duties, only to immediately return to Aldenria without rest.

When they reached a sloping hillside, Liam's voice broke the silence. "Pull over here."

"Here, sir?" Ryan's eyebrows shot up.

"Yes." Liam's tone left no room for argument.

The car veered onto the grassy shoulder. Liam stepped out and disappeared into the dense thicket without explanation.

Ryan scratched his head. "What's General Blackwood doing?"

Adrian shrugged. "Nature call?"

Ryan snorted. "Since when does the general relieve himself roadside?"

They waited in bewildered silence until Liam reappeared, cradling something carefully in his hands. His usual stern expression had softened.

Ryan's eyes widened. "Is he... picking flowers?"

Indeed, Liam carefully arranged a bouquet of white zinnias, gently removing wilted leaves. A rare smile touched his lips as he imagined Evelyn's reaction.

"Did you see that?" Ryan elbowed Adrian. "He's actually smiling!"

Adrian could only nod, his mouth slightly agape at the unexpected display of tenderness from their normally stoic commander.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn had been engrossed in her novel when a sudden craving for fresh fruit struck her.

She descended the grand staircase, her bare feet silent on the marble steps. The moment she entered the sunlit living room, Victoria's dramatic voice filled the air.

Victoria sat surrounded by the Blackwood family, her delicate features twisted in distress. "I don't blame Liam," she sniffled. "He must have his reasons."

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "She's been poisoning his mind against me with vicious lies. That's why he's grown distant!"

Victoria dabbed at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. "She plays men like chess pieces. I can endure the pain, but I fear for Liam. She's dangerous."

Eleanor frowned. "Liam's no fool. He wouldn't be easily manipulated."

"Hasn't he changed?" Victoria countered.

Richard considered this. "He's certainly more present at home lately."

"More talkative too," Cassandra added.

Maxwell nodded. "And far more approachable than before."

Isabella smiled. "These seem like positive changes to me."

Victoria's face fell as she realized her plan was backfiring. Her protest died on her lips when she noticed Evelyn standing in the doorway.

Evelyn greeted the family before fixing Victoria with a steady gaze. "Ms. Dawson, I chose not to expose your misdeeds out of courtesy. Why are you stirring trouble in my home?"

Victoria's mask of innocence slipped back into place. "Evelyn, darling, we were just chatting. No trouble at all."

Isabella shot Evelyn a disdainful look. "We know Victoria well enough without your interference."

Eleanor quickly interjected. "We were simply catching up. Evelyn, would you like some dessert? I'll have the kitchen prepare something."

Evelyn's patience snapped. "I've tolerated enough lies. Someone here constantly twists the truth and sows discord."

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes. "How cruel! Why are you attacking me like this?"

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "Still pretending? On Grandmother's birthday, Liam gifted me jewelry and a gown."

"You ruined that gown with dye," Evelyn continued. "Destroyed my carefully planned gift."

Gasps filled the room. Cassandra clutched her pearls. "How dreadful!"

Victoria's hands clenched, her perfect manicure digging into her palms. "These are vicious lies!"

Evelyn's eyes blazed with long-suppressed anger. "You threw yourself down stairs to make Liam think I pushed you. That's why I was banished from Blackwood Manor."

"When I was injured, you pretended I abused you in front of Liam," Evelyn continued relentlessly. "At the military dormitory, you staged another fall."

"You're a master manipulator," Evelyn concluded. "My silence wasn't weakness - it was mercy."

The family stared at Victoria with dawning horror and revulsion.

Victoria sprang to her feet, trembling with rage. "Lies! All lies!" she shrieked. "You're the one destroying my relationship with Liam! Now you're turning his family against me!"

Her carefully constructed facade crumbled completely, revealing the venom beneath.
###Chapter 164

The air crackled with tension as distrustful glances darted between family members. Evelyn Carter clenched her fists, her patience wearing dangerously thin.

How could someone be this brazen?

Trapped without concrete evidence, Evelyn felt utterly helpless. To compound matters, Victoria Dawson burst into theatrical sobs, playing the victim card with practiced ease.

Just as Evelyn was strategizing her next move, the sharp click of military boots echoed through the hall.

"Liam..." Victoria sniffled dramatically.

All heads swiveled toward the entrance where Liam Blackwood stood framed in the doorway. His tailored navy suit accentuated his commanding presence, the silver insignia on his lapel glinting under the chandelier. In his hand, a vibrant cluster of zinnias swayed gently.

Liam had rushed back from the military base the moment his meeting concluded. The thought of Evelyn facing Victoria's manipulations alone had haunted him throughout the afternoon.

Now, witnessing the scene firsthand, Liam realized Victoria's transgressions went far beyond what he'd imagined.

With deliberate steps, he approached Evelyn, offering the flowers. For a breathless moment, Evelyn simply stared, her lips parting in surprise. When their eyes met, her entire face illuminated with joy.

Her pulse quickened as warmth flooded her cheeks, an effervescent happiness bubbling in her chest.

Fingering the delicate petals, she murmured, "Where did these come from?"

"There's a meadow behind the base," Liam answered softly, his gaze never leaving hers.

Evelyn's smile deepened as she inhaled the flowers' subtle fragrance. "You were gone all day yesterday."

"Emergency briefing at the base," he explained.

"I see," she replied, still admiring her unexpected gift.

Liam intertwined their fingers before addressing the room. "Mother, Father, we'll retire for the evening."

Richard Blackwood nodded immediately. "Of course, son. Rest well."

Eleanor Blackwood chuckled, shaking her head. "Liam, darling, when bringing flowers to your wife, most men choose roses or lilies. Not wildflowers."

"Evelyn prefers zinnias," Liam countered without hesitation.

The intimate nickname and unwavering defense sent fresh color rushing to Evelyn's face. She ducked her head shyly.

Nearby, Gregory Lynch nudged Cassandra Blake with a smirk. "Couldn't even spring for florist flowers? My man's getting cheap."

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "At least he picks them himself instead of having his secretary order arrangements like someone I know."

Gregory's shoulders slumped in defeat.

As Liam guided Evelyn toward the staircase, he typed rapidly with his free hand.

Victoria's pleas went unanswered. "Liam! Liam, please!"

Eleanor intercepted her firmly. "Victoria, darling, you can't force what isn't meant to be."

Simultaneously, every phone in the room pinged - except Victoria's. The family exchanged puzzled looks before checking their devices.

Gregory's jaw dropped. "Well, damn." He shot Victoria a withering glare. One by one, the others followed suit, their expressions shifting from shock to outright disgust.

In that moment, Victoria understood Liam's silence hadn't been indifference. He'd been compiling damning evidence - audio recordings and surveillance footage exposing every one of her schemes against Evelyn.

The game was over.
###Chapter 165

Evelyn felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. Her anxious gaze darted between Richard and Eleanor. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, I—"

They strode past her without acknowledgment, their expressions icy and detached.

The other guests in the grand parlor mirrored their disdain. Their hushed whispers carried just enough for Evelyn to hear.

"After all these years, I still can't spot a fraud playing the victim."

"Don't blame yourself. She fooled me too."

The Blackwoods' contempt was palpable. Though Evelyn usually handled social slights with grace, this cut deeper. The room emptied until only she remained.

Fury simmered in her veins, her eyes burning with unshed tears. Jaw clenched, she stormed upstairs, packed hastily, and slammed the mansion door behind her.

Outside Blackwood Manor, Evelyn's resentment festered. She fumbled for her phone. "Hello? Is this Cassandra's father? Your daughter just married into the Blackwood fortune."

Meanwhile, in her sunlit chambers, Evelyn carefully arranged the zinnias in a porcelain vase. She placed them on the balcony ledge, humming as she watered the vibrant blooms.

Their delicate beauty captivated her. A radiant smile lit her face throughout the entire process.

A gentle breeze danced through the balcony as golden sunlight bathed the space. The warm rays tinted Evelyn's cheeks a rosy pink.

Her eyes crinkled with joy as she reached out to caress the velvety petals.

After a peaceful moment, she noticed the unusual quiet. Curious about Liam's whereabouts, she turned to find him sleeping soundly on the four-poster bed.

Evelyn crawled onto the mattress with feline grace, bracing herself on her hands as she leaned over Liam's striking features. She studied his peaceful expression for long minutes.

Liam lay perfectly still, his breathing deep and even. Thick lashes fanned over high cheekbones, his sculpted lips slightly parted.

Despite his breathtaking beauty, an aura of quiet intensity surrounded him even in sleep—a reminder of the formidable general he was.

Evelyn still marveled that she, of all people, had become Liam's wife. That he'd gifted her flowers, no matter how unconventional the gesture, made her heart flutter.

With a soft smile, she inched closer. Holding her breath, she couldn't resist brushing her lips against his.

The moment their mouths connected, electricity shot through her veins. Her entire body trembled with nervous exhilaration. The impulse had been irresistible.

As she pulled away, triumph bubbled in her chest—until Liam's eyes fluttered open, his gaze drowsy yet piercing.

Evelyn's face burned crimson. She pressed her lips together like a child caught stealing cookies, unable to meet his gaze.

"I-I'm sorry," she stammered.

Liam's throat worked as he swallowed hard. "Sorry for what?" His voice was rough with sleep.

Evelyn ducked her head. "I just... wanted to thank you. The flowers meant so much to me."

A low hum rumbled in Liam's chest, his eyes darkening. When Evelyn moved to leave, his hand shot out, encircling her wrist.

He'd never imagined a simple bouquet would earn him a kiss. Now he craved more—a deeper connection, a proper embrace.

"Is that all?" His eyebrow arched.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "What?"

Liam found her innocence endearing. "What else makes you happy?" His fingers slid from her wrist to intertwine with hers.

"Books," she answered without hesitation. Liam's gaze intensified, the air between them crackling with unspoken promise.
###Chapter 166

Liam found his thoughts drifting to Victoria, who always had her nose buried in books. To her, literature wasn't merely information - it was nourishment for the soul.

Evelyn spoke softly, not wanting to disturb him. "E-readers are so convenient these days, and many classics are available for free. You should rest more. I'll be quiet."

His fingers slowly uncurled from hers. A storm of emotions raged within him. Though he cared deeply for Evelyn, memories of Victoria lingered like stubborn shadows.

Unconsciously, he'd begun blending the two women in his interactions with Evelyn. Shaking off these thoughts, he closed his eyes.

Evelyn rose from the bed and selected a novel from the shelf. She settled into an armchair and began reading as Liam rested. The peaceful atmosphere in the bedroom deepened the sense of tranquility.

Occasionally, Evelyn couldn't resist stealing glances at his relaxed sleeping face. Just watching him filled her with warmth and joy. These stolen moments felt like pure happiness, making her heart swell with contentment.

After four hours, Liam stirred awake to find Evelyn dozing at the desk. Checking his phone, he quietly slipped from bed and approached her. With gentle care, he lifted her slight frame and carried her to the bed.

He tucked the blanket around her shoulders, then propped himself up on one elbow. Gazing at her serene expression, he tenderly brushed a lock of silken hair from her forehead.

After freshening up in the ensuite bathroom, Liam stepped into the hallway to a cacophony of raised voices.

He followed the commotion downstairs to find Evelyn's parents and brother making themselves at home in the living room with shocking disregard for decorum.

"Bring Evelyn down here immediately! How dare she marry without our permission? Does she think we're dead?" Vincent Carter, Evelyn's father, spat with barely contained rage.

Dominic lounged with crossed legs, eyeing the decor with greedy appreciation. "Dad, Evelyn's got good taste in rich men. This place must have cost millions."

Vincent sprawled across the sofa, arms spread arrogantly. "Marrying money means nothing! She's just like her mother - completely useless."

"She's been married before but never shared a cent with me. I'll teach her some manners soon enough."

Eleanor Blackwood recoiled at the visitors' vulgarity, discreetly ushering her daughters-in-law and grandchildren to their rooms. Only Richard remained with the unwelcome guests, his expression stony.

When Liam descended the staircase, Richard looked visibly relieved. "Liam, your in-laws have arrived. Would you handle this? I have matters to attend to."

After Richard's hasty exit, Liam approached the trio with a stern gaze. Though the Carters recognized him as their son-in-law, his commanding presence made them shift uncomfortably.

Dominic uncrossed his legs and sat upright, shooting nervous glances at his parents. Vincent struggled to maintain his bravado under Liam's piercing stare.

Dorothy, however, beamed with false warmth. "You must be Evelyn's husband! What a pleasure to meet you."

"I'm Dorothy Carter, Evelyn's mother. This is her father Vincent, and brother Dominic. We just wanted to visit our dear daughter."

Vincent exploded with rage. "You stupid woman! Don't you understand social hierarchy? He should be groveling to impress us!"

"Born trash, raising trash - that's all you've ever done!"

Dorothy rolled her eyes at Vincent's habitual vulgarity, worsened by his drinking problem. Old habits died hard, and Vincent had already begun his tirade during their first visit to their son-in-law's home.

Liam's hands clenched into fists, his expression darkening like gathering storm clouds.
###Chapter 167

Liam Blackwood casually took a seat across from the three visitors.

An immediate chill settled over the room, the temperature seeming to drop several degrees. Dominic Carter swallowed hard, his fingers twitching nervously. There was something hauntingly familiar about the general's face, but he couldn't place where they might have met before.

Vincent Carter leaned forward aggressively. "No greeting for your in-laws? You've got some nerve treating us like this."

Liam had thoroughly investigated Evelyn's adoptive family before their marriage. He knew she wanted nothing to do with them, and he had no intention of fostering any relationship either.

"State your business," Liam said flatly, his voice devoid of warmth.

Vincent's face flushed with anger as he jabbed a finger toward Liam. "I'm your wife's father! You should show some respect!"

"If you're just here to waste my time, leave now," Liam countered, his steely gaze making Vincent shrink back slightly.

Vincent quickly got to the point. "Where's the bride price for marrying my daughter? Don't think you can get away without paying at least a few million."

"It's been taken care of," Liam replied smoothly.

"Then where is it?"

"With Evelyn."

Vincent's eyes bulged. "How much was it worth?"

"Half of everything I possess."

Three jaws dropped simultaneously. Dorothy Simmons clutched her chest as if having a heart attack.

Vincent licked his suddenly dry lips, his tone turning wheedling. "Traditionally, the bride's parents receive the gifts. Why give them to my daughter?"

Liam rested his chin on one hand, his expression bored. "Evelyn owns half my estate. What she chooses to share with you is her decision. I won't interfere."

His voice turned dangerous. "And if she decides to give you nothing, you'll accept that."

Vincent scoffed loudly. "That ungrateful brat wouldn't dare! I'll make her regret it if she tries—"

Before he could finish, Liam's fist slammed onto the table, making everyone jump. "Touch one hair on her head, and you'll be breathing your last by sunrise."

The threat hung heavy in the air. Even Dominic stopped fidgeting, frozen in place.

After an awkward silence, Dominic forced a shaky smile. "So... what was your name again?"

"General Liam Blackwood." The name had an immediate effect - all color drained from their faces as they exchanged panicked glances.

They desperately tried to convince themselves it was just a coincidence. There was no way their Evelyn could have married the most feared military leader in Aldenria.

Dominic's voice cracked as he asked, "And... where do you work, exactly?"

"Royal Heights Military Base."

Dominic shot to his feet so fast he nearly knocked over his chair. "General Blackwood! Our deepest apologies for disturbing you!"

He grabbed his parents' arms urgently. "Mom, Dad, we should leave immediately."

Vincent shook him off angrily. "Leave? We haven't gotten our money yet!"

"Are you insane?" Dominic hissed, sweat pouring down his face. "That's the Supreme Commander of Aldenria's armed forces!"

Dorothy gasped as realization struck. "The same General Blackwood who shut down Vince's casino?"

Dominic nodded frantically, practically dragging them toward the door. "We need to get out of here before—"

Vincent suddenly roared, shaking off his son's grip. "I don't care if he's the damn president! He married my daughter, which makes him family!"

"You have no idea who you're dealing with!" Dominic shouted, his hands balling into fists.

Vincent scoffed loudly. "What's he going to do? Shoot me with one of his fancy military toys? Let him try! I'm not afraid of some weapons dealer!"

Dominic looked ready to strangle his own father as he whispered harshly, "That 'weapons dealer' commands the deadliest special forces in three nations. He could have us disappeared before we reach the parking lot!"
###Chapter 168

Dorothy stamped her foot, glaring at Vincent with undisguised irritation. "Have you lost your mind completely? Are you drunk or just plain stupid? One minute you're coherent, the next you're spouting nonsense. If you won't leave, we will!"

Vincent jabbed a threatening finger toward Dorothy and Dominic. "Nobody's going anywhere. With me here, what's there to fear anyway?"

Liam felt a migraine coming on. If this commotion continued, Evelyn would surely wake up. Having such troublesome in-laws was utterly exhausting. He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text.

Meanwhile, Vincent continued making a scene in the living room for several more minutes until Ryan entered with four armed soldiers. Their rifles gleamed under the chandelier as they advanced with military precision.

Vincent's bravado evaporated instantly. His knees buckled and he collapsed to the floor, trembling violently. "P-please, s-sirs, I didn't m-mean—"

Dominic looked equally shaken. He hurried to help his father up, whispering urgently, "Dad, let's just go."

"M-my legs... I can't feel them," Vincent stammered.

Dorothy rolled her eyes but reluctantly helped support her husband as they retreated.

Liam leaned against the sofa, massaging his temples as he watched the trio stumble out. His heart ached for Evelyn—having family like this must have been unbearable for her.

Ryan and the soldiers efficiently escorted them from Blackwood Manor.

Outside the wrought iron gates, Vincent gulped the fresh air like a drowning man. He cast a fearful glance back at the imposing estate.

Only when certain they weren't being followed did his bravado return. "Who knew my daughter married a military general? Did you see those guns? Actual rifles!"

Dorothy shot him a withering look. "This entire disaster is your fault, you old fool! We could've had a comfortable life, but you had to ruin everything with your drunken antics."

Fury overtook Vincent. His fists rained down on Dorothy as he roared, "Shut your nagging mouth! Our daughter's living in luxury while I get nothing! I'll teach you to disrespect me!"

Dorothy shielded her head, trying to escape the blows. When cornered, she fought back desperately.

Dominic observed impassively. Having witnessed his mother's beatings since childhood, he only intervened when life-threatening. Right now, his mind was elsewhere—scheming how to exploit Evelyn's connection to power. A government position through Liam's influence... The thought made him smirk.

As Dorothy screamed for help, Dominic simply walked away whistling.

After exhausting his rage, Vincent staggered off, leaving Dorothy bruised and weeping. With shaking hands, she dialed Evelyn, who answered immediately.

"Evelyn," Dorothy sobbed, "your father beat me again..."

She sniffled pitifully. "Please help me, darling. I can't take this anymore!"

In Evelyn's three years of regained memory, Dorothy's calls always followed the same pattern—complaints about Vincent's abuse, followed by requests for money. Never before had she actually asked for rescue.

"Mom," Evelyn asked softly, heart heavy, "where are you?"
###Chapter 169

"Evelyn, I'm outside your gate," Dorothy wept uncontrollably.

"At my gate?" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"To be exact, the Blackwood estate's main gate. We found out about your secret marriage. Your father caused a huge scene here, and your husband's men had to remove him... at gunpoint."

"Your father took his anger out on me right here in front of your house!"

"My life is ruined! Dominic won't even help me! I'm done with both of them. I can't rely on my husband or son anymore."

"Evelyn, you're my only hope now!" Dorothy's voice cracked with desperation.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. Even with her fragmented memories, her feelings toward her adoptive parents had grown distant. After discovering her true identity, those emotions had faded completely.

"Wait there. I'm coming out," Evelyn said before ending the call and leaving her room.

Descending the grand staircase, she spotted Liam in the living room, engrossed in his phone. The moment her footsteps echoed through the hall, his head snapped up.

"I need to step out for a while," Evelyn announced awkwardly.

Liam set his phone aside and rose gracefully. "Your family was just here."

"I know," she replied quietly.

His intense gaze locked onto hers as he approached. "Where are you going? Should I come with you?"

Evelyn shook her head quickly. "That's not necessary."

But Liam noticed the subtle tremor in her hands and the uncertainty in her eyes. "At least tell me where you're headed?" He respected her privacy, yet an inexplicable protectiveness surged within him.

Evelyn hesitated before gesturing toward the gates. "My mother... she's waiting outside."

Hearing the careful neutrality in Evelyn's voice, Liam softened his tone. "Would you like me to invite her in?"

"No!" The word came out sharper than intended. Evelyn feared her adoptive family might cause more trouble for the Blackwoods.

An uncomfortable silence stretched between them. Liam casually slipped his hands into his pockets and gave a noncommittal hum.

"I should go," Evelyn murmured.

Liam simply nodded.

She took three steps before freezing mid-stride. Without turning around, she suddenly pivoted and marched back toward him.

Noticing her determined expression, Liam's lips curved slightly. "What is it?"

Evelyn inhaled deeply, gathering courage. "Liam, as long as it's just the two of us... I won't ask for a divorce. Unless you want me to."

His smile turned tender. "Where is this coming from?"

"It's fine if you don't love me. But please... end things with Victoria. Let's keep her out of our marriage."

Liam's breath hitched. His pulse raced as those three words - I love you - lodged in his throat again. Heat crept up his neck. Why was confessing his feelings harder than leading troops into battle?

Before he could form a coherent sentence, his body betrayed him with telltale signs - rapid heartbeat, flushed cheeks, nervous sweat.

Evelyn misinterpreted his silence. "Is that too much to ask?"

"I'll do it," Liam stated firmly.

A radiant smile transformed her face, eyes sparkling like sunlight on water. "Liam, I'll trust you this once. I should go now."

With a small wave, she turned and walked away, leaving Liam standing there, still grappling with unspoken emotions.
###Chapter 170

Evelyn paused at the doorway, turning back with a playful wink. Her fingers formed a delicate heart shape in the air.

That radiant smile of hers could melt glaciers. Absolutely adorable.

Liam's breath caught in his throat. His pulse quickened as warmth spread through his chest. A faint blush colored his cheeks as he returned her smile sheepishly.

The moment Evelyn disappeared down the hallway, the mansion felt cavernous. Liam's shoulders slumped slightly as the vibrant energy she brought dissipated.

To combat the sudden emptiness, he paced the marble floors before retreating to his study. Paperwork would be the perfect distraction from her absence.

At the Blackwood estate gates, Evelyn spotted Dorothy - face bruised, eyes swollen. Without hesitation, she hailed a cab and directed it to the nearest hospital.

In the sterile examination room, Evelyn insisted on comprehensive tests. Dorothy only agreed when assured she wouldn't bear the costs.

A minor hiccup occurred during the bloodwork. One vial mysteriously disappeared, requiring a second draw for complete analysis.

The final report showed only superficial injuries. No internal damage or underlying conditions.

At the hotel restaurant, Dorothy piled her plate high with delicacies, eating with gusto. Evelyn merely picked at her salad.

She studied the woman across the table. Pity warred with frustration in her chest.

Dorothy's life read like a tragedy - chronic gambling addiction, years shackled to an abusive alcoholic. Two children raised without guidance or discipline.

Her son Dominic was constantly evading loan sharks. Her daughter Rosalind had dropped out of school for questionable work.

Evelyn wondered if Dorothy's biological daughter still lived.

Upon learning of Evelyn's wealthy marriage, Dorothy saw an escape route. Visions of luxury danced in her head.

"Stay at the hotel for a week. It's already paid for," Evelyn offered.

Dorothy set down her fork. "Darling, does your husband have any vacant properties? I could move in immediately."

Her voice trembled. "With a modest allowance, I'll divorce that wretched man. I've suffered enough."

Tears tracked through her makeup. "Not one happy day since our wedding. Just beatings and humiliation."

Evelyn sighed. "Why stay after the first attack?"

"And go where? How would I survive? What about you children?" Dorothy countered.

"Street sweeping. Recycling. Waitressing. Factory work. Countless options if you truly wanted independence."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "But you'd rather live off his dividends than earn your own keep."

Dorothy's face fell. She pushed food around her plate, appetite gone.

"Mother," Evelyn leaned forward. "Do I seem like the same girl who left home ten years ago?"
###Chapter 171

Dorothy's eyes shimmered with affection as she studied Evelyn's face, her lips curving into a tender smile.

"My darling, you've transformed beyond recognition. Who would have thought my awkward little girl would grow into such an exquisite woman? You've made me so proud."

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably under the praise, leaning forward to rest her elbows on the café table. "In what ways have I changed exactly?" she pressed.

Clasping her hands together, Dorothy mirrored Evelyn's posture. "As a child, you favored your father's plain features. You used to beg for cosmetic procedures when you grew up."

"But look at you now - a natural beauty. That elegant poise, those delicate features, and that heart-shaped face could charm anyone."

Evelyn's fingers instinctively rose to trace her cheekbone as Dorothy spoke.

"And your temperament! You were so combative before, always ready for a fight. Now you're gentle as a lamb, with that soothing voice of yours."

"No wonder you've captured the heart of the military commander. You're practically flawless now."

"You used to clash constantly with Dominic and argue with me and your father. But these days, you navigate conflicts with such wisdom - anticipating problems before they arise. Your manners have become impeccable too."

"Really, the progress is remarkable."

"Evelyn, having you as my daughter fills me with pride."

A frown creased Evelyn's brow. "Do I seem like a completely different person to you?"

Dorothy's automatic nod froze mid-motion. She caught herself, giving Evelyn a startled look. "You'll always be my daughter, no matter how much you change."

Evelyn's bitter smile and silent nod confirmed Dorothy's words.

Judging by Dorothy's unfiltered honesty, she clearly didn't suspect Evelyn's true identity. She remained blissfully unaware.

"Who could be orchestrating all this?" Evelyn wondered.

After settling the bill, Evelyn pressed two thousand dollars into Dorothy's hand and escorted her back to the hotel before departing.

Instead of returning to Blackwood Manor, Evelyn hailed a cab leaving Aldenria behind. Hours later, she arrived in another city where she arranged new DNA tests using both their blood samples.

At registration, she used Rosalind's name and identification to maintain anonymity. Without special privileges, she expected to wait a week for results.

After the tests, she carefully tucked the receipt slip inside her phone case.

Night had draped the city in stillness. The empty streets glowed amber under the streetlights, devoid of pedestrians with only occasional cars passing by.

Evelyn rested her head against the cool window glass. The rhythmic blur of passing scenery began lulling her into drowsiness.

The sudden ringtone shattered the quiet.

She grabbed her phone instantly. Liam's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?" she answered without hesitation.

Liam's deceptively light tone carried an undercurrent of tension. "Not coming home tonight?"

"I am," she assured, detecting the subtle blend of concern and displeasure. "I'm on my way back now."

"Where are you? I'll come get you."

"No need, I'm already in a cab. Almost there."

"Be careful," he ordered.

"Okay."

The call ended abruptly. Evelyn's unease grew as she set her phone aside.

Ten minutes later, the cab pulled up to Blackwood Manor's imposing gates. After paying the fare, Evelyn hurried toward the entrance.

Suddenly, a towering figure materialized from the shadows, illuminated by the soft glow of perimeter lights. The lighting carved sharp angles across his face, emphasizing his commanding presence. His piercing gaze locked onto her.

Evelyn's steps faltered. Her pulse quickened as she swallowed hard.

Liam.

"Why is he waiting at the gates?" she wondered.

In that moment, Evelyn felt exactly like a child caught sneaking home after curfew, bracing for parental wrath.
###Chapter 172

The moment Evelyn realized Liam had been worried about her unannounced absence, a wave of guilt crashed over her, mingling with nervous anticipation.

Liam approached with measured steps, his piercing gaze holding mysteries Evelyn couldn't decipher. "Were you traveling?" he asked, his voice deceptively calm.

Evelyn's pulse quickened as she studied his expression, her mind racing with possibilities.

"How could he know? Did he have me followed?" The thought chilled her, though she'd been meticulous about covering her hospital expenses, leaving no paper trail.

Noticing her wary expression, Liam's lips curved slightly as he gestured toward the retreating cab. "Out-of-town taxis have distinct license plates. They rarely operate in Aldenria," he explained.

Evelyn glanced at the disappearing vehicle, understanding dawning. She nodded. "Yes."

"Care to share why you went?"

"No," Evelyn answered without hesitation.

The finality of her response struck Liam like a physical blow. Further questions seemed pointless. When partners kept secrets, it spoke volumes about the chasm between them.

With quiet resignation, Liam reached for her hand. "Let's go inside," he murmured, his disappointment barely concealed.

Evelyn let herself be led, his firm grip sending warmth radiating through her. The simple contact filled her with unexpected sweetness, making her heart flutter with forbidden hope.

Though known for his brisk military stride, Liam matched his pace to hers as they crossed the threshold of Blackwood Manor. Each step felt weighted with unspoken words.

At the bedroom door, Liam paused before releasing her hand. Though midnight approached, sleep was the furthest thing from Evelyn's mind. She longed to prolong their time together, yet feared speaking this desire might be misconstrued.

Hesitating, Evelyn pushed the door open and leaned against the frame, her eyes locking with Liam's. The intensity of his gaze stole her breath, dark with unvoiced emotions.

Neither moved to bridge the distance between them. In the charged silence, their eyes communicated what their lips couldn't.

"Goodnight," Evelyn finally whispered, breaking the spell.

Liam exhaled softly, a ghost of a smile touching his lips as he slid his hands into his pockets. "Sleep well," he rasped.

"Okay," she breathed, beginning to close the door with deliberate slowness.

The door caught abruptly. Evelyn looked up to find Liam's hand blocking its path. Before she could react, he pushed inside, his imposing frame filling the space between them.

"You—" Her protest died as Liam captured her lips in a searing kiss.

With one fluid motion, he kicked the door shut and lifted Evelyn clean off her feet, pinning her against the wooden surface as the kiss deepened.

Evelyn gasped against his mouth, her world tilting as strong arms enveloped her completely. Her hands fluttered uncertainly before finding purchase on his broad shoulders.

The kiss was all-consuming, a wildfire of passion that left her dizzy. Liam's powerful body radiated heat, his primal energy overwhelming as he claimed her mouth with unrestrained hunger.

His lips moved with devastating precision, each touch igniting new fires within her. The raw intensity of his desire left Evelyn breathless, swept away in the storm of his embrace.
###Chapter 173

The kiss lasted an eternity, leaving Evelyn's lips tingling and her breath stolen.

She gasped for air as she pushed Liam away, her chest heaving from the intensity.

With trembling hands, she pressed against his broad chest, breaking the passionate embrace. Liam reluctantly released her, their foreheads touching as they both struggled to catch their breath.

"Come with me when I return to base tomorrow," his deep voice rumbled, sending shivers down her spine.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. He'd just come home, and already he was leaving again.

She understood his duties - the military didn't wait for anyone. For a man like Liam Blackwood, even this brief visit was a rare concession.

Eleanor had mentioned how he'd been visiting more frequently since their marriage, unlike the months-long absences before.

But Evelyn couldn't go. Not yet. Not when she was so close to uncovering her true identity, waiting for that crucial DNA report.

"I can't," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Liam's lips curved into a bittersweet smile before he pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.

As her feet touched the ground, Evelyn's knees nearly buckled. Her fingers still clung to his uniform, unwilling to let go.

"Call me when you're ready. I'll send a car," he promised.

She nodded, her throat tight with emotion.

Liam ran his fingers through her hair, his touch tender despite the barely restrained desire in his eyes. "I leave at dawn."

"Let me see you off," she pleaded, her eyes glistening.

"No. Sleep in." His thumb brushed her cheek. "Call if you need anything."

"Okay," she agreed quickly, though the word tasted like ashes.

His gaze burned into her one last time before he murmured, "Goodnight, Evelyn."

She stepped aside as he opened the door. "Goodnight, Liam."

The door clicked shut behind him with finality. Evelyn pressed trembling fingers to her swollen lips, replaying every electrifying moment.

A blush crept up her cheeks as she remembered how he'd pinned her against the wall, his usually controlled demeanor shattered by passion.

She fell onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows to muffle her giddy laughter.

When morning came, Liam was already gone.

Days passed in a haze of longing. Evelyn moved through her routine like a ghost, her thoughts constantly drifting to Liam.

He'd told her to call, but what would she say? That she missed him? That her bed felt too empty without him?

And he hadn't called either. Probably buried in work. Or maybe he didn't miss her at all.

Meanwhile, Dorothy kept calling, dropping not-so-subtle hints about needing money and pushing for divorce papers.

Evelyn ignored each call, her heart heavy with conflicting emotions.
###Chapter 174

Evelyn Carter supported Dorothy Simmons' decision to divorce, but she refused to offer her a place to stay.

Instead, she urged Dorothy to find a job, to expand her knowledge and skills, and to become a better version of herself.

Dorothy, realizing there was no point in further discussion, retreated to the Carter family estate with bitter disappointment.

A week later, the long-awaited DNA test results finally arrived.

Despite mentally preparing herself, Evelyn was utterly shattered by the truth they revealed.

She stood frozen outside the hospital, tears blurring her vision as she read the words confirming she had no biological connection to the Carters.

The report validated every suspicion, every inconsistency about her identity.

If she wasn’t Evelyn Carter, then who was she? Where were her real family and friends? And what sinister motives had driven someone to mold her into this false identity?

Lost in thought during the car ride home, her mind swirled with unsettling questions. Overwhelmed and desperate for comfort, she found herself longing for Liam Blackwood’s presence.

Though the sun bathed the world in golden warmth, Evelyn’s heart was a storm of turmoil.

Summoning all her courage, she pulled out her phone and dialed Liam’s number. After a hesitant pause and a deep breath, she pressed the call button.

The phone rang twice before he answered, sending her pulse racing.

"Evelyn," Liam’s deep, soothing voice echoed through the line.

Her heart fluttered at the sound. Despite their week of silence, his tone held an unexpected warmth—one that made her wonder if she was imagining it.

"Are you busy?" she asked cautiously, her voice laced with hope and uncertainty.

Every conversation with Liam left her breathless, torn between affection and fear.

"Not at all," he replied.

"Oh." Evelyn’s gaze dropped, emotions clashing inside her. She wanted to confide in him, but doubt held her back. Words failed her.

"Is there something you need?" he asked.

She sighed. "No. I just realized it’s been a week since we last spoke. I wanted to check on you."

Liam stood outside his office, an important meeting momentarily forgotten the second he saw her name on his screen.

Leaning against the wall, he glanced down at his shoes, a faint smile touching his lips. "Yeah. A week."

For him, those seven days had felt like an eternity.

Late at night, he’d wrestled with the urge to call her—afraid of disturbing her sleep, of awkward silences, or worse, of her not wanting to talk at all.

Worse still, he feared the overwhelming need to fly back to Aldenria just to see her.

The week had been torture, his longing growing stronger, yet he forced himself to hold back.

Evelyn fidgeted with the hem of her shirt, nerves making her fingers restless. After a long pause, she murmured, "I finished my work."

Liam sounded confused. "Hmm?"

Her face flushed, her palms damp with nervousness. Taking a deep breath, she pushed forward. "I’m done with everything, so I thought… maybe I could come see you. But I don’t want to interrupt your—"

"Don’t worry about that," Liam cut in, his voice laced with excitement. "Wait for me at home. I’ll pick you up tomorrow. Is that okay?"
###Chapter 175

Evelyn lowered her head, a soft smile playing on her lips as she murmured, "Okay."

Liam exhaled in relief. Though he didn’t want to hang up, the meeting demanded his attention.

"I should go," he said.

A pang of disappointment twisted in Evelyn’s chest. Two minutes? That’s it? She had heard of couples who talked for hours, lost in each other’s voices.

But then reality struck. Those were couples in love.

What she and Liam had was different. Even if he had the time, he wouldn’t waste it on sweet nothings with her.

"Alright," she whispered, the word laced with quiet resignation. "Bye."

The call ended. Evelyn set her phone aside and turned to the window, uncertainty and longing swirling inside her.

Would Liam send someone for me tomorrow?

The next morning, Evelyn rose early, dressed carefully, and waited. She lingered by the window, watching for any sign of a military vehicle.

But noon came and went with no word from Liam.

Instead, the doorbell rang—Victoria and Julian stood on the doorstep, arms laden with gifts.

The Blackwood family might not have liked Victoria, but they would welcome Julian warmly.

Evelyn had no desire to see either of them. She slipped away to the garden, settling by the pool to wait.

Minutes stretched into hours. Restless, she paced the edge of the water, anticipation gnawing at her.

"I never thought I’d lose to you."

The voice sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine. She turned.

Victoria stood there, arms crossed, her sharp eyes filled with venom.

Evelyn didn’t flinch.

Victoria smirked, stepping closer. "Look at you—so delicate, so fragile. And yet, you’ve somehow wrapped the Blackwoods around your finger. Even Liam."

"Wrapped around my finger?" Evelyn scoffed. "What are you trying to say?"

Victoria’s expression darkened. "You ruined everything. All my plans. I should kill you right now."

Evelyn frowned. "Plans?"

"My plan to marry Liam," Victoria hissed. "It was supposed to be me. I’ve worked for this my entire life."

Evelyn shook her head and turned to leave.

But before she could take a step, Victoria lunged.

Fingers tangled in Evelyn’s hair, yanking her backward. Pain shot through her scalp.

"Let go!" Evelyn gasped.

Victoria dragged her toward the pool’s edge, her grip unrelenting.

With a sharp shove, Evelyn plunged into the water.

Cold swallowed her. Water rushed into her nose, her mouth, choking her.

Panic seized her. She thrashed, desperate for air.

Her head broke the surface—only for Victoria to slam her back under.

Evelyn fought back, clawing at Victoria’s arms.

With a splash, Victoria tumbled in after her.

But Victoria was a strong swimmer. She hauled Evelyn deeper, forcing her under again.

Darkness crept at the edges of Evelyn’s vision.

She was running out of time.
###Chapter 176

Evelyn felt her consciousness slipping away like sand through fingers. The icy water embraced her like a lover's final farewell, pulling her deeper into its merciless depths. Each desperate gasp only brought more liquid fire into her lungs.

Death's cold fingers brushed her cheek. In that terrifying moment, Liam's face flashed before her eyes - her last tether to life in this drowning darkness.

Then suddenly, Victoria's grip vanished. The woman who had been trying to drown her now thrashed wildly, screaming, "Help! Someone help me!"

Through the roaring in her ears, Evelyn faintly heard Victoria's cries, followed by two splashes nearby.

Her vision darkened at the edges as she fought against the water's deadly embrace, her body rising and falling with the waves.

When she broke the surface again, her blurred vision caught Liam carrying Victoria to safety.

Was this real? Why was Liam here? Had he really chosen to save Victoria instead of her?

The crushing weight of realization confirmed this wasn't some nightmare. Liam had returned - only to rescue the woman who couldn't swim, leaving Evelyn to drown. Her heart turned to stone in that instant.

Closing her eyes, she stopped fighting. The water welcomed her descent, its cold fingers soothing her burning lungs as darkness claimed her.

Suddenly, strong arms yanked her back to the surface. Julian's frantic voice cut through the haze, "Evelyn! Stay with me!"

But she didn't want to stay. The pain of living was too great. The future too bleak. Death would be kinder.

She felt herself sinking again into the abyss, weightless and free.

Then - a jolt. Her eyes flew open to sterile white ceiling tiles. The hospital. And beside her bed - Liam's worried face, with Julian standing nearby.

"Evelyn." Liam's voice was rough with emotion as he grasped her cold hand. "How are you feeling?"

His touch still burned with familiar warmth. She pulled away slowly, unable to meet his gaze.

Liam's expression crumpled as she withdrew, pain flashing across his features.

In his panic to save Victoria - who'd been terrified of water since childhood - he hadn't seen Evelyn struggling beneath the surface. By the time he'd carried Victoria to shore, Julian had already reached Evelyn.

He couldn't abandon someone who couldn't swim. Yet the cruel irony was that Evelyn, who could swim, had nearly drowned.

Julian stepped closer, his doctor's calm barely masking his concern. "You gave me quite a scare. You weren't breathing when I pulled you out. Thank God for medical training."

Evelyn's heart shattered. Tears threatened but she refused to let them fall - she wouldn't waste another tear on this hopeless love.

She turned to Julian, her voice barely a whisper. "Thank you for saving me, Dr. Whitmore."

His smile was gentle. "Just glad you're okay. No thanks needed."

Her next words came out hollow. "Please... I need to be alone."

Liam leaned forward, hand gripping the bedrail. "Let me stay with you," he pleaded.

Evelyn closed her eyes against the fresh wave of pain, turning her face away. "Liam... I don't want to see you anymore."
###Chapter 177

Liam stepped out of the hospital room, with Julian following closely behind, shutting the door with a soft click.

Noticing Liam's grim expression, Julian asked bluntly, "Liam, do you still have feelings for Victoria?"

Liam froze mid-step, his face hardening like stone.

"Victoria may have gone too far trying to win you back, but it's only because she loves you deeply. That incident at the pool must have been an accident."

"If you have time, you should check on Victoria. Nearly drowning might have left her traumatized," Julian suggested.

Despite Julian's words, Liam remained silent. His broad shoulders tensed as he walked away with determined strides, leaving no room for further conversation.

Watching Liam's retreating figure, Julian's eyes darkened with resolve. Victoria had crossed a line. No matter how many warnings he'd given her to stay away from Evelyn, she kept causing harm.

Liam exited the hospital and entered the waiting military vehicle.

Ryan and Adrian turned anxiously toward Liam in the backseat, their faces etched with concern. "General Blackwood, is Mrs. Blackwood alright?"

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Liam as he leaned back, closing his eyes. His shoulders slumped under invisible burdens. "She's stable."

"General, let us know if you need anything. Mrs. Blackwood needs you now more than ever," Adrian offered carefully.

Liam's jaw tightened further, his hands clenching into fists on his thighs. He remained silent, the tension in the vehicle growing thicker.

A crushing wave of guilt and self-loash washed over him. The woman he loved had nearly died before his eyes, yet he'd saved Victoria instead.

Evelyn's refusal to see him was understandable, but it left him drowning in bitterness and pain, his soul restless.

After a long silence, he finally spoke, his voice rough. "Did we recover the surveillance footage from the pool?"

Adrian hesitated. "General, the security system at Blackwood Manor was hacked an hour ago. All data was wiped clean."

Liam's voice turned steely. "Get the tech team to recover it."

"We tried, sir. They said the damage was too extensive. These hackers were top-tier professionals," Ryan explained.

Liam fell silent again, his weary form resembling a statue against the leather seat, motionless and withdrawn.

After another pause, his deep voice resonated slowly. "Do either of you know how to win back a woman?"

Ryan and Adrian exchanged glances. After an awkward moment, Ryan admitted, "General, I've never been in a serious relationship."

Adrian cleared his throat. "I've had two, but both complained I lacked romance. Said my schedule was too demanding. Neither worked out."

Liam absorbed their words in silence before abruptly exiting the vehicle. He returned to Evelyn's hospital room, taking up his vigil on the bench outside.

Hours passed unnoticed as nurses bustled by. As night deepened and the hospital grew quiet, Liam remained rooted to the spot.

Only when the lights in the VIP ward dimmed did he finally rise, pushing the door open with infinite care.

Evelyn lay sleeping peacefully. Approaching her bedside, Liam's gaze - both intense and tender - lingered on her pale face.

She'd nearly slipped through his fingers forever. The thought was unbearable. Had Julian not acted swiftly, would Evelyn be gone now?

Liam settled into the chair beside her bed, gently cradling Evelyn's hand in his. He pressed a feather-light kiss to her knuckles. Though her skin was warm, the fear lingered.

Evelyn stirred at his touch, slowly waking. When her eyes focused on Liam, she immediately withdrew her hand.

The sudden emptiness in his palm felt like losing her all over again, leaving Liam drowning in despair.
###Chapter 178

Liam exhaled deeply, reclining in his chair with uncharacteristic softness. "Did I disturb your sleep?"

After hours of silent turmoil, Evelyn had regained her composure. A glimmer of detachment shone in her hazel eyes as she responded, "You should rest. I'm perfectly fine now. There's no need for you to stay."

He tried to reconstruct the day's events. "I couldn't spot you underwater. Besides, Victoria has aquaphobia."

A sardonic smile played on Evelyn's lips. While the first explanation held water, the second was laughable. How could a socialite from old money not know how to swim?

Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Spare me the excuses. They're meaningless."

Noticing the venom in her tone, he replied helplessly, "Evelyn, I couldn't abandon Victoria in that state."

This was the ultimate litmus test of loyalty. In life-or-death moments, logic blurred and primal instincts took over.

Liam loved Victoria profoundly, and Evelyn had no right to question his choice. Yet the knife of betrayal twisted deeper in her chest.

Tears welled up as Evelyn met his gaze, her voice quivering. "Liam, Victoria can swim. She pushed me in and held me underwater. She believes I stole you from her. She wanted me dead."

His expression darkened instantly, silence stretching between them.

Evelyn wiped her tears, cursing her weakness. She'd sworn never to cry for him again, yet here she was.

Regaining control, she asked coolly, "Is there any surveillance footage?"

"None," Liam answered flatly.

Her lips curled bitterly. "So without evidence, my accusations are baseless?"

Liam found no words.

An icy chill spread through Evelyn's veins. There was nothing left to say.

She burrowed into the blankets, turning her back to him. Silent tears traced down her cheeks, soaking into the pillow.

As midnight approached, the hospital room grew still. In the dim glow of monitors, Liam remained motionless, his piercing gaze fixed on the darkness. The night stretched endlessly before them.

Dawn arrived.

At Wright Manor, a military SUV screeched to a halt. Liam emerged swiftly, followed by Adrian and Ryan. The butler startled at their abrupt appearance.

Liam strode past without acknowledgment, his regal bearing radiating danger. He marched straight toward the dining room.

Inside, Victoria breakfasted with Margaret. Her face lit up. "Liam!"

Margaret smiled warmly. "Here to see Victoria?"

His expression darkened as he seized Victoria's wrist, dragging her toward the garden. "Come with me."

Victoria stumbled. "Where are we going?"

Liam's silence was answer enough.

Alarmed, Margaret hurried after them. "Liam! She hasn't finished eating!"

He hauled Victoria to the pool's edge. Realizing his intent, she struggled violently. "Liam, stop!"

His grip tightened as she screamed toward the balcony, "Uncle Julian! Help!"

With one brutal motion, Liam hurled her into the water.

"No!" Margaret's face drained of color as she rushed forward, her aged legs trembling. "Have you gone mad? She'll drown!"
###Chapter 179

Ryan and Adrian moved swiftly to restrain Margaret, preventing her from reaching the pool's edge. Victoria's panicked thrashing in the water was erratic, nothing like the controlled movements of someone who knew how to swim.

"Help! Liam, I can't swim!" she screamed.

Hearing the commotion, Julian rushed out onto the balcony from the second floor. His eyes widened at the scene below before he bolted toward the pool area.

Liam stood motionless by the water's edge, watching Victoria's desperate struggles with unnerving detachment. Despite her flailing limbs, she somehow managed to keep her head above water.

Margaret's tearful pleas for help echoed across the estate as she begged both the butler and Julian to intervene.

When Julian reached the scene, Adrian blocked his path.

"Liam, have you gone mad? Victoria can't swim!" Julian's voice shook with barely contained fury, veins bulging in his neck. "Are you trying to drown her?"

Equally distraught, Margaret clutched at Liam's arm. "Please, Liam! Save her! She's terrified of water!"

Liam remained stone-faced, his icy gaze fixed on Victoria's struggling form. The chaos around him seemed to have no effect on his composure.

The butler arrived moments later, only to be stopped by Ryan, who prevented any interference.

As Margaret sobbed uncontrollably, Julian's voice cut through the air like a blade. "Are you punishing Victoria for Evelyn? She's been devoted to you since childhood! How can you be so cruel?"

Liam spoke calmly to Adrian. "How long has it been?"

"Fifteen minutes, General Blackwood," Adrian replied.

Julian, being a doctor, felt his frustration mounting. Why couldn't Victoria just hold her breath and sink? Didn't she realize Liam would save her if she truly appeared to be drowning?

The idiot just needed to sink!

Julian was nearly beside himself with rage. He couldn't understand why Victoria couldn't fake drowning properly.

After five more agonizing minutes, Liam finally gave the order with quiet authority. "Pull her out."

"Yes, General Blackwood."

Ryan and Adrian immediately grabbed life preservers and threw them into the pool. Victoria grabbed one and weakly paddled toward the edge.

The moment Victoria reached solid ground, Margaret rushed forward and enveloped her in a crushing embrace. With trembling hands, she cradled Victoria's face, her voice thick with tears. "My poor darling, what have they done to you?"

Margaret turned on Liam with fire in her eyes. "Get out! You're not welcome here!" she shouted.

Victoria quickly grabbed Margaret's arm. "Grandmother, no! You can't send Liam away. He must have misunderstood me because of Evelyn. I don't blame him."

Julian could only stare in disbelief at Victoria's words, his face darkening with anger. She'd completely forgotten his instructions.

Victoria's hydrophobia was severe. When submerged, her entire body would shake uncontrollably, overwhelmed by paralyzing terror.

Once out of water, she'd be left weak and trembling, drenched in cold sweat and on the verge of fainting.

Margaret clenched her jaw.

It was always about Evelyn. That woman was truly vile. Not only had she stolen Victoria's childhood sweetheart, but she kept causing trouble for her.

Margaret silently vowed that Evelyn would pay dearly for this.

Liam approached Victoria, his pupils contracting slightly. Beneath his composed exterior, shock rippled through him. Suppressing his turmoil, he asked softly, "Are you hurt?"

Julian opened his mouth to speak, but Ryan quickly covered it with his hand.
###Chapter 180

Liam's jaw clenched in silent fury, his voice trapped beneath an invisible weight as unseen forces dragged him away.

Victoria, feigning fragility, swayed dramatically before collapsing against Margaret. "Liam, I almost died! You know I'm terrified of water. Were you trying to kill me?"

The absurdity struck him immediately. Despite her claimed aquaphobia, she'd tread water effortlessly for twenty minutes. Now she stood perfectly composed, without a single symptom of panic.

Margaret's grip tightened around Victoria's wrist, her eyes narrowing with sudden suspicion. "Victoria... since when did you conquer your fear of water?"

A beat of hesitation. Then Victoria burst into theatrical sobs. "Grandmother, I'm shaking! I was so scared I thought I'd die!"

Liam turned on his heel without a word, Ryan and Adrian falling into step behind him.

"Liam!" Victoria's wail echoed across the estate. "Don't walk away from me! Why are you being so cruel?"

Margaret pulled her "distraught" granddaughter into an embrace, their shared tears a perfect performance.

As the car sped toward the hospital, Liam leaned back, eyes closed. The pieces didn't fit. This wasn't the Victoria he remembered.

His mind flashed to her homecoming a year ago - how she'd thrown herself into his arms, whispering "I missed you so much" with tears glistening. He'd attributed her changed demeanor to time abroad. Now he knew better.

"Ryan." His voice cut through the silence. "I want Victoria's complete dossier. Past ten years. You have forty-eight hours."

Ryan's eyebrows shot up. "Investigating Ms. Dawson?"

A curt nod. "Every detail."

The two soldiers exchanged bewildered glances. Victoria came from impeccable lineage, had grown up with Liam. What could possibly warrant investigation?

Still, Ryan nodded. "Understood, General Blackwood."

The hospital ward stood empty when they arrived. Liam's pulse spiked as he scanned the vacant room before storming to the nurses' station. "Where's Evelyn Carter from the VIP suite?"

The nurse flinched. "Discharged an hour ago."

"Without my authorization?" His voice turned dangerous.

"She... left a note and slipped out quietly, sir."

Fists clenched, Liam marched back to the car, dialing Evelyn's number repeatedly. Each attempt met the same automated rejection: "The number you have dialed is unreachable."

Blackwood Manor offered no solace. The butler reported Evelyn's brief return - ten minutes to pack a single bag before vanishing again.

Alone in their bedroom, Liam sank onto the mattress, his gaze falling on Evelyn's abandoned books in the corner. Last time she left, there'd been a letter. This time? Nothing.

His chest constricted painfully as he collapsed backward. Fumbling for his phone, he hit speed dial - the one he'd programmed to Evelyn's number months ago.

The same robotic voice answered. His fingers trembled against the screen.

Was this it? Had she truly left him for good? The ache in his chest deepened with each hollow ring.
###Chapter 181

Liam Blackwood turned every stone in Aldenria searching for Evelyn Carter.

Her childhood home. Her mother's residence. The apartment she rented last month. No trace of her remained.

Just twenty-four hours had passed, yet exhaustion carved deep lines into his handsome face. The same heartbreak he'd felt a decade ago when leaving Valtoria returned with crushing intensity.

At midday, an unexpected visitor arrived at Blackwood Manor. Natalie Winslow, a sharp-eyed attorney, presented herself as Evelyn's legal representative to finalize divorce proceedings.

Sunlight streamed through the study's bay windows, yet the air hung thick with tension.

Natalie slid a platinum card and legal documents across the mahogany desk. "My client has signed. This contains your account details, General Blackwood. She'll repay the withdrawn amount in monthly installments."

Liam's knuckles whitened as he stared at the papers. Each breath felt like swallowing shards of glass.

Evelyn had promised to communicate. Had sworn she wouldn't abandon their marriage without discussion. Were her vows so easily broken?

Did she truly despise him enough to send a lawyer instead of facing him?

He exhaled sharply, lifting glacial eyes to meet Natalie's. "Where is she?" His voice could have frozen hell.

"Ms. Carter declines visitation. Once you sign, you'll naturally see her when collecting the divorce decree." Natalie maintained perfect professionalism.

A humorless smirk twisted Liam's lips as he snatched the documents. Without reading, he tore them in two.

Natalie's composure cracked for a single heartbeat.

"Tell her to face me like an adult if she wants this." Liam tossed the shredded papers into the wastebin.

Natalie rose, squaring her shoulders. "Should you refuse, General Blackwood, my client will pursue litigation."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Liam's fist clenched, veins standing stark against his skin.

Natalie swallowed hard. With a curt nod, she turned toward the door.

His voice stopped her mid-step, dark with promise. "There isn't a soul in Aldenria I can't find."

A shiver raced down Natalie's spine. Taking this case against the Blackwood heir had been career suicide from the start.

She barely maintained her dignity exiting the estate. Only when safely in her car did she release a shuddering breath.

One hour later, Evelyn received the update in Rosalind Fairchild's cozy apartment. The torn papers. The threat. The inevitable court battle.

Evelyn sagged into the sofa, exhaustion weighing her bones.

On the coffee table sat two steaming bowls of truffle macaroni with pancetta, a fruit platter, and dog-eared novels.

Rosalind joined her with a jar of cornichons. "You're really going through with this?"

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "It's done."

Only the 500,000 dolar debt to Rosalind complicated matters. Repayment would take time.

Rosalind speared a cheesy forkful. "So your husband really is Aldenria's Iron General?"

Evelyn slid onto the floor, stirring her pasta absently. "Unfortunately."

"And he's refusing?" Rosalind asked around a mouthful.

Evelyn blew on her fork. "Vehemently."

Rosalind froze. "Does he love you?"

The question struck like a blade between ribs. Evelyn's throat closed. She could only shake her head, suddenly finding her macaroni fascinating.
###Chapter 182

"Why won't he divorce you if he doesn't love you?" Rosalind's question hung heavy in the air.

Evelyn poked at her food listlessly, the once comforting mac and cheese now tasteless on her tongue.

"His grandmother adores me," she murmured, pushing the noodles around her plate.

Rosalind snorted. "Ah, the dutiful grandson act."

Silence descended again as they mechanically ate their meal.

After several minutes, Rosalind picked up a shiny red apple and began peeling it with practiced motions.

"You know," she mused, "no matter how passionate the romance starts, marriage always changes things. The fire burns out."

The knife flashed as she continued, "Marriage isn't about love. It's about obligation and convenience. As long as he provides for you, does it matter if he loves you?"

Evelyn gave her a wry smile. "When did you become so cynical about marriage without ever trying it?"

Rosalind chuckled darkly. "I've seen enough miserable marriages to last a lifetime. Besides, being single isn't so bad."

"I envy you," Evelyn admitted. "After this divorce, I'm never marrying again. I'll live out my days alone, just like you."

Rosalind nearly choked on her apple slice. "How can you be alone if you're with me?"

Evelyn managed a small smile as she accepted the offered fruit.

Rosalind's expression turned curious. "It's been two days since you left. Do you think your husband will come looking for you here?"

Evelyn took a bite of apple. "He doesn't know we're friends. He won't find me here."

"But he's Liam Blackwood!" Rosalind exclaimed. "Head of Aldenria's military defense! The man who develops weapons systems for our country!"

She leaned forward. "If he can handle advanced weaponry, finding one missing wife shouldn't be difficult, right?"

Evelyn froze mid-bite, the apple suddenly tasting like ash in her mouth. Rosalind had a terrifying point.

The doorbell chose that exact moment to ring.

Rosalind wiped her hands on a napkin. "That'll be my package." She rose from the table. "Be right back."

Left alone, Evelyn forced herself to chew the apple slice, her stomach twisting with anxiety.

At the door, Rosalind's breath caught in her throat. Towering before her stood a man who radiated power and authority. His chiseled features were set in a stern expression, his military bearing unmistakable. Two equally intimidating men flanked him.

The leader's piercing gaze locked onto hers. "I'm looking for Evelyn Carter."

His voice - deep and commanding - sent an involuntary shiver down Rosalind's spine. Without thinking, she stepped aside.

"She's inside."

Hearing that familiar voice, Evelyn's heart lurched violently. She shoved the rest of the apple slice into her mouth and scrambled to her feet, frantically looking for an escape route.

She barely made it two steps before the imposing figure filled the small living room doorway.

Trapped, Evelyn forced herself to meet his gaze, her cheeks bulging comically with half-chewed apple.

Liam's stern expression softened momentarily at the sight. Two days without her had felt like an eternity. His gaze flicked to the half-eaten meal on the table, and his chest tightened.

Rosalind hovered awkwardly, gesturing to the other men. "Would you all like to come in?" When they declined, she closed the door and turned to Liam.

"Excuse me, sir, but who exactly are you? And what business do you have with Evelyn?"

Liam's eyes never left his wife's face. "I'm her husband. Please give us some privacy."

Rosalind's mouth fell open. He was dismissing her from her own apartment?

She opened her mouth to protest, but something in his demeanor made her reconsider. Muttering under her breath, she grabbed her tea and retreated to the bedroom, slamming the door behind her.

Left alone, Evelyn finally swallowed the apple, her hands trembling at her sides. She couldn't bring herself to look at him, staring instead at a spot on the floor between them.
###Chapter 183

"Let's have this conversation." Liam's voice was tender, his eyes filled with a warmth that made Evelyn's heart ache.

She kept her gaze lowered. "My attorney has already made everything clear to you. There's nothing left to discuss between us," she replied stiffly.

His fingers curled into tight fists as his tone grew more insistent. "You gave me your word," he reminded her. "You promised never to threaten divorce again."

Evelyn finally lifted her tear-filled eyes to meet his. "And you swore you'd cut all ties with Victoria Dawson," she countered sharply.

"I haven't contacted her once since then," Liam declared firmly.

The words only made her fists clench harder. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks. Even without contact, his love for Victoria remained unchanged.

When she'd been drowning, Liam had been the only thought in her mind. Yet he'd chosen to save Victoria - who could swim - and left her to die.

The memory still cut like a knife.

"If not for Julian, I'd be your dead wife now," she choked out.

Panic flashed across Liam's face. "Without Julian, I would have saved you both."

Evelyn forced a bitter smile through her tears. "How thoughtful. Though Victoria knows how to swim. Were you truly so worried she'd drown?"

He stepped closer, his expression pained. "She used to have aquaphobia. I didn't know she'd overcome it and learned swimming."

Evelyn retreated, her voice shaking with anger. "Don't come any closer. Stay away from me."

"Please, Evelyn. Just let me explain." His voice held a note of desperation.

What good would explanations do? Nothing could change the past. Time and again, Victoria had come between them, leaving Evelyn broken.

It didn't matter anymore. She refused to force what couldn't be.

Besides, she wasn't truly Evelyn Carter. Even if they continued this marriage, it would all be void once her real identity came to light.

"I don't want a messy court battle, Liam. Let's settle this amicably." Her voice broke as she met his gaze with tear-filled eyes.

Liam's chest constricted painfully. Seeing her determination, his eyes reddened as he growled, "I won't agree to this divorce."

The words sent a fresh wave of pain through her. Clenching her fists, she warned, "Don't push me, Liam Blackwood. We're married on paper, but this was never a real marriage."

"Then let's make it real. Whenever you're ready, I'll be here," he vowed.

Evelyn bowed her head as tears splashed onto the floor. Her entire body trembled with suppressed emotion.

"I don't want to," she whispered hoarsely, repeating like a mantra, "I don't want to. I don't want this."

Sobs wracked her body as she struggled to contain her anguish. It felt like her heart was being torn in two.

Liam had loved Victoria for over twenty years. Having that woman constantly between them would drive her mad.

If only she didn't love him so deeply. As Rosalind had said - marriage didn't require love, just companionship and mutual respect.

But Evelyn couldn't bear it. Her love for Liam couldn't tolerate another woman in his life.

Liam closed the distance between them, pulling her into a crushing embrace. He drew a shuddering breath, the pain in his chest so acute it stole his words. There were no explanations that could mend this.
###Chapter 184

Evelyn's body went rigid. She shoved against Liam's chest with all her strength.

His arms only tightened around her in response. He buried his face in her silken hair, inhaling her delicate floral scent.

"Don't leave me, Evie," he whispered hoarsely, his voice cracking with emotion. "Please reconsider the divorce."

Tears burned behind Evelyn's eyelids as she shook her head against his shoulder.

Liam squeezed his eyes shut, the red veins stark against his pale skin. His entire world was crumbling.

First Victoria's betrayal. Now Evelyn walking away. The pain was unbearable.

He'd survived gunshot wounds and knife fights, but nothing compared to this soul-crushing agony.

Love wasn't worth this torment. Never again.

Drawing a shuddering breath, Liam forced himself to speak calmly. "In these six months together... did you ever care for me at all?"

She had loved him desperately. But each heartbreak had left deeper scars than the last.

How could she keep loving a man whose heart belonged to another? Victoria still owned every piece of him.

Evelyn straightened her spine. "Never," she lied coldly.

The words stabbed through Liam's chest like a white-hot blade. The pain stole his breath.

He released her abruptly, stepping back. His voice was eerily calm despite his bloodshot eyes. "Is this truly what you want?"

"My decision is final." She couldn't meet his gaze.

Liam's hands clenched into fists. "Where are the papers?"

Evelyn turned mechanically toward the bedroom. She returned with the divorce documents and a pen, placing them on the coffee table.

Love wasn't everything. He'd survived losing Victoria - this would pass too.

His signature slashed across the page without hesitation. The pen clattered onto the table as he turned away.

Evelyn stood frozen. All her mental preparation shattered the moment the papers were signed.

The pain was a thousand times worse than she'd imagined. Silent tears streamed down her face, her body trembling.

Rosalind entered and immediately understood. She wrapped Evelyn in a warm embrace. "Let it out, darling."

Evelyn leaned limply against her friend. The tears kept falling, but no sobs came.

Sometimes heartbreak left you too hollow to even cry properly. Just an empty shell where your heart used to be.
###Chapter 185

Liam Blackwood stormed out of the cramped apartment, his face dark as thunder. An icy aura radiated from him as he brushed past Ryan Sullivan and Adrian Castillo.

The two men had never witnessed their commander in such a state before. The chill in his wake was so intense they feared their blood might freeze mid-stride. They barely dared to breathe as they trailed behind him.

Silently, they followed him down the stairs and into the waiting car. The engine roared to life as they pulled away from the curb.

In the backseat, Liam's expression grew more frigid with each passing mile. He leaned his head against the leather seat, eyes shut tight, his jaw clenched in silent fury.

The atmosphere inside the vehicle became so oppressive it felt like the oxygen was being sucked out.

Then a phone rang, shattering the tense silence.

Ryan fumbled with the device like it was a live grenade. He answered in hushed tones, terrified of disturbing the storm brewing in the backseat.

After a brief conversation, he hung up and turned hesitantly toward Liam.

"General Blackwood," he ventured cautiously, "the investigation into Ms. Dawson is complete. Would you like the report now?"

"Proceed," Liam replied, his voice like tempered steel.

"Solterra doesn't recognize dual citizenship, sir. The identity 'Victoria Dawson' doesn't officially exist in Aldenria's records."

Liam's eyes snapped open. Though his gaze appeared dull, his voice carried dangerous weight. "She changed nationalities?"

Ryan nodded. "Correct. She's not Aldenrian, and her legal name in Solterra is Cassandra Wright."

The temperature in the car seemed to drop another ten degrees. "Continue," Liam commanded.

Ryan swallowed hard before delivering the full report.

"Cassandra Wright was admitted to Solterra's most prestigious academy at fourteen. However, she never lived on campus and was rarely seen there. Few classmates remember her presence."

"Yet she consistently ranked first in every subject. Won numerous academic awards. Published five research papers during her university years - all in top-tier international journals."

"She graduated summa cum laude but missed the ceremony due to work commitments. Became something of a legend at the institution."

"At eighteen, she was assigned to a classified research facility. Her work was so sensitive she only got sixty days of leave per year."

"Her parents and uncle were kept in the dark about her exact position and location. Visits were strictly limited to her off days. No contact permitted outside those windows."

Ryan hesitated before continuing. "Three years ago, about a month before her return to Aldenria, security footage shows the family making regular video calls to her grandparents together."

"Then her parents died suddenly. We only found death certificates and empty graves. No cremation records exist."

"After that, Archibald Wright brought her back to Aldenria. She's been living here as Victoria Dawson ever since, but never held any official employment."

Liam's brow furrowed as he processed this information.

A changed nationality? Victoria Dawson didn't truly exist?

The puzzle was becoming more complex by the minute. After a long silence, Liam spoke again, his voice grave. "Can we obtain those video call recordings?"

Ryan shook his head. "Our tech team already hacked into Archibald Wright's devices, General. There are no backups or recordings of those calls."

Another heavy silence filled the car.

Adrian, gripping the steering wheel tightly, finally voiced what they were all thinking. "General... do you suspect the woman we know as Victoria Dawson isn't who she claims to be?"
###Chapter 186

Liam remained silent in response to Adrian's question. His fingers tapped rhythmically against the car window before he finally spoke. "Dig deeper into her parents' supposed death."

His voice dropped an octave. "Without cremation records, there's a chance they're still breathing."

"Should we continue investigating Ms. Wright as well?" Ryan inquired.

"Keep all lines of inquiry open," Liam commanded.

"Understood, sir!" Ryan responded with military precision.

Liam's piercing gaze shifted. "Where's that research paper she published?"

Ryan swiftly retrieved his phone, pulling up the document with practiced efficiency before handing it over.

The screen illuminated Liam's sharp features as he scanned the complex text. His brows furrowed in deepening confusion.

"Core Analysis and Research on Derivative Nanotechnology of Copper, Iron, Steel and Cyanide in Redox Reactions."

The technical jargon continued with "Synthesis of Molecular Metal Re-Separation and Its Chemical Applications."

As he scrolled further, the formulas and diagrams might as well have been hieroglyphics. Though the content escaped his comprehension, the sophisticated chemical equations spoke volumes.

Resting his temple against two fingers, Liam massaged his forehead. "Obtain DNA samples from Evelyn and old Mr. Wright. Discreetly."

Ryan and Adrian exchanged knowing glances. They'd served under Blackwood long enough to recognize where this was heading.

"Consider it done," they chorused.

Dawn's light had barely touched the windows when Evelyn was jolted awake by her screaming phone. The sleepless night had finally granted her a few precious hours of rest just before morning.

She fumbled for the device, pressing it against her ear with sleep-heavy limbs. Eleanor Blackwood's clipped, irritated tone sliced through the haze.

"Just what fresh hell has your brother dragged us into now, Evelyn?"

Evelyn shot upright, adrenaline burning away the grogginess. "What happened, Eleanor?"

"A pack of thugs showed up at the manor at sunrise claiming your brother owes them a small fortune." Eleanor's voice crackled with barely contained fury. "They said you guaranteed his debts. Made quite the spectacle demanding payment."

Rage bleached Evelyn's complexion. She threw off the covers in one violent motion.

Frantically yanking open drawers for clothes, she spat, "No one in this family would vouch for him. Call the authorities if they return. I'm on my way."

Eleanor's sigh carried through the line. "Don't bother. It's handled."

Evelyn froze mid-motion. "Handled?"

"Paid off his debts and sent them packing." The words dripped with disgust.

What mother-in-law would tolerate such disgrace?

Evelyn's stomach twisted with understanding. She collapsed onto the bed's edge, head bowed under the weight of shame.

"I'll repay every cent, Eleanor. Immediately."

Another sigh. "Keep your money. We're family, however briefly." The unspoken 'until the divorce' hung between them. "Just ensure this never happens again."

"Tell your brother to grow up. His recklessness shouldn't tarnish the Blackwood name."

Each word drove the knife deeper. Evelyn's nails bit into her palms as fury warred with humiliation. The apologies poured out automatically.

The signed divorce papers made them temporary family at best.

She kept apologizing.

When the call ended, her fingers flew to dial Dominic Carter.

He answered on the second ring, voice dripping with false cheer. "To what do I owe this rare pleasure, sister dear?"

Evelyn's breath came in sharp bursts as she wrestled her temper under control. "How dare you send your loan sharks to harass the Blackwoods? Have you completely lost your moral compass?"
###Chapter 187

Dominic's voice dripped with icy sarcasm through the phone. "What was I supposed to do? You refused to help me, and those loan sharks were breathing down my neck."

His tone turned mocking. "So I told them my precious sister married into the Blackwood fortune. A few crumbs from their table would be enough to cover my debts."

A dark chuckle followed. "Worked like a charm! Your in-laws are incredibly generous. They paid off half my debt without blinking."

"Your husband's reputation is even better. Just dropping that my brother-in-law is General Blackwood of the Aldenrian Military - and that you'd vouch for me - suddenly everyone was tripping over themselves to lend me money."

Dominic's voice vibrated with glee. "That name opens every door! Nobody dares cross me now. One mention of my powerful brother-in-law and they all back down."

Evelyn's knuckles turned white around the phone. Rage made her entire body tremble.

Her voice came out like shards of ice. "Dominic Carter, you despicable leech. If I hear you're using Liam's name to scam people again, I swear to God-"

Dominic's mocking laughter cut her off. "Oh please, Evelyn. Dad's been bragging to his drinking buddies about his son-in-law being General Blackwood for months. The old man loves rubbing it in their faces."

He continued with relish, "But Mom? She's the real pro. Called your husband last week and walked away with a hundred grand. Now that's what I call generous."

Evelyn could practically hear him preening through the phone. Her vision blurred with furious tears.

These people were human parasites, clinging to anyone successful. Impossible to shake off. Disgusting.

"We're divorced," Evelyn ground out. "Stop harassing him and stay away from the Blackwood family."

Dominic snorted. "Nice try. Like you'd give up that golden ticket? You'd have to be insane to walk away from that kind of money."

"Listen, I'll be reasonable. No more gambling debts. Just get your husband to pull some strings - I want a cushy military office job where-"

Evelyn slammed the phone down. She squeezed her eyes shut, struggling to breathe through the suffocating anger.

Her head throbbed. Every muscle ached with tension.

Why? Why was she cursed with this family? Being related to them felt worse than death.

She threw her phone onto the bed and dragged herself to the shower, needing to wash off the filth of that conversation.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn emerged from her room.

Rosalind sat cross-legged by the coffee table, glasses perched on her nose as she typed furiously on her laptop.

"Morning," Evelyn muttered, collapsing onto the couch like a puppet with cut strings.

Rosalind barely glanced up from her screen, fingers flying across the keyboard. "You look like hell. Bad night?"

Evelyn let her head fall back against the cushions. "Couldn't sleep until dawn. Then got woken up by human garbage."

"Who?"

"The Carters. My so-called family."

Rosalind smirked without looking up. "You mean your parents and brother?"

"They're not my family," Evelyn said coldly.

Rosalind's fingers stilled. "Right. The adoption. Let me tell you, having grown up with Evelyn Carter - her father is absolute scum. You should watch yourself."

Evelyn's eyes opened. "Why?"

Rosalind set aside her laptop and removed her glasses. Her expression turned grim, eyes dark with disgust. "He molested her when she was twelve."

Evelyn froze. A wave of nausea crashed over her.
###Chapter 188

A storm of emotions crashed over Evelyn Carter. Fury and heartache twisted inside her chest like twin vipers. She knew better than anyone—

No girl spiraled into darkness without reason.

Every fall from grace had its origin story.

"Why didn't you report him?" Her jaw clenched so tight her teeth ached. The image of that monster in shreds flashed behind her eyelids.

Rosalind Fairchild gave a hollow laugh, fingers pausing over her keyboard. "Her mother was a ghost. Couldn't shield her kids from a summer breeze, let alone predators. Gambling dens were her only talent."

She adjusted her glasses, resuming her frantic typing. "You're different. Charismatic. Resilient. With a billionaire husband wrapped around your finger?" A sardonic smirk. "Blood ties or not, they'll suck you dry like leeches."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She pressed her palms against her closed eyelids until stars exploded in the darkness.

The past was a minefield. Now the Blackwoods were stumbling into it blind. Revealing her truth now? Impossible. The weight of it threatened to crack her ribs.

Rosalind's keyboard clattered like gunfire. "What are you writing?" Evelyn finally asked.

"Ghostwriting gig. Trashy romance novel." Rosalind snorted. "Plot's thinner than tissue paper, but the paycheck clears by midnight."

Evelyn's throat tightened. "You don't have to—"

"You borrowed that money from someone too, didn't you?" Rosalind's gaze never left the screen. "Debts don't pay themselves."

Silence stretched. Evelyn curled onto the couch, resting her head against Rosalind's shoulder. The glow of the laptop painted them both blue.

"Get me a job?" The request slipped out softer than intended.

Rosalind's fingers stilled. "Skills?"

"Eight languages. Piano. Basic chemistry." Evelyn counted off on her fingers. "I paint, but only for charity. That was... important to me. Before."

The keyboard went silent. Rosalind swiveled slowly, eyes wide. "Either you're delusional or a walking Renaissance fair."

Evelyn's laugh tasted bitter.

"Fluency or tourist phrases?"

"Dreamt in Mandarin last week."

Rosalind whistled. "Corporate translations. Publishing houses pay fortunes for that." She nudged Evelyn's knee. "We're hitting job boards tomorrow."

———

The call came as Evelyn booted up her laptop. Liam Blackwood's private number glared from the screen like a warning.

Her pulse thundered in her ears as she answered.

"Two PM. City Hall." His voice was Arctic ice. "Bring the divorce papers."

The line died before she could exhale.

Evelyn sat frozen on the bed, phone digging into her palm. The pain came in waves—sharp, then dull, then sharp again. No tears. Just a vise around her lungs stealing every breath.

The clock ticked louder.

Each second a hammer to the ribs.
###Chapter 189

The clock struck noon when Rosalind burst into Evelyn's dressing room, clutching a slinky black dress. "Wear this," she commanded, thrusting the garment forward.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated over the silky fabric. "This is a divorce, not a wedding. Why would I need to dress up?" Her laugh sounded hollow even to her own ears.

Rosalind's expression turned deadly serious. "Precisely why you should look absolutely breathtaking." She spun the dress to showcase its plunging neckline. "Let's make that stone-faced general regret losing you."

"But I'm the one filing for divorce," Evelyn protested weakly. "I don't want anything from him anymore."

Rosalind arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "You only filed because he broke your heart, didn't you?"

The words struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's breath hitched as fresh pain lanced through her chest.

"Men are simple creatures," Rosalind continued, smoothing the dress against Evelyn's frame. "You always dress like you're attending a funeral. Today, let's make his jaw drop so hard it cracks the marble floors at City Hall."

Despite herself, Evelyn chuckled at the mental image. The dress was scandalously short, nothing like her usual modest wardrobe. Yet she couldn't refuse Rosalind's determined kindness.

By two o'clock, Evelyn stood transformed. The dress hugged every curve, her legs appearing endless beneath the short hem. Rosalind had worked magic with her makeup - smoky eyes, flushed cheeks, lips painted the color of crushed roses.

Outside City Hall, Liam leaned against his black Bentley, shoulders slumped beneath an invisible weight. The midday sun beat down mercilessly, yet an arctic chill seemed to radiate from him.

The click of stilettos on pavement made him glance up. His breath caught.

Evelyn stood before him, sunlight glinting off her golden highlights. The dress revealed miles of creamy skin, the neckline dipping dangerously low. She looked like a fallen angel - devastatingly beautiful and utterly untouchable.

For the first time in their six-month marriage, Liam saw his wife truly shine. And it was for their divorce.

"You're..." His voice failed him. Clearing his throat, he checked his watch. "Right on time."

Evelyn's pulse fluttered under his intense scrutiny. "Shall we?" she asked, fighting to keep her voice steady.

Liam straightened, his gaze darkening as it swept over her. "You have all the documents?"

She nodded, clutching her purse like a lifeline. The disappointment tasted bitter - all this effort, and he barely reacted. To him, she might as well have worn sackcloth.

They'd barely taken three steps toward the building when Liam's phone rang. The conversation lasted mere seconds, but his entire demeanor shifted.

"I need to handle an emergency," he said abruptly, turning back to her. "Can you wait two hours?"

Evelyn blinked at the bustling plaza. "Here? For two hours?"

His jaw tightened. "Or we reschedule."

"No." Her voice came out sharper than intended. "Today. I'll wait."

As Liam strode away, Evelyn squared her shoulders. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing her break. Not today. Not ever again.
###Chapter 190

"Your choice." Liam's gaze darkened imperceptibly as he brushed past her and strode toward the driver's seat. He yanked the door open and slid inside.

A surge of irritation hit him the moment he caught sight of Evelyn's dress from behind.

From the front, it looked modest—elegant even. But the back? A daring plunge, exposing the smooth expanse of her pale skin beneath the cascade of her hair.

Completely inappropriate.

Liam turned on his heel and seized her wrist, steering her toward the passenger side.

"What are you doing?"

"Wait in the car." He nudged her into the seat and slammed the door shut.

Then, he circled the hood and dropped into the driver's seat.

"Seatbelt."

Evelyn reached for the door handle. "Go handle your business. I'll find a café to wait in. Just text me when you're done."

Liam leaned over, his fingers brushing against her waist as he buckled her in.

The sudden closeness startled her. She pressed herself against the seat, putting as much distance between them as possible. Her breath hitched, lashes fluttering nervously.

The faint scent of her perfume coiled around him, tugging at something deep in his chest. He forced his expression to remain neutral, ignoring the rapid thud of his pulse, and focused on the road.

Thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop outside the hospital. Liam unbuckled his belt and told her to stay put.

"Who's in the hospital?" she asked, concern lacing her voice.

"Adrian. He's injured."

Evelyn immediately undid her seatbelt. "How bad is it? I want to see him."

"It's fine. Stay here. I'll update you if anything changes." His tone was gentle but firm.

Since he clearly didn’t want her inside, she didn’t push further.

After he disappeared into the building, she waited in the passenger seat for what felt like hours. The sun blazed through the windshield, the heat oppressive despite the AC.

Eventually, she climbed out and moved to the backseat instead.

Bored, she stretched out across the leather and closed her eyes. Without realizing it, she drifted into a deep sleep—one that lasted from mid-afternoon well into the night.

Evelyn woke groggily, disoriented by the sensation of movement. Rubbing her eyes, she sat up.

In the driver's seat, Ryan was focused on the road when a shadowy figure suddenly appeared in the rearview mirror. Wild, tangled hair framed a pale face, and he nearly screamed, slamming on the brakes.

His shout startled Evelyn just as much. She scrambled into the corner, clutching her chest. "Who are you?"

Recognition dawned on him. He exhaled sharply, composing himself. "Mrs. Blackwood?"

She peered at him, blinking. "Ryan?"

Understanding flashed across his face. "You were asleep in the back? I thought you'd left."

"What?"

"General Blackwood instructed me to take you home before heading to the military base," he explained. "When I didn’t see you at the hospital, I assumed you'd gone on your own."

Only then did she notice the darkness outside. Leaning against the window, she took in the dense forest whipping past. "Where are we?"

"The border. We're returning to the Aldenrian Military Base," he answered respectfully.

Her stomach dropped.

Where’s Liam? Weren’t we getting divorced? How did I end up at the border?

Evelyn was speechless.

Ryan shifted uncomfortably. "My apologies, Mrs. Blackwood. This is my mistake. I’ll arrange a flight back to Phoenicia for you first thing tomorrow."
###Chapter 191

Evelyn lowered her gaze with a tired sigh. "It's fine. I don't have any pressing work anyway. Might as well treat this as an unplanned vacation and return in a few days."

Ryan glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Why don't you rest a while longer, Mrs. Blackwood? We'll arrive at the base in about an hour."

Suddenly remembering Adrian's condition, she sat up straighter. "How's Adrian? Are his injuries life-threatening?"

Ryan's expression darkened instantly. "Quite severe, but he's stable now. General Blackwood is personally overseeing his care at the military hospital."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She hadn't expected Liam to show such concern for a subordinate. "What exactly happened?"

The car hit a bump as Ryan gathered his thoughts. "We lost a shipment of advanced weaponry during transport to the base. Adrian was leading the investigation."

He tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Three days ago, he traced the weapons to drug cartel operatives in Valtoria. Went undercover posing as a buyer with another operative."

Ryan's voice cracked. "Their cover got blown. The other soldier... he sacrificed himself to get Adrian out alive."

Evelyn's nails dug into her seat. "Why not just raid their entire operation? Those monsters deserve worse than death, weapons or not."

"Politics," Ryan spat bitterly. "If this happened in Aldenria, we could've leveled their compound. But on foreign soil? We need irrefutable evidence before acting."

The reality of the situation settled heavily on Evelyn's shoulders. She felt useless, unable to help despite her rising anger.

They arrived at Aldenria Military Base well past midnight. Ryan escorted her to Liam's private quarters - protocol for military spouses.

At 4 AM, the compound stood eerily silent. Dim security lights cast long shadows across empty walkways. Only the occasional cricket chirp interrupted the stillness.

The door creaked open then clicked shut behind her. Moonlight filtered through the blinds, painting silver stripes across the dark bedroom.

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed onto the large bed without bothering to change. Sleep claimed her instantly.

The mattress dipped suddenly. A muscular figure slumped onto the bed, hands cradling his forehead. The weight of the world seemed to press down on his broad shoulders.

Then he fell backward - directly onto a soft, warm body.

"Oof!" A feminine gasp pierced the silence.

Liam sprang up like electrocuted. His sharp eyes locked onto the unexpected occupant in his bed.

Evelyn clutched her stomach where his elbow had landed. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she squinted at the silhouette looming over her.

Moonlight revealed enough for mutual recognition.

Both froze.

Why was Liam here? Hadn't Ryan said he was in Aldenria with Adrian?

Her pulse raced as she struggled for words.

Liam broke the tense silence first. "What are you doing here? Did I hurt you?"

"No," she whispered, pulling the blanket higher. "I fell asleep during the drive. Ryan must have assumed you'd want me brought directly here."

A relieved smirk tugged at Liam's lips. "Since you're already here, you might as well stay a few days. I'll be too busy with this weapons situation to finalize our divorce paperwork anyway."
###Chapter 192

Evelyn's chest tightened with sympathy. He must have been swamped with urgent matters to return at such an ungodly hour.

"It's fine," she murmured, scooting to the far side of the bed. "Your responsibilities come first. I can take care of myself." The first hints of dawn colored the curtains. "Get some rest while you can."

Liam feared she might recoil from his travel-worn state and moved to stand. "I should shower first."

Her fingers encircled his wrist. "You're fine. That can wait till morning." She tugged him downward with surprising strength. "Sleep now."

When he settled beside her, she draped the blanket over his shoulders with unexpected tenderness. The sudden shift in her behavior left him disoriented.

Just weeks ago, she'd been erecting walls between them - cold shoulders, clipped responses, divorce papers always within reach. Now this gentle concern for his wellbeing?

Women truly were incomprehensible creatures. The mystery of her transformation kept him awake despite his exhaustion.

Liam rolled onto his side, studying her moonlit profile. The rhythmic rise and fall of her chest. The delicate floral scent clinging to her skin that somehow soothed his frayed nerves better than any sleeping pill.

Morning arrived too soon. Three hours of fitful sleep left Liam groaning as consciousness returned.

Then he discovered the reason for his discomfort.

Evelyn had migrated across the bed during the night, her warm curves now pressed insistently against him. The thin fabric of her sleep shorts did nothing to disguise the smooth skin of her thigh where it rested perilously close to...

Heat flooded his veins. His breath hitched as he fought against his body's immediate response.

"Evie," he growled, voice thick with sleep and something darker. Gently, he attempted to relocate her limb.

She murmured incoherently and reclaimed her territory with sleepy determination, the pressure against his growing arousal bordering on painful.

A sharp inhale. Clenched jaw. Then in one fluid motion, he flipped their positions, caging her beneath him.

Evelyn blinked awake to find Liam's stormy gaze burning into hers. The intensity there stole her breath, made her pulse thunder in her ears.

Her mouth went dry. Words evaporated. All she could do was stare up at him with wide, questioning eyes.

What was happening?

Why had he pinned her down?

That hard line pressing against her thigh answered the question before she could voice it.

"N-Nathan?" The name came out strangled. "What are you—"

"Your sleeping habits," he ground out, muscles trembling with restraint. "You were... everywhere. Couldn't move without you following."

Mortification heated her cheeks. "I didn't realize! I'm so sorry, I—"

With a frustrated groan, Liam pushed off the bed. He raked both hands through his hair before stalking toward the bathroom like a man pursued.

Evelyn lay frozen, staring at the canopy above as the shower turned on. A whirlwind of thoughts churned in her mind.

Physical reactions didn't equate to emotional connection, right?

Yet the hunger in his eyes... The way his body had responded to her proximity... It felt like more than simple biology.

Did he secretly enjoy her touch despite his obvious discomfort? The thought sent an unexpected thrill through her as water pounded against tile in the next room.
###Chapter 193

The bathroom door creaked open after thirty minutes.

Evelyn sat perched on the edge of the bed, her gaze lifting.

Liam emerged with damp hair, dressed in a crisp white shirt and tailored trousers. The fresh scent of soap clung to him.

His warm eyes met hers, making her cheeks flush. She hastily grabbed the clothes beside her and stood.

As she brushed past him, his hand caught her wrist.

Evelyn froze.

Liam's brow furrowed as he studied the white sundress in her hands - yesterday's outfit she'd washed and dried overnight. Currently, she wore his oversized sleepwear.

"Don't you have anything else to wear?" His voice was rough.

She glanced at the dress. "It's clean and dry now. This will do."

"Change. Into. Something. Else."

"Why?"

He released her arm, struggling for words as his jaw tightened.

Seeing his darkened expression, Evelyn guessed, "Embarrassed to be seen with me dressed like this?"

Liam's eyes flashed with frustration. "That's not what I—"

The military base housed many women - soldiers' wives who wore far more revealing outfits during visits.

Why couldn't she?

Anger flared as she threw the dress onto the bed. "Happy now? I won't wear it."

"I'll have clothes delivered," he said softly.

She knotted the hem of his shirt, transforming it into a cropped top. Snatching her phone, she turned toward the door.

He intercepted her in two strides, gripping her elbow. "Where are you going?"

"Morning jog. Breakfast. Sightseeing." She jerked her arm free. "Anywhere but here with you."

Her words cut deep, leaving them both wounded.

Pain flashed across his face before his expression shuttered. His hand fell away.

Evelyn didn't look back as she stormed out. She wandered beyond the base perimeter until reaching a vibrant marketplace.

Stalls overflowed with colorful wares as merchants called to passersby. The lively atmosphere lifted her spirits slightly.

She snapped photos absently as she browsed.

At a boutique, she purchased a flowing bohemian dress with intricate embroidery and changed in their fitting room.

By midday, her camera roll filled with images of local artisans at work. She'd collected several handmade souvenirs.

Then a jewelry stall caught her eye.

"Try anything you like!" The vendor beamed as she paused before a display of costume rings.

Her fingers hovered over a faux diamond solitaire. Sliding it onto her ring finger, she held it up to sunlight.

The stone glittered despite its humble quality, stirring bittersweet emotions.

"These come in pairs - his and hers. Only 20 dollars!" The vendor gestured to matching bands.

Evelyn's smile turned wistful as she removed the ring. "Not today, thank you."

"15 dollars - my final offer!"

She shook her head politely before walking away, the phantom weight of the ring lingering on her finger.
###Chapter 194

Evelyn shook her head and turned to leave.

"Fine, I'll drop it to 8 dollars!" the vendor shouted after her. "That's below cost price! Surely you can spare 8 dollars?"

Her fingers absently traced the pale band on her ring finger where her wedding band used to sit. Hot tears pricked at her eyes as she quickened her pace through the crowded marketplace.

It wasn't about the money. She could technically afford it. But buying herself a replacement ring felt like admitting her marriage was nothing but a hollow sham.

The marketplace faded behind her as she reached the roadside where bicycle taxis clustered. Their drivers called out offers, but Evelyn kept her distance, choosing to wait for the public bus instead.

Standing alone, her striking features drew appreciative glances from passersby. Then a black SUV screeched to a halt nearby.

The tinted window rolled down to reveal two leering men. "Need a ride, sweetheart?" the driver asked, his gaze crawling over her body.

"No thank you," Evelyn replied politely but firmly.

"Come on, we'll take you anywhere," the passenger insisted, licking his lips.

Alarm bells rang in Evelyn's mind. She turned sharply toward the safety of the crowded market.

Car doors slammed. Heavy footsteps pounded behind her.

"Help!" Evelyn screamed as rough hands grabbed her arms.

A bicycle taxi driver moved to intervene, but froze when one attacker brandished a switchblade.

Evelyn fought desperately as they dragged her toward the SUV. In this supposedly civilized society, she never imagined being abducted in broad daylight.

Inside the vehicle, they wrestled her phone away and pinned her down. As the car bounced along a forest trail, Evelyn forced herself to stop struggling. She needed to conserve energy for the right moment.

After what felt like hours of jolting along backroads, they merged onto a highway.

Evelyn's blood ran cold when she spotted the sign: "Valtoria Border Crossing 5km."

Valtoria? The lawless narcostate neighboring Aldenria? No wonder these men operated with such brazenness.

The SUV turned onto a concealed dirt road leading to a fortified compound. Through the window, Evelyn saw armed guards patrolling between poppy fields behind high electrified fences.

They stopped before a rustic lodge where four men lounged in an open pavilion. The sight of drug paraphernalia scattered across their table made Evelyn's mouth go dry.

"Boss!" her captor announced proudly. "Found this pretty thing near the market. Thought you might enjoy her."

They shoved Evelyn forward. Her pulse hammered as she took in the terrifying scene.

At the center sat a bald, neck-tattooed brute flanked by three equally dangerous-looking men. Their predatory gazes made her skin crawl.

The bald man's lips curled into a grotesque smile as he examined her. "You've outdone yourself this time," he told his subordinate, licking cracked lips. "Where did you find such exquisite merchandise?"
###Chapter 195

"Aldenria."

"Holy hell, she's gorgeous." The tattooed man licked his lips as he rose from his chair, already reaching for Evelyn.

Before his fingers could graze her arm, an iron grip clamped down on his shoulder.

"Back off, Donovan. This one's mine."

Evelyn's breath hitched when she saw the speaker.

The man had striking aristocratic features - high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and piercing blue eyes that reminded her painfully of Liam Blackwood. His military-style leather jacket hugged broad shoulders.

"I thought you'd sworn off women, Alexander?" Donovan's laughter boomed through the warehouse. "What changed your mind?"

Alexander's lips curled into a smirk. "Maybe I just found someone worth breaking my rules for."

Donovan's grin turned predatory as he eyed Evelyn. "Fine. But I get her when you're done. A beauty like this shouldn't go to waste."

In one fluid motion, Alexander stood and blocked Donovan's path. "I'm calling first dibs. Consider it repayment for that shipment I let slide last month."

The other men hooted with laughter at the rare display of desire from the usually indifferent Alexander Blackwood.

Donovan finally shrugged and waved them toward a side room. "Don't take too long. I want my turn."

Alexander grabbed a cigarette from the table before seizing Evelyn's wrist. He dragged her into the storage room, slamming the door behind them.

Evelyn's knees trembled. Tears blurred her vision as she desperately scanned the windowless concrete walls for any escape route. In this heavily guarded compound, hope seemed futile.

Alexander locked the door and shoved her onto the cot. She scrambled up immediately, clasping her hands in supplication. "Please," she begged, voice breaking. "I have money. I can pay you—"

He lit his cigarette with deliberate slowness, the flame illuminating his sharp profile. "Start screaming."

"What?"

Exhaling smoke, he clarified, "Moan. Cry. Struggle. Make it convincing."

Understanding dawned, bringing a flush to Evelyn's cheeks. Her pulse pounded as she realized his intent. "I-I don't know how to—"

Alexander crushed his cigarette underfoot and closed the distance between them in two strides. "Never been with a man before?" His mocking tone sent heat rushing to her face.

Before she could respond, he yanked her against his chest, burying his face in her neck. His sudden movement startled a genuine shriek from her lips.

"No! Stop!" She thrashed in his hold.

Alexander's lips brushed her ear, his whisper barely audible. "Keep going. Louder."

Trembling, Evelyn obeyed, letting out choked sobs between pleas for mercy.

"Where are you from?" he murmured against her skin.

"My husband—he's with the Aldenrian Special Forces. I was shopping when they grabbed me."

Alexander snorted. "Of all the women in Phoenicia, they had to kidnap a soldier's wife." His grip tightened briefly. "Talk about shit luck."

Evelyn stilled, studying his face through her tears. "Do you...know me?"

Rolling onto his side, Alexander propped his head on one hand, his gaze sweeping over her with unsettling intensity. "Little Miss Wright, isn't it?"
###Chapter 196

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Blackwood Manor. Evelyn Carter stood by the window, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns of frost on the glass. The cold mirrored the turmoil in her heart.

Liam Blackwood entered the study, his military boots clicking against the hardwood floor. His stormy gray eyes locked onto Evelyn's slender frame. "We need to talk," he said, his voice rough with barely contained emotion.

Evelyn turned slowly, her artist's fingers still pressed against the chilled glass. "About what, Commander Blackwood?" Her tone was deliberately light, but her knuckles had turned white.

Liam crossed the room in three strides. He pulled a folded photograph from his breast pocket and slapped it onto the mahogany desk. "Explain this."

The image showed a younger Evelyn - no, Wanda Wright - standing beside Julian Whitmore in a laboratory. Test tubes filled with glowing blue liquid surrounded them. The date stamp read three days before the infamous Aldenria chemical attack.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Where did you get this?"

"Does it matter?" Liam's jaw tightened. "You swore you had no memory of your past. Yet here you are, working with the man responsible for thousands of deaths."

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly in the tense silence. Evelyn reached for the photograph, but Liam snatched it away. "I remember now," she whispered. "But not what you think."

Outside, a car door slammed. Victoria Dawson's shrill voice carried through the open window. "Liam! Darling, I brought your favorite from the patisserie!"

Liam didn't take his eyes off Evelyn. "This isn't over," he growled before striding toward the door.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. The truth was more complicated than Liam could imagine. She had been working against Julian, not with him. But proving it would require revealing secrets more dangerous than her forgotten past.

The front door burst open. Victoria's laughter echoed through the manor, a sharp contrast to the storm brewing between Evelyn and Liam. Somewhere in the house, a phone began to ring insistently.

Evelyn glanced at the antique clock. Ryan Sullivan would be calling with updates on their investigation. Time was running out - for her, for Liam, and for the fragile peace between Aldenria and Valtoria.

The photograph still lay on the desk, a silent accusation. Evelyn reached for it again, her hand trembling. This single image could destroy everything. Or, if handled correctly, it might be the key to stopping Julian Whitmore once and for all.

Evelyn was stunned.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Don't tell me you've forgotten me just because I've gotten more attractive?"

Her heart skipped a beat, and she shook her head.

He reached out and pinched her soft cheeks in one swift motion. "The name's Alexander."

She shook her head again.

The man sighed and sat up straight. Gently ruffling her hair, he murmured, "Don't be scared. As long as I'm here, nothing bad will happen to you."

"Do we... know each other?" she asked hesitantly.

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "First you forget my face, now you don't even remember my name? You're absolutely heartless."

She bolted upright. Tears blurred her vision. "I lost my memory three years ago. Do you know who I am? Please, tell me."

He studied her carefully. The genuine confusion and fear in her eyes convinced him she wasn't lying.

"Aren't you Wright? Cassandra Wright? Liam always called you 'Chubs'."

Evelyn gaped at him for a long moment before shaking her head. "I don't know who I am," she whispered. "But I'm not Cassandra Wright. She's currently in Aldenria." Alexander pinched her cheeks again.

"Ow! That hurts!" She slapped his hand away and scooted backward, glaring.

"You're not Chubs?"

Another head shake.

"Then you're her exact double. Same features, just slightly thinner."

"Many people say I resemble her younger self," Evelyn admitted with a sigh.

He pressed his lips together, staring intently. After a prolonged silence, he asked softly, "Did you marry Liam Blackwood?"

"Yes." She nodded.

"Then you're definitely Chubs," he declared, rising to light another cigarette. "That man would never marry anyone else."

Evelyn suddenly processed his name. "You're Alexander Blackwood?"

He didn't answer. His face darkened as he slowly lit his cigarette and took a deep drag. Exhaling smoke, he checked his watch.

"Keep making noise. We can't let the guards outside think I'm underperforming!"

She complied, though her moans sounded painfully stiff.

Alexander rolled his eyes. "Didn't Liam teach you anything after marriage? The man must be truly incompetent."

Evelyn's cheeks burned. Alexander had absolutely no filter. Lowering her voice, she asked, "Why are you here, Alexander? Can you get me out?"

"Can't extract you."

"Then what?" Panic edged her voice. "You can't possibly stay here indefinitely?"

"Already sent word. We'll wait an hour or two. See if Liam sends reinforcements."

Evelyn knew better. This wasn't Aldenria. Liam had no jurisdiction here. He couldn't possibly mobilize enough forces to storm the compound. Any insufficient attempt would be futile.

"This is Valtoria, not Aldenria, Alexander. Political constraints prevent Liam from rescuing us," she said nervously. "Isn't there another way?"

Alexander studied her intently. After a thoughtful pause, he asked, "I heard you got accepted into Solterra's prestigious institute, Chubs."

He continued, "Do you know chemistry? Could you isolate diacetylmorphine from an impure mixture?"

She hesitated, then nodded. "I have some chemistry knowledge. I could try."
###Chapter 197

Two hours later, Alexander pushed open the creaking door.

Two armed men stood waiting outside, their weapons glinting in the dim light.

"Not bad, Blackwood. The woman still conscious after all that time?" one sneered, nudging his companion.

Alexander's lips curved into a thin smile. "What do you want?"

"Donovan sent us. Wants to know if you're done with her. If so, we'll take her to his quarters."

A shadow crossed Alexander's face. He glanced back into the room before responding, "I'll bring her myself."

The men exchanged glances before shrugging. "Fine."

Alexander hesitated, then turned and disappeared back inside. Moments later, he emerged, dragging Evelyn by the arm.

Her hair was tangled, her clothes rumpled. She lifted her gaze toward the sky, her heart pounding with fear.

Would Alexander really help her escape? She could only pray Liam had received her message and was already searching for her.

Outside the wooden shack, Donovan's eyes gleamed as he watched Alexander haul Evelyn toward him. A smirk twisted his lips.

"How was she?" he asked, exhaling a cloud of smoke.

Alexander gave a casual shrug. "Pleasant enough. Thanks for the favor."

Donovan adjusted his belt with a grunt. "My turn now."

Evelyn's stomach twisted with revulsion.

Alexander's expression darkened. He hesitated before speaking. "There's something more valuable than just having her, Donovan."

"Oh?"

Alexander glanced at Evelyn, noting the way she trembled, her forehead slick with sweat.

He spun a lie on the spot. "Turns out she's a chemist from Solterra. She can fix that contaminated batch we've been stuck with."

Donovan's eyes widened. "Seriously?"

"Let her try," Alexander suggested smoothly.

Donovan didn't hesitate. Rubbing his bald head excitedly, he barked, "Take her to the lab."

Evelyn was marched into the warehouse.

The sheer scale of the drug operation left her speechless. Anger burned in her chest.

How many lives would this poison destroy?

In the makeshift lab, Donovan pointed to a bag of white powder. "Fix this."

Evelyn steadied herself. "I don't use drugs."

"Not asking you to. This batch is unstable—explodes on contact with water."

To demonstrate, he tossed a handful into a nearby cup. The liquid instantly erupted in violent bubbles before detonating with a sharp pop.

Everyone flinched back—except Evelyn.

Fascination overtook her fear. She stepped forward, scooping a pinch of powder between her fingers.

The substance grew warm against her skin, emitting faint wisps of smoke.

She'd never seen anything like it.

A thrill of scientific curiosity surged through her, momentarily eclipsing her terror.

She rubbed the powder harder, wincing as it burned her fingertips red.

Inhaling this would be lethal.

"How much is there?" she asked.

"Two tons," Donovan replied.

Disgust churned in her gut.

"Get me a microscope."

One was produced immediately.

Evelyn bent over the equipment, her focus absolute. The room watched in silence as she worked.

Someone murmured, "She knows what she's doing."

The game had changed.
###Chapter 198

Alexander Blackwood felt a knot of unease tighten in his stomach. He never expected Evelyn Carter to succeed where seasoned chemists with decades of experience had failed. All he could hope for now was that she could buy them more time.

"The contaminated mixture contains sodium and a compound resembling rubidium," she murmured, her fingers deftly adjusting the equipment. "But rubidium is volatile—exposure to air or water triggers an explosion."

She exhaled sharply, pushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "This is unlike anything I've encountered before. I need more time to analyze it."

The men around her exchanged skeptical glances, their distrust palpable. Some of their gazes lingered too long on her figure, making her skin crawl.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She needed to prove herself—fast.

Scooping a small portion of the powder, she sealed it in a vial, then added a stabilizing agent before heating it. Her movements were precise, almost clinical.

Then, she dropped the treated powder into water.

The men flinched, bracing for an explosion that never came.

Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief.

Donovan Sharpe let out a booming laugh, clapping his hands. "No wonder you're from Solterra! You fixed it in minutes!"

Evelyn shot Alexander a nervous glance. He gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head, his expression unreadable.

Swallowing hard, she forced a cautious tone. "I've neutralized the water reaction, but this substance is still lethally toxic. One breath could kill you."

The bald drug lord sauntered toward her, and she instinctively stepped back. He smirked, patting her cheek with rough fingers. "Pretty thing, if you can purify all two tons of this, I'll not only let you go—I'll pay you handsomely. Or, if you'd rather stay…" His grin turned predatory.

Evelyn forced a stiff nod. "Thank you."

Then—gunfire erupted outside.

Her pulse skyrocketed. The men scrambled for their weapons, shouting orders.

Alexander shoved a pistol into her hands, his voice low and urgent. "If anyone threatens you, shoot. No hesitation."

Her fingers trembled around the grip. "Is Liam here? Did Aldenria send forces?"

He pulled her toward the exit. "It might be him—but it's definitely not Aldenrian military."

Her stomach dropped. Had Liam come alone? Had he walked into a death trap?

Outside, smoke choked the air. Bullets whizzed past, the relentless gunfire deafening.

Donovan and his men charged into the fray.

One of them barked at Alexander, "Where's your weapon?"

"Who's attacking?" Alexander demanded.

"Mercenaries."

A smirk tugged at his lips. So, Liam had hired outside forces.

Alexander was almost impressed by the lengths his brother would go for Evelyn.

He dragged her to a nearby shack, shoving her into a cramped closet. "Stay alive, Cassandra," he ordered, his voice grim.

"Where are you going?" she cried.

He didn’t answer. The door slammed shut, plunging her into darkness.

Alone, Evelyn pressed a hand to her racing heart. The gunfire outside was relentless, each shot sending a fresh wave of terror through her.

She was drenched in sweat, tears pricking her eyes. How had she ended up in the middle of a warzone?

Her mind raced—was Alexander safe? Was Liam?

The battle raged on, stretching into the night.
###Chapter 199

The Muzat forces were clearly a force to be reckoned with. Their defenses were nearly impenetrable.

Evelyn Carter remained on high alert.

Suddenly, the door to the room burst open.

At the loud noise, her fingers tightened around the pistol. Her body went rigid. Her heartbeat accelerated. Cold sweat trickled down her spine. She strained her ears as the footsteps grew closer.

"Evelyn."

That calm, familiar voice made her hand tremble. She thought it must be her imagination playing tricks on her. She tried to steady her ragged breathing.

"Evelyn."

Liam Blackwood's voice came again. This time, she knew it was real.

She threw open the closet door. The moonlight streaming through the window outlined the familiar silhouette of a man.

All of Liam's fears evaporated the moment he saw her hiding there. Relief flooded through him.

Tears sprang to Evelyn's eyes immediately. She rushed from the closet straight into his arms.

"Is it really you, Liam?" She clung to him desperately, burying her face in his chest.

It felt surreal yet comforting.

Liam held her tightly, pressing a kiss to her forehead. His racing heart still ached.

He'd been terrified ever since she was taken to Muzat. Every second without her had been agony. When the mercenaries failed to secure the area after a day, he couldn't wait any longer. He'd infiltrated alone, following an anonymous tip to find her.

"Don't worry, it's me." His deep voice was barely above a whisper.

Gradually, Evelyn calmed in his embrace. She sniffled and looked up at him.

"How did you get in? They have advanced weaponry. Their firepower rivals our own."

Liam took her hand and moved toward the door. "I'll explain later," he murmured.

Outside was pitch black. Gunfire echoed through the night.

Guiding her carefully, they navigated through obstacles, avoiding enemies engaged in combat. Every step was fraught with danger.

When they reached the warehouse's rear, Evelyn tugged his hand. "Wait. We need to destroy the drugs here first."

Leaning against the wall, Liam kept watch. "I didn't bring explosives. It's impossible."

"We don't need them. One bullet into those containers will trigger an explosion. This is our only chance."

Liam chuckled and ruffled her hair. "That's naive thinking."

"Trust me," she insisted. "Alexander had me pose as a scientist to inspect their stock. I discovered they mixed two highly flammable chemical compounds. One's similar to rubidium - contact with water or fire causes detonation."

Liam's brow furrowed. "Alexander who?"

"Your brother, Alexander Blackwood."

Liam's eyes widened in shock. His entire body tensed.

"You didn't know?" Evelyn asked, puzzled. "He's the one who sent your rescue message."

With danger all around, they couldn't linger.

Liam pushed aside his confusion. "Will the explosion be massive?"

"No, more like firecrackers. It won't breach the walls but will destroy everything inside."

Without further questions, Liam carefully led her to the warehouse entrance. He cracked open a gap in the wall and fired a single shot.

Instantly, a series of explosions lit up the night like fireworks.

Liam quickly pulled her into the forest, their escape continuing through the darkness.
###Chapter 200

Evelyn kept glancing over her shoulder as she moved through the dense foliage. The sight of the drug warehouse being consumed by flames brought her a strange sense of relief.

Every trafficker in the area was now rushing toward the inferno, drawn like moths to a flame.

They emerged from the forest's edge to find themselves at the nation's border—a sheer cliff dropping into endless darkness.

Moonlight painted silver streaks across the landscape as distant gunfire echoed from the drug compound they'd left behind.

Trapped between a burning nest of vipers and an abyss, Evelyn turned to Liam with wide eyes. "You climbed up this cliff?"

Liam remained silent, scanning their surroundings before pulling her behind a massive boulder. He motioned for her to crouch.

From his pocket, he produced a flare gun and pressed it into her trembling hands.

"In thirty minutes, a helicopter will come," he said, his voice steady. "When you see it overhead, fire this. They'll retrieve you."

"Where are you going?" Evelyn clutched his sleeve, her fingers digging into the fabric.

Liam studied her panicked expression before gently tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Adrian was injured in Muzat while tracking the stolen weapons. He's still hospitalized."

Evelyn's grip tightened. "You're going after them alone, aren't you?"

His lips pressed into a thin line as he caressed her hair. "Just wait here for the helicopter."

The thought of Adrian's condition made tears spill down her cheeks. "No! It's too dangerous!"

"I'll be fine."

She grasped both his arms desperately. "Please, Liam. Don't go."

"You're the general of Aldenria," she pleaded. "Send someone else—anyone else—to investigate."

His warm palm cradled her face, thumb brushing away her tears. "Right now, I'm just Evelyn Carter's husband. My only duty is keeping you safe."

"Then stay with me," she begged. "Wait together for the helicopter."

Liam secured his sidearm before framing her tear-streaked face with both hands. "Evelyn, sending another operative now would be more dangerous than me going while everything's in chaos."

He met her gaze steadily. "They're someone's father, husband, or son too. Their lives matter as much as mine."

"With the enemy scattered, this is our best chance."

His words moved her profoundly, yet selfish fear clawed at her heart. "Please don't go," she whispered.

Liam crushed her against his chest in a desperate embrace, burying his face in her neck. "Forgive me," he murmured. "If I could change the past, I'd have saved you instead of Victoria."

Then he released her and turned away.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her mouth, silent sobs shaking her shoulders as she watched him stride toward danger.

Liam Blackwood!

Liam Blackwood!

Liam Blackwood!

"Come back to me," she whispered into the night wind. "I'll be waiting."
###Chapter 201

The rescue chopper located Evelyn without difficulty and airlifted her back to Aldenrian military headquarters.

Sleep eluded her completely that night. Dawn arrived with still no sign of Liam's return.

Each passing hour twisted her stomach tighter. She paced like a caged animal, whispering desperate prayers for his safety.

As morning light spilled across the compound, Evelyn curled up by the main gates. Her tear-filled eyes scanned the empty road stretching toward the horizon.

Ryan observed her from a distance. The raw emotion in her posture confused him - how could someone so clearly in love insist on divorce?

"Mrs. Blackwood," he approached gently, "you haven't eaten anything all day."

Her gaze remained locked on the distance. A single tear traced her cheek as she shook her head.

"I can't."

"Please don't worry. The General can handle himself."

Evelyn whirled around with bloodshot eyes. "Then send someone after him! I'm begging you, Ryan!"

His face contorted with conflict. "Our orders are absolute. Aldenrian forces can't enter Valtorian territory without risking war."

"What about Liam?" She gripped his arms until her knuckles turned white.

"The mercenary team remains with him. And General Blackwood has survived worse situations."

Evelyn collapsed onto the steps, burying her face in her hands as silent sobs wracked her body.

Two endless days passed without word. Exhaustion carved hollows beneath her eyes, but terror kept sleep at bay.

Then - a midnight knock shattered the silence.

She nearly fell scrambling to the door. Ryan stood there, face unreadable.

"Mrs. Blackwood... he's back."

Life flooded her veins. "Where? Is he hurt? Take me to him now!"

"The military hospital."

Her heart stopped. She was running before he finished speaking, bare feet slapping against cold concrete.

The hospital door burst open under her frantic hands.

There - shirtless on the examination table, being stitched up by a medic - sat Liam. Whole. Alive.

Their eyes met across the sterile room. In that suspended moment, a thousand unspoken words passed between them.

Evelyn pressed trembling fingers to her lips. The relief nearly buckled her knees.

"Why the tears?" His voice, though hoarse, wrapped around her like a warm blanket.

She couldn't answer. Not with the sight of those brutal gashes marring his torso.

The doctor finished bandaging and turned to her. "The wounds aren't life-threatening, but they're serious. Stitches need redressing daily - no water contact. He requires complete rest and these antibiotics."

Evelyn nodded mechanically, her entire world narrowed to the man before her. Alive. Home. Hers.
###Chapter 202

Evelyn Carter nodded solemnly, committing the doctor's words to memory.

After finishing his examination and giving additional care instructions, the physician exited the room.

Evelyn stood motionless as her eyes traced every wound on Liam's body, her heart shattering. Her face was pale with distress. She hadn't spoken a word since entering, consumed by overwhelming guilt.

Noticing her expression, Liam Blackwood attempted to reassure her. "Don't fret. I've lost count of how many injuries I've sustained. This is nothing."

His casual dismissal only intensified her anguish. The last time, a bullet had nearly pierced his heart. How could he remain so composed when any misstep could be fatal?

Now he was covered in lacerations. She couldn't fathom the dangers he'd faced throughout his military career.

His brow furrowed as he watched her distress. "Why are you crying? Are you... concerned about me?" he asked hesitantly.

She immediately turned away, hastily wiping her tears.

Liam exhaled sharply, disappointment flashing across his face. He must have misinterpreted her reaction. After all, she'd been adamant about their divorce - why would she care about him now?

Perhaps she was merely shocked by his injuries. Whatever she felt was likely just pity and gratitude.

After composing herself, Evelyn approached again. Picking up the hospital gown, she said with a slight tremor, "Put this on before you catch cold."

Liam studied her intently as he slowly complied.

She avoided his gaze, her cheeks flushing under his scrutiny, her pulse quickening noticeably.

"Did you... happen to see Alexander?" she asked softly.

"No," he replied in a low voice.

"What about the missing weapons?"

"Recovered them."

Her hands froze on his buttons as she looked up, startled. "That's wonderful," she breathed. "Does this mean you can mobilize troops against them now?"

"It's not that simple. There are political considerations between both nations."

Unversed in such matters, Evelyn didn't press further.

Liam, however, grew curious. "My brother left the family five years ago. How do you know him?"

"I don't. He mistook me for someone else." Finishing the last button, she retreated to a nearby chair.

His frown deepened. "What do you mean?"

She sighed. "He thought I was Victoria Dawson," she explained. "After we crossed paths, he protected me from the traffickers. He's the one who sent you that message."

Liam's expression darkened. He studied her face in silence, recalling how not just his grandmother and Alexander had mistaken her identity initially.

Truthfully, he'd made the same error when they first met three years ago. He remembered vividly the surge of emotion he'd felt then.

His first words to her had been: "You're back, Cassandra?"

The woman had smiled gently, correcting him: "You're mistaken, Mr. Blackwood. I'm Evelyn Carter."

In that moment, he'd experienced crushing disappointment.

Later investigations revealed Victoria was still working at Solterra, living with her parents and uncle.

The woman before him was simply Evelyn.

When Victoria returned to the country, he'd felt... nothing. A year later, even his childhood crush had faded completely. No butterflies remained.

Then his grandmother had pressured him to marry.

Liam had agreed for two reasons: familial obligation, and the inconvenient feelings developing for this woman who bore such striking resemblance to Cassandra.

Now, with all these coincidences, he had reason to suspect both DNA tests might have been flawed.

Taking a deep breath, he gathered courage to ask: "Do you have a gray mole... on your inner thigh?"
###Chapter 203

Evelyn gasped, her eyes widening. "Excuse me?"

Liam's finger hovered near her skirt hem.

The summer breeze made her floral maxi skirt flutter dangerously. She crossed her legs instinctively, heat creeping up her neck.

"Have you lost your mind?" she hissed, fingers clutching the fabric tighter.

A flush crept up Liam's neck despite his composed expression. "Just curious," he said evenly. "No offense intended."

Her cheeks burned. "Did you peek while I was sleeping?"

Now his entire body felt like it was burning. "I would never," he denied quickly, ears turning crimson.

"Then how would you know?"

Memories surfaced - childhood summers when she'd proudly shown him the tiny birthmark while wearing denim cutoffs.

"Is it really there?" His voice held an odd tension. "On your right thigh?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why? Have you discovered my secret identity?"

"Secret identity?" His gaze sharpened.

She bit her lip, suddenly finding the fruit basket fascinating. "I'll wash these grapes," she announced, grabbing the bowl.

The moment the bathroom door closed, Liam snatched his phone. Text to Ryan: "Any progress on Victoria and Archibald Wright's DNA?"

Ryan's reply came instantly: "Victoria's being careful. Got her parents' samples though."

"Get to the hospital. Find a way to draw Evelyn's blood for comparison," Liam typed.

"On it."

Evelyn returned with glistening grapes. "You should rest," she chided, setting the bowl down. "Doctor's orders."

He locked his phone, studying her face intently.

"What?" She touched her cheek self-consciously.

"Nothing." His lips quirked.

"Grape?"

"Too sour."

She popped one in her mouth - and immediately regretted it. Her face contorted as the acidic punch hit.

Liam chuckled at her reaction.

Ryan had brought the infamous military base grapes - beautiful to look at, brutal to taste.

"You!" Evelyn gasped when she recovered. "You could've warned me!"

"I did," he said innocently.

"You should've physically stopped me!"

His eyebrows shot up. The audacity.

"I assumed you liked punishment," he teased.

With mischief sparkling in her eyes, she selected another grape. "Do you enjoy suffering?"

"No."

"Then share my pain." She brought the fruit to his lips, eyelashes fluttering.

Liam's resolve wavered at her playful expression. "No."

Undeterred, she pressed the grape against his closed lips. The moment her fingertips brushed his mouth, electricity shot up her arm.

Her breath hitched. She started to pull back, embarrassed -

Then his lips parted, taking the grape... and lightly sucking her finger.

The contact sent sparks through both of them.

Evelyn jerked her hand away, flustered. Liam chewed slowly, the sourness nothing compared to the sweetness flooding his chest.
###Chapter 204

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

Awkwardness settled like a heavy blanket.

Then came three sharp knocks at the door.

Ryan Sullivan burst in, his face pale. "Evelyn, what's your blood type?" he demanded urgently.

"A positive. Why?" She blinked in confusion.

"Commander Blackwood's lost too much blood. The hospital's running low on type A. Would you be willing to donate?"

Without hesitation, she sprang to her feet. "Let's go now."

The moment they left, Liam's expression darkened.

Memories flooded his mind. If Evelyn truly was Cassandra...

The truth would reveal itself soon enough. The DNA results wouldn't lie.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn returned, rubbing her arm.

"They barely took anything. I'm perfectly healthy - why so little?" she muttered.

When she reached the hospital bed, Liam appeared to be sleeping.

She settled quietly into the chair beside him, resting her chin on folded arms. Her gaze traced the sharp lines of his face - the strong jaw, the faint shadows beneath his eyes.

Even exhausted, he looked devastatingly handsome. The thought of his injuries made her throat tighten.

She'd finally understood - his work wasn't just about weapons development. It involved dangerous field operations too.

Liam Blackwood was ruthless when necessary, a man of immense power who commanded fear.

All those rumors about him were absurd. The truth was simpler - he showed no mercy to criminals.

Thank you for coming back alive, Liam.

Gently, she adjusted his blankets. Then she leaned against the bed, closing her eyes.

Two sleepless nights of waiting had drained her. She drifted off within minutes.

She awoke to darkness and an empty stomach.

Blinking, Evelyn realized with horror that she was curled against Liam's chest, his arm draped over her.

She jerked upright so violently she nearly fell off the bed.

Holy hell!

How did she end up here?

Her sudden movement roused Liam. "Problem?" he murmured sleepily.

"I'm so sorry!" She scrambled off the mattress. "I didn't mean to - I don't even remember climbing up here. Did I hurt you?"

"My injuries are fine," he said calmly.

Evelyn pressed her hands to her flaming cheeks. "I must have sleepwalked. This is so embarrassing."

Liam bit back a smile. He'd never admit lifting her onto the bed himself.

"Don't worry about it." He nodded toward the nightstand. "Ryan brought food."

"Have you eaten?"

"Not yet."

"Let me help you sit up." She slid an arm behind his shoulders, straining against his muscular frame.

Her hair brushed his face, carrying the scent of vanilla and citrus.

Liam's breath hitched as she leaned closer. His gaze dropped to her lips.

The hunger in his eyes had nothing to do with food.
###Chapter 205

Evelyn gently assisted Liam into a sitting position before adjusting the hospital bed's meal tray. She then carefully transferred the dishes from the side table.

The injuries were minor for a hardened military man like him. He certainly didn't require assistance for such trivial matters.

Yet he'd deliberately allowed her to help him sit up. The truth was, he secretly enjoyed her attentive care. So he played the role of a vulnerable patient.

As she arranged the dishes, Evelyn poured soup into a bowl. "Liam, why is Alexander in Muzat? Your parents mentioned he hasn't visited home in five years." Her brow furrowed. "Is he... involved in drug trafficking?"

Liam responded casually while picking up his utensils. "With the Blackwood family fortune, my brother has no need for illegal income."

"But I saw him negotiating with known traffickers." She placed the steaming bowl before him. "Why didn't you approach him?"

He offered her a spare set of cutlery. "Join me for dinner."

"I'll eat later." She settled at the foot of the bed, pushing the soup closer.

"Now," he insisted.

"Alright." Accepting the utensils, Evelyn began eating beside him.

After a brief silence, she ventured, "Alexander isn't actually a criminal, is he?"

Liam's hands stilled, his expression darkening. "He graduated top of his class at the police academy."

Evelyn's eyes widened in realization. She stared at Liam, comprehension dawning. As a Blackwood heir, Alexander would never need drug money.

Which meant only one possibility - undercover narcotics work. His five-year absence suddenly made terrible sense.

"Does your family know?" she whispered.

"No. And they can't." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn understood the deadly risks of deep cover operations. A heavy weight settled in her chest.

Noticing her somber expression, Liam's voice turned sharp. "Why this sudden interest in my brother?"

If not for Alexander's intervention, she might not have survived. Of course she'd worry about her rescuer. Especially since he was the brother of the man she...

"Just curious," she murmured, focusing on her food.

They ate in tense silence until Evelyn spoke again. "Liam... is Alexander in danger?"

His appetite vanished. Setting down his spoon, he answered tersely, "He can handle himself."

"Adrian nearly died when his cover was blown during that investigation." Her voice trembled. "I'm terrified the same might happen to Alexander."

Liam wiped his mouth with a napkin, exhaling sharply.

Evelyn blinked. "You're not eating?"

"Lost my appetite." He leaned back against the pillows.

She frowned at his barely touched meal. "You've hardly eaten anything."

"Not hungry."

"Just a little more?"

"You finish it."

"Alright." She continued eating alone, sighing between bites.

Liam studied her troubled face. "What's wrong?"

"I can't stop worrying about Alexander."

He took a measured breath before responding calmly, "This was his choice. We must respect that. The consequences... are beyond our control."

Evelyn pushed her plate away. "Those traffickers are monsters. If they discover him..."

"You met him once." Liam's voice turned icy. "Spent less than a day together." His jaw tightened. "Why this obsession with his safety?"

His tone made her pause. She looked up, confused by his intensity.

With a sharp exhale, Liam swung his legs off the bed.

Evelyn reached out anxiously. "Your injuries! You shouldn't be moving."

His expression darkened. "My legs work fine." He stood firmly. "I can walk perfectly well."
###Chapter 206

"Where are you going? Let me help you." Evelyn's voice was laced with concern as she reached out, worried Liam might still be too weak to move on his own.

Liam's response was sharp, his tone icy. "Bathroom. Are you coming too?" he snapped.

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks, and she quickly withdrew her hand, flustered. His sudden hostility caught her off guard. Was there some tension between him and Alexander? Did they not get along?

"Y-you go ahead." She lowered her gaze and settled back onto the bed, picking up her spoon to continue eating. Her face burned, and her pulse quickened.

After finishing her meal, she tidied up and settled into a chair with a book while Liam focused on his laptop, engrossed in work. The room was silent, the only sounds the occasional rustle of pages and the soft tapping of keys.

Sunlight streamed through the window, warm and golden. Evelyn stole glances at Liam, admiring the way his sharp features softened in concentration. Even without words, just being near him filled her with quiet contentment.

Her phone buzzed, breaking the peaceful moment. She checked the screen—it was time for his medication. Closing her book, she approached him. "Liam, it's time for your medicine."

His eyes remained fixed on the screen, his expression unreadable.

A pang of sadness struck her. She hated seeing him like this—distant, untouchable. He wasn’t the only man in the world, yet he was the only one who made her feel so uncertain.

"Alright, I’ll head back then. Call me if you need anything."

He gave a noncommittal hum in response.

"Don’t forget to take your medicine on time. And your wounds—keep them dry. No strenuous activity. Eat properly, and—"

Liam finally looked up, brows furrowed in confusion as she rambled.

"—change your bandages daily," she finished.

"You—" He hesitated, words trapped in his throat.

Evelyn forced a smile, feigning relief. "Then I’ll go now. Rest well."

Was she not planning to visit again? He had only told her to rest, not to stay away. Why did it sound like a goodbye?

She took two steps before his voice stopped her.

"Hey?" She turned back.

Liam’s expression softened slightly. "Are you going back to the dormitory?"

She shook her head. "Not until you recover. You got hurt protecting me, after all."

"Then are you—!"

Evelyn blinked, waiting.

He exhaled sharply, lips pressing together before he spoke again. "If you go out, take some soldiers with you."

"Alright."

The sight of her tired face and slender frame tugged at his chest. He didn’t want her to leave, not really. "Go rest," he murmured.
###Chapter 207

Evelyn clenched her thighs nervously. "You should rest now."

She threw one last hesitant glance at Liam before turning away, shutting the door firmly behind her.

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly before her. With each step, her vision blurred. Tilting her chin up, she drew ragged breaths, fighting the tears.

True love meant craving their presence most when hurting. Yet Liam had sent her away precisely when he needed care. The message couldn't be clearer.

She meant nothing to him.

Sunlight assaulted her as she exited the building. Its warmth failed to penetrate the icy void in her chest.

Ryan approached hurriedly. "Mrs. Blackwood," he called, "your brother's here."

"My brother?" Her voice cracked with disbelief.

"Yes. I've seated him in the administrative building's reception. He insists on seeing both you and the General."

Evelyn's fists clenched. Teeth gritted, she stormed toward the building.

She'd encountered shameless men before, but Dominic Carter redefined audacity. His sudden appearance at Aldenrian Military Headquarters boded nothing good.

The door crashed open under her force. There lounged Dominic, legs arrogantly crossed, sipping coffee like he owned the place. His gaze swept the room with entitlement before landing on her.

"Evelyn! There you are." He set down the cup with false cheer.

"What the hell are you doing here?" she spat.

His lips curled into that familiar slimy smile. "Turning over a new leaf. Thought I'd ask dear brother-in-law for a military position. Serve my country, you know?"

Evelyn barked a laugh. "Veteran status? Defense Academy graduate? Which qualification do you possess?"

"Blood ties count for nothing?" He spread his hands with brazen charm. "Can't he pull strings for family?"

"Connections?" Disgust twisted her gut. Only familial obligation had stayed her hand from prosecuting him before.

Dominic adopted a wheedling tone, inching closer. "Sis, I admit my mistakes. You're the bigger person—"

"Save it." She cut him off coldly. "Liam and I are divorcing. The papers are signed. Don't even think of exploiting that relationship."

His chuckle dripped condescension. "Don't be ridiculous. No woman walks away from Liam Blackwood's wealth."

"Get. Out." Her finger jabbed toward the exit. "Or I'll settle every debt between us right now."

Amusement flickered across his face. "We're flesh and blood, Evelyn. Where's your heart?"

"My heart?" The irony choked her.

She inhaled sharply. "You won't stop until forced, will you? Hear this clearly, Dominic—you ceased being my brother the moment you sold me. You're lucky I haven't sought vengeance. How dare you come begging favors?"

Rage darkened his features. He advanced, voice venomous. "Who do you think you are? Liam must be blind to waste himself on trash like you—a common whore."

"Now you've climbed into some man's bed, you forget your family. Ungrateful bitch."
###Chapter 208

Evelyn had reached her limit. "Ryan, get in here!" she snapped, her voice sharp with fury.

Ryan Sullivan, who had been waiting outside, entered promptly. "Yes, Mrs. Blackwood?" he asked with practiced deference.

"Remove him from the Aldenrian Military base," she commanded. "Ban him permanently. If he causes any disturbance or attempts to force entry, handle him according to protocol."

"Understood, Mrs. Blackwood." Ryan approached Dominic Carter. "This way, sir."

Dominic remained unfazed. He strolled to the sofa and lounged carelessly, crossing one leg over his knee with a deliberately provocative smirk. "I'm not going anywhere. Fetch your general. Tell him his brother-in-law demands an audience." His tone dripped with arrogance.

Evelyn was momentarily speechless at his audacity.

Ryan remained eerily calm. He withdrew his sidearm and disengaged the safety with a crisp click.

Dominic's face drained of color. His body stiffened visibly as he swallowed hard.

"You were permitted entry solely due to your relation to Mrs. Blackwood," Ryan stated coolly. "Since she's revoked that privilege and authorized lethal force, do you understand your current position?"

He continued evenly, "Trespassing on Aldenrian Military property and creating disturbances carries severe consequences. Are you aware what those entail?"

Dominic's hands trembled. He sat ramrod straight, forcing composure. "I merely wished to see my brother-in-law. No disturbance intended."

"Aldenrian law permits lethal force against military base intruders when circumstances warrant." Ryan leveled the firearm at him.

Dominic shot to his feet, hands flying up in surrender. "I-I'm leaving now! D-don't shoot!" His voice cracked with panic.

He didn't dare breathe as he passed Evelyn. Leaning close, he hissed through clenched teeth, "This isn't over. You'll regret this."

Ryan escorted him out without further incident.

Evelyn stood frozen, fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms. The anger coursing through her left her trembling.

She loathed everything about the Carter family. She yearned to shed this false identity and reclaim her true self - if only she could remember who that was.

Who was she really?
Who had orchestrated this nightmare?

Exhausted, she returned to her quarters. A hot shower did little to ease her tension before she collapsed into bed.

Morning came late. After a solitary lunch, she attempted to read, but her thoughts kept drifting to Liam.

Had he eaten properly? Taken his medication? Rested adequately?

She longed to visit him yet feared another rejection. Propping her chin on one hand, she absently flipped pages until her phone chimed.

The notification startled her. Seeing Liam's name, she opened it immediately.

"If you're available, I'd appreciate a book to alleviate my boredom," the message read.

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

Bored? Liam Blackwood? The man who worked through injuries and had subordinates at his beck and call?

Why request this of her specifically?

Shaking off the oddity, she selected a book, checked her appearance, and headed out. Perhaps he simply wanted reading material.
###Chapter 209

Evelyn's heart fluttered as she approached Liam's hospital room, clutching her favorite novel tightly in her hands.

"What should I say first?" she pondered. "Should I mention this book or ask about his recovery? How can I stay longer without seeming obvious?"

Lost in thought, she reached the doorway before realizing it was slightly open.

She had been walking briskly but came to an abrupt stop at the threshold.

The sight before her made her blood run cold - Liam locked in an intimate embrace with another woman.

One fleeting glance was all it took to shatter her composure. She stumbled backward, pressing herself against the hallway wall.

The book dug into her chest as she hugged it like a lifeline. A sharp sting pierced her nose as hot tears threatened to spill.

Evelyn tilted her head back, fighting the tears, but the crushing weight in her chest demanded release.

There was no mistaking it - Victoria Dawson was wrapped around Liam's neck.

How had she gotten here so quickly? Had Liam summoned her the moment he was injured?

Victoria's saccharine voice carried through the doorway.

"I came the instant you called, darling Liam. When you asked me to visit yesterday, I never imagined you'd be hurt. I've been sick with worry."

"It's nothing serious," Liam replied.

"But you're in pain!" Victoria whimpered. "Does it hurt terribly?"

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut as twin tears traced down her cheeks, dripping onto her collar.

An icy numbness spread through her body while her heart felt cleaved in two. The agony was unbearable.

This marriage had brought her nothing but endless heartache.

Her arms went slack. The book hit the floor with a resounding thud.

She gasped for air, her chest constricting painfully.

Feeling hollowed out, Evelyn turned away blindly, tears distorting her vision as she fought back sobs.

Inside the elevator, she scrubbed at her face furiously, but the tears kept coming in relentless waves.

Back in the hospital room, Liam disentangled himself from Victoria's grasp. He started to speak when a faint noise at the door caught his attention.

"Let me check," Victoria offered sweetly.

She stepped outside just in time to see Evelyn's retreating figure disappear around the corner. Spotting the abandoned book, a triumphant smirk curled her lips.

Returning, she said airily, "Just a nurse passing by."

Liam gave a distracted nod.

Victoria fluttered her lashes coquettishly. "Did you summon me so urgently because of your injury, darling? Do you need me to care for you?"

He averted his gaze. "Don't throw yourself at me like that. I'm married now. It's inappropriate."

Victoria pouted dramatically. "You'll always be the love of my life, Liam. I don't care about wives or families - my feelings will never change."

Keeping his tone gentle but firm, Liam suggested, "You must be exhausted from traveling. Why don't you rest at the guest quarters?"

He was still waiting for Evelyn.

"Fine," Victoria sighed. "I'll bring you lunch later."

Liam nodded absently, his expression unreadable.

Victoria collected her things, pausing to scoop up the discarded book on her way out.

Alone again, Liam checked his watch impatiently, sitting on the edge of the bed.
###Chapter 210

Where was Evelyn? Had she changed her mind?

A soft knock echoed through the room moments later.

Liam immediately tossed his phone aside and straightened his tie. He adjusted his posture, sitting rigidly upright.

His lips curved into an expectant smile as he gazed toward the door.

In an instant, his hopeful expression shattered.

The person entering wasn't Evelyn—it was Ryan.

"Sir, why did you summon Ms. Wright here?" Ryan asked cautiously.

Liam's face darkened. "The task I assigned you remains incomplete after all this time. How much longer must I wait before taking matters into my own hands?"

Understanding dawned on Ryan's face. He lowered his head in shame. "My apologies, General."

Liam rose and strode toward the doorway. He stood in the empty corridor, staring intently at the elevator banks.

His heart sank with each passing second. The anticipation turned torturous.

Ryan approached quietly. "What should we do now?"

"Her toothbrush, used tissues, strands of hair—or create an opportunity to obtain a blood sample. Use whatever means necessary. I need that DNA immediately."

"Yes, sir."

Liam remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the deserted hallway.

After several minutes of silence, Ryan studied his commander's despondent expression before following his line of sight.

"What are you looking at, General?"

Liam didn't respond, the disappointment evident in his slumped shoulders.

"Are you... waiting for Mrs. Blackwood?"

Without a word, Liam turned and stalked back into the room, Ryan trailing behind him.

Liam collapsed onto the sofa, draping his arms along the backrest. His fingers tapped an erratic rhythm as he stared blankly at the balcony view.

The usually formidable general looked utterly defeated, his eyes devoid of their characteristic intensity. The silence around him felt heavier than any battlefield.

Ryan hesitated before whispering, "Should I bring Mrs. Blackwood to you, sir?"

"No." The single word carried icy finality.

The untouched meal and medication on the table spoke volumes. Ryan had never seen his commander like this—so clearly pining for a woman who remained oblivious to his devotion.

"If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave, sir." Ryan bowed slightly.

Liam responded with a noncommittal hum.

He waited the entire day without any sign of Evelyn. No calls. No texts.

As twilight painted the sky, Ryan returned with devastating news.

"General, Mrs. Blackwood departed for Aldenria hours ago," he reported quietly. "She's already airborne."

A bitter smile twisted Liam's lips before vanishing. Loving someone who didn't love him back was a special kind of torment.

First, the childhood sweetheart who saw him only as a brother. Now, a wife in name only.

Was he truly unworthy of love?

Days later, discharged from the hospital, Liam drowned himself in work. Constant activity provided temporary relief from his heartache—if he stayed busy enough, he could almost forget.

In his office, Ryan entered carrying a sealed dossier.

"The results are in, General Blackwood."

Liam set aside his documents and extended his hand.

He tore open the file with uncharacteristic impatience. Inside lay two DNA reports—one for Victoria Dawson and Archibald Wright...
###Chapter 211

The second report belonged to Archibald and Evelyn's.

Both documents came from the military hospital, ensuring absolute accuracy in their findings.

Liam's brow furrowed as he examined both files. His expression grew increasingly grave, his eyes darkening like storm clouds.

When he finished reading, rage turned his face ashen. Veins bulged at his neck, his entire body radiating lethal energy.

He slammed the papers onto the table with such force that Ryan jumped. The explosive anger made the younger man shrink back instinctively.

Liam bent forward, elbows on knees, pressing his palms against his forehead. He squeezed his eyes shut, taking measured breaths to contain the fury threatening to consume him.

An arctic chill settled over the room.

"Is something wrong, General?" Ryan ventured timidly.

Liam felt like he was drowning in rage. Leaning back against the sofa, he stared blankly at the ceiling.

Ryan's breath caught when he saw the moisture gathering in Liam's bloodshot eyes. In all their years working together, he'd never witnessed the general struggling to contain emotions like this.

Through clenched teeth, Liam spat out two names like poison: "Julian... Whitmore..."

Ryan swallowed hard.

Liam's fist smashed into the sofa cushion before he abruptly stood and strode toward the door.

Ryan scrambled after him. "Where are we going, sir?"

"Back to Aldenria."

"By car or—"

"Private jet."

"Right away, sir."

Evelyn had been staying with Rosalind these past few days. Today, Eleanor had summoned her back to Blackwood Manor.

Upon arrival, she found an elegant elderly woman in the parlor. Though her hair was silver-white, she carried herself with refined grace that made Evelyn's pulse quicken inexplicably.

"Evelyn, this is Margaret Whitmore, Victoria's grandmother," Eleanor introduced.

Evelyn offered a polite greeting. "Madam Whitmore."

Margaret's steel-gray eyes raked over her with disdain. "My granddaughter tells me you copied her youthful appearance through plastic surgery to trap Liam Blackwood."

"Modern medicine is truly remarkable. At first glance, you do resemble Victoria in her younger days. But upon closer inspection..." She sniffed derisively. "The imitation falls short."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

She'd never undergone any procedures. Why was Victoria spreading these vicious lies? What was she trying to hide?

Margaret's hostility was palpable. Clearly, she'd come as Victoria's champion.

Evelyn maintained her composure. "If you have business with me, Madam Whitmore, please state it plainly."

"Eleanor," Margaret said coolly, "I'd like a word alone with her."

Understanding flashed in Eleanor's eyes. "Of course. I'll tend to the greenhouse roses."

With that, she departed, leaving Evelyn alone with the older woman.

Evelyn sipped her tea, the unfairness of the situation churning in her gut.

Margaret produced a check from her purse and slid it across the table. "Ms. Carter, our family lacks for nothing except my granddaughter's happiness. Name your price to walk away from Liam Blackwood."
###Chapter 212

Evelyn stared at the check in her hands, her emotions swirling like a storm.

"You don't need to do this, Madam Hoffis. Money means nothing to me."

"My granddaughter told me everything about you," Margaret sneered. "Besides, Liam has loved Victoria since childhood. You can't possibly understand the depth of his feelings."

She continued, her voice dripping with pride, "Victoria was a prodigy. Top of her class, brilliant beyond measure. Liam worked himself to exhaustion just to get into the National Defense Academy - all to be worthy of her."

"Victoria told him she admired men who could build rockets and defend our nation. He became the man he is today because of her."

"It was Victoria who shaped him into this remarkable man, yet you stole him with your scheming ways." Margaret's voice grew louder with each word.

Her fists clenched, trembling with barely contained rage. "You destroyed what should have been a perfect union. Do you realize how despicable you are?"

Evelyn looked down. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms, the pain anchoring her to reality.

At that moment, she felt like she might shatter. Her nose burned, her throat tightened. Tears welled up as her chest ached with unbearable weight.

The humiliation crushed her.

She couldn't speak, couldn't breathe.

Margaret composed herself with visible effort. "Make the wise choice, Ms. Carter. Why cling to a man whose heart you'll never possess?"

"Name your price. I'll pay whatever it takes to be rid of you."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Truthfully, Madam Hoffis, this visit was unnecessary. Your money means nothing to me."

She continued softly, "The divorce papers are already signed. We're just finalizing the legalities."

Margaret's face lit up. "Truly?" She shot Evelyn a triumphant look.

Seeing the older woman's joy twisted Evelyn's heart. These tears weren't for Liam - they were for the cruel woman before her.

The unfairness of it all made tears spill uncontrollably. She dug her nails deeper into her palms.

"Keep your money," she whispered hoarsely.

"You're certain? When will this be official?"

Evelyn's voice shook. "When Liam returns to Aldenria."

"Excellent. I'll await the good news."

Good news? The irony burned.

Suddenly, heavy footsteps echoed through the room. Both women turned to see Liam striding in, his expression dark.

"You're back, Liam! What perfect timing," Margaret said brightly.

Liam's intense gaze locked onto Evelyn. Seeing her distress, his eyes turned bloodshot.

The woman he'd searched for endlessly stood right before him. All this time, he'd unknowingly fulfilled his childhood dream - marrying the love of his life.

Even without recognizing her as Cassandra, he'd fallen for her all over again.

His heart had known before his mind did. This was the woman he'd loved for over two decades.
###Chapter 213

Liam stepped into the room with measured steps.

Evelyn quickly snatched the check from the table and shoved it into her pocket before flashing him an embarrassed smile.

Noticing Margaret's distressed expression, he could easily deduce why Evelyn had wanted a private conversation with her.

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, avoiding eye contact.

"You sent Victoria to the Aldenrian Military base last week," she ventured. "Did she not return with you today?"

"No," Liam answered curtly.

Her fingers twisted nervously. "Why didn't you bring her along? It's dangerous for her there without you."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn's face suddenly brightened. "Oh! You only came back to handle the divorce paperwork, didn't you? You're returning immediately after?" Her voice took on a knowing tone. "You didn't want to tire her with the journey."

"Ms. Hoffis—" Liam began heavily, but she cut him off again.

"You've always been so considerate, even as a boy," Margaret beamed. "I won't keep you any longer. I'll await your good news."

She turned toward the exit with visible excitement.

Evelyn spotted the forgotten handbag on the sofa. She grabbed it and hurried after the older woman.

"Grandmother, your bag," she called softly.

Margaret froze mid-step. She whirled around, her face draining of color.

Evelyn stiffened at the intense reaction.

Had she misspoken? Why such a dramatic response?

"Say that again," Margaret whispered, her hands trembling.

Confused, Evelyn extended the bag. "Your handbag."

"No." The older woman swallowed hard. "Call me 'grandmother' again."

Realization dawned. Evelyn's cheeks flushed. "My apologies, Ms. Hoffis. It slipped out in the moment."

Margaret studied her with unsettling intensity. The cadence of Evelyn's voice had been uncannily familiar.

A decade had passed since she'd last heard her real granddaughter's voice. Only a handful of phone calls during that single year of freedom—not enough to memorize the tone. Yet the way this young woman had said "grandmother"...

But Victoria had always been here. Why was she doubting?

Margaret forced a tight smile as she accepted the bag. "You resemble my granddaughter in more than just appearance, Ms. Carter. No wonder Eleanor became confused," she said with forced lightness.

Evelyn offered a strained smile in return.

Liam's chest constricted watching this exchange. The urge to reveal the truth and restore Cassandra's identity burned within him. But he couldn't. Not yet.

"Ms. Hoffis," he interjected politely, "might I have a word in private?"

Margaret brightened immediately. "Of course!"

Evelyn nodded at them both. "I'll excuse myself then."

She'd barely taken two steps when Liam caught her wrist.

"Wait for me in the parlor," he murmured.

Evelyn blinked up at him in surprise.

"Please follow me to the study, Ms. Hoffis." Liam gestured gracefully.

As Margaret moved toward the study, Liam held Evelyn's gaze for a weighted moment. "Don't leave," he repeated firmly. "Wait for me."

Without a word, Evelyn returned to the sofa and settled in to wait.
###Chapter 214

Liam stepped into the study with measured steps. He gestured for Margaret to take a seat on the plush leather sofa before launching into his interrogation.

"Mrs. Hoffis, did you ever see Cassandra in person during her decade abroad?"

Margaret shook her head. "No, she was completely immersed in her studies. Never had time to visit. But we spoke regularly on the phone."

"Video calls?" Liam pressed.

"Those were... infrequent," Margaret admitted, her fingers twisting in her lap.

Liam leaned forward. "When did you first notice her appearance had changed?"

Margaret's brow furrowed. She shifted uncomfortably before asking, "Why all these questions, Mr. Blackwood?"

His jaw tightened. "Just answer honestly. I want to understand Cassandra better."

The older woman brightened at his apparent interest in her granddaughter. "About three years ago," she began eagerly. "We hadn't done a video call in ages. When we finally connected, her round cheeks had hollowed out completely. Archibald and I were devastated."

She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. "The poor girl hated looking so youthful. She got some minor cosmetic procedures done. Between that and her exhausting work schedule..."

Liam's eyes narrowed. "Were her parents present during these calls?"

"Oh yes," Margaret nodded. "My son, his wife, and our adopted son Julian. They were celebrating Thanksgiving when they called."

A chill ran down Liam's spine. Now he understood why Archibald and Margaret never questioned Victoria's true identity. The imposter had appeared alongside Cassandra's actual parents.

"Tell me about their reactions," Liam pressed. "Did they seem uncomfortable? Stressed? Upset?"

Margaret's expression clouded. After a long pause, she shook her head. "It's been too long. I can't recall."

"How many such calls occurred?"

Tears welled in Margaret's wrinkled eyes. "I don't know if they suspected anything," she whispered hoarsely. "That entire month, they video-called constantly. Kept saying how Victoria would take good care of Archibald and me when she returned."

Her hands trembled. "Less than a month later... we got the news. By the time we reached Solterra..." A sob escaped her. "Only their headstones remained."

Liam quickly offered tissues, regretting his harsh questioning. But Margaret continued through her tears.

"That poor child... losing both parents so suddenly. We had no choice but to bring her home." She wiped her eyes. "The trauma changed her. She became withdrawn, indifferent to the family business. Refused to help Archibald manage anything."

Margaret grasped Liam's hand desperately. "We can't let Julian inherit everything. If you marry Victoria, we'll rest easy knowing the Wright legacy is in capable hands."

The Wright family fortune.

Liam finally understood Julian's conspiracy with the Obsidian Circle. They were after this massive inheritance.

The puzzle pieces clicked into place.

For now, Cassandra's safety depended on maintaining her current identity. His next move? Finding her missing parents.
###Chapter 215

If he exposed her true identity before capturing Julian and the imposter, Evelyn would face even greater danger as the sole heir to the Wright family.

Liam was burning with curiosity. What exactly did Cassandra do for a living?

What kind of job required her to secretly change nationalities and cut off contact with her family for ten months every year? She couldn't even return to the country for a decade.

"Ms. Wright, what was Cassandra's previous occupation?"

Margaret gave him a knowing smile. "Aren't you two inseparable these days? Why don't you ask her yourself?"

Liam returned an awkward smile. "She refuses to tell me."

"Not just you," Margaret sighed. "Even her uncle and parents never knew what she was doing. The pay was terrible, and she worked herself to the bone. But one thing's certain - she worked for the Solterra government."

A government job requiring such secrecy? The only possibility that came to mind was Alexander's position - an undercover operative.

But something still didn't add up.

After some polite conversation, Liam escorted Margaret out of the study.

When they passed through the living room, Evelyn was no longer on the sofa.

His pulse quickened as he scanned the area. After seeing Margaret out, he questioned Ryan standing guard at the entrance about Evelyn's whereabouts.

Ryan confirmed she hadn't left the residence.

Liam rushed back inside, taking the stairs two at a time. He threw open the master bedroom door with urgent force.

The sudden intrusion startled the woman inside. Evelyn scrambled up from the pile of books, studying his expression with cautious apprehension.

"I... I found these books. Haven't had time to read them yet. Just wanted to borrow a few."

Liam's chest constricted. A bittersweet smile twisted his lips as his eyes grew moist.

The woman he loved remained unchanged - still reserved, resilient, and hungry for knowledge, just like in her youth.

What had he been thinking before? How could he have failed to recognize her and caused her so much pain?

He closed the door gently and approached.

"You're welcome to read them here," he said softly.

Evelyn set the book down. "I've been staying with Rosalind lately, as you know."

He exhaled in frustration.

She met his gaze nervously. "Did you want to say something when you asked me to stay?"

Liam shoved his hands in his pockets, at a loss for words.

There was so much he couldn't say or do. The situation was too complicated to know what was appropriate.

Reading his troubled expression, she forced calm into her voice. "It's really not that hard to say. I understand completely."

Liam frowned. Understand what?

"We should finalize the divorce soon," she continued. "That way you and Victoria can be together openly."

His frown deepened. "What do you mean 'openly'?"

Why was he still pretending? She'd seen and heard everything.

Since he couldn't forget Victoria, divorce was the simplest solution.

Evelyn offered a pained smile, inhaling sharply as her chest constricted with hurt.

"I visited Grandma two days ago. She's lost all cognitive function. Doesn't recognize anyone, her thoughts are completely jumbled. She's becoming incoherent. The symptoms are worsening rapidly."

His heart sank.

"You should visit when you have time."

"Okay," he agreed.

"When are you free?"
###Chapter 216

"What?" Evelyn's voice trembled with disbelief.

"Let's divorce." Liam's words cut through the air like a knife.

His expression darkened instantly, the temperature in the room dropping several degrees. He took slow, deliberate steps toward her until she found herself backing against the wall.

"I don't have time for divorce proceedings," he said through clenched teeth. "Ask for anything else."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, her emerald eyes flashing with fury. "Why didn't I see what a liar you were sooner? We would've ended this farce if Adrian hadn't been in danger last time! It's barely been a week - what changed?"

Liam studied her flushed face, suppressing the storm of emotions raging inside him. "I did change my mind," he admitted calmly. "If you want a divorce, you'll have to recover your memories first."

He took a steadying breath before continuing. "If after remembering everything you still don't want to be my wife, we'll part ways. But if your memories change your mind-"

The unspoken words hung between them. After a heavy pause, he finished quietly, "Then we remain husband and wife."

Her hands balled into fists at her sides, her entire body shaking with barely contained rage. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks despite her efforts to stop them.

"Are you insane, Liam? Do you get off on playing these games? Wouldn't it be easier to just be with Victoria openly?"

Her voice broke as she continued, "Why keep me trapped in this marriage? I refuse to be the pathetic joke between you two! Does cheating make it more exciting for you?"

Liam recoiled as if struck, his face draining of color.

Evelyn bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, angrily swiping at her tears. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.

"If you won't agree to divorce amicably, I'll see you in court," she spat, pushing past him toward the door.

He moved faster, his hand closing around her wrist like a steel trap. "Evelyn, don't do this."

She jerked away like his touch burned, her fight-or-flight instincts kicking in. "Let go of me, Liam! I hate you!"

The words hit him like a physical blow. He stood frozen, his world crumbling around him. The pain was worse than any battlefield wound - a gaping hole where his heart should be, making it impossible to breathe.

Knife wounds healed in days. Bullet wounds in weeks. But this agony had haunted him for years, resurfacing when he was most vulnerable. The kind of pain that didn't kill you but made you wish it would.

Hearing her say she hated him shattered whatever remained of his composure.

"Tell me what I'm doing wrong," he pleaded, his voice raw. "I'll fix it. But don't accuse me of things I haven't done. There was no affair. No cheating."

Evelyn would never believe him again. Not after his promise to cut ties with Victoria - only to summon her to the military base knowing Evelyn would be there.

What kind of game was he playing?

Did ex-lovers normally embrace like that? Did he think she was stupid?

Tears streamed down her face as she glared up at him. Trapped in his grip, she demanded, "Why won't you let me go, Liam? What do you want from me?"
###Chapter 217

Liam didn't hesitate. "I want you."

"Me?" Evelyn froze. Just as anger flared within her, his next words extinguished it.

She stared at him in shock. Had she misheard?

His voice was deep, his gaze burning with intensity. "I refuse to divorce because what I want is you."

Her breath caught. Her heart pounded wildly in her chest.

A blush crept up her cheeks as she stammered, "You... Do you realize what you're saying? Would you dare repeat that in front of Victoria? Don't you find this ridiculous?"

Liam's expression darkened. "I'll say it to anyone. I don't want to divorce you. I want to be with you. Why is that ridiculous?"

Evelyn's mind reeled at his direct words. She knew he still loved Victoria - that much was certain.

Taking a shaky breath, she forced calm into her voice. "You won't divorce me, yet you're still involved with Victoria. How blind I was not to see what kind of man you truly are!"

Liam released her hand. Running frustrated fingers through his hair, he moved to the bed and sat heavily, rubbing his temples.

The picture of misery, he drew several deep breaths.

An aura of loneliness and sorrow clung to him.

He was exhausted. Love had never been his strong suit, and now he faced a woman who couldn't remember their past. He'd shown her his heart, only to have it thrown back at him.

Seeing his distress, Evelyn felt an ache in her chest.

Was he torn between his marriage and Victoria?

"You don't have to struggle with this decision," she said quietly. "You don't have to give up Victoria."

She turned toward the door. "This marriage was never my choice to begin with."

His firm voice stopped her. "I'm not struggling. There's no other woman in my heart. And we can't divorce based on your whims."

Evelyn turned back. "What do you mean?"

Liam straightened, meeting her gaze. "Look up the Aldenrian Military Marriage Laws," he said quietly.

Shock held her motionless for several seconds. Without another word, she opened the door and left.

As it clicked shut behind her, Liam collapsed backward onto the bed. He pressed his hands over his eyes, fighting back tears.

The last time he'd cried was ten years ago when Cassandra left him. Now, even without her memories, she could still break his heart.

On the subway ride home, Evelyn searched military marriage policies on her phone.

Her stomach dropped when she discovered she needed her military spouse's consent for divorce. The only exceptions required proof of abuse, infidelity, or drug use.

Frustrated, she immediately called her divorce attorney, Natalie.

"I thought you said your husband was involved with another woman?" Natalie asked.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated such difficulty. "He's in love with someone else and still sees her. But I have no proof of cheating."

"Then get some. Secret photos would work. Even military marriages can end with evidence of adultery."

"Would it count if I saw him hugging her?"

"It counts, but barely. You'd need something more substantial - hand-holding, kissing, or catching them in bed together." Natalie paused. "If you want a quick divorce, you could provoke him into hitting you. That would make things easier."
###Chapter 218

Provoking Liam to the point of violence? That sounded like a suicide mission.

Evelyn's face paled as she shook her head. "I can't do that. One punch from him would kill me."

"Without proof of infidelity, domestic abuse, or drug involvement, divorce isn't an option," Natalie explained. "The court would dismiss your petition immediately. You wouldn't even get a hearing."

Evelyn clenched her fists in frustration. "But you told me I could file for divorce before."

"That was when you mentioned his affair. I assumed you had evidence." Natalie sighed, realizing her mistake. "I apologize for the misunderstanding. You'll need to gather proof first."

"Be careful," Natalie warned.

"Thanks," Evelyn murmured before ending the call.

She slumped against the seat, exhaling heavily as the subway carried her back to Blackwood Manor.

Upon arrival, she froze at the entrance. Sebastian and Isabella had returned, chatting animatedly with Richard and Eleanor in the living room.

Evelyn hesitated. Sebastian and Isabella had always despised her. Would her presence drive them away again?

Cassandra approached silently, leaning against Evelyn's shoulder. "Hello, Evelyn."

"What's troubling you?" Cassandra asked with a knowing smile.

Evelyn bit her lip before whispering, "Why do they hate me so much?"

Cassandra smirked. "Sebastian's a spineless man who mirrors his wife's opinions. As for Isabella..." She lowered her voice. "She was obsessed with Liam. Went through great lengths to marry him, but got rejected."

"Out of spite, she married Sebastian instead. Notice how she barely tolerates him? Of course she resents you."

Evelyn absorbed this shocking revelation as they walked toward the stairs.

Suddenly, Cassandra stiffened. "Liam! When did you return?"

Evelyn looked up to find Liam emerging from a room, his intense gaze locking onto her. Surprise flickered in his eyes.

Cassandra disentangled herself awkwardly. "What a reunion! Sebastian and Isabella are back, and now you. The manor hasn't been this lively in ages."

Under Liam's burning stare, Evelyn blurted, "Alexander isn't home yet."

Liam's expression darkened.

Cassandra coughed. "Why bring up Alexander? I'll leave you two alone." As she retreated, she noted their tense body language - outwardly indifferent, yet their eyes betrayed deeper emotions.

Now alone in the hallway, the contrast was stark - cheerful voices downstairs, but multiple pairs of eyes watching their every move from below.
###Chapter 219

Liam stepped closer to Evelyn, his voice dropping to a whisper. "You're still here?"

She forced a calm expression. "I left and came back."

"Forgot something?" His gaze flickered to the nightstand where her book lay.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. This man infuriated her, yet some inexplicable pull kept drawing her back. "Not the book," she snapped.

"Hmm." Liam appeared composed, but beneath that military discipline, turmoil churned in his chest.

Summoning courage, she asked, "Are you staying home or returning to base?"

His brow furrowed. "Why do you ask?"

Evidence. She needed proof of his affair with Victoria. Getting closer would make it easier. "I want to come with you," Evelyn declared.

Liam stilled, studying her with sudden intensity. This abrupt shift in her demeanor sent an unexpected warmth through him. He swallowed hard. "Not returning to base yet. Just getting water."

She stepped aside with exaggerated politeness. "After you."

The gesture felt painfully unnatural. Moments ago she'd stormed out after their argument. What game was she playing?

Liam passed her cautiously, glancing back as she disappeared into their bedroom.

"Liam!" Eleanor called from the living room as he descended. He paused for water before joining his family.

Evelyn noted Isabella's improved attitude - undoubtedly because Liam was home.

Dinner passed pleasantly. Garden lights twinkled beneath a chorus of cicadas as Evelyn settled on the balcony wicker chair. Palms cradling her chin, she counted sparse stars, savoring temporary peace.

His confession haunted her. "I want to be with you." That voice, rich with emotion, played on loop in her mind. She couldn't afford to fall for this man - not when she knew about Victoria.

The bedroom door clicked open. Liam entered, setting his watch on the nightstand. His gaze never left her, as if she might vanish from the balcony.

Evelyn's attention locked onto his phone - surely evidence lurked in those messages and photos. She closed the balcony door, leaning against the curtains. "Shower?"

"Yes." He collected pajamas from the walk-in closet.

The bathroom door shut. Evelyn pounced on his phone. Locked. Fingerprint required. Defeated, she tossed it back and grabbed a book instead.

Ten minutes later, the shower stopped. Liam emerged, the scent of sandalwood soap preceding him. The mattress dipped as he settled beside her.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her book. Every nerve stood alert, though she pretended absorption in the text. His proximity electrified the air between them.
###Chapter 220

Evelyn couldn't understand why her heart raced so violently at the thought of sharing a bed with him. They'd slept beside each other before.

Liam noticed her stiff posture and chose to give her space. He mirrored her position, propping himself against the headboard with a book in hand.

The bedroom settled into a comfortable silence. Harsh overhead lights illuminated the space as both pretended to focus on their reading.

Though their eyes scanned pages, their senses remained hyper-aware of each other's every breath and movement. The sound of turning pages echoed unnaturally loud in the tense atmosphere.

Evelyn finally broke under the pressure. She lifted her gaze just as Liam looked up from his book. Their eyes locked, sending her pulse into overdrive.

"Why isn't he reading?" she wondered, her fingers tightening around her book's spine.

He quickly averted his gaze, feigning sudden interest in his novel.

"Are you... going to sleep soon?" Her voice cracked slightly.

"Yeah."

He snapped his book shut and placed it on the nightstand. With a click of the remote, darkness swallowed the room as he slid beneath the covers.

Evelyn followed suit, turning her back to him as she settled in.

Minutes later, his deep voice rumbled through the darkness. "Should we talk?"

Liam had always been a man of few words. Romance didn't come naturally to him, nor did expressing emotions. He hoped conversation might bridge the growing distance between them.

"It's fine. I'm tired." Her reply came clipped and final.

He exhaled quietly before turning to study her silhouette in the dim light. Desire burned through him - the woman he'd loved for two decades lay beside him as his wife, yet remained untouchable.

Even a simple embrace might send her recoiling in disgust. The thought paralyzed him.

His mind raced. Despite her memory loss, she still adored his grandmother and admired Alexander just as before. Only memories of him had vanished completely.

"Did I leave no impression at all?" The question haunted him.

Hours crawled by in painful silence. Finally, Evelyn's whisper cut through the darkness. "Liam? Are you asleep?"

He remained perfectly still.

Satisfied he slept, she moved with exaggerated care, reaching for his phone on the nightstand. Holding her breath, she pressed his thumb to the biometric sensor.

She knew it was wrong, but desperation had stripped away her morals.

The screen unlocked. She ducked under the covers, illuminating her face with the dim glow.

Liam opened his eyes, watching the suspicious lump in the blankets. Had she been checking his phone out of jealousy, it might have pleased him. But he knew the truth - she'd only returned to his side to gather evidence for their divorce.

The knowledge sat like a boulder on his chest, making each breath an effort.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn had hoped to find damning evidence on Liam's phone, but all she uncovered were classified blueprints of experimental military tech.

Scrolling through his messages, she noticed Victoria had been blocked weeks ago. Yet his contacts still listed her under "Victoria Dawson."

Wrapped in the silk sheets, Evelyn exhaled in frustration at the dead end. Then her breath caught - her own contact name flashed "Sweetheart" in bold letters.

Her pulse skyrocketed as she verified the affectionate title wasn't a mistake. The phone trembled against her chest where her heart threatened to break free.

She replaced it with exaggerated care, oblivious to Liam's lashes fluttering open at her movements.

The scent of Evelyn's jasmine perfume hit Liam's senses like a physical blow. He forced his breathing steady, watching through slitted eyes as she settled back onto the mattress.

Moonlight painted silver streaks across Evelyn's sleeping form when he finally dared look. So close, yet separated by invisible barriers no armor could breach.

Adjusting the thermostat with silent precision, Liam draped his blanket over her shoulders. The room's temperature plummeted in response.

Shivering, Evelyn instinctively sought warmth, curling into Liam's radiating heat like a flower turning toward sunlight.

He couldn't resist brushing a stray lock from her forehead, lips ghosting over her skin. The gesture dissolved months of carefully constructed walls.

Then everything shattered.

Evelyn's wandering hand slipped beneath his shirt, fingers tracing the ridges of his abdomen with sleep-softened curiosity. Her palm flattened against his pounding heart.

Liam turned to stone. Every muscle locked in torturous restraint as her touch set his nerves ablaze.

He counted backward from one hundred, gripping the sheets until his knuckles whitened. The war between propriety and desire raged until dawn painted the room in pale gold.

Morning brought Evelyn awake with a gasp, fragments of scandalous dreams clinging like cobwebs. Reality proved worse - her body molded against Liam's, hand splayed possessively over his chest.

Mortification turned her veins to ice. She willed her traitorous limbs to retreat, praying his steady breathing meant he slept through her indiscretion.

As her fingers skimmed downward, iron strength clamped around her wrist. Liam guided her palm lower, pressing it against the evidence of his own restless night.

The silent accusation burned hotter than any words.
###Chapter 222

Evelyn gasped as her fingers accidentally brushed against Liam's bare chest.

With his eyes still closed, Liam murmured sleepily, "Exploring so early in the morning, darling?"

"I-I wasn't!" Evelyn's voice hitched as she quickly withdrew her hand, her cheeks flaming.

She bit her lip, terrified he might interpret her stammering as a confession.

"Then what were you thinking about?" he asked without opening his eyes.

Her mind went completely blank. The way their bodies were tangled together under the sheets made her pulse race uncontrollably.

After an awkward pause, she whispered, "Sorry!"

A deep chuckle rumbled through his chest. "No need to apologize to your own husband."

"But I didn't—" Her protest died in her throat as her heart hammered violently.

Liam captured her wandering hand and guided it slowly up his sculpted abdomen to his broad chest. "Touch me whenever you want," he said huskily. "No explanations needed."

Her fingertips tingled as they traced the hard planes of his muscles. The sensation was intoxicating - equal parts thrilling and terrifying.

His skin burned beneath her touch, his breathing growing uneven.

"P-Please stop," she begged weakly, but he pressed her palm firmly against his pounding heart.

The air between them grew thick with tension. When he finally opened his eyes, the smoldering look he gave her sent shivers down her spine.

Unable to withstand the intensity of his gaze, she averted her eyes, her entire face burning.

"How do you like what you feel?" His whisper against her ear made her toes curl.

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood before giving a tiny nod. Her fingers unconsciously flexed against his chest, savoring the feel of him.

"Next time, just ask," he teased. "No need to sneak touches while I'm asleep."

Her mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

"I didn't touch you!" The weak protest sounded pathetic even to her own ears.

Liam released her hand only to snake his arm around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

Evelyn froze when she felt his hardened length press against her thigh. Every inch of her skin felt like it was on fire.

"I'm not divorcing you," he growled. "And this marriage won't be just on paper anymore. Be prepared to fulfill all your wifely duties from now on."

Wifely duties? Her heart threatened to burst from her chest. A confusing mix of fear, anticipation, and something dangerously close to desire swirled in her stomach.

This morning had taken a surreal turn. Instead of finding evidence of his supposed affair, she'd somehow ended up in this compromising position.

With a desperate effort, she wriggled out of his embrace and scooted to the far edge of the bed. "Don't touch me," she muttered, though the words lacked conviction.

The sheets rustled as Liam shifted closer. "Too late for that, Mrs. Blackwood."
###Chapter 223

The light in Liam's eyes dimmed as disappointment washed over him. Evelyn caught the shift in his expression, and a pang of guilt twisted in her chest.

Yet that guilt evaporated the moment she remembered his entanglement with Victoria. Besides, she had no intention of revealing her true identity—or lack thereof—to anyone, including Liam.

Clutching the sheets, she sat up abruptly and raked fingers through her tangled hair. "I refuse to waste my life on a cheating bastard like you."

He mirrored her movement, sitting up with a heavy sigh. Running both hands through his dark locks, he exhaled slowly before speaking. "That's the second time you've called me that. At least tell me why."

Her fingers tightened around the blanket's edge as she avoided his gaze. The silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

"I can't fix what I don't understand," he pressed, voice rough with frustration.

A strange calm settled over her. "You're still in love with your childhood sweetheart."

His head snapped up. "You are my first love."

The words hit her like a physical blow. She blinked rapidly before scoffing. "Don't be ridiculous."

Liam's piercing gaze never wavered. "That's a poor excuse. Give me something concrete."

"When you were injured," she spat, "you demanded Victoria stay with you—even when I was right there!"

"That was strictly professional!" he interrupted. "She was consulting on the Norvanian military case."

His excuses only fueled her anger. "And the embrace in your hospital room? Was that professional too?"

Understanding dawned across his features. So this was the root of her sudden coldness—the reason she'd vanished and now demanded divorce papers.

Liam exhaled sharply. "She threw herself at me. You saw that?"

Evelyn turned away, tears pricking her eyes. Men and their convenient excuses.

"There's surveillance footage," he offered. "I'll have security pull it."

"I don't want to see it," she muttered into her knees.

"Then don't accuse me without evidence." His voice dropped. "If you doubt me, at least give me the chance to prove my innocence."

She curled tighter into herself, fingers twisting the sheets. "I gave you one last chance," she whispered. "At the lake."

The memory flashed between them—Liam choosing to save Victoria while Evelyn nearly drowned. That moment, followed by the hospital embrace, had shattered whatever fragile hope remained.

A migraine pulsed behind Liam's temples as he collapsed backward onto the mattress. Emotional confrontations weren't his forte; comforting distraught women even less so.

Not only had Evelyn lost all memory of their past, she'd lost all trust in him. Every explanation fell on deaf ears. Was she determined to believe the worst?

Draping an arm over his eyes, he voiced the question haunting him: "Why did you marry me in the first place?"

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken answers.

"Was I just... convenient?" His voice cracked. "A stable military man to depend on until you realized I couldn't measure up to whatever fantasy you'd imagined?"

The bed dipped as he turned away, the space between them suddenly vast.
###Chapter 224

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her throat tightening with unspoken words as she shook her head in distress.

"Is that your final answer?" Liam's whisper carried a wounded edge, his voice barely audible.

A sob escaped Evelyn's lips as she finally forced out the word, "No."

His hands fell away from her as his misty eyes blinked open. Pushing off the bed, he turned his back to her, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

"Whatever's going through that mind of yours," he stated coldly, "never mention divorce again. That's not an option."

He continued without turning, "If there's something I need to improve, tell me directly. I'll change anything for you - except who I am at my core."

"Be honest with me," he demanded, his voice like steel. "Don't make me guess your thoughts because I can't read your damn mind."

With those final words, he strode toward the bathroom, leaving her trembling on the bed. She wiped at her tears with shaking fingers, swallowing back the lump in her throat.

Truthfully, Liam terrified her when he wore that icy expression. His words had struck like physical blows. Even drowning in hurt and injustice, she didn't dare challenge him when he was like this.

Yet as the bathroom door clicked shut, anger at her own weakness flared hot in her chest.

Storming to the bathroom door, she pressed her palm against the wood and declared, "I want a written promise. Swear you'll cut all ties with Victoria Dawson."

"Or you'll grant my divorce request without conditions next time." Her voice wavered on the dreaded word, her pulse hammering.

Having made her demand, she fled to the dressing room, her hands fumbling with the buttons of her nightgown.

When Liam emerged from the bathroom, steam curling around his damp frame, he found the dressing room door firmly closed.

Without hesitation, he retrieved pen and paper from the nightstand and settled into the wicker chair on the balcony. The scratching of pen against paper filled the morning air.

Evelyn emerged later, her hair neatly braided, wearing a simple linen dress. At the same moment, Liam reentered from the balcony, extending a folded sheet toward her.

She unfolded it with careful fingers. The heading read: "Binding Agreement."

"I, Liam Blackwood, solemnly vow to my wife Evelyn Carter that I shall remain faithful to our marriage. Should I ever betray this oath, I will not contest any divorce proceedings initiated by her."

Her eyes flicked up. "I'm not 'Chubs'," she corrected pointedly.

A ghost of amusement touched his lips. "Grandmother calls you that."

He wasn't wrong. She studied the document again, tracing the bold signature at the bottom.

Yet Liam remained distant, his usual reticence more pronounced than ever. Even his written promise was characteristically blunt and to the point.

Folding the paper carefully, she tucked it into her pocket, the weight of her grievances lifting. Once again, she'd surrendered her principles for him.

Since he'd complied with her demand, she softened. "Let's go down for breakfast," she offered quietly.

He stepped closer, studying her face. "You're not angry anymore?"

She nodded, avoiding his piercing gaze. "We should go before the food gets cold."

As she turned toward the door, his arm shot out, catching her waist. In one fluid motion, he pinned her against the wall, caging her between his arms.

Her breath hitched as she stared up at him, wide-eyed. "Liam, what—"

His heated gaze dropped to her lips. "I want to kiss my wife," he murmured roughly.

Before she could protest, his mouth crashed down on hers in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

"Mmph!" The startled sound was swallowed by his demanding lips as he kissed her with barely restrained intensity.
###Chapter 225

Liam poured years of pent-up longing into that searing kiss. His lips claimed Evelyn's with possessive intensity.

Evelyn's mind went blank under the assault. She could only feel - the heat of his mouth, the press of his body pinning her against the wall, the way time seemed to stop.

When they finally broke apart, she followed him downstairs in a daze, her lips still tingling.

The Blackwood family was already gathered for breakfast. Eleanor's curious voice broke the silence. "Evelyn, what did Ms. Wright want with you yesterday?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

She hesitated briefly before answering. "Nothing important." Then she focused on her plate, clearly unwilling to elaborate.

Isabella scoffed. "Please. Women like Margaret Wright only deal in threats or bribes." She smirked. "Probably wanted to pay you off to leave Liam for her precious granddaughter."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her fork. "You're quite the mind reader, Isabella."

Liam continued eating silently, but his expression darkened.

Cassandra, ever the gossip, leaned forward eagerly. "How much did she offer you?"

Evelyn shrugged. "She said I could name my price."

Cassandra gasped. "You didn't accept?" She caught Liam's glare and quickly added, "I mean, it's admirable you resisted temptation."

Evelyn ignored her.

The tension at the table grew palpable as everyone watched Liam's reaction.

Only Isabella dared to continue. "Not that it matters. Without Liam's consent, she couldn't leave this marriage even if she wanted the money." She smirked. "I overheard them discussing divorce last night."

Shocked glances flew between family members. Their expressions clearly accused Evelyn of being a gold digger.

"Evelyn, is this true?" Eleanor asked nervously.

Cassandra gasped. "You'd really choose money over Liam?"

Isabella looked triumphantly at Liam. "You shouldn't waste your power keeping this gold digger. She's not worth it."

Evelyn set down her utensils with deliberate calm, though her knuckles were white. The appetite had left her.

Before she could respond, Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Isabella Sinclair, you've crossed a line eavesdropping on private conversations!"

The entire table froze under his fury. Even Sebastian didn't dare defend his wife.

Isabella, incensed by Liam defending Evelyn, snapped back. "I'm not the one crossing lines here! Unlike your sham of a marriage!"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

Evelyn looked stunned. The others exchanged glances, their expressions suggesting they found Isabella's claim believable given Evelyn's background.

Sebastian grabbed his wife's arm in panic. "What nonsense are you spouting? Apologize now!"

Isabella shook him off defiantly. "Tell me I'm wrong, Liam."

Liam said nothing. Instead, he pulled out his phone and dialed a number, his expression terrifyingly calm.
###Chapter 226

OWN

Liam's voice cut through the tense silence like a blade. "Deploy two search teams to Blackwood Manor immediately."

Isabella's face drained of color as she stared at him in disbelief.

The dining table erupted into hushed whispers.

"Why search the house?"

"We're family, Liam. What is this about?"

"This is completely unnecessary."

Liam ignored them. His expression remained unreadable as he pushed back from the table and strode toward the living room, settling onto the couch with an air of unshakable authority.

A suffocating tension filled the room, making everyone shift uncomfortably. It felt like the calm before a storm—one that would tear the family apart.

Evelyn glanced between Liam and the others, her stomach twisting with unease.

Under Richard and Eleanor's insistence, the Blackwoods had been forced to live together under one roof. On the surface, they maintained civility, but beneath it all, resentment simmered.

Within minutes, Ryan arrived with six military investigators, their gear professional and intimidating.

"General Blackwood, the teams are ready."

Liam lounged on the couch, his fingers tapping idly against his chin. The casual gesture did nothing to soften the weight of his presence.

The family abandoned their meals and gathered in the living room, watching as the investigators dispersed toward their private quarters.

Panicked, Isabella dug her nails into Sebastian's hand.

Sebastian couldn't stand it. He stepped forward, defiance burning in his eyes. "Liam, you don’t own this place! What gives you the right to invade our privacy? Did you even ask for our permission? What the hell are you trying to prove?"

Liam lifted a brow, his cold gaze locking onto his brother. The contrast between Sebastian's righteous anger and Liam's chilling calm was stark.

His voice was slow, deliberate. "You should pray they find nothing. Otherwise, you'll be dealing with more than just my displeasure."

Sebastian scoffed. "Why should I be worried? I just can’t stand your arrogance! Do you even care about this family?"

Liam didn’t dignify that with a response.

Richard and Eleanor joined in, chastising Liam for his high-handedness. They called it excessive, disrespectful.

Liam remained unmoved.

Then Ryan rushed back downstairs, urgency in his steps. "General Blackwood—we found something."

All eyes snapped to him. When Ryan placed miniature listening devices and hidden cameras on the coffee table, the room erupted in shock.

Richard shot to his feet, jabbing a finger at the devices. "Where were these? Who planted them?"

Ryan's voice was grim. "All were found in your and Madam Blackwood’s bedroom."

Evelyn covered her mouth, her chest tightening with betrayal. This was supposed to be her sanctuary. Now, it had been violated.

The room exploded into outrage.

And in that moment, every accusing glare turned toward Isabella.
###Chapter 227

"If it wasn't you, then who could it possibly be?" Cassandra countered, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Besides, everyone knows how obsessed you were with Liam back in the day."

Isabella's face darkened at Cassandra's words, the tension between them thickening like storm clouds.

Sebastian struggled to keep his voice steady as he asked, "Isabella, tell me the truth. Did you do this?"

"Of course not!" Isabella's defiance was immediate. Her eyes flashed with hurt. "Even you're doubting me now?"

Sebastian's frustration boiled over. "Then why were you panicking when the security team arrived? And how did you know about Liam and Evelyn's arrangement?"

Tears sprang to Isabella's eyes as she screamed, "If you don't trust me, maybe we should just end this marriage right now!"

The argument was cut short when Richard slammed his fist on the coffee table with a thunderous crash. "Enough!"

Silence fell over the Blackwood living room.

Evelyn flinched at the sudden noise, her anxious gaze darting to Richard.

Taking a deep breath, Richard turned to Liam with measured calm. "Son, how do you propose we handle this... situation?"

Liam's expression remained unreadable, his military bearing evident in his straight posture. "We identify who violated our privacy, then pursue legal action."

Eleanor gasped, clutching her pearls. "Liam darling, we're family! We can't involve the law - think of the scandal! Someone could go to prison!"

Richard nodded in agreement. "Your mother's right. Since no real harm was done, can't we just let this go? For the sake of family harmony?"

Evelyn stared at them in disbelief. No harm? Their most private moments could have been recorded. She shuddered at the thought of changing clothes in what she'd believed was the safety of their bedroom.

Liam wordlessly gathered the surveillance equipment from the table, handing it to Ryan with deliberate movements.

Eleanor reached for her son's arm with trembling fingers. "Please, Liam. For me? Let's just move forward and make sure it never happens again."

Her pleading gaze shifted to Isabella, who scoffed loudly. "Why are you looking at me like that? I told you I didn't plant those cameras!"

Cassandra couldn't resist interjecting. "Then why did you know about Liam and Evelyn's fake marriage before anyone else? And why were you sweating bullets when security showed up?"

Isabella's eyes darted nervously. "Well, that's..." She swallowed hard before pointing an accusing finger at Maxwell and Penelope, who had been observing quietly. "Why single me out? They're just as suspicious!"

Maxwell and Penelope exchanged startled looks. "What does this have to do with us?"

Isabella's voice rose defensively. "Everyone's a suspect! For all we know, it could have been an outsider. Remember when Victoria stayed over last month? She's practically obsessed with Liam - maybe she's behind this!"

The room fell into thoughtful silence as the family considered this possibility.

Liam stood abruptly, his commanding presence silencing the room. "This investigation will continue."

Eleanor tried one last plea. "Liam, is this really necessary?"

Meeting his mother's gaze steadily, Liam replied, "Don't concern yourself with this matter, Mother. Evelyn and I will be moving out temporarily. Once the truth comes to light, we'll decide our next steps."

No one dared to object to the military commander's decision.
###Chapter 228

Liam approached Evelyn with quiet determination, his fingers intertwining with hers. "Come live with me at Blackwood Manor," he murmured.

Evelyn's head bobbed eagerly. Absolutely she would. This house, these people... A shiver ran down her spine wondering who among them could be the traitor.

"Go pack your essentials," Liam instructed gently.

"Right away," Evelyn breathed before darting upstairs.

The living room sat heavy with unspoken tension, every family member wearing identical grim expressions.

Liam lifted Evelyn's luggage. After exchanging stiff farewells, they departed the Blackwood estate.

Once settled in the car, Evelyn tilted her head. "Where exactly are we going?"

Liam reclined against the leather seat, his molten gaze tracing her curious expression. "Blackwood Manor. Will that be acceptable?"

Blackwood Manor?

The name sent an uncomfortable twinge through Evelyn's chest. That estate had been custom-built for Victoria, every detail tailored to her exact preferences.

But circumstances left no room for sentimentality.

She couldn't return to the main house, and asking Liam to arrange new accommodations would be unreasonable.

"That's fine," Evelyn answered with forced brightness.

Liam's eyes softened. Unable to resist, he reached out to tuck a stray lock behind her ear.

The intimate gesture made Evelyn's cheeks flush. She cleared her throat. "But... could your security team sweep the manor first?"

Liam stilled.

"Even though Isabella clearly dislikes me," Evelyn hurried to explain, "I don't believe she'd go that far."

Liam's brow furrowed. "Who told you Isabella had feelings for me?"

"Cassandra."

An exasperated smile tugged at Liam's lips. "And you believed her?"

"I've seen it myself. The way she looks at you explains her hostility toward me," Evelyn insisted.

Liam's lips pressed into a thin line. He turned toward the window, his profile hardening into that intimidating mask that kept most people at bay.

Evelyn studied his rigid posture before gathering courage. She leaned across the console, pressing against his arm. "Even Victoria was obsessed with you. Did you ever suspect her?"

The contact sent electricity through Liam. His muscles tensed as his gaze dropped to where her body met his.

His pulse jumped. That familiar warmth flickered in his eyes as he rasped, "Everyone remains under investigation."

"Even Blackwood Manor?"

"Naturally."

"Good." Evelyn exhaled in relief, beginning to pull away.

An inexplicable emptiness filled Liam's chest. "Little Sparrow," he murmured.

Evelyn blinked. "Since when do you call me that?"

"It suits you better. Helps establish intimacy." His thumb brushed her knuckles.

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she ducked her head. "Oh."

Liam studied her delicate features, fighting the urge to trace the blush spreading across her cheeks. "There's nothing between Isabella and me. Don't let your imagination run wild."

The earnestness in his voice made Evelyn's heart flutter. For the first time, this all felt startlingly real.
###Chapter 229

Forty minutes later, the car pulled up at the grand gates of Blackwood Manor. Evelyn stepped out behind Liam, her fingers nervously clutching the hem of her blouse as they entered the lavish living room.

They had barely taken their seats when Ryan rushed in, his hands trembling around a dozen listening devices. His face was ashen, eyes burning with barely contained fury. "General Blackwood, you need to see this."

Liam's brow furrowed as he examined the pile of surveillance equipment. His expression darkened like a gathering storm, the temperature in the room seeming to drop several degrees.

Evelyn gasped, her gaze darting between Ryan and Liam in confusion. The air grew thick with tension.

The security team conducted a thorough sweep of the entire estate, including the gardens and basement. After reporting their findings to Liam, they departed swiftly.

"Who would do this?" Evelyn demanded, her voice shaking.

Ryan shifted uncomfortably, while Liam merely smirked, his silence more unsettling than any answer.

Evelyn's mind raced. Liam and Harrison had discussed confidential matters here. When Project Aurora was compromised, she'd been the prime suspect.

Now the realization made her stomach churn with guilt for ever doubting him.

Liam's jaw tightened with barely restrained anger. He knew exactly who was responsible, but revealing his hand now would jeopardize everything.

Seeing Liam lost in thought, Evelyn pressed, "Could it be Victoria?"

Liam's gaze turned inscrutable as he leaned closer. "Cassandra," he murmured, using her childhood nickname, "you must pretend you know nothing. No questions. No investigations."

"But why?"

Liam cupped her face gently. "Just trust me on this."

Evelyn hesitated. "Is she so obsessed with you that she's lost her mind?"

"This isn't about love," Liam said firmly. Turning to Ryan, he ordered, "Destroy these."

"Yes, General Blackwood."

"And proceed as we discussed."

Ryan nodded sharply before exiting with the incriminating devices.

The grand living room fell silent, leaving only Evelyn and Liam amidst the opulent furnishings.

Evelyn glanced around, noting how unchanged everything appeared. Yet everything felt different now - the air charged with unspoken tension.

When her wandering gaze met Liam's, the intensity in his dark eyes sent heat rushing to her cheeks. Her pulse quickened, and she hastily looked away.

Since when had his gaze become so... consuming? Those smoldering looks made her feel exposed, vulnerable to emotions she couldn't name.

Liam chuckled at her flushed face. "Warm?"

Evelyn shook her head too quickly. "No."

Liam checked his watch - barely 10 AM. "Care to read?"

Evelyn eyed the leather-bound volumes lining the shelves and nodded.

"Choose one and join me in the study," Liam said, rising.

Evelyn stood awkwardly. "I'll stay here."

Liam's voice dropped to that low, irresistible tone. "I'd prefer your company."

Evelyn blinked, certain she'd misheard. Since when did the formidable General Blackwood request companionship?
###Chapter 230

A flicker of unease danced in Liam's steel-gray eyes, so fleeting most would miss it. "I have urgent matters in the study. You should rest."

Evelyn observed him silently. Behind that military commander's stoic mask, she detected the awkward tenderness of a man unaccustomed to vulnerability.

She drifted toward the mahogany bookshelf, fingers trailing across leather spines before selecting a novel. Pressing it to her chest, she turned with deliberate casualness.

Liam strode toward the study, Evelyn's soft footsteps echoing behind him.

Sunlight poured through floor-to-ceiling windows as they settled into their respective spaces - him behind the imposing oak desk, her curled on the velvet chaise. The companionable silence wrapped around them like a cashmere shawl.

A spring breeze carried the scent of jasmine from the balcony, mingling with the rich aroma of aged paper and leather-bound books.

Every few minutes, Liam's gaze would lift involuntarily, drawn to the way sunlight gilded Evelyn's auburn hair. Just as it had ten years ago. She remained his most captivating distraction.

He memorized the way her lips parted slightly when engrossed in reading, the delicate flush painting her cheekbones. His fingers twitched with the need to trace that rosy warmth.

Some things never changed.

Liam exhaled softly, marveling at Margaret's wisdom. Science could be manipulated, but a grandmother's intuition never erred.

"Little Sparrow."

Evelyn startled, blinking up with wide amber eyes. "Yes?"

"Are you bored?"

She shook her head, silken strands catching the light. "Not at all."

"Would you like some refreshments?" He rose abruptly, the chair scraping against hardwood. "I'll prepare fruit."

Before she could protest, he'd vanished through the arched doorway. Evelyn stared after him, bemused.

Minutes later, Liam returned bearing a crystal bowl of meticulously sliced tropical fruits. He placed it on the low table before settling beside her - closer than propriety allowed.

Evelyn's breath hitched as his thigh brushed hers. She focused intently on the glistening mango cubes, avoiding his gaze.

"Eat," he commanded softly.

Obediently, she speared a pineapple chunk, savoring the burst of sweetness. Between bites, she studied him through her lashes. Why had he gone to such trouble just to watch her eat? Had he finished his reports? And why did his intense scrutiny make her pulse flutter?

Their eyes locked suddenly. Evelyn swallowed hard. "Aren't you having any?"

Liam's lips curved, warmth softening his angular features. "They're all for you."

She popped a strawberry into her mouth, juice staining her lips. "Shouldn't you be working?"

Ignoring the question, he reached for her book. "What are you reading?"

Evelyn held up the thriller. "Random pick. Quite gripping actually."

He examined the dust jacket with disinterest before setting it aside. His attention remained fixed on her.

After several more bites, Evelyn reached for her novel. Liam's hand closed over hers abruptly.

Her breath caught as he leaned closer, his cedar-and-leather scent enveloping her. "Little Sparrow," he murmured, voice roughened, "come sit in my lap."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. This sudden tenderness from the famously reserved general left her dizzy. Before she could process the request, his other hand settled at her waist, drawing her inexorably toward him.
###Chapter 231

Evelyn found herself pulled onto Liam's muscular thigh. Her entire body stiffened as waves of nervousness crashed over her.

Liam's strong arm encircled her waist possessively. His other hand tangled in her silken strands, his smoldering gaze intensifying as he murmured against her ear, "Sweetheart, from now on, call me Liam or darling."

The endearment "darling" sent electric shocks down Evelyn's spine. Flustered, she ducked her head and whispered, "May I call you Liam?"

"Of course," he replied, his Adam's apple bobbing as he studied her delicate profile with rapt attention.

Evelyn twisted her fingers nervously. "Liam, you don't have to force physical closeness. We can take things slowly."

Liam moistened his lips. His elegant fingers traced the curve of her cheek, threading through her hair until they found her burning earlobes. Cradling the back of her head, he breathed in that dangerously low voice, "I'm not forcing anything."

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. Her breathing turned erratic.

As Liam's lips descended, his warm breath fanned across her skin, making her pulse race and limbs weaken. Though terrified, she secretly yearned for his kiss.

The first brush of his lips was featherlight before he deepened the contact. His teasing movements left Evelyn powerless to resist. Her hands fluttered weakly to his broad shoulders as she surrendered to his embrace.

Unlike his previous passionate assaults, this time Liam was tender yet provocative, guiding her through each new sensation with deliberate care.

Evelyn drowned in the intoxicating rhythm of his kisses. The study's atmosphere grew thick with desire.

Their ragged breaths mingled.

A soft whimper escaped Evelyn's lips, fueling the growing fire between them.

Liam traced kisses along her jaw before finding her sensitive earlobe. When his warm breath ghosted over it, her entire body shuddered.

She tried squirming away, but Liam's iron grip held her captive. "Sweetheart," he murmured against her ear.

Evelyn's response came as a breathless sigh. To her surprise, he made no further advances, simply allowing her to rest her head against his shoulder.

Eyes closed, he stroked her hair tenderly, whispering her nickname like a sacred prayer.

Pressed against his solid chest, Evelyn inhaled deeply, savoring the security of his embrace.

Each whispered endearment carried profound affection, as if he cherished something precious yet fragile.

Gradually, Evelyn surrendered to his devotion, adapting to his passionate gestures. The air between them burned with restrained desire.

She realized he was deliberately holding back - whether from respect or poor timing, she couldn't tell.

Only later that night did Evelyn understand it was sheer willpower restraining him.

For though Liam claimed every opportunity to leave her breathless with searing kisses, he never demanded more. Yet his addiction to her lips became undeniable, stealing her breath and sanity with each intoxicating encounter.
###Chapter 232

The morning sun streamed through the windows as Liam moved about the kitchen, the scent of freshly brewed coffee filling the air.

Evelyn lounged on the living room sofa, her fingers absently scrolling through social media updates.

A sudden vibration startled her. An unknown number flashed across her screen.

She hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

The voice that responded made her blood run cold. "Ms. Carter, surely you remember this old woman?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. She cast a nervous glance toward the kitchen before whispering, "Madam Hoffis... is everything alright?"

"I simply wished to inquire whether you and Liam have finalized your divorce yet."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "I'm afraid we've decided against divorce, Madam Hoffis."

Dead silence. Then a sharp intake of breath. Evelyn rushed to explain, "Liam refused to sign the papers. I thought... perhaps we could make this work."

"Liam refused?" The laugh that followed was bitter. "You expect me to believe that?"

"I'm telling the truth. I won't bring it up again."

"You're the most despicable creature I've ever encountered!" The venom in Margaret's voice made Evelyn flinch. "Do you have any idea what you've done? Torn apart two people who've loved each other for decades!"

Evelyn remained silent, her nails digging into her palm.

"Let me remind you - Liam has adored my Victoria for twenty years! Twenty!"

The words struck like physical blows. "And you - some gutter-born tramp with a face full of silicone - you think you can compare to my granddaughter? You're not even fit to lick her shoes!"

Enough. Evelyn's voice shook with restrained fury. "First, I've never had plastic surgery. This is my natural face."

She continued through gritted teeth, "Second, as a high-ranking Aldenrian general, Liam's marital status affects his career. I can't divorce him unless he agrees."

"Third," her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, "don't you dare call me conniving when your precious Victoria tried to buy me off. My husband provides quite adequately."

"Finally, we have nothing more to discuss." Evelyn ended the call with trembling fingers, her chest heaving.

The phone rang again instantly. Margaret's number.

Evelyn took three steadying breaths before answering. "Was I unclear?"

"How dare you hang up on me, you little slut!" The shriek made Evelyn hold the phone away from her ear.

"I've investigated you thoroughly," Margaret spat. "Do you really think some back-alley whore can compete with my Victoria? Mark my words - you'll regret this!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to retort when the phone was plucked from her grasp.

Liam's voice cut through the tension like steel. "Madam Hoffis, you're mistaken about the situation. I'd advise against making threats."

"Nate!" Margaret's tone turned pleading. "Tell me - what does that worthless tramp have that my Victoria lacks?"

The question hung in the air as Evelyn watched Liam's jaw tighten. His next words came slow and deliberate.

"Everything."
###Chapter 233

Liam's face darkened with an intensity Evelyn had never seen before. He shot her a quick glance before turning away, his voice sharp as he spoke into the phone. "Madam Hoffis, Evelyn is my wife. You will mind your language."

As Liam stormed out, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa, grabbing a cushion and hurling it across the room with frustration.

First Victoria, now her grandmother? Was every wealthy person in this family determined to make her life miserable?

Evelyn had always assumed the rich were simply accustomed to getting their way.

When Liam returned, he placed his phone on the table with deliberate calm. "Don't let her harsh words affect you."

Evelyn looked up at him. After three years of enduring similar treatment, she'd built up immunity to such remarks. What truly mattered now was Liam's reaction.

"Are you defending Victoria or Madam Hoffis?" Evelyn asked, unable to keep the bitterness from her voice.

Liam sensed her displeasure immediately. After a thoughtful pause, he responded, "Neither."

"That woman may appear refined, but her actions are despicable. The way she spoke about me—"

Before Evelyn could finish, Liam sat beside her, his voice softening. "Cassandra, she's not being cruel. She simply loves her granddaughter too much. Try to understand."

"So I'm supposed to just accept it?" Evelyn felt Liam always prioritized the Hoffis family over her.

Even when Evelyn was clearly wronged, he urged forgiveness. A wave of sadness washed over her as she lowered her head with a sigh.

"Let's eat. Afterwards, I'll take you to the hospital," Liam said gently.

"The hospital?" Evelyn's head snapped up in alarm.

Unable to resist, Liam reached out, his fingers brushing through her long hair as he touched the back of her head. "Just a routine check-up for your head injury and memory condition."

Evelyn found herself lost in Liam's deep, mesmerizing eyes—so warm yet intense. She too longed to rediscover her true identity.

It suddenly struck her that she'd never undergone a comprehensive medical examination.

"Will you go?" Liam asked.

Evelyn nodded.

With a tender smile, Liam took her hand and led her to the dining table. "Don't stay angry at Madam Hoffis forever."

Evelyn responded with a bitter smile, remaining silent.

"You'll understand eventually," Liam added.

Three of the country's top neurologists gathered in the examination room. After reviewing Evelyn's medical records, they spent considerable time examining her head before exchanging concerned looks.

"Her amnesia wasn't accidental," one doctor finally said. "This was caused by deliberate damage to the brainstem."

Liam's expression turned stormy, his hands clenching into fists as he processed this revelation.

Evelyn stared at the doctors in shock. "Deliberate damage? Did someone perform brain surgery on me?"

"Not traditional surgery," the doctor clarified. "A minimally invasive procedure specifically targeting memory. The risks were enormous—one wrong move could have left you permanently paralyzed."

"But I'm perfectly healthy," Evelyn protested. "I just can't remember certain things. Whoever did this must have been an extraordinary surgeon."

"Is there any way to restore her memories quickly?" Liam interjected, his urgency surprising Evelyn.

The three doctors exchanged glances before shaking their heads helplessly.

Evelyn's face fell as she sighed. For three years, her past had remained frustratingly blank—as if those memories had never existed at all.
###Chapter 234

"Is there truly no alternative?" Liam's voice was tight with tension.

The neurologist adjusted his glasses. "There is one option. We could attempt surgical nerve repair to facilitate gradual memory recovery."

His colleague interjected, "But the risks are substantial. A single misstep could leave the patient in a permanent vegetative state. Given her current stable condition, we don't recommend taking that chance."

Evelyn turned to Liam, her fingers tightening around his sleeve. "Which surgeon in Aldenria would you trust with this procedure?"

Before the doctor could respond, Liam cut in sharply, "We're not doing it."

"Why not?" Evelyn's eyes flashed with frustration. The possibility of regaining her memories—however slim—felt worth the gamble.

Liam simply took her hand and thanked the medical team. With a firm grip, he led her out of the hospital.

The car ride to Blackwood Manor was silent, both lost in their thoughts as the city blurred past the windows. When they arrived, Liam didn't cut the engine.

"Go inside," he said softly, his knuckles whitening on the steering wheel. "There's something I need to handle. I'll return when it's done."

Evelyn nodded, stepping onto the gravel driveway. She watched his car disappear down the tree-lined road, wondering if this absence would stretch into days like before. The hollow ache in her chest lingered, but she squared her shoulders and walked inside.

Thirty minutes later, Liam's car screeched to a halt outside Wright Manor. He tore off his watch as he strode toward the entrance, Ryan Sullivan shadowing him closely.

Victoria Dawson leapt up from the sofa the moment he entered, her face lighting up. "Liam—"

Ryan moved like lightning, blocking her path. Liam didn't spare her a glance. His icy gaze swept the room. "Where's Julian?"

Victoria blinked. "Uncle Julian is upstairs. What's—"

"Get him down here. Now."

The command sent servants scattering. Two minutes later, Julian Whitmore descended the staircase, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses with a polished smile. "To what do we owe this unexpected—"

Liam's fist connected with his jaw before he could finish.

Julian crashed to the marble floor, blood streaking from his split lip. He barely had time to register the pain before Liam hauled him up by his silk tie and drove a knee into his abdomen. A choked groan escaped Julian as he crumpled again.

Victoria screamed, rushing forward. "Have you lost your mind?! You'll kill him!"

Ryan caught her wrist, his voice low. "Stay out of it."

Liam crouched beside Julian, gripping his collar. He yanked him close until their faces were inches apart. "Listen carefully," he hissed, each word a blade. "I'm letting you breathe today. But this mercy won't last."

Julian's glasses lay shattered on the floor, his breath ragged. Liam released him with a shove, turning on his heel without another word. The slam of the front door echoed through the manor like a gunshot.
###Chapter 235

Julian wiped the blood from his split lip with his thumb, his dark eyes gleaming with malicious amusement as he smirked up at Liam.

Liam's fists trembled at his sides, the knuckles already bruised from their earlier impact. With visible restraint, he shoved Julian backward onto the Persian rug.

After retrieving a monogrammed handkerchief from his pocket, Liam meticulously cleaned his hands as if erasing all traces of their confrontation.

Victoria blocked the study doorway, arms outstretched. "You can't just assault someone and walk away like nothing happened!" Her voice shook with indignation. "Explain yourself!"

Liam's gaze swept over her with undisguised revulsion. The woman before him bore no resemblance to the childhood friend he once cherished.

Turning sharply, he shouldered past her without a word, leaving Wright Manor behind in long, purposeful strides.

A sudden realization struck Victoria. She rushed to the antique desk and frantically activated the surveillance system - only to find every device offline.

Her knees buckled as she collapsed into the leather chair, face drained of color.

Moments later, Victoria found Julian in the parlor, wincing as he applied antiseptic to his injuries.

"Uncle Julian," she whispered urgently, dismissing the hovering housekeeper with a sharp gesture.

Her breathing came in shallow gasps. "Something's wrong. All our surveillance equipment has been disabled. Do you think Liam suspects us?"

Julian's derisive laughter sent chills down her spine. "You think he came here for a friendly chat?"

"Then what should we do?" Victoria wrung her hands.

"He has no concrete evidence," Julian scoffed, snapping the first aid kit shut. "If he did, you'd already be in handcuffs."

Victoria's lips curled in a smug smile. "Impossible. I was once the love of his life. He wouldn't dare arrest me, even if his feelings have changed."

Julian merely snorted in response.

After a tense silence, Victoria murmured, "The way he looked at me... it was different. Colder. Do you think he doubts my identity?"

"Of course he does," Julian said, rising to his full height. He regarded her with open contempt. "You and Cassandra are nothing alike. The comparison is laughable."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. "Then why haven't you eliminated her yet? She's Liam's wife now - you'll never have her!"

Julian's expression darkened dangerously. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Careful, Victoria. That sounded like a threat."

She swallowed hard but maintained her composure. "Mark my words - if you don't act, she'll destroy you when her memory returns."

"Everything you've worked for - the Wright fortune, your reputation - it will all be hers. You'll lose not just Cassandra, but your freedom. Your life."

Julian's eyes clouded with contemplation. Seizing the moment, Victoria suggested, "If killing her is too difficult... why not keep her?"

"Lock her away where only you can access her. Then you can have her however you want, for as long as you want."

A slow, sinister smile spread across Julian's face as he nodded in agreement.

As twilight descended, the gardens of Blackwood Manor glowed under the soft illumination of wrought-iron lanterns lining the cobblestone paths.

In the grand dining room, Evelyn rested her chin on folded hands, staring at the untouched meal before her. The silverware gleamed under the chandelier's light, the food long gone cold.

She debated calling Liam to inquire about his dinner plans, but hesitated. With a resigned sigh, she pushed the plate away.

This was her reality now - a military wife waiting alone more often than not. She needed to adjust her expectations.

The sound of the front door opening sent her rushing to the foyer. Her face lit up when she saw Liam's familiar silhouette crossing the threshold.
###Chapter 236

"Liam, you're home," Evelyn murmured softly. The moment Liam heard her voice, his pulse quickened. The way her lips curved into that gentle smile breathed life back into his weary soul.

He had always been devoted to Victoria. But the imposter had never stirred his heart the way Evelyn did.

Real love defied logic. It was pure, raw emotion - the kind that endured lifetimes without fading.

After shrugging off his coat, Liam crossed the room to where Evelyn stood. Without hesitation, he pulled her into his arms, holding her close against his chest.

Evelyn froze momentarily before melting into his embrace. The solid warmth of his body anchored her as his familiar cedarwood scent enveloped her senses.

Her heartbeat accelerated until she could hear it pounding in her ears. "What's this about?" she whispered against his shoulder.

"Just needed to hold you," Liam murmured. He pressed his lips to her forehead, fingers threading through her silken hair. "Long day."

Evelyn surrendered to the moment, letting his affection wash over her. The way he held her - so tender yet possessive - made her wonder if perhaps he'd finally fallen for her too.

Hesitantly, she slid her arms around his waist. "Have you eaten? I kept dinner warm."

Liam pulled back just enough to meet her gaze. "You waited for me?"

"I wanted us to eat together."

A soft smile touched his lips. "Don't skip meals on my account, sweetheart. Your health comes first."

Evelyn nodded, warmth blooming in her chest at the endearment. "Let me reheat everything."

As Liam started to release her, she caught his hand. "The staff can handle it. You should rest after your long day."

They moved to the sitting area, but before they could settle, Liam's phone rang. His expression darkened when he saw the caller ID. "Mother?"

Whatever Eleanor said transformed Liam's demeanor instantly. He stood abruptly, ending the call with clipped words.

Evelyn rose beside him, alarmed. "What's wrong?"

"Stay here. Eat, rest. I need to go out." His grip on her hand was almost painful.

Her stomach twisted with worry. She'd never seen him so agitated. "Tell me what's happening. I'm your wife."

Liam hesitated before answering. "It's Donovan."

"Donovan?" The name sent a jolt through her. The man who'd saved her from that hellish drug den. His return should be cause for celebration, yet Liam looked like he'd seen a ghost.

"What happened to him?" Dread pooled in Evelyn's stomach. She knew the risks undercover narcotics officers faced - they either came home heroes... or in body bags.

Liam shook his head. "Don't know yet. He's at Memorial Hospital."

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes. Donovan wasn't just Liam's brother - he'd risked everything to save her life. She tightened her grip on Liam's hand. "I'm coming with you."

Seeing her tears, Liam's resistance crumbled. Without another word, he led her to the car, their fingers still entwined as they raced toward the hospital.
###Chapter 237

The moment Evelyn Carter arrived at the hospital with Liam Blackwood, the ICU waiting area was already overflowing with Blackwood family members. Their expressions were grim, their shoulders heavy with unspoken dread.

Donovan Blackwood hadn't stepped foot in the family estate for five years. Now his return came at the brink of death.

Eleanor Blackwood had collapsed in hysterics outside the emergency room and had to be sedated in a private ward with IV fluids.

Earlier, Donovan had been delivered to the hospital by two plainclothes officers. Evelyn didn't need explanations to understand the gravity of the situation.

The surgery lasted over six grueling hours. It wasn't until dawn's first light that the lead surgeon finally emerged. The Blackwoods swarmed him immediately, desperate for news.

The surgeon's face was drawn with exhaustion. He removed his surgical cap with trembling hands. "We've done all we can. The patient remains in critical condition in the ICU. At this point, his survival depends entirely on his own will to live."

Richard Blackwood's knees buckled. Gregory Lynch caught him before he hit the floor. The patriarch's face turned ashen, decades of grief carving fresh lines across his weathered features.

Though the doctor's words offered a sliver of hope, everyone knew the odds were stacked impossibly against Donovan. The chances of him waking up were negligible at best.

Richard sank to his knees, pressing his forehead against the cold hospital tiles. Silent sobs wracked his broad frame. Evelyn had never witnessed the formidable Blackwood patriarch in such a broken state. Liam's brothers swallowed their own grief to comfort their father, their eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Evelyn and her sisters-in-law stood helplessly by, their hearts aching. All they could offer were silent prayers for Donovan's survival through this darkest night.

Liam remained eerily composed. After hearing the prognosis, he followed the medical team to the ICU viewing window.

Through the glass, Donovan lay motionless, his body a landscape of tubes and bandages. The heart monitor beeped erratically, its jagged lines mirroring the turmoil in Liam's chest.

Nurses moved like ghosts around the bed, constantly adjusting machines and checking vitals.

Liam stood frozen, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. Tears burned behind his eyes, but something darker simmered beneath - a rage so profound it threatened to consume him.

Donovan had secretly enrolled in the police academy against their parents' vehement objections. He'd refused every bribe, every threat, every ultimatum.

"I'm not afraid of dying," Donovan had told them that final night. "I'm only afraid of dying for nothing. Who will keep our family safe if everyone runs from danger?"

Two plainclothes officers approached Liam hesitantly. The older one extended a simple silver ring with trembling fingers. "We thought you should have this," he said hoarsely.

Liam's vision blurred as he took the bloodstained band. "This is Donovan's?"

The younger officer nodded, wiping his eyes. "Six days ago, when Donovan realized his cover was blown, he sent us one last message. Told us to retrieve this ring if...when we found him. Said to give it to his first love."

"We don't know who that might be," the older officer added. "Thought you'd know, being his brother. Maybe you could...fulfill that wish for him?"

Veins bulged along Liam's neck. His bloodshot eyes burned with homicidal fury. "Six days?" The words scraped from his throat like broken glass.

Both officers nodded, their professional composure crumbling. "Those animals kept him alive for six days," the younger one choked out. "They hung him from the ceiling and...God, the things they did..."

Liam couldn't bear another word. He spun and drove his fist into the concrete wall with a roar that echoed through the sterile hospital corridollars. The impact left his knuckles raw and bleeding, but he welcomed the pain - anything to distract from the images now seared into his mind.
###Chapter 238

Another officer broke down completely. He buried his face in his hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Death by gunfire would have been merciful compared to this torture. No one could fathom how Donovan had endured such unspeakable agony.

Liam stood motionless. Silent tears carved paths down his stony face as his fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. His entire frame trembled with barely contained emotion. He didn't remain at the hospital after the two narcotics officers departed.

Leaving Donovan's care to his remaining brothers and parents, Liam exited with Evelyn. She sensed his grief like a physical presence, so she simply held his hand during the silent drive home, offering wordless comfort.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Liam informed her he'd be occupied for several days. He suggested she rest while he retreated to his study to work.

That night, Evelyn slept alone. When she woke the next morning, the other side of the bed remained cold and untouched.

She found Liam still wearing yesterday's clothes, conducting an emergency meeting via video conference. Not wanting to interrupt, she quietly closed the study door.

For two days, Evelyn visited the hospital for updates on Donovan's condition. Each report was more devastating than the last.

On the third day, Liam returned to the military base to oversee a critical training exercise.

At precisely 4:00 pm, as Evelyn read in the parlor, the housekeeper approached. "Mrs. Blackwood, you might want to watch the live broadcast of the military drill."

"Drill?" Evelyn frowned in confusion.

"Mr. Sullivan asked me to remind you. General Blackwood wants you to see Aldenria's first aerial defense demonstration," the housekeeper explained.

Evelyn immediately set aside her book and turned to the specified channel. Her pulse quickened as the broadcast began.

The screen alternated between the command center and distant missile launch pads. This was being televised globally, but something felt... off.

Suddenly, the feed cut to panicked shouts in the command center. "General! System malfunction! The missile has deviated from its programmed trajectory!"

The world watched in shock as the missile struck the border between Aldenria and Valtoria.

While world leaders might have laughed at the embarrassment, Evelyn burst into tears.

The impact transformed an entire mountain into a smoldering crater. Nothing could have survived that blast zone.

It was the exact location where the Valtorian drug cartel had held Evelyn captive. Where Liam and Donovan had rescued her.

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face as she covered her mouth. This was no accident. It was a precision strike.

But Liam would face court-martial if President Pierce discovered his true intentions.

Her fingers hovered over her phone. She wanted to call him, but hesitated.

In the end, she didn't dial. He'd be swamped now - explaining this to both nations, facing international scrutiny.

Helpless with worry, Evelyn could only wait. She remained at home, watching the door, until dawn's light crept through the windows.
###Chapter 239

Evelyn Carter sat curled up on the living room sofa, absently stirring her morning coffee while scrolling through news updates on her phone. The headlines screamed about yesterday's disastrous missile strike along the Valtoria border.

Aldenria faced international condemnation, with reports from Valtorian media claiming hundreds of civilian casualties. Demands for compensation and formal apologies flooded diplomatic channels.

The Aldenrian government maintained the missile had veered off course, accidentally obliterating a major drug cartel stronghold along the border. Tons of narcotics and dozens of cartel leaders had been wiped out in the explosion.

Evelyn's fingers trembled against her phone screen as she read further.

Despite knowing the truth about the drug den's destruction, world leaders seemed determined to ignore the facts. Political tensions were being deliberately stoked instead.

"Mr. Blackwood, good morning," the housekeeper's voice suddenly announced.

Evelyn startled, nearly spilling her coffee. She hurried to the foyer, her bare feet silent on the marble floor.

Her breath caught when she saw Liam standing there, looking impossibly handsome yet visibly exhausted in his rumpled military uniform.

"Liam," she whispered, her voice cracking. Unbidden tears pricked at her eyes as she took in his haggard appearance.

Liam's tired face softened into a smile. He crossed the space between them in three strides, pulling her into a crushing embrace without a word. Evelyn melted into his arms, inhaling the familiar scent of sandalwood and gunpowder that clung to his uniform.

After a long moment, she tentatively wrapped her arms around his waist. "You look exhausted," she murmured against his chest. "Why don't you rest for a while?"

Liam simply shook his head, burying his face in the crook of her neck.

"Have you eaten? Should I make you breakfast?"

Another shake of his head. His arms tightened around her almost desperately, as if she were his only anchor in a storm. Evelyn felt him exhale shakily against her skin.

"Liam, do you—" she began, but he cut her off with a hoarse whisper. "Just let me hold you. I need this."

Her heart stuttered at his words. That this powerful man drew strength simply from holding her sent warmth flooding through her veins. She stood motionless, letting him take whatever comfort he needed.

Eventually, she coaxed him to a nearby café for a quick breakfast before leading him back to their bedroom. After a hot shower, he collapsed onto the mattress, pulling her down with him.

It was barely 9 AM. Evelyn had been awake less than two hours before finding herself back in bed. She hadn't expected Liam to fall asleep so quickly.

The dark circles under his eyes told their own story—clearly he hadn't slept properly in days. She lay still, watching the tension gradually leave his handsome features. Resisting the urge to smooth the worry lines from his forehead, she eventually drifted off herself.

When Evelyn awoke hours later, the space beside her was empty. The sheets were cold—Liam had been gone for some time.

She found him downstairs in the library, standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows with a glass of whiskey in hand. The golden afternoon light painted his profile in sharp relief.

"You're awake," he said without turning, as if he'd sensed her presence. His voice was rough with sleep and something darker.

Evelyn approached cautiously. "How long have you been up?"

"Long enough." He finally turned, his stormy gray eyes meeting hers. "We need to talk about what's coming."
###Chapter 240

Liam slid a leather bookmark between the pages before closing the novel with a soft thud. He set it down on the mahogany coffee table with deliberate care.

Evelyn's lips curved into a gentle smile. "You're awake? Shall I ask the kitchen staff to warm up some dinner for you?"

As she started to rise, Liam's arm snaked around her waist, pulling her back against him. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his breath warm against her skin. "Not hungry. Just stay with me."

She arched an eyebrow playfully. "What would you like to talk about, then?"

A heavy sigh escaped his lips. "How's Donovan doing?"

"Still in intensive care." Her fingers absently traced patterns on his forearm. "No improvement. The ventilator's doing most of the work for him now."

Liam reached into his pocket, producing a velvet ring box that clicked open with practiced ease. The diamond caught the light, scattering prismatic sparks across Evelyn's stunned face.

Her breath hitched. Six months of marriage, and this was the first time he'd offered her jewelry.

"This was something Donovan wanted his first love to have," Liam explained quietly, watching her reaction closely. "Before the accident."

The light in Evelyn's eyes dimmed instantly. Her hopeful smile dissolved into a tight line. "I see."

"I want him to give it to her himself." Liam pressed the ring into her palm, his fingers lingering against her skin. "When you visit tomorrow, have the doctors sterilize it. Then place it on his finger."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. This was Liam's way of giving his brother a reason to fight. She studied the simple platinum band with its modest diamond. "Are ICU patients even allowed to wear jewelry?"

"This meant everything to him." Liam's voice grew rough. "Before the crash, he never mentioned family. Only her."

Evelyn turned the ring over in her palm. Like Liam, Donovan seemed to be the sentimental type. The depth of his devotion moved her, even as it twisted the knife of Liam's lingering feelings for Victoria.

She extricated herself from his embrace. "About what happened at the Valtorian border... Has President Pierce taken any disciplinary action?"

"Don't worry about it." His jaw tightened. "Will Aldenria face consequences?"

"The international spotlight might cause some headaches," he admitted. "But nothing serious. It was an honest mistake, after all."

Evelyn's lips quirked at the diplomatic phrasing. At her skeptical look, Liam challenged, "You don't believe me?"

"Oh, I believe it was completely unintentional," she said sweetly, eyes dancing with mischief. "We'd never want any... miscalculations in missile coordinates or trajectory deviations."

Liam caught her chin, his thumb brushing her lower lip. "You minx." The words held more affection than reprimand.

Evelyn leaned back, her expression sobering. "Liam... I've decided to undergo the memory restoration procedure."

The color drained from his face. "Absolutely not."

Her temper flared. "It's my mind, my choice! Why must you control everything?"

His dark eyes held a quiet desperation that gave her pause. Beneath the steel exterior lurked a primal fear - that the surgery might fail, that she might never wake up. Or worse, that she would remember a life without him.

Ten years abroad. No contact. Changing her nationality. Showing no intention of returning to Aldenria. To her, he'd just been a childhood friend - nothing more.

Before the amnesia, there might have been someone else. Another man who'd claimed her heart. The thought made Liam's blood run cold. He couldn't lose her. Not again.
###Chapter 241

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Blackwood Manor. Evelyn Carter stood by the grand piano, her fingers tracing the polished ebony keys without pressing them. The silence felt heavier than usual today.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. Ryan Sullivan entered with military precision, his boots clicking against the marble floor. "Ma'am, the General requests your presence in the war room."

Her pulse quickened. Liam Blackwood only used the war room for matters of extreme importance. "Did he say why?"

Ryan's jaw tightened. "The situation in Valtoria has escalated. Obsidian Circle operatives were spotted near the border."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She'd hoped her past with that organization was buried forever. The scar on her wrist throbbed as if in reminder. "Tell him I'll be right there."

As Ryan departed, Evelyn caught her reflection in the antique mirror. The woman staring back barely resembled the frightened girl who'd escaped Shadowmire Island five years ago. Yet some shadows never fade.

She smoothed her emerald green dress - Liam's favorite color - and headed for the east wing. The manor's security system beeped as it scanned her retina before granting access to the restricted corridor.

Inside the war room, Liam stood before a holographic map of Aldenria, his broad shoulders tense beneath the uniform. Adrian Castillo hovered near the communications array, his expression unreadable.

Liam turned, his storm-gray eyes locking onto hers. "We have a problem."

The hologram zoomed in to show a convoy of black vehicles crossing into Solterra. Evelyn's breath hitched. "That's Julian Whitmore's insignia."

"Indeed." Liam tapped the console, bringing up surveillance footage. "He's transporting something - or someone - of great value to Obsidian Circle."

The video showed a hooded figure being escorted into a fortified compound. Even through the grainy footage, Evelyn recognized the distinctive limp of her former mentor. "That's Cassandra Wright."

Adrian cleared his throat. "Our intelligence suggests she's developed a new chemical weapon. One that could destabilize the entire region."

Liam's hand found Evelyn's, his calloused fingers intertwining with hers. "We need to move before they complete the transfer."

Evelyn studied the tactical display, her mind racing through possibilities. "We can intercept them at the border checkpoint. But we'll need inside help."

Ryan stepped forward. "I've already contacted our asset in Solterra. He's standing by."

A notification pinged on Liam's tablet. His expression darkened as he read the message. "It's from Victoria Dawson. She claims to have critical information about the operation."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. The woman who'd stolen her identity years ago was the last person she trusted. "It's a trap."

"Probably." Liam's mouth set in a grim line. "But we can't afford to ignore any leads."

The overhead lights flickered as the manor's security system initiated a protocol change. Adrian's hand drifted toward his sidearm. "We're being hacked."

Evelyn rushed to the main console as lines of code scrolled across the screens. Her fingers flew over the keyboard, countering the intrusion. "Someone's trying to access our defense grid."

Liam barked orders into his comm unit. "Lock down all systems! Initiate countermeasures!"

The holographic map dissolved into static before reforming to display a single message in crimson letters: "Tick tock, Evelyn. The past always comes due."

The screen went black. In the sudden silence, Evelyn could hear her own heartbeat pounding in her ears. Julian Whitmore's voice, though synthesized, was unmistakable.

Ryan swore under his breath. "How did they penetrate our firewalls?"

Liam's gaze never left Evelyn's face. "Because they have inside help."

Adrian stiffened. "You can't possibly think-"

"I think," Liam interrupted, "that we have a traitor in our midst." His thumb brushed the scar on Evelyn's wrist - the one matching the brand all Obsidian Circle operatives bore. "And I intend to find out who."

Liam's warm gaze lingered on Evelyn's delicate features. His voice was gentle yet firm as he spoke, "Cassandra, let's not force things. While I'd love for you to regain your memories, we can't risk lives for it."

"Please find me the top neurosurgeon," Evelyn implored, her eyes shimmering with hope as she blinked up at him.

Liam shook his head decisively. He wouldn't allow even a fraction of a percent risk to her safety.

"Let's talk about this later," Liam smoothly changed the subject. "You must be hungry. Shall we have dinner together?"

Evelyn nodded in agreement. Liam stood and reached for her hand.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

The housekeeper rushed to answer it, then turned back with nervous energy. "Mr. Blackwood, President Pierce and his secretary are here."

They exchanged a glance. Liam tenderly brushed Evelyn's hair and murmured, "Go ahead and start dinner. I'll attend to the President."

Evelyn nodded understandingly.

As the maid opened the door, Harrison strode in with thunderous authority, brushing past Liam without acknowledgment and heading straight for the study.

Liam greeted politely, "Mr. President, you—"

Before he could finish, Harrison stormed past him, radiating fury. Liam had no choice but to follow into the study.

Meanwhile, Evelyn made her way to the dining table, casting anxious glances toward the study. The secretary stood guard outside like a stone sentinel, intensifying the tension.

Her stomach twisted with worry as she waited, fearing repercussions Liam might face.

In the study, Harrison collapsed onto the sofa, barely containing his rage. "I don't believe a word of that missile malfunction report you presented."

"Now that we're alone, tell me the truth. What really happened?"

Liam sat across from him, maintaining perfect composure. "Would you like some coffee?"

Harrison's expression darkened further, his hands gripping his knees, chest heaving. "Liam, don't play games with me. The Edge Mark 1's technology is flawless. There's no possible data error, let alone this catastrophic deviation."

"A missile meant for unpopulated desert lands in a neighboring country? You've truly outdone yourself this time!"

"You've shamed our entire nation. Have you seen the international outcry? The condemnations? Do you feel no remorse?" Harrison's voice shook with fury.

Liam met his gaze steadily, speaking with measured calm. "Missile failures aren't unprecedented. Is national pride truly that important?"

Harrison slammed the table, leaping to his feet, his face dark as storm clouds.

"Who do you think you are, Liam? As Aldenria's Defense General, you have no right to such words!"

"Do you understand how we were trampled when we lacked missiles and advanced weapons? Our lands, our hills, our dignity—all stolen from us! Don't you see?"

"We endured sanctions, oppression, humiliation—all because we couldn't defend ourselves. Our military was weak, our defenses outdated, our strength insufficient."

Harrison's fists clenched, veins bulging, eyes glistening with frustrated tears. "Our once-proud missiles have become a global joke! Is that meaningless to you? Are you saying Aldenria is defenseless? That we can be bullied at will? Is that what you mean?"

Seeing the tears in Harrison's eyes, Liam felt a pang of sorrow. Yet he regretted nothing.

"Harrison, you know exactly what Valtoria has been doing these years."
###Chapter 242

"This is a poisoned land, cultivated by government-sanctioned opium fields. It's become the epicenter supplying nearly all global narcotics. And as their immediate neighbor, we suffer the worst consequences of this drug epidemic."

"Remember those 18 border guards who were forcibly injected with narcotics? They're now battling addiction daily, living in torment. In Aldenria, we have over 20 million addicts, and that number keeps climbing exponentially!"

"Despite our anti-drug forces' sacrifices, we can't stem the relentless drug tide flooding our borders."

Liam Blackwood collapsed into his chair, pressing his palm to his forehead. His voice trembled with anguish as he spoke, "What good does destroying one drug den with a missile do?"

"It barely makes a dent against Valtoria. The root of this plague remains untouched."

Alexander Blackwood closed his eyes sorrowfully, drawing a deep breath.

Liam's tone softened slightly. "I know you're not one for reckless actions. Tell me, what pushed you to this extreme?"

Alexander buried his face in his hands before meeting Liam's gaze with steely resolve. "Yes, I acted for personal reasons. Adrian, my colleague, and my wife, Cassandra, barely escaped Valtoria with their lives recently. Their safe return held me back."

"But now it's my brother. He's devoted everything to Aldenria's anti-drug campaign, a true patriot willing to sacrifice all."

Alexander's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I'd rather see him die with honor than endure the barbaric torture he suffered for six endless days. It's too cruel!"

"My brother now lies in critical condition, fighting for every breath."

His voice broke with emotion. "I don't know how much time he has left, but if I don't act for him now, I'd fail as his brother."

Liam's expression darkened. "Is it Donovan? Has he been undercover in Valtoria all this time?"

Alexander's throat constricted as he nodded.

Liam's face drained of color before he slammed his fist against the sofa.

After composing himself, Liam exhaled heavily. "A nation's defense capabilities determine its fate. With sufficient military strength, even an economically weak nation can dominate globally. But we—"

Liam rubbed his face wearily. "We still beg other nations for most of our weapons."

"In recent years, we've educated countless brilliant minds who choose foreign offers over returning home."

"We've lost so much talent," Liam lamented, his expression pained. "I apologize for my earlier outburst. Your actions were indeed impulsive."

Alexander nodded. "I'll accept whatever punishment comes."

Though this incident became an international spectacle, it ultimately caused minimal damage. Eliminating the border's largest drug operation and humbling Valtoria brought relief to many.

Liam sighed again. "Valtoria's demanded compensation will come from the military base's budget."

Alexander nodded. "Understood."

Liam changed subjects. "What's the status of the hydronium research?"

Alexander shook his head. "No breakthroughs yet."

"And Cassandra Wright?"

"Retired scientists from Solterra provided leads. She's likely deceased."

Liam leaned back, massaging his temples. "Even if we found Cassandra Wright, she wouldn't serve our nation."

Standing, Liam sighed deeply. "Perhaps it's for the best. At least the world won't face more terrifying weapons."
###Chapter 243

As Harrison Pierce stepped out of the study, Liam Blackwood rose from his seat.

"Righteous hearts carry blades to protect, while wicked souls wield them to conquer," Harrison murmured while walking away.

"General Blackwood, I sincerely hope to witness Aldenria develop an impregnable defense system to shield our nation from further disgrace. I'm counting on you." Harrison's voice carried the weight of his deepest aspirations.

While escorting the president out of Blackwood Manor, Liam felt an uncomfortable tightness in his chest. Evelyn Carter waited anxiously at the dining table, her nerves stretched thin.

When Liam returned, Evelyn rushed to him, her worry palpable. "Darling, did President Pierce give you trouble? Was he angry? Are there going to be consequences?"

Though Liam's expression remained grave, he managed a small smile as his fingers gently combed through her silky hair. "Everything's fine, love. Don't worry."

"Are you absolutely certain?" Her voice trembled slightly.

"Positive," Liam assured her.

Evelyn reached up to cradle his face, her delicate fingers tracing the tired lines. The warmth of her touch seeped into his bones, bringing unexpected comfort.

Liam caught her hand and pressed it against his cheek, gazing at her with deep affection.

"You look exhausted, my love," she whispered, distress coloring her voice. "You've been working nonstop. You need rest."

"There are things I can't share with you yet, sweetheart. Thank you for understanding," Liam replied softly.

Evelyn offered a gentle smile, her eyes overflowing with love. "Dinner's been reheated three times already. Let's eat."

Liam nodded and led her to the dining table.

That night, Liam worked until dawn. When he finally returned to their bedroom, Evelyn had succumbed to exhaustion, her breathing deep and even.

The next morning found Evelyn at the hospital's ICU ward as usual. After spending time with Alexander and consulting with his doctors, she handed over her engagement ring to the medical staff.

The doctor initially objected to bringing jewelry into the sterile environment, but Evelyn insisted the sentimental value might stimulate Alexander's will to survive. Reluctantly, the doctor complied.

As Evelyn prepared to leave, a male doctor in a white coat suddenly blocked her path. When she recognized his face, her breath caught in her throat.

Julian Whitmore offered a charming smile, his dark eyes unreadable behind his glasses. Adjusting the frames, he murmured, "What an unexpected pleasure, my dear former lover."

The term "former lover" made Evelyn's heart stutter, panic creeping up her spine like icy fingers.

She wasn't the real Evelyn Carter. Yet Julian seemed convinced she was, even mentioning her fluency in eight languages. Before her memory loss, Julian had known her true identity. The terrifying realization struck her - Julian was a brilliant surgeon.

Evelyn's fingers unconsciously drifted to the scar at the base of her skull. Goosebumps erupted across her skin as horrifying possibilities flooded her mind.

"Dr. Whitmore," she managed, forcing calm into her voice. "Do you practice at this hospital?"

Julian's smile remained light as he casually replied, "Not exactly. Just consulting on a special case."

Evelyn's pulse quickened, her throat suddenly dry. As the heir to a pharmaceutical empire and renowned surgeon, he could have easily manipulated those DNA test results.

She had initially suspected Liam. Now, Julian appeared far more suspicious - and dangerous. This man, like Victoria Dawson, radiated menace.

Julian frowned, stepping closer. "You're pale. Are you unwell?" His hand reached toward her forehead.

Evelyn recoiled, her voice trembling. "I have urgent matters. Excuse me." She hurried away before he could respond, her heart pounding like a trapped bird.
###Chapter 244

Evelyn marched past Julian, but he suddenly grabbed her wrist and pulled her back violently. Annoyed, she shoved his hand away.

"What the hell are you doing? Get your hands off me!"

Julian didn't release her. Instead, he yanked her closer. His gaze turned predatory as he murmured in that velvet voice she used to love, "My darling ex, why so hasty? I have something important to tell you."

Despite her pounding heart, Evelyn forced her expression to remain neutral. She glared at his restraining hand and snapped, "If you have something to say, say it. But keep your damn hands to yourself!"

Julian only tightened his grip, leaning in until his breath ghosted over her cheek. "After all those years together, do you really think I don't know every curve of your body?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw, fighting to control her rising temper.

"I know you better than anyone ever will," Julian whispered, his fingers tracing circles on her wrist.

If not for the gynecologist's recent confirmation of her virginity, she might have believed his lies. The man was a walking deception, his audacity limitless.

With a sharp twist, Evelyn wrenched her arm free. "I said let go!"

Julian reacted instantly, wrapping both arms around her waist in an iron grip. His lips brushed her ear as he growled, "You'll be mine again, Evelyn. One way or another."

Tremors of fear ran through her. "If you don't release me right now, I'll—"

Before she could scream, a blur of motion caught her eye. A tall figure barreled toward them. There was a sickening crack as Julian's arm was twisted at an unnatural angle.

Julian howled in pain, immediately cradling his injured limb.

The next instant, Evelyn found herself pressed against a solid chest, her hands splayed over warm muscle. The familiar scent of sandalwood and gunpowder enveloped her.

Looking up, she met Liam's stormy gaze, and immediately, the tension drained from her body.

Wasn't he supposed to be in meetings all day? He'd even canceled his visit to Alexander. How had he appeared here like some guardian angel?

"Liam..." Evelyn's voice softened as she took in his furious expression directed at Julian, his jaw clenched tight.

Julian sucked in a pained breath, glaring daggers at Liam. "Think being Aldenria's General gives you the right to assault people?"

Liam's reply was ice. "When it comes to my wife? Absolutely."

"You broke into my home last time! Now this?" Julian spat. "I won't let this slide."

A dangerous smirk curled Liam's lips. "Harassing my wife in public? I could put a bullet in you and call it self-defense."

Julian paled visibly, his eyes burning with impotent rage. Against Liam's commanding presence, he looked like a yapping dog challenging a wolf.

Defeated, Julian cradled his arm and hissed, "This isn't over." With a final venomous look, he stalked off toward the orthopedic wing.

Evelyn couldn't tear her gaze from Liam. She traced the strong line of his jaw, the tempting Adam's apple, the faint stubble shadowing his chin.

Pure masculine perfection.

Noticing her rapt attention, Liam's throat worked as he murmured in that deep, honeyed tone, "See something you like, sweetheart?"
###Chapter 245

Evelyn jolted back to reality, heat flooding her cheeks as she quickly broke away from Liam's embrace. She turned her face away, unable to meet his intense gaze.

"Aren't you supposed to be in meetings?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Liam's lips curved slightly. "Just wrapped up the last one."

"Oh," Evelyn murmured, her fingers nervously playing with the hem of her blouse.

Without another word, Liam took her hand, his warm fingers intertwining with hers. "Come," he said gently. "Let's check on Alexander again."

As they walked down the hospital corridor, Evelyn couldn't tear her eyes away from their joined hands. Her pulse raced, each point of contact sending electric currents through her skin. Even after all this time, his touch still made her heart stutter like a schoolgirl's.

Outside the observation room, Liam's expression turned grave as he studied his brother through the glass. "Any changes?" His voice carried the weight of unspoken fears.

Evelyn shook her head slowly. "The doctors say it's remarkable he's lasted this long."

Liam's jaw tightened, his eyes glistening. "Miracles happen."

"Yes," Evelyn agreed softly. "They do."

They stood in companionable silence, keeping vigil over Alexander's still form as the afternoon light faded.

In the following days, Liam became consumed with state affairs again. Evelyn found herself wandering the gardens of Blackwood Manor one bright morning, enjoying the rare sunshine when her phone buzzed urgently.

Rosalind's voice crackled with tension. "Evelyn! Turn on the Citizen's Broadcast right now!"

"What broadcast?" Evelyn frowned, stopping mid-step.

"Channel 7 - the interview segment. Hurry!" Rosalind insisted before the line went dead.

With trembling fingers, Evelyn pulled up the live stream. The image that greeted her made her blood run cold.

There, sitting across from the smarmy host, were Vincent, Dominic, and Dorothy Carter - the family that had raised her. The very people who had betrayed her.

The interview was a character assassination. They painted Evelyn as a gold-digging social climber who abandoned her humble roots. They claimed she'd physically abused Dominic and neglected her adoptive parents.

But the worst was yet to come.

With theatrical tears, they dredged up fabricated stories about Evelyn dropping out of school, working in seedy bars, contracting diseases from promiscuity. The crowning blow? Accusing her of marrying an elderly millionaire before setting her sights on Liam.

Most devastating of all - they revealed her marriage to General Blackwood, dragging his sterling reputation through the mud on national television.

Evelyn's vision blurred with angry tears as the lies kept coming. Her phone slipped from numb fingers as the broadcast cut to shocked reactions from "ordinary citizens."

She tried calling Dorothy repeatedly, only to be met with the robotic voice of voicemail. Stumbling back to the manor's sitting room, she collapsed onto a velvet chaise and dialed Rosalind with shaking hands.

"They're monsters," Evelyn choked out when her friend answered. "Absolute monsters."

"Breathe, Evie," Rosalind soothed. "We'll figure this out."

Evelyn's voice broke. "Do you realize what they've done? Liam's name... his family's honor... all tarnished because of me!"

The weight of it crushed her. The media frenzy would be relentless. And she had no idea how to protect the man she loved from the fallout of her toxic past.
###Chapter 246

"You have two choices," Rosalind said firmly. "Either quietly divorce Liam by denying the marriage, or reveal your true identity to the world."

Evelyn slumped against the sofa, pressing trembling fingers to her temples as tears welled up. "I made a promise to Liam. I can't bring up divorce."

"Then you must prove you're not Evelyn Carter," Rosalind insisted. "Show them you're someone else entirely."

Shaking her head, Evelyn wiped at her damp cheeks. "I can't. Not until I uncover who's behind this conspiracy and learn my real identity. It's too dangerous to expose myself now."

Rosalind threw up her hands. "Then what's your plan?"

Drawing a shuddering breath, Evelyn squared her shoulders. "I'm telling Liam everything. He'll believe me. He's the only one who can fix this."

"Is he even home?" Rosalind asked.

Evelyn's shoulders slumped. "No. He's stationed at the border outpost."

"Then wait until he returns. And be careful going out - you might get ambushed," Rosalind warned.

"I will," Evelyn promised.

As she ended the call and reached to dial Liam's number, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Dominic. Her hand shook as she answered, fury making her voice unsteady.

"Well, little sister," Dominic's smug voice dripped through the speaker. "Did you catch your starring role on the noon broadcast? Quite the ratings grabber, wasn't it?"

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the fabric of her blouse. "Have you lost your mind? Why would you do this? How could you—"

Dominic's laugh cut her off. "Your reputation's in tatters. Scared yet?"

Evelyn had never feared for herself. Her terror was for Liam - how this sordid history attached to her false identity could destroy his career. The thought of dragging him down terrified her.

"Aren't you afraid of consequences?" she ground out between clenched teeth.

Dominic's sneer was audible. "Why should I be? The whole world knows we're connected to the General now. If anything happens to us after spilling your secrets on live TV, suspicion falls right on him."

Evelyn trembled with suppressed rage, hot tears burning behind her eyes. Facing such shameless blackmailers left her feeling helpless.

Then Dominic's tone shifted, turning almost coaxing. "Listen, sis... maybe we can work something out. A little financial incentive could make these scandals disappear. What do you say?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

"Don't get too comfortable," Dominic taunted. "We've got so much more dirt to share. Our new social media accounts already have fifty thousand followers."

"People can't wait to hear more juicy details about the General's scandalous wife!" His cackle made her skin crawl. "Pay up or we'll monetize the traffic ourselves."

Furious, Evelyn ended the call and checked trending topics. The results made her stomach churn - a flood of vicious rumors mixing truth and fiction, all designed to destroy her.

Her personal details and photos were everywhere, along with her identity as the philanthropic artist Isabella Grayson. The relentless online assault left her feeling hollow.

Her phone buzzed with messages from the Blackwood family group chat.

Eleanor wrote: "Evelyn, what's happening with your family? Have they gone completely mad?"

Richard demanded: "This is absurd. Come home with Liam immediately."

Cassandra chimed in: "Are you seeing this? Get Liam involved now! If this continues, it won't just hurt him - our entire family will suffer because of you."
###Chapter 247

The live stream continued to reveal damning information.

Evelyn couldn't take it anymore. She collapsed onto the sofa, her mind swirling with chaos as tears threatened to spill. At this moment, she needed Liam more than ever.

If this continued, she might have to reveal her true identity. But with two compelling DNA reports circulating, who would believe her? She barely believed it herself, let alone the internet trolls.

Her phone vibrated. Evelyn picked it up to see a message from Dominic.

"Dear sister, Mom and Dad are demanding $80 million in compensation. Handle it."

With a violent motion, Evelyn hurled her phone across the room. She lay on the sofa with her eyes closed, body trembling with rage and pain.

"Who am I? What's my real identity?" she cried internally, drowning in sorrow and fury.

As twilight descended, Liam disembarked from his private jet with two aides and rushed back to Blackwood Manor.

Entering the darkened house, he flicked on the lights. His polished shoes crunched over shattered phone glass near the entrance.

His warm gaze fell upon Evelyn, asleep on the couch with tear tracks staining her cheeks.

Liam knelt slowly, his tender expression fixed on Evelyn's peaceful face. Seeing her tears made his heart constrict.

She was supposed to be the cherished jewel of the Wright family. Yet she'd endured so much suffering.

Gently, Liam brushed away her tears. The moment he'd seen the online reports, he'd rushed back. He hadn't expected her to find out.

As he reached to lift her, Evelyn's tear-filled eyes fluttered open.

Seeing Liam, fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. She threw herself into his arms, burying her face in his shoulder.

"Liam, you're back?"

Her choked sobs made his chest tighten.

"The Carters are despicable!" Evelyn gasped between cries. "I don't care what they do to me! But they're destroying your reputation, making you a global laughingstock!"

With each word, her anger grew until she couldn't contain it. "What do we do? The entire internet is attacking me, mocking you and the Blackwoods!"

Liam sat on the couch, pulling Evelyn onto his lap. "Don't worry," he murmured into her hair. "Leave this to me."

Evelyn rested her cheek against his chest, taking shaky breaths. After a long pause, she whispered, "Liam...if I told you I'm not Evelyn Carter...would you believe me?"

Liam stiffened in surprise.

Evelyn pulled back to meet his gaze. "I thought I was Evelyn, but now...I don't know who I am. Those DNA reports are fake. Do you believe me?"

Liam's brow furrowed, his expression darkening. He'd thought only he knew the truth - but apparently Evelyn had discovered it too.
###Chapter 248

Liam sat frozen in place as Evelyn's delicate fingers wrapped around his wrist. "Come with me," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

He rose mechanically, allowing her to lead him up the grand staircase. Her grip was surprisingly strong for someone so petite.

The bedroom door clicked shut behind them. Evelyn guided him to sit on the edge of the four-poster bed, her hands trembling visibly.

"Sit down, please." Her voice cracked with nervous energy.

Liam obeyed, studying her flushed face. The usual clarity in her emerald eyes had been replaced by something hesitant, almost shy. There was an unfamiliar mischief in her expression that made his pulse quicken.

With gentle pressure, she pushed against his shoulders until his back met the mattress. She hovered above him, her breathing uneven.

"I don't know how to say this," she whispered, her warm breath fanning across his face. "I had DNA tests done with Dorothy. I'm not her biological daughter."

She swallowed hard before continuing. "You might have guessed Evelyn was adopted. But I'm not even her. The medical report confirmed... I'm still untouched." Her cheeks burned scarlet as the words tumbled out.

Perched atop him, her fingers fumbled with the buttons of his dress shirt. Each shaky exhale made her chest rise and fall rapidly.

"Let me show you—"

Liam's hand shot up to stop hers, his grip firm. His throat constricted as he struggled to maintain control.

"I believe you, sweetheart," he said, voice strained. "You don't need to prove anything like this."

Evelyn blinked in surprise, her lips parting slightly.

In one fluid motion, Liam reversed their positions, caging her beneath him. Even the slightest movement from her sent fire racing through his veins.

His normally steady voice dropped an octave. "When we come together, it should be about love—not some test of purity."

She turned her face away, embarrassed. "I destroyed the evidence. I was afraid you wouldn't believe me."

He pressed a tender kiss to her forehead. "I trust you implicitly. But this stays between us. You must keep playing Evelyn for now."

She nodded against his chest. "I understand. Until I uncover who I really am—who's pulling the strings—"

"You're exposed while they hide in shadows," Liam finished. "Smart girl."

"What about the backlash from the Carter family?" she asked.

"Leave that to me," he said firmly.

After a beat of silence, Evelyn whispered, "Liam... if I'm not Evelyn, then our marriage—"

His entire body tensed. "What are you suggesting?" The words came out sharper than intended.

She gave a small shake of her head. "Just thinking aloud."

Liam exhaled slowly through his nose before reaching for the hem of her blouse.

Evelyn gasped, grabbing his wrist. "What are you—"

His expression darkened. "Making this marriage indisputable. Once I've put my babies in you, you won't question this bond again."
###Chapter 249

Evelyn turned her face away as Liam leaned in for a kiss. His lips barely brushed the corner of her mouth.

"I need to shower," she whispered, her voice trembling.

Heat flooded Evelyn's body, her cheeks burning crimson as she avoided his intense gaze. The atmosphere between them grew thick with unspoken tension, her pulse racing wildly.

Liam exhaled sharply through his nose before pushing off the bed. Evelyn scrambled up and fled to the bathroom without another word.

Once inside, she cranked the shower to full blast, letting the steam fill the room as she tried to steady her breathing.

This was inevitable, she told herself. Since she'd already confessed everything to Liam, he shouldn't be shocked by her condition now.

With this reassurance, Evelyn scrubbed herself meticulously. Tonight would be her first time, and she wanted it to be perfect for them both.

Thirty minutes later, she emerged in fresh silk pajamas only to find the bedroom empty.

She checked the balcony, the walk-in closet - nothing. A cold dread settled in her stomach. Had he gotten cold feet? Had he run?

Evelyn padded down the hall to the study. The door stood slightly ajar, revealing Liam hunched over paperwork at his desk.

She raised her hand to knock, then hesitated. Maybe she shouldn't push him right now.

Inside the study, Liam's gaze flickered to the doorway where Evelyn lingered. He stared blankly at the documents before him, not really seeing them.

Only when he heard her retreating footsteps did he finally look up, watching her leave with a pained expression.

Liam shoved the papers aside and rubbed his tired eyes. Leaning back in his chair, he took several deep breaths to quell the storm inside him.

Running wasn't his style. But he'd left to spare Evelyn further distress. She was right - once her true identity came out, their marriage would be legally void.

And in a nullified marriage, he had no right to touch her. Until he could be certain of Evelyn's feelings, he wouldn't risk hurting her.

That night, Liam deliberately avoided their shared bedroom. Meanwhile, Evelyn tossed restlessly in the oversized bed, sleep eluding her.

Morning light revealed the other side of the bed still pristine and untouched. Evelyn dressed mechanically before venturing out.

"Has Mr. Blackwood left already?" she asked the housekeeper in the living room.

"Left right after breakfast, ma'am," came the reply.

"Where did he sleep last night?"

"The guest suite, ma'am."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line as she nodded.

The housekeeper added, "Mr. Blackwood said you're not to leave the estate today. There are reporters camped outside. If you must go out, take the security detail."

"Understood," Evelyn murmured.

At the breakfast table, she scrolled through news sites on her phone. Yesterday's explosive headlines about her scandal had vanished completely.

She searched every variation - "General's wife", "Evelyn Carter", "the Carter family" - but found nothing. It was as if the entire incident had been erased from existence.

Liam's ability to scrub the internet astonished her. But no amount of deleted articles could stop the rumor mill.

Her phone buzzed with an unknown number. "Hello?"

"Good morning, this is Aldenria Daily News. May I speak with Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn ended the call without responding. When it rang again moments later, she answered in silence.

"Hello? This is National Truth Network calling about..."
###Chapter 250

Evelyn disconnected the call with trembling fingers.

Her phone immediately lit up like a Christmas tree, buzzing violently against the marble countertop. Despite the security protocols at Royal Heights, someone had clearly leaked her private number.

Within minutes, her device was flooded with calls and texts. Evelyn's breathing turned shallow as panic clawed at her throat.

She slammed the power button, her breakfast suddenly tasting like ash. Pressing her palms against her temples, she felt the beginnings of a migraine creeping in.

The thought of how this scandal might affect Liam made her stomach churn.

"Madam, are you unwell?" The maid's voice held genuine concern.

Evelyn could only shake her head mutely.

"Don't fret, Madam. Mr. Blackwood has everything handled," the maid reassured. After a beat of silence, Evelyn snatched her phone and stormed upstairs.

She locked herself in the master suite, powering on the device with shaky hands. Dominic answered on the first ring. "Well, well. My dear sister finally calls."

Evelyn swallowed the lump in her throat. "What's your endgame, Dominic?"

"Wasn't I crystal clear? Eighty million. One lump sum." His voice dripped with mock sweetness.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "I don't have that kind of money."

"But you're the famous Isabella Grayson!" Dominic sneered. "Sell a few paintings. Or better yet - ask your billionaire husband. That's pocket change for Liam Blackwood."

His voice turned venomous. "You parade around as this perfect couple while abandoning your own flesh and blood? Disgusting."

After his tirade, Dominic's tone turned triumphant. "I went to the border hoping for a position, and what did your precious husband do? Treated me like gutter trash. Well, now the whole world will know what kind of people you really are!"

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "So you put our parents on national television, destroyed my reputation, and now you're leaking my number to the press?"

"You left me no choice," Dominic spat.

Evelyn stepped onto the balcony, gripping the railing until her knuckles turned white. "Who's really behind this, Dominic?"

A beat of silence. Then: "What are you implying?"

Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I may not be as cunning as you, but remember - I'm not fighting alone. I'm Liam Blackwood's wife."

Dominic's laughter was cruel. "Your precious husband? Please. I've got the entire media machine behind me. Do you really think I'm scared of him?"

"Check the news," Evelyn said coldly before ending the call.

She powered off the device and collapsed into a patio chair, staring blankly at the manicured gardens below. The weight of her fractured memories pressed down on her like a physical force.

More than anything, she wished she could remember her past - to finally break free from the Carters' toxic grip.

Liam was handling business elsewhere. She trusted him implicitly to resolve this, even if it meant the complete destruction of her so-called family. For now, she would wait.

Night fell without Liam's return. Evelyn avoided her phone, dreading the inevitable media storm. She didn't inquire about Liam's whereabouts, choosing instead to wait in agonizing silence until sleep finally claimed her.

On the third morning, a frantic maid burst into her room. "Madam! Your mother is kneeling outside the gates with some sort of protest sign! You need to see this!"
###Chapter 251

Evelyn's thoughts whirled in disarray. Dorothy was outside Royal Heights?

She threw on her clothes in haste. With two burly bodyguards flanking her, she left Blackwood Manor and headed toward the heavily secured gates of the government compound.

Royal Heights housed Norvania's elite—high-ranking officials and foreign dignitaries. Its perimeter bristled with armed guards, barring unauthorized entry.

When Evelyn stepped beyond the gates, the chaotic sight that greeted her ignited white-hot fury. Her hands clenched into trembling fists.

Behind Dorothy, several relatives held up banners that read: "Evelyn, your mother begs for mercy—free Vincent and Dominic."

Dorothy knelt before the signs, her tear-streaked face the picture of maternal anguish. At least two-thirds of the gathered crowd were reporters, their cameras and phones trained on the scene.

Seeing Dorothy's performance, Evelyn's eyes burned with betrayal. Though not her biological mother, she'd given Dorothy three years of genuine devotion. Even a stray dog would show more loyalty than this woman who seemed determined to ruin her.

"Dorothy," Evelyn's voice shook with barely contained rage. "What are you doing?"

The older woman burst into fresh tears. "My darling, I was wrong! Terribly wrong!"

The media frenzy intensified at Evelyn's appearance. Reporters surged forward, cameras flashing, live streams broadcasting the confrontation worldwide.

The bodyguards closed ranks around Evelyn. "Madam," one murmured urgently, "let's return home. Mr. Blackwood should handle this."

Evelyn's heart ached. While she relied on Liam, she couldn't burden him with every crisis. Between national security, corporate affairs, and his brother Donovan's critical condition, he had enough to manage.

Murmurs spread through the crowd like wildfire. The relatives behind Dorothy began hurling accusations—ungrateful daughter, abandoning her family, using Liam's influence to imprison Vincent and Dominic.

"Imprison?" Evelyn's mind raced. If Dorothy truly wanted to help, she'd have contacted her privately. This spectacle wasn't about justice—it was emotional blackmail.

"Why were they arrested?" Evelyn demanded coolly.

Dorothy continued sobbing dramatically. A relative answered, "Dominic got caught in human trafficking, and Vincent committed rape while drunk! All your husband's doing!"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Did Liam force them to traffic people? Or rape someone? Why blame him for their crimes?"

The relative sneered. "Everything was fine until you appeared on television! Then suddenly they're arrested—who else could be responsible?"

"That only proves they were good at hiding their crimes," Evelyn countered. "If Liam framed them, Dorothy wouldn't be kneeling here unharmed. The truth speaks for itself."

Silence fell over the crowd like a heavy curtain.
###Chapter 252

Dorothy's wails echoed through the crowded room.

A journalist shoved a microphone forward. "Ms. Carter, why are you refusing to support your adoptive parents? How do you feel about them revealing your private history to the media?"

Evelyn straightened her posture, facing the sea of flashing cameras. Her voice remained steady. "Actually, I'll use this platform to share my truth with the world."

"Three years ago, I lost all memory of my past. I don't remember who I truly am, but I know I'm not Evelyn Carter. My entire life has been carefully constructed to fit this identity."

"I understand the risks of speaking out, but I can no longer endure this family's cruelty."

Gasps rippled through the audience. The Carter family members exchanged shocked glances. Dorothy staggered to her feet, her face twisted in horror. "Sweetheart, what terrible lies are you telling?"

Ignoring the outburst, Evelyn pressed her fingertips to her cheekbone. "I've never had plastic surgery. Medical records will confirm this."

"So I beg anyone who might recognize me - former friends, classmates, or relatives - to come forward."

Dorothy frantically produced a DNA report from her purse. "We've tested twice! You're my daughter!"

Evelyn's gaze hardened. "Like me, you've been deceived by fabricated evidence. You should focus on finding your real daughter. I'm not her."

Turning to the press, she concluded, "Please help spread my story. Help me find my true family."

With that, she turned on her heel. Two armored bodyguards materialized, shielding her from the clamoring reporters as she exited.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Evelyn collapsed onto the plush sofa, emotionally drained. She'd promised Liam to keep silent, but the truth had become unbearable.

As expected, social media exploded with speculation. Evelyn couldn't bear to check her phone, terrified of the backlash.

An hour passed. She curled into a tight ball on the bedroom couch, knees drawn to her chest, staring blankly at the coffee table.

The door swung open. Familiar footsteps approached.

Evelyn lifted tear-filled eyes to meet Liam's stormy gaze.

His rapid breathing betrayed how urgently he'd rushed home. Their locked eyes communicated volumes without words.

"I'm sorry, Liam," she whispered brokenly.

He sank beside her, pulling her into his strong embrace. "No, darling. The apology should be mine."

Evelyn buried her face in his chest, tears glistening. "Have I caused more trouble for you?"

Liam's heart ached as he stroked her silken hair. "Sweetheart, you could never be a burden."

He'd already contained the fallout - handling Donovan and Dominic, managing the media frenzy. Yet he'd underestimated Dorothy's audacity in staging this public spectacle.

"Liam," Evelyn murmured, closing her eyes as fresh tears fell.

The past days had pushed her to breaking point. She'd rather face unknown dangers than endure her "family's" torment. And she couldn't bear watching Liam suffer because of her identity crisis.
###Chapter 253

Liam's arm encircled Evelyn's waist, his fingers intertwining with hers as he whispered, "Darling, whatever you decide, I'll stand by you."

Evelyn leaned into his embrace, seeking solace in his familiar warmth. "Aren't you upset I kept this from you?"

"You weren't ready to share with anyone, were you? The moment overwhelmed you." His understanding tone made her throat tighten.

She nodded. Dorothy's relentless pressure had been unbearable. The accusations had flown like daggers, and in that heated moment, the truth had spilled from Evelyn's lips without thought.

"It's alright now. I'm here." Liam pressed a kiss to her temple, his lips warm against her skin.

A rush of affection flooded Evelyn's chest, wrapping around her heart like a security blanket.

"Have you eaten today?" Liam's question was soft, concerned.

She shook her head. "Not hungry."

"You need to eat something." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but suddenly found herself lifted into his arms. "Let me take you upstairs to rest. I'll bring you a proper meal."

"I can walk," she murmured, though her arms instinctively wound around his neck.

"I know." His steps were measured, his voice tender. "But I want to carry you."

Heat bloomed across Evelyn's cheeks as she nestled against his shoulder, surrendering to his care.

From the foyer, Ryan and Adrian watched the couple ascend the staircase before moving to their posts outside Blackwood Manor's entrance.

Adrian chuckled. "Never thought General Blackwood could be so... domestic."

Ryan's expression darkened. "He's been running on fumes lately. How much longer can he keep this up?"

"Ryan," Adrian lowered his voice, "you've noticed it too, haven't you? The General's feelings for Mrs. Blackwood have changed."

"Changed?" Ryan scoffed. "That's an understatement."

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "What happened while I was hospitalized?"

"The General knows her true identity now."

"Then why hasn't he told her? Why let her go through that media circus searching for her family? She looked devastated."

"Some truths are too complex for simple explanations."

Adrian leaned closer. "Give me details."

Ryan exhaled heavily.

Since publicly renouncing her identity, Evelyn had become a recluse within Blackwood Manor's walls. Fear kept her indoors, away from prying eyes and news broadcasts. She filled her days with books, studies, and tending to her plants - anything to avoid confronting the storm outside. For Evelyn, staying safe had become the greatest gift she could give Liam.

On a particularly golden afternoon, after hours of intense reading, Evelyn's eyes grew heavy with fatigue. She'd just finished her eye exercises when two figures materialized before her, making her jump.

Blackwood Manor wasn't a place where strangers wandered in unannounced.

The young man and woman were strikingly attractive, each holding gift bags and regarding Evelyn with curious expressions, seemingly as startled by her presence as she was by theirs.

"May I help you?" Evelyn asked, smoothing her dress.

The man offered a polite smile. "Benjamin Hudson. This is my sister, Victoria. We're Liam's friends. And you are?"

Taking in their refined attire and the gifts, Evelyn guessed they were Royal Heights residents. She returned their smile. "Evelyn Carter. Liam's wife."
###Chapter 254

The word "wife" sent Benjamin and Victoria into stunned silence, their faces frozen in identical expressions of shock.

Their scrutinizing gazes swept over Evelyn as if she were some perplexing riddle they couldn't solve.

Benjamin recovered first, his lips curling into an amused grin. "You're Liam's wife? Since when? Why wasn't I informed?"

Evelyn didn't miss the way Victoria's expression darkened at the revelation.

"We signed the marriage papers six months ago, but we skipped the ceremony," Evelyn explained.

"That's impossible. Liam wouldn't get married without telling me—I'm his closest friend!" Benjamin shook his head, still disbelieving.

Evelyn ushered them inside, preparing coffee and setting out snacks with practiced ease.

Victoria's mood was palpable—her silence heavy, her posture rigid. She hadn't said much since arriving, but her disapproval was unmistakable.

Benjamin settled onto the couch. "Is Liam home?"

"No, he's been busy with work. Family matters, too. He stops by occasionally but never stays long," Evelyn replied.

"I always said any woman marrying him would have to get used to solitude. You have my admiration," Benjamin chuckled.

Evelyn flushed slightly but managed a small smile.

Then Victoria pulled out her phone and dialed, her voice softening unnaturally. "Liam, Benjamin and I are back. We're at your place. When will you be home?"

The way she said his name—so familiar, so intimate—sent an uneasy prickle down Evelyn's spine.

Victoria was effortlessly elegant, every movement exuding confidence and grace.

Hanging up, she murmured, "He's on his way."

Then she turned her sharp gaze back to Evelyn. "What do you do for a living?"

Evelyn cleared her throat. "I don't work."

Victoria's lips curled into a thin smile. "No job? Are you pregnant, then?"

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks. "No."

Victoria's tone turned pointed. "Liam has staff for household matters. He doesn't need a housewife. So if you're neither working nor expecting, what exactly do you do all day?"

The question stung. Evelyn fidgeted under Victoria's judgmental stare, struggling to defend herself.

It wasn't that she didn't want to work—but with no formal education or qualifications, what options did she have?

Taking up menial jobs like caregiving or waitressing again would only embarrass Liam. So she remained stuck, directionless.

Benjamin, sensing her discomfort, intervened with a lighthearted smile. "Don't mind Victoria. She's blunt with everyone—comes with working at the Foreign Ministry."

Evelyn forced a nod. "It's fine."

But she knew better. Diplomats were masters of tact—Victoria's hostility was personal.

The woman pressed on. "I've known Liam for years. He's never mentioned you. We were apart six months—how did you two even meet?"

The interrogation made Evelyn's skin prickle. She wasn't used to dealing with strong personalities like Victoria's.

"Through Margaret," she answered quietly.

"An arranged marriage?" Victoria's eyebrow arched.

Evelyn hesitated. She didn’t owe this woman an explanation. If Victoria had questions, she could ask Liam herself.

"Something like that," Evelyn replied.
###Chapter 255

Victoria's voice was laced with venom. "I never thought Liam could craft such a romantic facade while treating marriage like a casual fling."

Benjamin's expression darkened. "Victoria, what's wrong with you today? Why so bitter?"

Evelyn felt an uncomfortable tightness in her chest, abruptly ending the conversation. She stood gracefully. "Excuse me, I have matters to attend to. Please make yourselves comfortable."

"Don't trouble yourself, Evelyn. We know this place well enough," Benjamin reassured, checking his watch. "Liam should be returning soon."

As if on cue, the sound of tires crunching on gravel echoed through the manor.

Benjamin turned toward the entrance. "That must be him now."

Victoria practically leaped from her seat, rushing toward the door. Evelyn remained frozen, an odd heaviness settling in her chest as she watched Victoria's eager departure.

When Liam entered, Victoria practically threw herself at him. A fond smile touched his lips at the sight of her.

"Liam, it's been too long," Victoria purred, extending her hand.

Liam grasped it warmly. "Indeed it has, Victoria."

Benjamin strode forward with open arms, grinning broadly. "Welcome home, brother!"

Releasing Victoria, Liam embraced Benjamin tightly.

"Half a year apart and you've gone soft," Liam teased, playfully punching Benjamin's chest before turning serious. "Neglecting your training, I see."

Benjamin slung an arm around Liam's shoulders, steering him toward the sitting area. "Let's talk about you instead. Getting married without telling your best friend? Some friend you are!"

Liam's gaze shifted past Benjamin, landing on Evelyn standing rigidly in the parlor, her displeasure evident.

Extricating himself from Benjamin's hold, Liam approached Evelyn. His intense gaze softened as he murmured, "Sweetheart, come meet my friends."

Evelyn replied coolly, "We've already been introduced."

Victoria sauntered over then, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Liam, I remember how you despised people without ambition."

"Yet here you are, keeping some pampered mistress in this grand manor. Do you view her as some sort of pet?"

Evelyn's breath caught. So Liam despised the unambitious?

A wave of insecurity crashed over her. What value did she hold in Liam's eyes? Was she worth less than the household staff? Should she seek employment?

Liam's expression darkened as he finally understood Evelyn's discomfort. Guiding her to sit, he gestured to the others. "Please, have a seat."

Benjamin and Victoria settled opposite them.

Benjamin forced a smile. "Ignore her, Liam. She's not herself today."

Liam fixed Victoria with a stern look. "Victoria, Evelyn's situation is complex. Her current lack of employment doesn't define her worth, especially considering the emotional support she provides. Mind your words."

Victoria laughed lightly. "Can't take a joke anymore?"

Benjamin interjected, "Perhaps you should speak less. Every word seems to offend someone. I wonder how you function at the Foreign Ministry."

Liam turned to Benjamin with concern. "How did the negotiations go? Six months is a long time. Any progress?"

Benjamin ran a hand through his hair, sighing deeply. "It's a disaster. They're all opportunistic thieves."

"How much?" Liam asked.

"600 billion dollars per unit," Benjamin replied.

Liam exhaled sharply, leaning back against the sofa. He noticed Evelyn's earnest attempt to follow the conversation.

Gently squeezing her hand, he explained softly, "Benjamin is Director of Defense Procurement. He's spent the last six months negotiating for advanced fighter jets overseas."
###Chapter 256

Evelyn's voice trembled slightly as she asked, "Would you prefer me to leave you alone?"

Victoria shot her a dismissive glance. "Current affairs clearly aren't your strong suit. Reality TV and soap operas seem more your speed, am I right?"

Suppressing the sting of the remark, Evelyn drew a slow breath. She hovered uncertainly, torn between staying and risking overhearing something confidential. Never had she expected Victoria to paint her as ignorant so blatantly.

Liam's brow furrowed as he fixed Victoria with a piercing stare. "What's gotten into you? Must you always be so abrasive?"

Benjamin cleared his throat nervously, forcing a conciliatory smile. "Liam, Evelyn, don't take it to heart. Victoria's just gone through a messy breakup."

Liam looked genuinely surprised. "Victoria was in a relationship?"

Victoria turned her face toward the window, neither confirming nor denying.

Benjamin added, "Yes, and it's not her first failed romance either."

Victoria's expression darkened visibly. She stood abruptly. "Let's have dinner here tonight. What would you like? I'll start preparations now."

This was typical of Victoria. Whenever she visited, she insisted on cooking herself.

Benjamin suggested, "It's been forever since I've had Aldenrian beef stew."

Liam replied, "Anything's fine."

Victoria turned her sharp gaze on Evelyn, disapproval evident in her tightened lips and narrowed eyes.

Feeling uneasy, Evelyn murmured, "I'm not picky."

Victoria let out a derisive chuckle, planting her hands on her hips. "Really, Evelyn? This is your home. Normally, hosts prepare meals for their guests."

"Are you seriously going to sit there while I cook for you?"

Evelyn felt suffocated by Victoria's domineering presence, as if facing an overbearing sister-in-law. Even Richard and Eleanor had never made her feel this inadequate.

In a small voice, she admitted, "I don't know how to cook."

Victoria countered, "Can you at least wash and chop vegetables?"

"I can wash them, but I'm not good with knives."

Liam took Evelyn's hand and stood, his displeasure palpable. "Neither of you needs to bother. Abigail can handle it."

Victoria remained firm. "You know I never eat food prepared by others."

Leaning close to Evelyn, Liam spoke softly, "Stay here with Benjamin. If you're tired, rest in our room."

Evelyn nodded obediently.

Liam rolled up his sleeves as he joined Victoria. "You stay put."

At that, Victoria finally cracked a smile, mischief dancing in her eyes as they walked toward the kitchen together. "You're always so busy, barely stopping to breathe."

"Unlike your delicate wife who can't even wash vegetables. Planning to spoil her completely?"

Liam ignored her jab.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat dejectedly on the sofa, fidgeting with her sleeve hem. A gnawing worry consumed her - that Liam might eventually find her worthless.

She couldn't cook. She lacked social graces. She preferred solitude. She felt like a dull, useless presence.

Benjamin sipped his coffee, observing Evelyn's melancholy. "Don't mind Victoria. We've known Liam since childhood. Sometimes we forget to filter our words."

Evelyn forced a tight smile. Noticing how casually Victoria treated the surroundings, she ventured, "Where do you all live?"

Benjamin gestured toward the balcony. "Just across the street at Hudson Manor."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Of course. Friends, colleagues, and neighbors. Their effortless closeness suddenly made perfect sense.
###Chapter 257

While Liam and Victoria were busy cooking in the kitchen, Evelyn took out her phone and searched for the advanced stealth aircraft they had discussed earlier. To her surprise, she realized it wasn’t shrouded in secrecy at all.

This prized aircraft was the most advanced aerial weapon globally, boasting unparalleled performance and stealth capabilities.

Yet Aldenria, with all its resources, lacked the expertise and technology to construct such sophisticated weaponry and had to purchase them at exorbitant prices from overseas.

Meanwhile, Benjamin lounged with his coffee, his demeanor relaxed and carefree. His gaze drifted lazily around the room, exuding effortless ease.

Glancing at her phone, Evelyn turned to Benjamin. "Considering the hefty price tag of the advanced stealth aircraft, why don’t we manufacture our own?"

Slightly taken aback by Evelyn’s engagement in the discussion, Benjamin quickly regained his composure, his charming smile returning. "It’s not that simple. Our shortfall lies not in funds but in technology and skilled labor."

Undeterred, Evelyn persisted, "Then why not buy one and reverse-engineer it? It shouldn’t be too difficult to replicate."

Benjamin found Evelyn’s suggestion naive, prompting a chuckle before he caught himself. "No, it’s not that straightforward. You’re oversimplifying."

Evelyn pursed her lips and fell silent.

Benjamin sighed. "It’s not impossible, but our nation lacks such skilled individuals. Compared to other powerful nations, our technology is far behind."

"We’ve sent our brightest minds abroad for education, hoping they’d return to contribute to the country."

"Yet, most of those with real capabilities are lured away by other nations offering better opportunities. Some elites do return, but they rarely make a significant impact."

Evelyn nodded in understanding. "I see."

"What’s your interest?" Benjamin redirected the conversation.

Evelyn gestured toward the bookshelf. "I enjoy reading, drawing, and I can play a bit of piano."

Benjamin nodded, his gaze reflecting comprehension. He now understood why Evelyn didn’t engage in household chores or pursue a career—she had been raised in privilege, unaccustomed to hardship.

Their conversation continued until dinner was ready.

Evelyn ate quietly, listening to the three of them discuss work. She understood their words but felt out of place, as if she didn’t quite belong.

Liam, sensitive to Evelyn’s demeanor, occasionally offered her dishes and gently probed about her preferences, hoping to draw her into conversation.

Yet Evelyn remained silent, focusing on her food.

Throughout the meal, Liam’s attention stayed fixed on Evelyn, worried she might dislike the food, feel uncomfortable, or be bored. He made subtle efforts to ensure her comfort.

"Liam," Victoria asked casually, her tone light, "you’ve known Sally for years, haven’t you? Why did you agree to Margaret’s arranged marriage?"

Liam’s enjoyment of the meal faltered as he frowned at Victoria’s sudden question.

Pretending innocence, Victoria continued, "What’s the matter? Did I say something wrong?"

Benjamin, visibly nervous, leaned closer to Victoria, his teeth clenched as he whispered, "Please, let’s not discuss this."

Evelyn slowly set her utensils down, forcing a tight-lipped smile as she excused herself. "I’m full. Please enjoy your meal." With that, she rose and headed for the door.

Seeing Evelyn leave, Liam sighed, frustration flickering in his eyes as he turned to Victoria. "Is there an issue with me or my wife?"

Dropping her facade, Victoria set her spoon down, her expression turning icy. "Liam, as a friend, I simply can’t comprehend why you married such a woman."

"Aside from her beauty, she seems utterly devoid of any useful qualities. What could possibly have drawn you to her?"
###Chapter 258

Liam's knuckles turned white as he fought to control his rising anger.

Victoria's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "She's completely useless - can't advance your career, can't even take care of herself without you and the servants. She's like an overgrown child."

Her words grew sharper with each sentence. "In your entire relationship, it's always you making the effort while she remains emotionally detached."

"Is it just her pretty face that has you so obsessed?" Victoria's composure cracked, her voice trembling with fury. "Are you satisfied having her as nothing more than decorative furniture in your home?"

"Or is it her bedroom skills that have you so enthralled?" she spat out, her eyes flashing with contempt. "Have you really sunk that low?"

Benjamin froze, his face draining of color as he stared at his twin sister. He couldn't comprehend Victoria's sudden recklessness in front of Liam.

Liam dabbed his lips with a napkin, his pale face contrasting with the fire in his icy gaze. He'd always considered Benjamin a brother and Victoria a close friend.

Tossing the napkin aside, Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You want to know why I married her?"

Both siblings fixed their attention on Liam, waiting for his answer.

"Because I crave her." The words came out rough with suppressed emotion. "That's why."

Victoria looked utterly bewildered. She shot a questioning glance at Benjamin, who could only shrug in equal confusion.

"She's like air to me." Liam's voice thickened. "Even if she doesn't know anything, even if she can't do anything - I can't live without her because losing her would suffocate me." With that, he pushed back from the table and strode toward the door.

For years, he couldn't understand his physical attraction to Evelyn despite loving Cassandra. When pressured by Margaret to marry Evelyn, he hadn't resisted. Instead, he'd accepted the arrangement willingly.

After their first night together, Liam found himself not only comfortable sharing a bed with Evelyn but actively craving her touch. His desire for her only grew stronger with time. It wasn't until he realized she was the woman he'd once loved deeply that everything made sense.

Having been separated from his true love for a decade, having forgotten her identity and even mistaken her for someone else - when their eyes met again after all those years, his mind and heart waged war.

Yet in that moment, his body recognized her instantly.

Liam tore through the garden in a panic, calling Evelyn's name. No response came. Even the security guard confirmed she hadn't left the property.

Heart pounding, Liam sprinted back to the house. He took the stairs two at a time, throwing open every door in his path.

"Cassandra! Where are you?" His voice echoed through the empty rooms. He found her phone in their bedroom, but no sign of Evelyn.

Benjamin stood abruptly as he took in Liam's disheveled state. "What's wrong? Didn't Evelyn just step outside? Maybe she's still in the garden."

Liam's face was a mask of barely controlled panic as he rushed to the study. "She's not out there. The guard confirmed she didn't leave."

Abandoning their meal, Benjamin and Victoria followed Liam to review the security footage.

Victoria frowned. "She only left minutes ago. She couldn't have just vanished."

Liam's fingers flew over the keyboard, his eyes glued to the monitor as fear gripped his heart.

The footage showed Evelyn exiting the house and walking toward the garden gazebo. Then she stepped into a blind spot - and never reappeared on any camera.
###Chapter 259

Liam Blackwood's forehead creased with worry. "How could she vanish without leaving a single clue?"

Victoria Hudson turned away, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Let's search again," she muttered under her breath. "She's nothing but trouble for you."

Though Blackwood Manor wasn't sprawling, a dozen people combed through every inch of the gardens—inside and out—after Evelyn Carter's mysterious disappearance earlier that evening.

Liam was beside himself with distress.

As night fell, two women sat side by side on a bench in a deserted park, the air filled with the rhythmic chirping of cicadas.

One of them wept intermittently, her emotions swinging wildly between joy and sorrow.

Evelyn, growing impatient, finally cut in. "Enough. Can you please stop crying? Who are you? How did you manage to get into Blackwood Manor and take me so easily?"

"You're supposed to know me—to know who I really am. Is it true?"

"I was just overwhelmed," the woman sniffled. "I thought you were dead! A few days ago, I saw your video online, searching for your family."

Evelyn's head throbbed relentlessly. It was already dark, and she had been unconscious for two hours after being taken. Despite enduring half an hour of sobbing, she still couldn’t make sense of the situation.

Exhaling sharply, Evelyn suggested, "How about this? Take me back. Come find me again once you've calmed down. My husband will be frantic if I don’t return."

The woman sniffled again and clutched Evelyn’s hand tightly. "M, I've been searching for you for three years! After all this effort, I’ve finally found you. You can’t leave me again—not even for a second!"

Evelyn blinked. "What did you just call me?"

Seeing Evelyn’s confusion, the woman’s tears spilled over again. "You really have lost your memory. What are we going to do? You’ve forgotten everything—even me."

Evelyn sighed, studying the woman who appeared to be around her age. She was dressed sharply in fitted black pants and a sleek cap, looking nothing like the emotional wreck before her.

She waited in silence, letting the woman compose herself.

After another half hour, the woman finally steadied her breathing. Lowering her voice, she began, "M, I'm Rosalind Baskins. I'm your assistant and bodyguard—I handle everything for you and make sure you're safe."

"Three years ago, when that incident happened… we all thought you were dead."

"But then, a few days ago, a video surfaced online. When I saw you, I cried for an entire day."

"I reported your survival to our superiors immediately. They were overjoyed and sent me to bring you home."

Evelyn was completely lost. "Our superiors? You’re saying you work for me?"

She struggled to keep her voice steady, masking her rising excitement. "Then tell me—who am I? Who are my parents?"

Rosalind pulled out a sleek, high-tech tablet from her backpack and handed Evelyn a pair of headphones, placing the device in her lap.

"This is classified, provided by our superiors. It contains everything about you—and only your iris scan can unlock it. No one else can access it. Try it."

Evelyn took the tablet, watching as the screen prompted for an iris scan. Aligning her eyes with the camera, she heard a soft beep. The screen unlocked instantly.

Meanwhile, Rosalind stood guard, scanning their surroundings with sharp vigilance.

As Evelyn scrolled through the information, her hands began to tremble. Tears welled in her eyes, shock rooting her to the spot.

She couldn’t move.

She couldn’t breathe.

The truth was staring back at her—and it changed everything.
###Chapter 260

A shiver raced down Evelyn's spine, icy fingers of dread tracing her vertebrae as cold perspiration bloomed across her skin.

The artificial voice shattered the silence through her headphones, crisp and clinical.

"Iris recognition confirmed. Welcome to the classified intelligence network, Ms. Wright. How may I assist you today?"

"Ms. Wright?" Evelyn's breath hitched. Though Liam had mentioned this name in passing, she couldn't fathom it belonging to her.

The revelation that followed struck like lightning. Her hands trembled violently as she whispered, "Tell me who I am."

The AI responded with chilling precision: "You are Cassandra Wright, alias Wanda Hoffis. Formerly registered as Victoria Dawson. Age 25, born in Aldenria to an Aldenrian father and Solterran mother."

"You obtained Solterran citizenship at age 14. Graduated with dual doctorates from Solterra National Defense Academy."

"Currently holding top-level clearance as principal chemical weapons researcher and first-class military engineer, designated a national treasure of Solterra."

Evelyn ripped off the headphones, her face draining of color. Tears welled in her wide, unseeing eyes as her lips quivered uncontrollably.

Her heart hammered against her ribs like a caged beast, the staggering truth threatening to crush her.

How could she—who believed herself a discarded orphan—possibly be Cassandra Wright, the woman hunted by intelligence agencies worldwide?

Stumbling to her feet, Evelyn lurched toward Rosalind and thrust the tablet at her.

"You're white as a ghost," Rosalind observed, concern etching her features. "What's wrong?"

Evelyn couldn't breathe. Her chest constricted as if bound by iron bands. "I need... I need to go home," she gasped.

"We'll arrange immediate transport," Rosalind said eagerly.

Evelyn shook her head violently. "No! To Shadowmire Island. To my husband's estate. You've made a mistake—I'm not who you think I am!"

Rosalind seized her wrist with surprising strength. "Cassandra, this system doesn't make errors. If you accessed this data, you are exactly who we've been searching for."

"I've served as your personal security since you were sixteen, until your disappearance at twenty-two. Six years, Cassandra. I'd recognize you anywhere."

Evelyn remained paralyzed by the revelation, gently extricating her arm. "Please... just give me space. I need to think."

Rosalind studied Evelyn's ashen complexion and haunted expression. Perhaps the truth had come too suddenly. "Of course. Let's get you somewhere quiet first."

Guiding Evelyn toward the waiting vehicle, Rosalind murmured, "Your country has waited so long for your return, Cassandra."

Drowning in the maelstrom of emotions, Evelyn heard nothing. Her mind reeled, thoughts scattering like leaves in a hurricane.

When they arrived at Blackwood Manor, a crowd had gathered—soldiers and staff who'd scoured the continent for her.

"Madam's returned!" The sentries erupted in cheers as Evelyn crossed the threshold, their voices thick with emotion.

Then—movement. A blur of dark fabric as Liam crashed into her, crushing her against his chest as if trying to merge their very souls.

Evelyn melted into his embrace, the rigid tension in her limbs dissolving in the warmth of his arms.

Pressed against his pounding heart, silent tears carved paths down her cheeks. The floodgates burst—years of lost memories surging forth, each recollection a fresh wound.

Her body shook with violent sobs, anxiety manifesting in cold sweat and trembling limbs.

Liam held her tighter, his breath ragged against her hair. His voice broke when he finally spoke. "My love, nothing matters except that you're safe. Thank God you came home."
###Chapter 261

The chandeliers in Blackwood Manor cast a golden glow across the grand living room. The antique grandfather clock chimed half past ten.

Evelyn sat curled up on the velvet sofa, cradling a steaming mug of chamomile tea. Liam hovered nearby while the Hudson siblings occupied the adjacent armchairs.

Ryan and Adrian stood sentinel by the marble fireplace. The air hung thick with tension as all eyes remained fixed on Evelyn, waiting for an explanation about her mysterious disappearance.

She took a final sip of tea and met their expectant gazes. Her eyes eventually locked with Liam's.

His jaw was clenched tight, but his stormy gray eyes held that familiar tenderness as he reached to brush a stray curl from her face.

She intercepted his hand gently. "I'm fine," she murmured, taking the handkerchief from his fingers.

"Are you ready to tell us what happened?" Liam's deep voice resonated with barely restrained concern. "How did you vanish from our secured estate? Where were you taken?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the teacup before she gestured toward the French windows.

"There's an ancient oak in the south garden," she began. "I was sitting beneath it when a rope ladder descended from the branches above."

"What?" Liam's brows furrowed.

"Before I could react, a woman rappelled down," Evelyn continued, avoiding eye contact. "I never saw her face—everything went black. I woke up alone in an abandoned amusement park on the city outskirts."

Ryan immediately pulled out his tablet, fingers flying across the screen as he accessed security feeds.

"Did she hurt you?" Liam's voice dropped dangerously low.

Evelyn shook her head, her fingers twisting the fabric of her skirt. "No... she was gone when I came to."

A heavy silence blanketed the room.

Victoria snorted derisively. "That's the most ridiculous story I've ever heard."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, knowing her weak acting betrayed her. The truth was Rosalind had extracted her using a sophisticated pulley system, then transported her in a nondescript van. But she couldn't reveal that.

"Evelyn," Benjamin leaned forward, his diplomatic training evident in his measured tone. "If someone's threatening you, we can help. Your husband commands Norvania's entire military force. No one can touch you here."

She forced wide-eyed innocence. "I've told you everything."

Victoria stood abruptly, her designer heels clicking sharply against the hardwood. "Enough of these childish lies! You clearly staged this whole drama for attention."

Evelyn's throat tightened. The kidnapping wasn't her doing, but her deception made defense impossible.

"I'm sorry to have worried everyone," she whispered, standing to bow slightly before turning toward the grand staircase.

Liam caught her wrist gently. "Let me take you to the hospital, sweetheart," he murmured, using that endearing nickname that now carried new meaning.

She turned back, studying his face—the worry lines etched between his brows, the warmth in his gaze that now made perfect sense. He knew. He'd always known her true identity.

The realization brought bittersweet comfort. All this time, she'd been jealous of... herself. The irony almost made her laugh.

"Just need rest," she said softly, placing a hand over his. The unspoken understanding passed between them.

Though concern still darkened his features, Liam reluctantly released her. As she ascended the staircase, she could feel his protective gaze following her every step.
###Chapter 262

Evelyn climbed the stairs quietly, catching snippets of Liam expressing gratitude to the Hudson siblings. Victoria's displeased tone barely reached her ears.

She entered her bedroom and turned the lock with a quiet click. Perching on the edge of her bed, Evelyn mentally retraced every significant event since her memories returned.

That first moment when Liam's grandmother identified her as Cassandra at the gala - it had been the beginning of countless near-revelations about her true identity.

What unsettled her most was Julian Whitmore. Her own uncle had conspired with outsiders to steal her identity, even posing as her former lover.

Accepting herself as Cassandra Wright had been challenging enough. But M Winkler? The name carried an unbearable weight that made her chest constrict.

Cassandra Wright, alias M Winkler - a Solterran citizen, chemical scientist, and top-tier weapons engineer.

Tears welled up as she gave a resigned smile. She fell backward onto the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling while anxieties swirled in her mind.

In that moment, she wished she could remain ignorant. Just be Liam Blackwood's wife - an ordinary, vulnerable Aldenrian woman.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Are you asleep, Cass?" Liam's voice filtered through the door.

Evelyn remained silent, blinking away tears as she stared at the doorway.

After two unanswered knocks, footsteps retreated down the hallway.

"What should I do now, Liam?" She curled into herself, pulling the duvet tight as silent sobs shook her body.

Morning light found her washing up mechanically. She paused mid-step when opening her bedroom door.

Liam stood waiting, hands in his pockets, his tall frame radiating quiet authority. Even in stillness, he commanded attention with that innate military bearing.

"Morning," he greeted warmly.

Evelyn swallowed before offering a thin smile. "Good morning."

They both knew she'd been awake all night, deliberately avoiding him.

"Let's talk, Cass."

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe. "Come in."

Liam withdrew his hands and strode past her into the room.

Closing the door, Evelyn followed, her fingers twisting nervously.

He turned to face her. "I understood you couldn't speak freely last night with everyone present."

His gaze softened. "It's just us now. Tell me the truth."

Evelyn lowered her head, gathering her thoughts. After a sleepless night of deliberation, she knew exactly what needed saying.

When she looked up, her gaze held steady conviction.

"Why didn't you tell me?" The question hung between them.

Liam's brow furrowed.

"I was Victoria Dawson as a child. After moving countries, I became Cassandra Wright. You knew this all along - why keep it from me?"

Liam's expression darkened. After a beat, he reached for her arm with uncharacteristic hesitation. "I wanted to eliminate the threats against you first."

Evelyn understood his reasoning. Without her memories, the information would have been useless - possibly dangerous if she'd recklessly sought out her family.

She didn't press further. Instead, she closed the distance between them, searching his warm brown eyes before whispering, "So the girl you loved... was always me?"

Liam stared at the face inches from his, his breath hitching. The tips of his ears burned crimson as his gaze grew heated.

Noticing his reaction, Evelyn grinned. "Do you still love me now?"

He exhaled shakily, chest rising and falling rapidly. That familiar electric current between them sparked to life again, leaving him speechless with nervous anticipation.
###Chapter 263

Evelyn waited endlessly, yet the response she longed for never came.

A strained smile touched her lips as she murmured, "It changes nothing. Our marriage remains invalid."

"I do—" Liam's voice cracked with urgency, his words raw with emotion. "I adore you. I'm utterly in love with you."

When she lifted her gaze, she found his eyes bloodshot, his chiseled features flushed crimson. Even the skin behind his ears burned scarlet.

Guilt prickled her conscience—why push this stoic soldier to verbalize feelings when declarations weren't his strength?

He'd probably find it easier to complete a twenty-mile tactical march with full gear than articulate his heart.

Evelyn worried her lower lip between her teeth, vision blurring with unshed tears. Her pulse hammered against her ribs.

This would be her only inquiry—never again would she demand such vulnerability.

She knew Liam cherished her. Had loved her fiercely for over a decade.

Even when she became Evelyn Carter, some inexplicable magnetism drew him to her rather than the impostor Victoria Dawson.

As for her? Her soul must have remembered, falling for him anew despite amnesia's veil.

Biting back emotion, she teased with feigned indifference, "Well... thanks for loving me, I suppose."

His expression crumpled. Clearly dissatisfied with her flippant reply, the light in his eyes dimmed noticeably.

Hands clasped rigidly behind his back, he regained military composure.

After a weighted pause, Evelyn continued, "We'll annul this marriage when convenient."

"Understood," he replied evenly, though his breath hitched.

"Then you'll have been married twice," she jested.

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "The number means nothing. Only whether I can remarry you."

Her breath caught. Heartbeats turned erratic.

In that moment, she yearned to recall their shared childhood—those lost memories must have been magical, euphoric. Nothing less could inspire such devotion.

Tears welled as she met his gaze shyly. "Liam... I'll marry you again as Cassandra Wright," she whispered.

His hands trembled violently. Chest heaving, eyes glistening, he rasped, "Truly?"

Evelyn nodded, smiling through tears. "A simple ceremony—would that suffice?"

"Anything," he choked out, emotion roughening his voice.

Yet conflict shadowed his features. "Are you certain? Does present-day Evelyn want this? Before your amnesia... was there someone else?"

Silence stretched between them.

With visible effort, he steadied his voice. "It's been ten years."

"After you left Aldenria, you grew distant—claimed studies kept you from calls. Then... nothing." His throat worked. "I held no place in your heart. Should we wait for your memories to return?"

True affection wouldn't ghost a decade.

Liam understood perfectly—pre-amnesia Evelyn had felt nothing for him. He refused to let her commit from obligation rather than desire.

His selflessness shattered her.

Here stood a man of integrity—passionate yet principled. Though yearning for her, he prioritized her genuine happiness over his own longing.

Voice thick, she confessed, "I don't need those memories, Liam. I'm content now."

"These past three years contain all I require. Because in them... I've loved only you."
###Chapter 264

"I've only ever loved you."

The words pierced through Liam Blackwood's anxious heart like a thousand needles. A surge of exhilaration flooded his veins, but it came with an undercurrent of restless unease. His joy was tinged with apprehension.

Overcome by emotion, he couldn't stop himself. His hand found its way to the nape of her neck, fingers tangling in her hair.

His lips crashed against hers in a desperate kiss, pouring every ounce of his pent-up affection into the moment.

Evelyn Carter's palms flew to his chest, attempting to create distance between them.

Fearful she might escape, Liam's free arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against his muscular frame.

Her entire body molded against his solid chest. A startled gasp escaped her lips before he claimed them again, kissing her until they swelled. Dizziness overtook her as oxygen became scarce.

His scorching breath against her skin turned her limbs to liquid. She melted into his embrace, surrendering to the intoxicating kiss.

Though passionate, his kisses maintained a thread of restraint.

Each time he approached the brink of losing control, he'd pull back, releasing her with visible effort. Without hesitation, he'd turn away to compose himself elsewhere.

After their meal, the couple visited the civil affairs office where their divorce was finalized without complications. This time, there were no second thoughts or lingering regrets.

During the drive back to Blackwood Manor, Evelyn remained deep in thought. Eventually, she voiced her desire to see her grandparents in person.

Liam respected her wishes but wanted to avoid any potential encounter with Julian Whitmore at Wright Manor. Instead, he sent Adrian Castillo to escort Archibald and Margaret Hoffis to their home.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Evelyn placed the divorce papers on the table and prepared tea. She sat nervously in the living room, anticipation knotting her stomach. Excitement eluded her - only anxiety remained.

Without her memories, she couldn't recall her true feelings toward her grandparents. They were her last living relatives - she couldn't bear losing them.

"This way, Mr. and Mrs. Hoffis," Adrian's voice announced from the entrance.

Evelyn straightened at the sound, her gaze darting toward the door.

Liam sat beside her, his hand enveloping hers in reassurance. "Don't be nervous."

Evelyn bit her lip. "They don't recognize me anymore. Grandmother came before on behalf of that imposter granddaughter. The way she treated me... it hurt."

"If you want to tell them the truth, do it," Liam encouraged. He supported her decisions unconditionally, unwilling to see her suffer any longer.

She shook her head. Revealing the truth would mean exposing everything to Julian and Victoria.

What if Julian became desperate enough to harm her grandparents for the inheritance before she could reclaim her identity? The risk was too great. She only wanted to see them, nothing more.

Under Adrian's guidance, Archibald and Margaret Hoffis entered the living room.

Evelyn rose with a polite smile. "Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Hoffis."

Margaret cast her a fleeting glance before sniffing dismissively. Her demeanor was frosty, eyes flashing with irritation.

Archibald froze the moment he saw Evelyn. His eyes widened in shock.

Hearing her voice deepened his confusion. He stood rooted to the spot, conflict warring across his features as the light in his eyes dimmed.

Noticing his reaction, Margaret interjected sharply, "Stop staring. Your real granddaughter is at home watching television. This is just an uncanny lookalike."
###Chapter 265

Liam ushered them into the grand parlor where antique furniture gleamed under crystal chandeliers. The scent of fresh roses filled the air as they settled on the velvet sofa.

A maid served Earl Grey tea in delicate china cups. Evelyn absently stirred her tea, the silver spoon clinking softly. "Why did you summon us both this time?" she asked coldly, not meeting their eyes.

Her chest tightened painfully. The elderly couple before her were her grandparents, yet they were complete strangers. Their gazes held no recognition, only polite distance.

She glanced up to find Archibald's piercing stare still fixed on her face.

"I apologize, Mr. and Mrs. Hoffis," Evelyn murmured, her fingers trembling around the teacup.

Margaret scoffed, her diamond earrings catching the light. "Save your apologies for our real granddaughter."

Evelyn's throat constricted. She lowered her head, suddenly finding the Persian rug fascinating. "Understood."

The older woman's lips curled in disdain. "Are we done with this charade?"

"How have you both been?" Evelyn tried again, desperate to bridge the chasm between them.

Margaret's teacup clattered against its saucer. "Speak plainly, girl. We're not here for pleasantries."

Evelyn's fingers twisted the lace trim of her blouse. The rejection stung like salt in an open wound. She couldn't tell them. Not yet.

Liam's warm hand enveloped hers, his thumb tracing comforting circles on her wrist.

Archibald remained silent, but his watery blue eyes never left Evelyn's face.

"We're divorced," she whispered, the words tasting like ash.

Margaret's teacup froze midway to her lips. She looked sharply between them. "Is this true?"

Liam's jaw tightened. It killed him to see Evelyn debase herself like this, but he understood. These were the only family she had left.

Suddenly, Margaret's face lit up. She clapped her hands like a child receiving a present. "Why didn't you do this sooner?"

She nudged her husband. "Archibald, say something! Have you lost your tongue?"

The old man snapped out of his trance. "You foolish woman!" he thundered, making the china rattle.

Margaret's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up. "What on earth are you shouting about?"

"I did this for Victoria!" Margaret hissed. "Now that Liam's free, we can finally put this nonsense behind us!"

Archibald trembled with suppressed emotion. His gaze burned into Evelyn before he wrenched it away.

Unperturbed, Margaret turned to Liam with a saccharine smile. "Now that you've delivered this wonderful news, what's next?"

Liam leaned back, his military posture never faltering. "That's not why we're here today, Mrs. Hoffis."

"Then why summon us?"

"To clear up the misunderstanding about Cassandra."

"Cassandra?" Margaret sneered, pointing a jeweled finger at Evelyn. "Isn't that what you call our Victoria?"

Liam massaged his temples. This meeting was proving more painful than he'd anticipated. The truth remained locked away, and Evelyn kept taking the blows.

The tension thickened like fog.

Evelyn schooled her features into calm composure. "Mr. and Mrs. Hoffis, I only wished to meet you and resolve any misunderstandings between us. I don't want you to resent—"

"Oh, my dear child," Archibald interrupted, his voice cracking. Tears glistened in his eyes. "How could we ever resent you? Just... take care of yourself, won't you?"

Liam's head snapped up, his eyes widening in shock at the old man's unexpected tenderness.
###Chapter 266

Liam noticed the flicker of recognition in Archibald's gaze and instantly understood.

Had the shrewd old man seen through the deception at first glance?

Archibald turned to Liam with grave intensity. "Take care of her, Liam," he said quietly.

Liam gave a solemn nod.

"What's wrong with you? He's supposed to marry Victoria! Who are you telling him to protect?" Margaret snapped irritably.

Archibald completely ignored her. Rising from his seat, he announced, "We won't impose on you further. We'll take our leave now. We'll visit again soon."

Margaret looked utterly bewildered.

Liam and Evelyn stood to see them out.

Before entering the car, Archibald couldn't resist turning back for one last look at Evelyn.

Their eyes met in a silent exchange filled with unspoken sorrow and resignation.

As the car disappeared down the driveway, Liam reached for Evelyn's hand with a sigh. "You shouldn't have agreed to meet them."

Evelyn's expression darkened with regret. "I never expected Grandfather would recognize me."

"Archibald Hoffis has always trusted his instincts over anything else," Liam said with a wry smile. "But he understands the situation. He won't reveal anything."

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "We can't let Grandmother know. She wouldn't be able to keep this secret with her temperament."

Liam pulled her into a comforting embrace, gently stroking her hair as he felt her trembling against him.

Evelyn leaned into his warmth, closing her eyes as the ache in her chest gradually eased.

Meanwhile at Wright Manor, Victoria lounged on the sofa, happily munching on snacks while watching entertainment shows.

She was thoroughly enjoying her luxurious life as the heiress of a wealthy family.

Suddenly, Julian stormed downstairs in a rage and snatched the snack bag from her hands.

"How can you just sit here eating and watching TV?" he growled. "The old couple went to Blackwood Manor!"

Victoria froze in shock before scrambling to her feet. "That's fine," she said nervously. "Grandmother has seen her before and didn't recognize her at all."

Julian paced furiously, running a hand through his hair. "You're underestimating Archibald Hoffis," he hissed. "The man built his fortune from nothing. Do you really think he's that easily fooled?"

"Relax," Victoria said with forced casualness. "Even if he suspects something, just have him do a DNA test. You control all the testing centers in the country anyway, don't you?"

Julian glared at her with such intensity that for a moment, he seemed ready to strangle her.

Just then, the sound of a car pulling up outside caught their attention.

Julian and Victoria immediately composed themselves and went to greet the returning couple.

Margaret's cheerful voice rang through the foyer. "Wonderful news, Victoria! Liam's divorced now!"

Victoria rushed forward eagerly. "Really, Grandmother? That's amazing!" she exclaimed, clutching the older woman's hands.

Archibald walked past Julian with an icy expression.

"Father," Julian greeted respectfully with a nod.

Archibald merely acknowledged him with a curt grunt.

"Did you... meet Liam and Evelyn?" Julian asked hesitantly as he followed his father inside.

Archibald settled onto the sofa, his darkening gaze fixed on Victoria as she fussed over her grandmother.

"We did," he said slowly. "If Victoria hadn't told us about her plastic surgery, I might have thought Evelyn was my real granddaughter."

Victoria paled visibly, her hands trembling as she avoided his piercing stare.

With forced laughter, she stammered, "It's just cosmetic surgery! She had it done specially to marry Liam."
###Chapter 267

Julian gave a curt nod, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn's bodyguard clenched his fists involuntarily, jaw tightening with barely contained tension.

At dawn's first light, Liam departed the estate with purposeful strides, his schedule packed with urgent matters.

The vibration of an unknown caller ID made Evelyn's phone buzz insistently.

"Ms. Carter? This is Archibald Hoffis's personal assistant. The elder Mr. Wright requests your presence at his office immediately. We've arranged transportation."

Her eyebrows shot up. "Archibald Wright wishes to see me personally?"

"Indeed. A car will be sent to your location within the hour."

Security protocols kicked in. "Just send the address. I'll arrange my own transport." Her fingers tightened around the phone.

"The coordinates will be texted to you momentarily."

Within minutes, Evelyn was en route with two armored SUVs flanking her vehicle, bodyguards scanning the surroundings.

The convoy merged onto the interstate, sunlight glinting off tinted windows.

Evelyn's mind raced - this summons couldn't be trivial. Archibald never met anyone without cause.

"Ma'am," the lead security agent turned, "should we alert Mr. Blackwood about this meeting?"

She hesitated only a second. "Yes. He should be informed." Her thumb hovered over Liam's contact.

Suddenly the driver's voice turned sharp. "Two hostile vehicles on our six since the last exit. Not standard surveillance protocol."

Evelyn whipped around. The pursuing cars were closing distance aggressively, engines roaring.

"Brace!" The driver slammed the accelerator as metal screeched behind them.

The sudden lurch sent Evelyn's phone skittering across the leather seats. Her vision blurred momentarily from the G-force as their armored vehicle became a bullet on asphalt.

Danger crystallized in her mind. Two bodyguards were insufficient against this orchestrated attack.

One agent already had his satellite phone to his ear when the world exploded.

"Mr. Blackwood, we're under—"

The warning died as a tanker truck swerved into their lane.

Impact.

Evelyn's body became a ragdoll against seatbelts. White-hot pain radiated through her limbs as the world inverted.

Through the haze of semi-consciousness, she registered the deafening boom of igniting fuel, the acrid smell of burning metal.

Then... nothing.

"Wake up, Cassandra."

Evelyn blinked against soft light to see a woman with kind eyes smiling down at her.

"Five more minutes, Mother," she murmured, snuggling deeper into plush blankets.

"Let the child sleep," came a warm baritone. "Being late won't end the world."

She sat up rubbing her eyes, grinning at the distinguished gentleman. "Father spoils me rotten."

"Only fifty days leave this time?" he asked with mock severity.

Evelyn pouted. "The project would collapse without me."

"What exactly is this mysterious project?" her mother prodded.

"That's classified." She winked.

"Not even for your parents?"

"Especially not for my parents."

Her father ruffled her hair affectionately. "Go wash up. We'll drive you to the airfield."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn emerged arm-in-arm with her mother when Julian materialized at the driveway. "Allow me to escort Cassandra."

She shook her head. "Uncle, you're much too busy."

Julian ignored the protest, sliding into the driver's seat. "Nonsense. It's my privilege."

The car hummed with pleasant family chatter, none noticing when the GPS route quietly diverted from its programmed destination.
###Chapter 268

The winding mountain road became increasingly treacherous as the car climbed higher.

Evelyn's fingers dug into the leather seat. "Uncle Julian, are we lost?" Her voice trembled slightly.

His lips curled into a chilling smile. "Not at all."

"Then where—" Her words slurred as a wave of dizziness hit. She turned toward the backseat, only to find her adoptive parents slumped motionless. She hadn't even noticed when they'd lost consciousness.

"Mom... Dad... wake up—"

"Uncle Julian, what did you—"

The car screeched to a halt.

Julian stepped out, his polished shoes crunching on gravel. He yanked her door open and dragged her limp body into the cold night air.

Her limbs felt like lead. As he hauled her toward an unmarked building, she twisted weakly to glimpse shadowy figures in black dragging her parents into the dense woods.

"Mom! Dad!" Her vision blurred at the edges. The world tilted violently as blinding surgical lights assaulted her senses.

A high-pitched ringing filled her ears. Julian's voice cut through the noise like a scalpel. "Don't fight it, Cassandra. Soon you won't remember any of this."

Darkness swallowed her whole.

Agony exploded behind her eyelids—a thousand white-hot needles stabbing through her skull.

"Stay with me, Cass! Look at me!" Liam's desperate voice pierced the haze.

A metallic bang echoed as operating room doors slammed shut. A nurse's muffled voice: "Sir, you must wait outside!"

Machines beeped erratically. The scent of antiseptic burned her nostrils. Every nerve ending screamed as if her skin were being flayed from her bones.

Time lost meaning.

Somewhere in the void, Liam kept calling her name like a prayer. She wanted to answer, but her eyelids weighed more than mountains.

When consciousness finally returned, golden sunlight streamed through half-drawn hospital curtains.

Her body felt alien—heavy and unresponsive. Turning her head took monumental effort. There, in an armchair, Liam slept fitfully, his stubbled jaw tense even in rest. Dark circles bruised his eyes.

Memories of her coma-dreams crystallized with terrifying clarity.

"Liam." The whisper barely left her cracked lips.

He jolted awake as if electrocuted. Bloodshot eyes locked onto hers, disbelieving. His calloused hands trembled as he mashed the nurse call button.

"You're awake." His voice broke. "Thank God, you're finally—"

She withdrew her hand gently. The ghost of a smile touched her lips. "You look terrible."

Liam froze. Tears welled in his eyes as he searched her face—this woman who called him by his given name for the first time in years. Was Cassandra Wright truly back?

"Seven days," he rasped. "You've been out for seven days."

Her smile turned bittersweet. "I think it's been three and a half years."

Liam's broad shoulders crumpled. His tears fell silently onto the sterile sheets, each drop carrying the weight of their stolen time.
###Chapter 269

The medical team flooded into the private hospital suite, their white coats swirling around Evelyn's bed like a snowstorm. Liam found himself pushed aside as they began their urgent examination.

A nurse checked her pupil response while another took her blood pressure. The cardiac monitor beeped steadily as electrodes recorded her heart rhythm. They tested her reflexes, asking detailed questions about any discomfort.

Evelyn answered each query with careful precision, indicating areas of lingering pain. When the flurry of activity subsided, she noticed Liam's absence. Her gaze swept the room just as the physicians exited, leaving only nursing staff behind.

Muffled voices carried from the hallway. "Remarkable recovery," the lead physician was saying. "All vital signs are stable."

"Despite the cranial trauma, her cognitive functions appear intact," another voice added. "We anticipate no long-term complications."

Liam's deeper tone cut through the medical jargon. "She's regained all her memories. Is that...normal?"

There was a thoughtful pause before the doctor responded. "The impact may have realigned neural pathways, reversing previous artificial damage. Memory restoration is an excellent sign, though we'll continue monitoring."

"Thank you," Liam murmured.

When the door clicked shut again, Liam sank into the chair against the wall, his broad shoulders slumping. He dragged both hands down his face, exhaling slowly.

Of course he was relieved she'd awakened. The joy threatened to overwhelm him. But now that Evelyn remembered everything...would she still be the woman who'd professed her love? Who'd wanted to build a life together?

After the last nurse departed, he rose and approached the bed with measured steps. The door closed softly behind him.

Evelyn sat propped against plush pillows, color returning to her cheeks. Her clear eyes met his - no longer the uncertain gaze he'd grown accustomed to, but steady and composed.

Liam's pulse stuttered. He pulled a chair close, the legs scraping against tile. "Any pain?" he asked, voice rough.

"Just tired," she answered, her tone even.

His fingers flexed against his knees. He swallowed hard before meeting her eyes again. "You remember everything?"

A slight nod.

His chest constricted. "Anything you want to tell me?"

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words. Finally, Liam forced a smile. "You should rest. I'll have broth sent up."

Her whisper cut through him like glass. "I'm sorry, Liam."

His hands curled into fists. That single word - sorry - was the one thing he couldn't bear. Apologies always preceded loss.

She continued, gaze lowered. "I never realized...your feelings all those years. To me, you were just the boy next door. That's why I never contacted you. I didn't know."

The admission struck like a physical blow, though he'd anticipated it. He leaned back, jaw tight. "Do you remember these past three years?"

Another nod.

The heart monitor's steady beep marked the passing seconds. Liam studied her face - the woman he loved, yet who now seemed a stranger. The Evelyn who'd chosen him no longer existed. In her place sat someone who remembered every reason why they shouldn't be together.
###Chapter 270

Liam's voice trembled as he asked, "Do you still mean what you said?"

Evelyn avoided his gaze, guilt flashing in her eyes. She remained silent.

The pause stretched between them like an endless chasm. Liam's face, usually so composed, now showed every line of exhaustion and heartbreak. His bloodshot eyes betrayed sleepless nights.

He couldn't bear to hear her answer. The silence at least preserved the fragile hope he clung to.

Finally, she whispered, "No."

A bitter smile twisted his lips. Tears threatened to spill as he fought to maintain control.

Seeing his devastated expression, Evelyn's heart ached. "Liam, you should go home and rest," she suggested gently.

His voice was rough when he spoke. "In such a hurry to be rid of me?"

"That's not what I meant."

He stood abruptly. "I know. Get some rest." Without another word, he strode from the room, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

Evelyn watched him leave, sensing more than just physical exhaustion in his retreating form.

As soon as Liam departed, two nurses entered, with security personnel stationed outside. "Thank heavens you're awake, Ms. Carter," one nurse exclaimed. "Mr. Blackwood was wearing himself to the bone waiting for you."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "What happened to him?"

"He hasn't left your side for days. Barely ate, barely slept. The man looked like death warmed over."

Evelyn clutched the blanket, tears pricking her eyes. Seven days and nights of unwavering vigil.

Now that she was conscious, perhaps he could finally find peace.

Composing herself, she asked, "May I borrow your phone?"

The nurse handed over a mobile. Evelyn dialed from memory. The line connected after two rings.

"Rosalind, it's me."

"Evelyn?" Rosalind's voice spiked with excitement. "How did you get this number? Have your memories returned?"

"Yes."

"Praise the heavens! The real Evelyn is back."

"I need your help."

"Anything, Evelyn. Just say the word."

"I can't return yet. Don't inform headquarters about my condition."

"Understood."

"I'm at the hospital. I'll send the address. Bring the pen gun I gave you."

"Consider it done."

After ending the call, Evelyn returned the phone with quiet thanks.

For the next three days, Rosalind provided round-the-clock care, leaving little for the hospital staff to do.

Liam never returned. Perhaps buried in work, or perhaps too wounded by her rejection.

On the fourth morning, discharge papers in hand, Rosalind packed Evelyn's belongings. "Where are you staying? I'll move in - better protection and care that way."
###Chapter 271

Evelyn Carter stood frozen as the words left her lips. "Rosalind, I'll be staying at your place tonight."

Rosalind Baskins blinked in surprise before letting out an exasperated sigh. "But I've been living in hotels this entire time."

Liam Blackwood's brow furrowed deeply at this revelation. Evelyn took a tentative step forward, her lips curving into a hesitant smile. "What's wrong with your place? Can't we stay there?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn as she stared at the floor. "I divorced Liam as 'Cassandra Wright.' That identity no longer exists, which means I'm technically homeless now."

Rosalind studied her friend with calm detachment. "You're a millionaire several times over. Just buy another property."

Evelyn's shoulders slumped. "This is Aldenria, not Solterra."

Rosalind smacked her own forehead with a chuckle. "God, I'm an idiot. All your assets are tied up in Solterra." Her expression turned serious. "If you try transferring that kind of wealth as Cassandra Wright, you'll have every intelligence agency in Aldenria breathing down your neck."

Evelyn's lips twisted into a wry smile. After a long pause, she confessed in a whisper, "Actually, I'm six hundred thousand dollars in debt."

Rosalind's eyebrows shot up. "To whom?"

"Liam Blackwood."

"Your ex-husband?"

"Yes."

Rosalind crossed her arms. "How did that happen?"

Evelyn's fingers twisted the hem of her blouse. "I borrowed money for a friend whose father needed emergency surgery. I didn't have cash, so I used Liam's card."

Rosalind shook her head slowly, exhaling through her nose. She sank onto the couch beside Evelyn. "Evelyn, your friend could have asked Liam directly. Why involve you?" She gave Evelyn's shoulder a gentle squeeze. "You're still too kind, even without your memories."

The light drained from Evelyn's eyes as she turned toward the balcony. "I'm not kind," she murmured. "I've done terrible things."

"There you go again." Rosalind hauled Evelyn to her feet. "Come on. We'll figure out the hotel situation later."

As they reached the doorway, Liam Blackwood materialized before them like a storm cloud, flanked by two stone-faced aides. Evelyn stopped dead in her tracks while Rosalind stiffened beside her.

Their eyes met - Liam's dark with unspoken emotion, Evelyn's shimmering with unshed tears. He closed the distance between them in three strides. "Are you feeling better?" His voice was rougher than usual.

Evelyn nodded, forcing a tight-lipped smile.

"I came to take you home," Liam said quietly.

She shook her head. "That's not necessary. I'll stay with Rosalind."

Liam's gaze flicked to Rosalind for a brief second before returning to Evelyn's guarded expression. He could read the resolve in her eyes - she'd recovered something from her past that demanded distance between them.

Affecting nonchalance, he asked, "Is there any chance for us in the future?"

Silence stretched between them like a widening chasm. Evelyn's heart hammered painfully against her ribs.

Liam pressed on, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Do you intend to return to your life from three years ago?"

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip as her fingers clenched around fistfuls of fabric. Longing and regret warred within her, but reason won out. As Solterra's top chemical weapons engineer, her duty lay with her country.

Just as Liam served as Aldenria's foremost military strategist. Though their nations weren't at war, their interests would always collide.

Liam's heart shattered at her continued silence. "Was there someone else?" he asked hoarsely. "From before?"

Evelyn's reply came out in a broken whisper. "I'm sorry, Nate."

Liam's lips quirked in a painful imitation of a smile as his vision blurred. He'd be damned before admitting these were tears.

Turning abruptly toward the corridor window, he willed the moisture in his eyes to dissipate. If he didn't look at her, maybe he could pretend this wasn't happening.
###Chapter 272

"I'm sorry..." Evelyn whispered, her voice barely audible.

Liam couldn't bear to watch any longer. His fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Blackwood devoted six months of his life to you. For you, he-"

"Enough," Liam growled, silencing Adrian mid-sentence.

Adrian immediately stepped back, biting his tongue.

Liam forced a casual tone. "Planning to return to Solterra?"

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered. "After I settle the two snakes near Grandpa and Grandma's graves."

Liam scrambled for excuses to keep her in Aldenria. "What about taking over the Wright family business?"

"No."

"Isn't it perfect? Your lover comes to Aldenria while you inherit the family empire. You could stay and spend time with your grandparents."

She offered him a sad smile and shook her head.

His jaw tightened, but he managed to say stiffly, "Then I wish you happiness."

Without another glance, he strode away. Ryan hurried after him.

Adrian remained, his face pale with suppressed anger. He pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn. "I've never met a woman as heartless as you. I know exactly who you are."

His teeth ground together. "Mr. Blackwood has loved you for over a decade. To become worthy of you, he risked his life climbing the ranks. That's how he reached his current position."

"Every time you were in danger, he dropped everything to save you. When you were in that coma, he cared for you day and night-"

Rosalind cut in sharply, "That's enough! What are you trying to do? Guilt-trip her? His sacrifices were his choice. He can't demand repayment."

Adrian glared at Rosalind, who stood her ground. "Mr. Blackwood said nothing about this. All he did was wish her well. Why are you pushing this when he expects nothing in return?"

Adrian threw his hands up. "I- I can't just stand by!"

Rosalind scoffed. "So you'd force her to accept a man she doesn't love because you can't handle the situation?"

A man she didn't love? The words struck Evelyn like physical blows, leaving her disoriented and heartsick.

Before leaving Aldenria years ago, she'd been too young to understand love. She'd only known she was fond of Liam.

But these past three years had changed everything. She'd fallen deeply, irrevocably in love with him.

Even if their relationship was doomed, the last thing she wanted was to hurt him.

Tears welled up instantly. Brushing past Adrian, Evelyn ran after Liam, leaving a startled Rosalind scrambling to follow. "Evelyn? What's wrong?"

Seeing this, Adrian chased after both women.

Liam had reached his car at the hospital entrance. Ryan glanced back. "Mr. Blackwood, Adrian hasn't come out yet."

Liam turned just as Evelyn came running through the doors. He froze, his hands clenching nervously at his sides.

Evelyn reached him, breathless. "Liam, I'm sorry. I-"

He gave her a bitter smile. She'd apologized too many times already. "You've done nothing wrong."

His gaze softened as he looked at her. "Take care of yourself. Leave your grandparents' matter to me."

"But-"
###Chapter 273

"Evelyn, wait up!" Rosalind's frantic voice cut through the air as she sprinted to catch up. Her breath came in ragged gasps as she finally reached Evelyn, doubling over with hands on her knees.

Adrian arrived moments later, his military boots crunching on the gravel path.

Evelyn hesitated under Liam's piercing gaze. The weight of dozens of watching eyes made her throat constrict with unspoken apologies.

She never meant to hurt him. But the truth remained - she couldn't give him what he wanted. All she had left were hollow words of regret.

Liam's eyes flickered briefly to Rosalind before returning to Evelyn. "Evelyn? Is that your real name?"

The question caught her off guard. Memories of her past life flashed through her mind. "It's... a pen name I used when publishing research papers," she admitted quietly.

Of course she'd been published. The woman excelled at everything.

Liam's intense stare never wavered. "You haven't changed. Always extraordinary." With those final words, he turned and entered the waiting vehicle without looking back.

Ryan took the driver's seat while Adrian occupied the passenger side. The car pulled away, leaving Evelyn standing motionless as hot tears blurred her vision.

Rosalind finally caught her breath and leaned in close. "Evelyn, tell me you're not in love with him. That's Liam Blackwood - Aldenria's youngest Defense General!"

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "I'm not," she lied through clenched teeth.

"Thank God." Rosalind pressed a hand to her chest. "Can you imagine the complications if you were?"

"Let's go." Evelyn turned sharply, blinking away stubborn tears.

The sleek black sedan glided through the city streets. Despite the summer heat, the car's interior felt frigid with tension.

Liam reclined with eyes closed, his expression hollow. Up front, Adrian's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "I can't believe her nerve!" he exploded.

"After everything General Blackwood sacrificed - risking his career to extract her from Shadowmire, putting his life on hold every time she needed help - this is how she repays him?"

Ryan placed a calming hand on Adrian's shoulder. "Easy. Let him rest."

Adrian glanced at the rearview mirror, his anger dissolving into concern at Liam's exhausted profile. Seven sleepless nights at Evelyn's bedside, three more days clearing his backlogged workload, then straight back to the hospital - the man was running on fumes.

"You know he could have made her stay," Adrian muttered. "With his connections, it would've been simple."

Ryan shook his head. "That's not love. Real love means wanting someone's happiness, even if it's not with you. The General understands that better than anyone."

Adrian fell silent, turning to stare out the window as the city blurred past.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at Blackwood Manor. Ryan turned in his seat. "Sir, we're home."

Adrian added softly, "General Blackwood?"

Liam rubbed his bloodshot eyes. "Where?"

"Blackwood Manor, sir." Ryan's voice held quiet concern. "You need proper rest. This can't continue."
###Chapter 274

Liam Blackwood massaged his temples and glanced at his wristwatch. His voice was sharp when he commanded, "Pull up Julian Whitmore's records from the past decade."

Ryan Sullivan nodded. "Right away, Mr. Blackwood."

Liam turned to Adrian Castillo. "Adrian, assign a team to keep tabs on Victoria Dawson. I want to know how she and Julian got involved with the Obsidian Circle."

Adrian hesitated, his voice strained. "Mr. Blackwood—"

Liam cut him off. "Also, station guards at Archibald and Margaret Hoffis' residence. I won’t tolerate any threats against them."

Adrian clenched his fists, frustration seeping into his tone. "Sir, you’re already stretched thin with the Aldenrian military. Why waste energy on her family? After what she did to you, she doesn’t deserve your protection."

Liam ignored him. He stepped out of the car and strode into Blackwood Manor, his two assistants trailing behind, their concern palpable.

Adrian called out, desperation lacing his words. "Mr. Blackwood, please—just rest. You need sleep."

"I’m fine," Liam replied curtly.

He wasn’t.

Exhaustion weighed on him, but he refused to close his eyes. Every time he did, Evelyn’s face haunted him, twisting his chest with a pain that robbed him of rest.

He settled at his desk and flipped open a file. "Both of you have work to do."

"Mr. Blackwood—" Adrian slammed his fist against the wall in frustration.

Ryan studied Liam with a grim expression, sympathy tightening his features.

Liam’s voice was cold but weary. "Leave."

The two exchanged a glance before obeying.

Outside, Adrian’s anger boiled over. He punched the car door, the metallic thud making Ryan flinch.

Ryan scowled. "You’re paying for that."

Adrian whirled on him. "How can you care about a car right now?" His voice cracked. "He’s not a machine, Ryan! He’s human—he hurts, he bleeds, he breaks!"

Ryan exhaled heavily. "What do you want me to do? He won’t drink, won’t sleep. Work is the only thing numbing the pain."

Adrian’s gaze flicked toward the hospital. "I’ll drag her back here myself."

Ryan grabbed his arm. "Grow up. This isn’t your call. He’s handled things his way for years. Let him."

Adrian yanked open the car door and dropped into the passenger seat, jerking the seatbelt violently as if it were to blame.

Ryan slid behind the wheel. Before driving off, he dialed Benjamin Hudson.

Thirty minutes later, Benjamin arrived at Blackwood Manor with a crate of whiskey. He pushed open the study door without knocking.

Liam lifted his head, arching a brow at the intrusion.

Benjamin grinned and thumped the crate onto the desk. "Drink with me."

Liam barely glanced at the bottles before returning to his documents. "Get those out of here."

Benjamin perched on the edge of the desk, leaning in. "When was the last time you had a drink?"

Silence.

Benjamin uncapped a bottle and slid it toward Liam. "If you consider me a friend, you’ll drink."

Liam shut the file and leaned back, studying Benjamin with narrowed eyes. "What did my men tell you? Ryan or Adrian?"

Benjamin chuckled awkwardly. "Doesn’t matter. You’re drowning in misery after the divorce. Time to drink it away."

Liam smirked, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes. "I’m not that weak."

Benjamin’s grin faded. "No. You’re just that stubborn."
###Chapter 275

Benjamin swirled the amber liquid in his glass before answering, "You're wrong about that."

Liam exhaled slowly, his fingers tracing the rim of his untouched drink. "Love seems trivial in the grand scheme of things. Marriage or no marriage - it hardly matters in the end."

A dry chuckle escaped Benjamin's lips as he took another sip. He moved toward the leather sofa, sinking into its cushions with one leg crossed over the other.

"You're remarkably composed. The rumors made it sound like you'd be devastated. Doesn't divorce affect you at all?"

Silence stretched between them as Liam reached for a crystal decanter on his desk. He placed it firmly on the coffee table before Benjamin.

"Take this home. I'm not in the mood for company tonight." Liam's voice was clipped as he returned to his paperwork without another glance.

Benjamin studied his friend over the rim of his glass, the alcohol warming his throat but doing nothing to ease the tension in the room.

He'd come expecting shared drinks and confessions, yet found himself drinking alone.

Liam hadn't touched a single drop.

When the room began to tilt slightly, Benjamin set down his glass with a decisive click. "This is pointless. I thought you'd be drowning your sorrows after the divorce, but clearly I misjudged the situation."

Liam's pen continued scratching across documents without pause.

Pushing himself up, Benjamin straightened his jacket. "I'm heading out, Liam. Call me when you're ready for that drink."

The study door clicked shut behind him.

Suddenly, the room felt too quiet, too empty.

Exhaustion crashed over Liam like a wave. He dropped his pen, rubbing his temples as he leaned back in his chair, eyes closing against the dim lighting.

In the stillness, his chest grew heavier with each breath.

Evelyn's face haunted him - that persistent ache behind his ribs that never quite faded.

Not sharp enough to cripple him, but constant enough to make every breath feel like effort.

This longing had become a chronic condition.

Like water slowly coming to boil, the pain had crept up on him until he was drowning in it.

Every moment brought fresh reminders - the ghost of her perfume, the empty space beside him in bed.

He could survive without her. He would survive.

The sudden ringing of his phone shattered the silence. Liam blinked at the unfamiliar number before answering, his voice rough. "Who is this?"

"Liam? It's Evelyn." Her voice sent electricity down his spine.

He sat up sharply, fingers tightening around the phone. "Evelyn? Is everything all right?"

A pause. Then, "Do you still have my phone and documents there?"

"Yes."

"Could you have someone bring them to me?"

Silence stretched between them.

"There's also some clothing I left behind," she continued. "They're still in good condition. Would you mind having them packed with my things?"

Liam exhaled slowly. "The housekeeper is on leave. Ryan and the others are tied up with assignments. You could come get them yourself."

"All right then," she murmured.

His pulse jumped. "When are you free? I can pick you up."

Surprise colored her voice. "Aren't you busy?"

"I am."

"Then I'll manage. I remember the passcode."

"Fine."

The line hummed with uncomfortable silence.

"If that's all..." Evelyn began.

"Wait." The word burst from him before he could stop it.

A soft intake of breath. Then, "Yes?"

That single syllable held more emotion than he'd heard from her in weeks.

Liam stared out the window at the city lights, his throat tight. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper. "Those ten years you were gone... were you happy?"
###Chapter 276

"I've been managing," Evelyn replied quickly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Liam's chest tightened painfully. He shut his eyes briefly, his words coming out strained. "Where did you study? Where did you work? You—"

"Liam," she cut him off, her tone weighted with unspoken emotions. "That's all in the past now. There's no use revisiting it."

But was it truly the past?

His lips pressed into a thin line as he fought the urge to push further.

For ten long years, there were countless things he'd wanted to say to her. He needed to know she was safe, happy—to learn every detail of the life she'd lived without him.

Even if it meant just being a concerned friend. A neighbor who cared.

"Liam," she said softly, "goodbye."

Silence stretched between them before the line went dead. A foolish part of him still hoped she'd call back.

Evelyn hadn't mentioned when she'd come for her things. Maybe she never intended to see him again.

After a long moment, Liam set his phone down gently. He moved to the window, staring blankly at the horizon.

His tall frame looked strangely isolated in the quiet room. Like a mighty oak stripped bare of its leaves.

Two days later.

The evening sky burned crimson as sunset painted Blackwood Manor in warm hues.

A car pulled up at the gates. Rosalind stayed inside while Evelyn entered alone.

Stepping into the familiar foyer sent a wave of nostalgia crashing over her. Swallowing hard, she quickened her pace.

The manor was unusually empty of staff. Evelyn climbed the stairs and pushed open the master bedroom door.

Given Liam's hectic schedule, she assumed he wouldn't be home.

Her fingers trailed over the vanity she'd once used, lingering for a heartbeat too long before moving to the closet.

She retrieved her suitcase and began packing methodically—folding clothes, gathering documents, tucking away mementos.

When everything was neatly arranged, she grabbed the suitcase handle and turned to leave.

Descending the stairs, she froze mid-step at the sight before her.

Liam sat motionless on the living room sofa, his back to her. He didn't react to her presence.

Her pulse quickened as she approached cautiously, studying his familiar silhouette. An uneasy flutter stirred in her chest.

"Liam," she murmured. "I didn't expect you here."

Silence.

Unable to see his expression, she continued, "I came to collect my things."

His voice trembled slightly. "Will we ever see each other again?"

The raw pain in his words sent a sharp pang through her heart. Her nose tingled with unshed tears.

She wanted to see him too.

For three years she'd secretly admired him, yearning to stay by his side every single day.

Even now, with her memories restored, that longing burned brighter than ever.

Those feelings had never faded.

Yet she knew they were like two ships passing in the night—destined never to meet.

Their worlds were at odds. If she returned to her work, even speaking to him could brand her a traitor.

What was the point of clinging to something with no future?

Tears welled in her eyes as she forced the words out. "I'm so sorry, Liam. I think... we should stop contacting each other. Go our separate ways, like before."

His reply came heavy with sorrow. "Of course. I understand."
###Chapter 277

Evelyn stepped out of Blackwood Manor, her suitcase wheels scraping against the cobblestone path.

Rosalind emerged from the sleek black sedan, swiftly taking the luggage and loading it into the trunk.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelyn gazed at the sprawling estate through the tinted windows. Unexpected tears blurred her vision as a strange heaviness settled in her chest.

Each breath felt like swallowing shards of glass. The memory of Liam haunted her like a persistent ghost.

Rosalind started the engine, the purr of the luxury car vibrating through the seats. "Evelyn, when are we returning to Solterra?" she asked, adjusting the rearview mirror.

Evelyn kept her eyes fixed on the disappearing mansion. "Did you file the report already?" Her voice was deceptively calm.

"Yes," Rosalind admitted, fingers tightening on the steering wheel. "Solterra needs you. They're expecting your immediate return."

A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips as she exhaled sharply. "You shouldn't have been so hasty."

"Why not?"

"There are matters here that require my attention. This isn't something that can be resolved overnight."

Rosalind merged onto the highway. "The government won't pressure you for an immediate return."

Evelyn rested her temple against the cool window. "No one can force me, true. But have you considered the spies in Solterra?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "What happens if news of my survival leaks?"

Rosalind's knuckles turned white. The realization of her mistake hit like a physical blow. "W-what do we do now?" she stammered, panic creeping into her voice.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, scrolling with practiced indifference. "We adapt. One step at a time."

"What's our first move?"

"Money." Evelyn's fingers flew across the screen. "We need to settle debts before anything else."

Rosalind nodded, though finances were the least of her concerns. Solterra's government would fund them indefinitely - but that would leave a paper trail. For now, they needed to rely on Evelyn's resources.

Evelyn accessed a dormant cloud account, untouched for three years. After a brief search, she transferred files to Rosalind's device.

"I've uploaded translated versions of my chemistry manuscript," Evelyn explained, setting her phone aside. "Six languages. They should fetch a decent price."

Rosalind knew about Evelyn's side projects - the academic translations between weapons development and her sporadic art donations.

"How much per copy?"

Evelyn frowned in thought. "The Aldenrian edition I did previously sold for six figures. Negotiate with publishers for current rates."

"Understood." Rosalind hesitated. "Why not sell your paintings instead? A single canvas could cover all debts."

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "Art proceeds go to charity."

"Then what about-"

"Military blueprints?" Evelyn's glare could melt steel. "Have you lost your mind? I don't need fortunes - just enough to survive."

Rosalind shrank in her seat. "I only meant-"

"How about I sell hydronium formulas instead?" Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "I could buy Valtoria by sundown."

"That's not what I meant!" Rosalind's voice pitched higher. "I'm just worried about your situation. You still owe Liam six hundred thousand."

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed marginally. "I've survived worse."

"You've endured enough these past three years."

"Every scar teaches a lesson."

Silence filled the car.

One week later.

Liam lay in his hospital bed when his phone chimed. The notification showed a deposit - six hundred thousand cleared.

He stared at the screen, confusion knitting his brow.

The phone rang moments later. "Hello?" His voice was rough from disuse.

In her modest apartment, Evelyn clutched a worn teddy bear to her chest. Her pulse roared in her ears as she finally heard the voice she'd dreamed of for years. "Liam... it's me."
###Chapter 278

Liam remained silent for a long moment before letting out a noncommittal hum.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her fingers absently tracing the worn fabric of the teddy bear in her lap. "I transferred six hundred thousand dollars to your account," she whispered.

Another indifferent hum came through the line. His detached tone sent icy fingers creeping down Evelyn's spine.

She wanted to keep her distance, to sever all ties completely. Yet the warring emotions inside her chest threatened to tear her apart.

The longing was unbearable. She ached to see him again. When words failed her, she simply murmured, "Never mind. Goodbye."

The line went dead before she could say more.

Evelyn stared at the darkened screen, hot tears spilling down her cheeks unchecked.

Across the coffee table, Rosalind paused mid-bite, potato chip suspended in air as she took in Evelyn's sudden breakdown.

"Evelyn?" Rosalind's voice softened with concern. "What did he say to make you cry like this?"

Snatching up her phone, Evelyn swiped at her damp face. "I'm not crying. My tear ducts are just... malfunctioning again."

Rosalind arched an eyebrow. "And what exactly triggered this particular malfunction?"

Evelyn's lower lip trembled. "He barely said anything! Just those infuriating little hums."

A surprised laugh burst from Rosalind's lips. She shook her head in disbelief. "You never cease to amaze me. You cry over nightmares, failed experiments, bad takeout, even when your driving instructor yells at you."

She popped another chip into her mouth. "But this? Crying over Liam's grunts? Maybe we should get those tear ducts surgically removed."

Evelyn sank into the couch cushions, pressing her palms against her closed eyelids. A bitter chuckle escaped her. "You should've seen me as a child. I was worse - a proper little drama queen always craving attention."

Rosalind smirked. "No surprise there. Spoiled rich girl with no real problems. Must be nice to have the luxury of crying over nothing."

Evelyn's lips curved despite herself. "Liam used to panic whenever I cried. He'd get so flustered, not knowing what to do." Her smile faded as she added softly, "And when I'd flirt with him..."

Rosalind leaned forward, intrigued. "What would he do then?"

Evelyn turned away, burying her face in the couch cushions as fresh tears spilled over. Those once-sweet memories now tasted like ash on her tongue.

She'd been the golden child - adored by parents, doted on by grandparents, popular at school, teachers' pet. When Liam showed her special attention, she'd mistaken it for brotherly affection. Back then, she hadn't understood the truth of their feelings.

The shrill ring of a phone shattered the moment.

Evelyn's head snapped up, hope flaring - only to watch Rosalind answer her own device.

As Rosalind listened, her expression grew grave. "Understood," she said before hanging up.

Her dark eyes met Evelyn's. "It's your grandfather. He's critically ill."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "But he was perfectly healthy when I saw him last! How could this happen?"

Rosalind's jaw tightened. "My contact at Wright Manor says his condition's been kept secret. Only the family doctor and your uncle are treating him - no hospitals."

Evelyn shot to her feet, hands shaking with rage. "That bastard! Is he trying to kill my grandfather?"

Rosalind stood as well. "It looks like he's eliminating your grandparents to help that imposter seize control of your family fortune." She gripped Evelyn's shoulders. "We can't wait. We need to move now."

Evelyn's fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms. "You think I don't know that? But what about my parents? If I reveal myself, they'll be the first targets. And my grandparents won't be safe either."
###Chapter 279

"What's our destination?"

Evelyn hesitated briefly before turning to Rosalind. "We're staying at Wright Manor," she declared.

Rosalind's expression turned incredulous. "Wright Manor? Are you out of your mind?"

Evelyn sighed. "It's the only way you can protect my grandparents properly."

Without another word, Rosalind marched inside to pack their belongings.

An hour later, in the grand foyer of Wright Manor, Evelyn and Rosalind stood with matching designer suitcases at their feet.

The staff exchanged bewildered glances, their skepticism palpable as they observed the unexpected guests.

Margaret was equally stunned, her eyes fixed on the luggage with undisguised shock. The absurdity of the situation nearly made her laugh.

"Since when did Wright Manor become a homeless shelter?" Margaret's voice dripped with contempt. "What makes you think you can just waltz into my home? The audacity is both laughable and pathetic."

Evelyn remained composed. "Grandmother, I'm recently divorced with nowhere to go. I only hoped to stay here temporarily."

Margaret let out a derisive snort. "Winston, show these trespassers out," she commanded the butler.

As they turned to leave, Evelyn murmured just loud enough to be heard, "Fine, I'll just return to Liam's estate then."

Margaret's hand shot up. "Wait!"

Evelyn and Rosalind exchanged a knowing glance before turning back, faint smiles playing on their lips.

After a tense silence, Margaret relented. "The family owns several properties. Take your pick. Or stay at any five-star hotel you prefer."

Evelyn shook her head, adopting an innocent tone. "I only have eyes for Blackwood Manor and Wright Manor. If not here, then Blackwood it is."

Margaret's face darkened with fury. "You're utterly shameless."

Unfazed, Evelyn turned to Rosalind. "What did Liam say earlier?"

Rosalind cleared her throat dramatically. "Mr. Blackwood said he wants to reconcile and remarry you."

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly. "Well, that's not entirely off the table—"

Margaret's voice thundered through the hall. "Winston! Prepare the east wing guest suites immediately!"

Evelyn's smile could have lit up the room. "Thank you, Grandmother."

She handed her luggage to a maid and grabbed Rosalind's hand, leading the way upstairs.

Every step through the familiar halls twisted Evelyn's heart. She never imagined returning to her childhood home under such circumstances, facing such hostility from her own flesh and blood.

Two hours later, Victoria returned from shopping to find the mansion filled with her latest designer purchases. Her satisfaction evaporated when she learned about their new "houseguests."

Discovering it was Evelyn sent her into a rage.

Victoria's scream echoed through the halls. "I never consented to this! Get them out now!"

Julian rushed back from the hospital upon hearing the news.

In the grand parlor, Evelyn and Rosalind sat calmly sipping tea while chaos erupted around them.

Victoria stood fuming, her expression murderous as she vowed to remove them at any cost.

Julian, though initially shocked, seemed more intrigued than angry.

Yet suspicion nagged at him. No matter how desperate Evelyn might be, moving into Wright Manor made no sense. Especially accompanied by this mysterious woman.

Victoria pointed at the door, her voice dangerously low. "Leave. Now."

Evelyn rose gracefully, her smile razor-sharp. "Your grandmother invited us. You have no authority here."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "Evelyn, what game are you playing? What sick scheme is this?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Ms. Wright, when it comes to scheming, I'm just an amateur compared to you. Don't worry - I simply couldn't sleep knowing you stole my husband."

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "So I decided to move in and make your life miserable. Consider it... therapy."
###Chapter 280

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. "I stole your husband?"

Julian nodded, his expression pained. "Yes, you took him from me. When our marriage ended, he admitted he'd never stopped loving his childhood sweetheart."

Rosalind's face contorted in confusion as she instinctively stepped closer to Liam.

Liam adjusted his glasses with a smirk, his dark eyes glinting dangerously. "How long do you plan to stay?"

"Until I find closure from my failed marriage," Evelyn replied calmly.

"Make yourself at home then," Liam commanded.

Victoria exploded, "Uncle Liam, have you lost your mind? She's clearly scheming something!"

Liam's icy glare silenced her immediately.

Evelyn noticed Victoria shrink back in fear.

Pointing at Rosalind, Liam demanded, "And who's this?"

Evelyn squeezed Rosalind's hand. "This is my dear friend Rosalind Baskins. She's fallen on hard times and needs temporary shelter."

Rosalind raised an eyebrow at Evelyn's carefully chosen words.

After introductions, Evelyn guided Rosalind toward the staircase.

Pausing beside Victoria, Evelyn whispered, "I look forward to your... hospitality."

Victoria's lips curled into a venomous smile. "Evelyn, do lambs usually walk willingly into the wolf's den? You could've stayed away."

Evelyn remained composed. "Who's the lamb and who's the wolf? The game hasn't even begun."

With that, Evelyn ascended the grand staircase.

Victoria watched her go, unease coiling in her stomach.

This was undoubtedly Evelyn - same face, same voice. Yet something felt different.

There was a new steel in her spine, an unshakable confidence that hadn't been there before.

Upstairs, Evelyn secured their room.

Meanwhile, Victoria confronted Liam. "Why let them stay? This is obviously a trap!"

Liam smirked. "When prey walks into your territory, you don't turn it away."

Victoria crossed her arms. "She's not as helpless as you think."

"What trouble could two defenseless women possibly cause at Wright Manor?" Liam countered.

Victoria fell silent, deep in thought.

As night fell, Evelyn double-checked all locks before preparing for bed.

After reading for an hour, she turned off the lights.

Just as sleep claimed her, a noise startled her awake.

Her eyes flew open to see a dark figure pinning her down.

A scorching hand clamped over her mouth. The familiar scent made her heart race.

She struggled weakly against the crushing weight.

Heat radiated from the intruder through her thin nightgown.

"Mmm!" Evelyn's muffled cry went unheard.

"Have you lost your mind?" The man's voice burned with fury. "Coming to Wright Manor was your worst mistake."
###Chapter 281

Evelyn's fingers curled around the concealed pistol beneath her pillow. As she aimed it at the shadow looming over her bed, a familiar voice stopped her cold.

"Chubs." Liam's raspy whisper made her freeze.

She instantly withdrew the weapon, her pulse hammering against her ribs. His presence alone calmed her, but something felt wrong. His skin burned through the thin fabric of her nightgown, his breath scorching her neck.

When she tried to speak, his calloused palm muffled her words. Liam had already detected the weapon's outline beneath the pillow. Moonlight glinted off the sleek metal as he pulled her hand free.

"You really think this toy can protect you?" His voice held no mockery, only exhaustion.

Evelyn yanked her wrist back, but his grip tightened. The "pen" was her masterpiece - a deceptively elegant firearm she'd engineered years ago.

Liam finally released her mouth. She gasped for air. "Have you lost your mind? Do you realize I almost—" Her voice cracked. She'd nearly shot the man who'd saved her life twice.

"Almost what?" His lips curved without humor.

Evelyn changed tactics. "Why are you here?" Her fingers brushed his forehead. "You're feverish."

He jerked away, hauling her upright. "We're leaving. Now."

She planted her feet. "How did you even get in?" Her gaze darted to the balcony doors - unlocked despite her precautions.

Liam scoffed. "Those flimsy locks wouldn't stop a determined housecat."

Evelyn hummed noncommittally. No security could thwart real danger, and they both knew it.

When he tugged her toward the balcony again, she resisted. "I'm not going."

Moonlight sculpted his sharp features as he studied her. Though shadows hid his expression, the steel in her voice gave him pause.

"Cassandra, my team's secured Wright Manor. Your grandparents are safe."

"Then why is Grandfather suddenly ill?" Her bitter smile sliced through him.

Liam's silence spoke volumes.

She softened. "Thank you for trying, Liam." The way moonlight haloed his broad shoulders made him look like some avenging angel.

"Come with me." Each word carried the weight of a vow.

"I can protect myself." Her declaration hit like a physical blow.

Liam's breath hitched, triggering a coughing fit that shook his entire frame.

"Damn it, you're sick!" Evelyn reached for him again. This time, he didn't resist. His skin scorched her palm.

"I'm fine." His voice sounded like gravel.

"Seen a doctor?"

"I said I'm fine."

"So that's a no." Her fingers trembled against his wrist. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

His bitter laugh chilled her. "Since when do you care?"

The question stunned her into silence. Evelyn spun toward the bedside lamp, flooding the room with golden light. What she saw stole her breath.
###Chapter 282

Liam looked as striking as always, though his complexion had lost its usual glow. His lips were cracked and pale.

"Liam, wait here. I need to change." Evelyn quickly pulled some clothes from the wardrobe and disappeared into the bathroom.

Liam had no clue what she was planning. He just wanted her to come away with him. Moments later, Evelyn emerged wearing different attire. She stuffed essentials into a small backpack before approaching him.

"Let's go, Liam."

"You're actually coming with me?" His voice held surprise.

"No, I'm taking you to see a doctor. Everyone's asleep now. We'll sneak out through the front entrance." She reached for his arm.

"I don't need a doctor." He pulled his hand away sharply. "I'm fine."

"You're clearly ill, yet you claim you're fine?" Evelyn's voice rose in frustration.

"That's none of your concern," Liam replied icily.

Evelyn glared at his haggard face, her heart twisting painfully. Tears pricked at her eyes. "If my wellbeing isn't your business, then what right do you have meddling in my affairs?"

Her words cut through Liam like razor blades. The pain was unbearable.

He clenched his fists, staring at the ceiling with red-rimmed eyes. After a shaky breath, he murmured, "Cassandra, must you always be so stubborn?"

After a tense silence, Evelyn forced a bitter smile. "Liam, do you even recognize who I am now that my memories have returned?"

Liam met her tear-filled gaze.

"It's been ten years since we last saw each other. You don't know me at all. No, you don't know Cassandra Wright," she stated firmly.

"You're right," Liam admitted with a hollow laugh, his voice fading. "You're neither the Cassandra I knew nor the Evelyn after amnesia. I... I don't know you anymore."

The crack in his voice shattered Evelyn's heart. She instinctively reached for his hand. "Liam."

He jerked away, stepping back. Bloodshot eyes burned into hers. "Take care of yourself."

Turning toward the balcony, he pushed open the glass door—only to stumble. His hand barely caught the doorframe in time.

"Liam!" Evelyn rushed forward just as his body collapsed against hers. She barely managed to drag his unconscious form to the bed, gasping for breath.

"Liam?" She shook him gently before pressing a hand to his forehead. His skin burned with fever, his entire body drenched in cold sweat.

Panicked, Evelyn grabbed her phone and scrolled for Rosalind's number. But her finger hovered over the call button, hesitation freezing her in place.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn knew telling Rosalind would be useless. She reached for her phone to call Ryan instead.

With trembling fingers, she activated speaker mode and placed the device on the nightstand. A damp tissue crumpled in her other hand as she dabbed at Liam's feverish forehead.

"Hello?" Ryan's voice came through thick with sleep.

"It's me, Evelyn."

"I can see that. Do you know what time it is?"

"Has Liam been ill?" Her voice cracked with worry.

"For nearly a week now." A frustrated sigh crackled through the speaker. "He refuses medical attention, won't take medication, and keeps pushing himself. Adrian and I tried reasoning with him..."

"He collapsed at my place. What should I do?" Evelyn knelt beside the bed, her fingertips brushing Liam's burning skin.

"General Blackwood went to Wright Manor looking for you?" Ryan's tone sharpened instantly.

"Yes." The sight of Liam's ashen face made her chest constrict painfully.

A sharp slap echoed through the phone. "This is completely reckless! The General never acts like this. What is it about you that makes him lose all sense?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Ryan, please. Should I call a doctor here, or can you come get him?"

"Absolutely not. If anyone at Wright Manor discovers the General came searching for you, our mole will be compromised."

"I understand." Her gaze flicked to the digital clock. 3:17 AM. Getting medical help now would raise too many questions.

"Do you have any medication?" Ryan asked.

"Yes."

"Give him fever reducers and cold medicine. Let him rest. He'll leave on his own when he wakes."

"Alright."

The call ended. Evelyn crept to the bathroom where she kept her first aid kit. Returning quickly, she locked the bedroom door behind her.

She carefully removed Liam's shoes and socks, lifting his legs onto the bed before covering him with the duvet. The pill bottle rattled as she shook out a capsule.

"Liam, you need to take this." She cradled his head gently. "Liam?"

When he didn't respond, she tried pouring water into his mouth. It trickled down his chin, soaking into the pillowcase. Panic clawed at her throat - every wasted second felt dangerous.

"Please wake up." Her voice broke.

After wiping his face, she steeled herself. Placing the capsule between his lips, she took a sip of water and leaned down.

Their mouths met. She felt the capsule dissolve as the water transferred. But she didn't pull away immediately.

Tears slipped from her closed eyes, splashing onto his stubbled cheeks. His warm breath mingled with hers in the quiet room.

When she finally drew back, her vision blurred. Her fingers traced the familiar contours of his face - the arch of his brows, the straight bridge of his nose, the curve of his lips.

Each touch sent electric currents through her fingertips, vibrating through her entire body with painful longing.
###Chapter 284

Evelyn's voice trembled as she whispered, "Liam, please be alright. Stay with me." She bit down on her lower lip until she tasted blood. Hot tears streamed down her face, dripping onto the sheets below.

The salty tang of her tears snapped her back to reality. With shaky hands, Evelyn wiped her face roughly, smearing the moisture across her cheeks.

She sprang from the bed with sudden urgency. In the bathroom, she grabbed a washcloth and ran it under cool water. Liam's fever had broken, leaving his body drenched in sweat. Every few minutes, she'd press her palm to his forehead, then wipe away the perspiration.

Thirty minutes later, his clothes were completely soaked through. His temperature had finally stabilized, but now he risked catching a chill.

Evelyn paced the room, phone clutched in her sweaty palm. She kept checking Ryan's contact information, then glancing at the antique clock on the wall. 5:07 AM.

Dawn hadn't yet broken over Wright Manor, but the staff would already be stirring. If Ryan came now, he'd be seen immediately.

Making a decision, Evelyn climbed back onto the bed. Her fingers trembled as she pulled back the covers and began unbuttoning Liam's shirt.

"Forgive me," she murmured. "Your clothes are drenched. I have to get you dry or you'll get sick again. That's all this is, I promise." The words were as much for herself as for him.

Liam's sculpted chest came into view, each defined muscle glistening with sweat. Even unconscious, his body radiated raw power and masculine perfection.

Evelyn had seen him shirtless before, but never like this. Never when she had to touch him. Her hands shook as she struggled with the damp fabric, finally wrestling it off with a frustrated huff.

Then her gaze dropped lower.

Her pulse skyrocketed. Heat flooded her cheeks and ears. His pants were just as soaked. Should she...?

"What's wrong with me?" She pressed her burning face into her hands. "He's sick. This is medical care, not... whatever my imagination is suggesting."

Steeling herself, she reached for his belt buckle. But no matter how she tugged, the wet fabric clung stubbornly to his hips.

In her struggle, her fingers brushed against something firm and unmistakable beneath the fabric. She squeezed her eyes shut, mortified. The prominent bulge made her want to vanish into thin air.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn swung one leg over his thigh for better leverage. She gripped his waistband tightly, preparing for another attempt.

A hoarse voice shattered the silence. "Evelyn... what exactly are you doing?"

She froze. Her wide eyes met Liam's half-lidded gaze. Fire raced across her skin as she realized their compromising position. If the ground opened up and swallowed her whole at that moment, it would be too kind.
###Chapter 285

My cheeks burned crimson. Words failed me completely.

Liam's eyelids drooped heavily. Within moments, he'd drifted back to sleep, though he instinctively lifted his hips to allow me to remove his trousers down to his thighs.

Taking a steadying breath, I whispered, "Liam? Are you awake?"

Only his even breathing answered me. After hesitating briefly, I carefully slid his pants off completely. Grabbing a damp towel, I began wiping down his feverish body with quick, efficient strokes. I repeated the process several times until his skin finally cooled to a normal temperature.

Nearly an hour later, I managed to get some fever medication between his lips. Exhaustion weighed on me after the sleepless night of nursing him. As dawn broke, I collapsed onto the bed beside him, instantly succumbing to sleep.

A deafening clap of thunder jolted Liam awake. He blinked groggily toward the balcony windows, only now noticing the violent storm raging outside.

The wall clock read 10:37 AM. Scanning the unfamiliar room, fragmented memories of collapsing at Wright Manor surfaced. When he attempted to sit up, an unexpected weight pinned him down.

A petite figure lay sprawled across his torso, her face obscured by cascading chestnut hair.

He couldn't determine if it was Cassandra. Every muscle ached with weakness. His throat burned with thirst, each swallow agonizing.

The storm outside created an eerie, shadowed atmosphere. Suddenly, Liam became acutely aware of something unusual about his own state.

His hand slipped beneath the blanket. His eyebrows shot up when he discovered he wore only his boxers. Closing his eyes in resignation, he felt heat creeping up his neck.

"Evelyn? Are you awake?" Rosalind's voice accompanied a sharp knock at the door.

I stirred slowly, rubbing sleep from my eyes. Studying Liam's peaceful expression, I pressed my palm to his forehead, then my own. Satisfied his fever hadn't returned, I exhaled in relief.

"Evelyn!" Rosalind called again, more insistently.

I scrambled to the door, yanking Rosalind inside before securing the lock behind her. She frowned at my frantic movements. "What's going on?"

Leading her to the bed, I whispered urgently, "Look."

Rosalind's gaze darted between the sleeping man and me. "How did he get here? And why is he in your bed?"

"He broke in around 3 AM to take me from Wright Manor but collapsed before he could."

Rosalind's lips twitched with suppressed laughter. "Did you roofie him?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" I swatted her arm. "He arrived sick and passed out unexpectedly."

"It's pouring outside. Now what?" Rosalind gestured toward the storm.

I bit my lip, shaking my head helplessly.

"Eve, you said we couldn't consume anything from Wright Manor - not even water. With this storm and a half-naked man in your room, what's our play?"

"We'll wait out the rain and order delivery," I said, glancing at Liam's sleeping form. "And we'll need some men's clothing."

Rosalind noticed the discarded garments at the foot of the bed. Her eyes widened as she reached for the blanket.

I caught her wrist just in time. "D-don't! He's... not decent."

Rosalind gasped dramatically. "Evelyn Carter! Did you strip him completely bare?"
###Chapter 286

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson as she stammered, "He was running a fever, and his clothes were drenched in sweat."

Rosalind arched an eyebrow with a knowing smirk. "Oh really? Just sweat?"

The color deepened in Evelyn's face as she defended, "O-Of course! Besides, we're married. I've seen him without clothes before - it's nothing special."

At the mention of their marriage, Rosalind leaned in conspiratorially. "Evelyn, you've been married to him for six months since your memory loss. Have you two...you know..."

"What?"

"Done the deed." Rosalind wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.

Evelyn's face burned as comprehension dawned. "What kind of question is that? No, we haven't."

Rosalind's eyes widened as she glanced at Liam's still form. "Seriously? With that face and body? So he's...incapable?"

Liam, feigning sleep, felt his jaw tighten imperceptibly. His body remained motionless while turmoil churned within.

Evelyn didn't know about Liam's capabilities. What she did know was his unwavering respect for her boundaries.

"Enough nonsense." Evelyn ushered Rosalind toward the door. "I'm staying to care for him. You go investigate my grandfather's illness."

"Fine, but be careful. Don't let anyone discover him here."

"I know."

After Rosalind left, Evelyn secured the door and exhaled shakily. When she turned back toward the bed, her breath caught - Liam had propped himself up, massaging his temples.

The defined muscles of his torso glistened faintly, accentuated by several faded scars that added a dangerous allure.

Evelyn swallowed hard and approached cautiously. "Liam, you're awake? Are you feeling any discomfort?"

He shook his head slightly, the air between them growing thick. Evelyn reached for the blanket. "You should cover up. Don't catch a chill."

The fabric slipped from his shoulders repeatedly. After two failed attempts, she knelt beside him, carefully wrapping the blanket around his frame.

Their eyes met suddenly - his stormy gaze locking with her clear one. The world seemed to pause as electricity crackled between them.

In Evelyn's eyes, Liam saw unexpected tenderness. In his, she recognized smoldering desire.

Her pulse quickened as warmth spread through her cheeks. "You collapsed yesterday, soaked through. I...I undressed you to clean you up. But I didn't...look improperly."

Liam responded with a faint hum, his lips quirking slightly.

"When the storm passes, I'll have clothes brought for you," Evelyn continued. "You can't stay here. Leave as soon as you're able."

"Do you think moving in protects your grandparents?" Liam's voice was rough. "Have you considered the danger if your identity is discovered?"

"I have."

"Then why take the risk?"

Evelyn leaned closer, her whisper barely audible. "Liam, they're my family. I can't abandon them."

"You shouldn't endanger yourself."

"Liam...my parents might still be alive." Her breath warmed his ear as she confessed, "That impostor Victoria moved in a month after my disappearance. She's been impersonating me in video calls with my parents and Julian to deceive my grandparents."
###Chapter 287

"They had video-called at least a dozen times during the past month. This made my grandparents convinced I was the impostor Victoria Dawson. Back then, Julian must have threatened my parents into cooperating in exchange for my safety."

Evelyn remained close to Liam's side. Her whisper was barely audible, carrying the faint scent of lavender. Liam felt an unusual warmth spreading through his body, his thoughts becoming increasingly scattered.

He cleared his throat roughly. "Pass me that water bottle."

"Oh." Evelyn reached for the bottle on the nightstand, her fingers brushing against his.

Liam tilted his head back, the muscles in his throat working as he drank deeply. The movement was unconsciously sensual.

Evelyn found herself staring at the way his Adam's apple moved. She licked her suddenly dry lips.

The blanket slipped from Liam's shoulders again as he wiped his mouth. Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, her cheeks burning hotter than before.

"Rosalind confirmed my parents have death certificates but no cremation records. Their graves are empty. I believe they're still alive. That's why we moved into Wright Manor - to protect my grandparents and get answers from Julian."

Liam suddenly turned Evelyn's face toward him. His intense gaze pinned her in place as he emphasized each word: "Remember what I told you? They could be Obsidian Circle operatives."

The severity in his expression made Evelyn nod hastily.

"Then why take this risk?" Liam demanded.

"To protect my family. To find the truth." Her voice held unwavering determination.

"With just you and that assistant Rosalind?" Liam's lips curled in a mocking smile.

Evelyn bit her lip before responding in a honeyed tone, "Why don't you help me, Liam? With you involved, we could accomplish twice as much with half the effort."

Even through his anger, Liam couldn't resist her pleading eyes and soft voice. "Cassandra, I promised to handle this. You need to trust me. Moving into Wright Manor is dangerous - do you understand that?"

"I do."

"Good. Leave with Rosalind today."

Evelyn shook her head firmly.

Liam exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. After a long moment, he sighed in resignation. "You haven't changed at all. Once you set your mind to something, nothing can sway you."

Evelyn leaned closer, bracing herself against the bed. "Don't underestimate Rosalind. She's highly capable."

"And what about you?" Liam's focus remained solely on Evelyn.

"Me?"

"You've lived a sheltered life, treated like royalty since childhood. Those three years of amnesia were your only hardship. How do you plan to save your family?"

Evelyn tapped Liam's shoulder confidently. "Trust me, Liam. Together we can find my parents and protect my grandparents."

"You're not listening!" Liam's eyes darkened dangerously. He threw off the blanket and stood abruptly.

Evelyn gasped, covering her eyes. "What are you doing?"

"Going to shower." Completely unselfconscious, Liam strode naked toward the bathroom.
###Chapter 288

"Couldn't you have warned me first?" Evelyn's voice trembled with barely contained frustration.

Liam remained silent, his broad shoulders tense as he strode directly into the bathroom without explanation.

A sharp knock shattered the tense silence. Evelyn sprang from the bed, her bare feet padding across the plush carpet. She pressed her ear against the solid oak door, her pulse racing.

"Who's there?"

"Victoria. Open up."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat. She threw a panicked glance toward the bathroom where Liam had disappeared. The knocking grew more insistent. "Evelyn! I know you're in there. Open this door!"

After a heartbeat's hesitation, Evelyn turned the knob. Victoria stood framed in the doorway, her crimson lips curled in a smirk that didn't reach her cold blue eyes.

"Ms. Dawson," Evelyn said loudly, deliberately raising her voice. "What brings you here?" Her words were meant as much for Liam's ears as Victoria's.

Victoria crossed her arms, the silk of her designer blouse whispering with the movement. "I've never encountered someone with your level of audacity. Threatening my grandfather with Liam's influence? Brazenly moving into Wright Manor? Do you have a death wish?"

"My mortality doesn't concern me," Evelyn replied, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins.

Victoria's sharp laugh cut through the tension. Her calculating gaze swept over Evelyn, clearly assessing her motives for staying at the manor.

"Ms. Dawson, state your business," Evelyn demanded, gripping the doorframe.

"Julian's looking for you. He's in Grandfather's suite." Victoria's tone could have frozen fire. "Don't keep him waiting."

Evelyn stepped into the hallway, pulling the door shut behind her with deliberate care. "Lead the way."

Victoria guided her through the labyrinthine corridollars to Archibald's private medical suite. The expansive room hummed with state-of-the-art equipment rivaling any top-tier hospital.

Archibald lay motionless beneath crisp white sheets, his once-robust frame now frail. The sight of her beloved grandfather in such a state sent a physical pain through Evelyn's chest. Tears pricked at her eyes as she forced herself forward.

Julian lounged on an antique chaise, his piercing gaze tracking Evelyn's every movement. Margaret hovered near the bed, meticulously wiping Archibald's hands with a damp cloth. She turned, her expression hardening.

"What are you doing here?" Margaret's voice dripped with disdain.

The cold reception twisted the knife in Evelyn's heart.

"Mother, I requested her presence," Julian interjected smoothly.

Margaret returned to her ministrations. "This is a recovery suite, not some common gathering place. Remove her."

Evelyn ignored the venom in Margaret's words. She approached the bed, gently taking Archibald's hand in hers. "What exactly is Mr. Wright's diagnosis? Why isn't he receiving hospital care?"

"Grandfather's medical decisions are none of your concern," Victoria snapped, tossing her blonde hair over one shoulder.

Evelyn bit her lip, glancing at Julian. His intense scrutiny made her skin prickle - was this another test? Another way to determine if her memories had returned?

Julian leaned forward, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "His time is limited. Days at most. Hospitalization would be pointless."

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Grief threatened to overwhelm her - until she felt two distinct presses against her palm.

Her breath hitched. Archibald's fingers moved again, repeating the pattern. Understanding dawned, washing away her sorrow. Her expression smoothed into serene acceptance.

"I pray for his swift recovery," she said softly.

Julian's face darkened. Evelyn's calm demeanor gave nothing away - no flicker of recognition, no hint of her true feelings. Just the perfect picture of a concerned stranger.
###Chapter 289

Evelyn gently tucked Archibald's hand back under the blanket and asked calmly, "Dr. Whitmore, may I ask why you summoned me here?"

Julian slowly rose to his feet, adjusting his glasses. His sharp gaze held a trace of suspicion as it lingered on her.

He approached the bedside with measured steps, clearly preoccupied. "As our guest, I believe you should pay respects to my gravely ill father. It's basic courtesy."

"My apologies for the oversight." Evelyn lowered her head in contrition.

Initially, she'd feared seeing Archibald's condition might cause her to lose composure and reveal herself. But those fears dissipated the moment she realized his illness was feigned.

Margaret set down her towel and ran trembling fingers through Archibald's silver hair. Her voice cracked as she whispered, "Archibald, please wake up. What will become of me without you?"

Victoria rushed to Margaret's side, grasping her arm in support. "Grandmother, don't distress yourself. You'll always have me, even if Grandfather..." Her voice trailed off meaningfully.

Margaret clutched Victoria's hand with desperate hope. "Victoria, how will we manage the family enterprises without your grandfather?"

Barely containing her excitement, Victoria quickly schooled her features into sorrow. "You're right, we can't imagine life without him. But Uncle Julian and I won't fail his legacy if... if the worst happens."

"Leave Julian out of this." Margaret shot him a dismissive glance. "He's not blood-related and has no inheritance rights. Besides, he's just a doctor - what does he know about business?"

Julian remained silent, fists clenched at his sides. A dangerous glint flickered behind his gold-rimmed glasses.

"Has Grandfather prepared a will?" Victoria couldn't quite mask the eagerness in her tone.

Margaret nodded. "Long settled. The family holdings and all properties go to you. Naturally, we've left Julian sufficient funds for life."

Victoria nearly glowed with triumph, though she maintained a discreet facade while Julian stood frozen like a statue. Evelyn found the entire charade darkly amusing.

"Grandmother, I want nothing. Only Grandfather's recovery matters to me." Victoria forced tears to roll down her cheeks.

Margaret sighed, patting Victoria's hand tenderly. "You're truly the best, dear. Your grandfather would be so touched."

Evelyn could endure no more. She cleared her throat pointedly.

All eyes turned to her.

"Madam Hoffis, I believe you and Mr. Hoffis remain unaware - Victoria isn't an Aldenrian citizen. She has no inheritance rights here." Evelyn delivered the bombshell casually.

Margaret reeled back. "What nonsense is this?"

Victoria gaped, her gaze darting between Evelyn and Julian with dawning realization of betrayal.

Evelyn offered Julian a thin smile. "Dr. Whitmore, why haven't you informed your parents of this?"

Julian's expression darkened dangerously. His steely glare could have pierced steel, veins bulging in his neck.

Evelyn's words had shattered his carefully constructed plans. Despite his feelings for her, at this moment he wanted to throttle her.

Margaret rose angrily. "Explain yourselves! Why isn't Victoria an Aldenrian? Answer me, Victoria!"

She seized Victoria's hand. "Is this woman lying, or have you renounced your citizenship?"

Victoria stood paralyzed, suddenly realizing Julian might have been manipulating her all along.
###Chapter 290

The Obsidian Circle had carefully orchestrated the replacement of Victoria Dawson with their own operative. Her objective was clear - marry Liam Blackwood and infiltrate his inner circle to extract classified military secrets.

Having successfully assumed Victoria's identity, she was poised to inherit the vast Wright fortune. Even sharing it with Julian Whitmore seemed a small price to pay. But the shocking revelation that Victoria wasn't actually an Aldenrian citizen - and therefore ineligible to inherit - struck like a physical blow.

Julian had deliberately withheld this crucial information. Evelyn Carter exposed this truth precisely to drive a wedge between the imposter and her supposed uncle.

"As Liam's former lover," Evelyn stated coolly, "I naturally investigated my rival. Imagine my surprise to discover Ms. Wright isn't just an immigrant, but has formally renounced her Aldenrian citizenship. She's now a Solterran national. Under Aldenrian law, foreigners cannot inherit property."

Margaret Hoffis erupted in fury. "That's absurd! How could my granddaughter possibly be Solterran?"

Evelyn knew exactly how devastating this revelation would be to Archibald and Margaret. To them, changing citizenship was tantamount to treason - which was precisely why Evelyn and her parents had kept this secret for so long.

The fake Victoria panicked internally, though she couldn't show it. She glared daggers at Julian, her jaw clenched in silent fury.

"Victoria, is this true?" Margaret demanded.

The imposter remained silent.

"It's true," Julian confirmed.

Margaret staggered as if struck, collapsing into the imposter's arms. "Grandmother, are you alright?" the fake Victoria asked with feigned concern.

When Evelyn moved to help, Margaret recoiled violently. "Don't you dare touch me!"

Evelyn withdrew, noticing a single tear tracing down Archibald's cheek. Her heart ached with unspoken explanations, but revealing the full truth would endanger them all.

Once seated, Margaret turned her wrath on Julian. "You! Victoria's been abroad for years - she wouldn't know Aldenrian laws. But you? This was deliberate, wasn't it?"

"You knew when we died, our wills would become invalid. The Wright fortune would default to you. Quite the scheme, Doctor Whitmore."

"Mother, I never knew about any wills," Julian protested calmly. "My focus has always been medicine, not business."

"Save your lies," Margaret spat. "I'm not your father - I won't be fooled so easily."

"Grandmother, what do we do now?" The imposter's concern was purely about the inheritance.

Evelyn seized the opportunity. "Ms. Wright, you could reclaim your Aldenrian citizenship."

The fake Victoria shot Evelyn a suspicious glare.

Margaret nodded eagerly. "Yes, change it back immediately. Aldenrian law is clear about foreign heirs."

Julian's expression darkened as he studied Evelyn thoughtfully.

"Of course," the imposter agreed quickly, then hesitated. "But Grandmother... I can't. The process requires returning to Solterra in person, and that's impossible right now."
###Chapter 291

Evelyn looked perplexed. "Why can't you go?"

Victoria hesitated. She struggled to find the right words. Cassandra smirked and exited the sickroom without another word.

Of course Victoria couldn't enter Solterra. Surveillance systems blanketed the entire capital, with facial recognition technology that would flag her instantly. As one of Aldenria's most wanted fugitives, she'd be apprehended before taking three steps inside.

Even if she somehow dodged the cameras, Cassandra knew Victoria would never pass the biometric scans during documentation. Not to mention Victoria Dawson had been a top-secret researcher at Solterra's defense institute.

Cassandra ascended the stairs and nearly collided with Rosalind in the hallway.

"Young miss, I've delivered the clothes and meals to Mr. Blackwood," Rosalind whispered.

"Good." Cassandra nodded.

"Where were you just now?"

Cassandra gestured toward Donovan's room.

"How is the elder Mr. Dawson faring?"

Leaning close, Cassandra murmured, "Perfectly fine. It's all an act. With Victoria and Julian at each other's throats now, my grandparents are safe - for the moment."

"What do you mean?"

"Victoria won't risk involving them right now since Aldenrian law prohibits foreign nationals from inheriting property here." Cassandra's lips curved into a sly smile.

Understanding dawned on Rosalind's face. She blinked rapidly. "Miss Wright, you're absolutely brilliant."

"Take this chance to search Julian and Victoria's rooms. See if you can find any clues about my parents," Cassandra suggested.

"I'll go now."

"Be careful." Cassandra gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"Understood."

As Cassandra turned toward her own room, Rosalind suddenly called out, "Miss Wright! I bought you some antiviral masks. Don't catch that flu going around."

Cassandra nodded guiltily before entering. Wearing masks now seemed pointless after sharing medicine and water with Liam last night. She locked the door behind her.

Liam stood by the rain-lashed window, dressed in dark casual wear, hands buried in his pockets. His tall frame cast a lonely silhouette against the storm-darkened glass.

A heavy silence filled the room. Cassandra moved to stand beside him, watching trees bend violently in the gale outside.

"Liam, you should be resting. Did you take your medication?" Her gaze traced his sharp profile.

His expression remained somber, yet his voice softened remarkably. "I'm fine."

"You collapsed last night. That's not fine."

"Donovan's awake," Liam said abruptly.

Cassandra grabbed his arm excitedly. "Really? Is he out of danger? How is he? What did the doctors say?"

Liam turned to study her radiant smile, recognizing genuine concern for his brother. "I just received word. Haven't seen him yet."

"I want to visit him too." Cassandra released his arm, her smile fading as she glanced at the torrential downpour. "But we're trapped here in this weather."

A bitter smile touched Liam's lips as he wrestled with the ache in his chest.
###Chapter 292

Liam Blackwood and Cassandra Wright had once been inseparable, spending countless hours together.

Yet Cassandra had always admired Donovan Blackwood. Liam often heard her praising Donovan's achievements.

There was no denying Donovan had been the golden boy of their school days. Basketball team captain. Straight-A student. Ivy League material.

Everyone considered him brilliant, yet he chose the police academy instead.

Donovan and Cassandra were the academic stars who dominated every competition. Liam worked tirelessly to match Cassandra's brilliance, desperate to prove himself worthy. Eventually, he carved out his own successful career, standing equal to her—yet her heart remained untouched.

"Cassandra, if you want to visit Donovan, I can have Ryan take you." Liam's voice carried a quiet melancholy.

Evelyn shook her head. She feared she might have caught Liam's cold and didn’t want to risk infecting Donovan in his fragile state.

"Not today. I’ll bring flowers and visit when the weather clears. Showing up drenched in this storm would be embarrassing."

Liam’s dark eyes were unfathomable as they lingered on her profile. His chest tightened painfully at her words—proof she still cared deeply about Donovan’s opinion of her.

No matter how hard Liam had tried to surpass Donovan, to become the man Cassandra admired, he knew he could never truly replace him.

Evelyn accidentally met Liam’s gaze when she glanced up, and he immediately turned toward the window. Her pulse quickened inexplicably.

"Liam, you should eat something and rest," she said softly. "You still need to take your medication."

Liam hummed in response and moved away from the window. He twisted open a water bottle and swallowed his pills dry.

Evelyn frowned. "You didn’t eat anything. Medicine on an empty stomach is bad for you."

"Not hungry," he murmured. He sat on the edge of the bed, watching the storm outside with subdued energy.

She assumed his illness had dampened his mood. Moving closer, she sat beside him. "Liam, you need to take care of yourself. Medicine requires food—that’s basic. You’re a grown man. Do I really have to remind you?"

Liam turned to her with a faint smile. "Cassandra, you’ve gotten quite naggy."

Her expression darkened. She opened the takeout box, revealing chicken pies and pastries.

Picking up a pastry, she held it out to him. "Open your mouth. I’ll feed you."

Liam recoiled slightly, surprise flickering across his face.
###Chapter 293

Liam accepted the pastry from Evelyn's hand with a curt nod. "Appreciate it. I can manage on my own."

Evelyn observed him quietly, her emotions tangled like knotted threads.

Before their divorce, Liam had pursued her relentlessly. But the moment she'd drawn her boundaries, he'd respected them completely. She'd gotten exactly what she wanted, yet an inexplicable ache settled in her chest.

She'd been disciplining herself rigorously. They weren't reckless teenagers anymore. Love couldn't be their priority - life held far weightier matters.

Liam took a small bite of the pastry, chewing mechanically as if tasting cardboard. When Evelyn brought over the entire box, she settled beside him, and they ate in silence.

It had been months since they'd shared food like this, sitting in wordless companionship. No unnecessary conversation, just two souls occupying the same space.

"How long do you think this storm will last?" Evelyn sighed, breaking the quiet.

Liam's dark eyes deepened as he set down his half-eaten pastry. Secretly, he hoped the downpour would continue - it meant more stolen moments with her.

The ringing of Liam's phone shattered the moment. He hesitated three full seconds before answering.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her pastry as her gaze locked onto Liam, ears straining.

"Victoria. What is it?" Liam's voice was calm.

Evelyn froze. Victoria Hudson - brilliant diplomat, Foreign Ministry official, and Liam's closest confidante. Her pulse quickened.

"Understood." Liam ended the call and moved toward the balcony, sliding open the glass door.

Evelyn abandoned her food and rushed after him. "Liam, where are you going?"

The opened door unleashed a gust of wind that sent the curtains billowing. The torrential rain outside looked treacherous.

Liam turned, his expression unreadable. "Since you've made your choice and I can't change your mind, there's no point in me staying."

"It's pouring! And you're still recovering. At least wait until-"

"Unnecessary," Liam cut her off coolly.

The pain in Evelyn's chest intensified. "Liam."

His back remained turned. The storm meant nothing to him - only Evelyn mattered. "Call if you need anything," he murmured.

Then he stepped onto the rain-lashed balcony and vaulted over the railing. Evelyn's face drained of color.

She lunged forward, ignoring the stinging rain, gripping the wet railing as wind whipped her hair. The cold downpour soaked through her clothes instantly.

Below, Liam landed gracefully on a first-floor ledge before dropping to the ground. Two fluid movements carried him effortlessly from the ten-foot height.

Rain plastered his clothes to his body, but his posture remained unbroken. His retreating figure grew smaller in the curtain of rain until he vanished completely.

Evelyn's vision blurred. She couldn't tell if it was rain or tears streaming down her face. All she knew was the crushing weight settling over her heart.
###Chapter 294

The downpour lasted for days. When it finally ceased, Evelyn collapsed with fever. She'd likely contracted Liam's virus. For three straight days, she remained bedridden.

While caring for Evelyn, Rosalind secretly investigated Julian for information about Evelyn's parents. It took a full week before Evelyn's fever broke completely.

At precisely 2:17 am, Evelyn slipped into Archibald's private hospital suite. After securing the door, she launched a scanning app on her phone. The readout revealed three surveillance devices - one visible, two concealed.

Evelyn activated her signal jammer. Within moments, all electronic monitoring in the room went dark. She approached the bed and whispered, "Grandfather, can you hear me?"

No response. She gently squeezed his hand. "Grandfather, it's me."

A faint twitch of fingers made her exhale in relief. "The cameras are disabled. We're safe."

Archibald's eyelids fluttered open. The dim medical lighting couldn't obscure the sharp intelligence in his gaze - nothing like a terminal patient's glassy stare.

"You're awake?" Evelyn breathed.

Tears pooled in the old man's eyes. "Cassandra... My real granddaughter. I knew we'd been deceived the moment I saw you at Blackwood Manor."

Evelyn stroked his papery skin. "This is my fault. Three years of amnesia gave them the perfect opening."

"Run," he rasped. "Disappear and never look back."

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks. "I won't abandon you and Grandmother."

"Stubborn girl."

"Tell me truth - have you been feigning illness? Or did they poison you?"

Archibald's hands trembled with rage. "Julian slipped toxins into my tea. The hospital flushed my system, but I dare not reveal my recovery. He'd finish the job."

"So you're playing possum?"

He nodded weakly. "I've bribed my physician to report my condition as terminal. Bought myself breathing room."

Evelyn sighed. "Grandmother's too transparent. I can't risk telling her my true identity."

Understanding flashed in Archibald's eyes. Suddenly he gripped her wrist. "Why renounce your citizenship? You're the last Hoffis heir! Who'll inherit the estate?"

She soothed his agitation. "All in due time. Right now, protecting you both and finding my parents takes priority."

"They're alive?" Hope cracked his voice.

"I refuse to believe otherwise. I will find them."

Silent tears tracked down Archibald's weathered face. His granddaughter's unshakable conviction reignited decades-dead hope in his heart.
###Chapter 295

"Grandfather, I must take my leave now." Evelyn gently caressed Archibald's weathered cheek, her voice barely above a whisper. "You needn't maintain this charade of illness if it grows tiresome. That imposter Cassandra won't dare harm you - not while you're still useful to her scheme."

Once Archibald and Margaret met their ends, the entire Wright fortune would fall into Julian's greedy hands. The fake Cassandra would never relinquish such a monumental advantage.

"Very well, I understand," Archibald replied with a tender smile.

With one final glance at her grandfather, Evelyn slipped silently from the sickroom.

The following morning brought troubling news from Rosalind. Margaret had taken Cassandra to Wright Corporation, introducing her to the board members and securing her position as Vice President.

Cassandra craved the Wright inheritance but feared changing her Solterran citizenship. Instead, she'd devised an alternative plan - marry an Aldenrian nobleman who could claim the fortune, then seize half through marital rights.

"Evelyn," Rosalind confided, "your grandmother has taken Cassandra to meet General Blackwood. Her dowry? The entirety of Wright Corporation. Whoever marries her becomes the wealthiest man in Aldenria! What man could resist such temptation?"

The revelation left Evelyn reeling all day. The vast Wright fortune might soon slip through her fingers if Cassandra succeeded in her marital schemes.

That evening, raucous laughter echoed through the grand hall. Evelyn and Rosalind emerged from their chambers to find Margaret and Cassandra celebrating with uncharacteristic gaiety. Dozens of exquisite jewelry sets littered the coffee table as Cassandra preened before a mirror.

Spotting Evelyn descending the stairs, Cassandra announced with triumphant malice, "Evelyn Carter, I bring joyous news - Liam has agreed to marry me."

Evelyn remained impassible, settling onto a couch beside Rosalind while Cassandra flaunted her jewels.

"Cassandra's dreams have finally come true," Margaret declared with smug satisfaction. "At last, I can rest easy."

"Grandmother," Cassandra simpered, "Liam has loved me for years. Our union would have happened sooner had his grandmother not forced that sham marriage upon him."

Margaret shot Evelyn a venomous glance. "Indeed. Thankfully, destiny has corrected itself."

The truth of their words began dawning on Evelyn. Though her face paled and heart ached, she maintained perfect composure.

"Madam Wright," she inquired coolly, "did Liam personally make this promise?"

"What man would refuse the Wright fortune?" Margaret scoffed. "Marrying Cassandra guarantees becoming Aldenria's wealthiest man. Besides, they've always been deeply in love."

Evelyn's fingers tightened imperceptibly on her skirt hem.

Cassandra noticed and smirked. "I warned you he'd divorce you, Evelyn. Know your place - you're nothing compared to me." She slid an emerald bracelet onto her wrist, admiring its sparkle.

With bitter amusement, Evelyn countered, "Ms. Wright, under which identity do you claim Liam's hand? As Cassandra Wright of Aldenria, or Wanda Wright of Solterra?"

Cassandra's face twisted in fury at the pointed question.
###Chapter 296

Margaret's face darkened instantly. "Evelyn, don't you think you're overstepping? This is none of your business. Take your little friend and get out of my house immediately."

Evelyn stood frozen.

With perfect posture, Margaret spoke slowly, "I only allowed you to stay at Blackwood Manor because I feared you'd harass Liam at his residence."

"This is property of Wright Manor."

"Now that he's agreed to marry Victoria, you have no reason to remain. I don't care where you go, but you will leave Wright Manor today."

Evelyn forced a bitter smile. "I'll leave. But not right now."

"I've tolerated your presence for ten days. My patience has limits. Leave now or my security will escort you out - straight to the police station," Margaret threatened.

Rosalind turned to Evelyn. "Let's go."

Evelyn's gaze locked with Margaret's. She couldn't bring herself to hate the woman - this was still her grandmother after all.

Between Victoria and Julian's schemes, Evelyn was already at her breaking point. Now Margaret was pouring gasoline on the fire.

If she and Rosalind left, who would protect Archibald and Margaret? Even with Liam's guards watching, Evelyn couldn't shake her worry.

"I'm. Not. Leaving." Evelyn emphasized each word.

Victoria jumped up, face contorted with rage. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Liam was supposed to be my husband. Since I've surrendered him to you, what harm is there in me staying a little longer?" Evelyn countered.

Margaret pulled out a checkbook. She methodically filled out several checks before sliding them across the table.

"This will buy you a luxurious villa and secure your future."

Evelyn didn't touch them. The offer stung - another attempt to buy her off.

She knew Liam wouldn't marry Victoria for money. This marriage was clearly a ploy to cut Julian out of the inheritance, making him think twice before harming Archibald and Margaret.

Evelyn leaned close to Rosalind's ear. "Stay here. Watch over grandfather. I'll be back soon."

Rosalind gave a nearly imperceptible nod.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and left.

"She's gone. Why are you still here?" Margaret demanded.

Rosalind offered a thin smile. "Madam Wright, I'll be retiring to my room now. I'll inform you when I'm ready to depart." She ascended the staircase gracefully.

Victoria pointed angrily. "Grandmother, what's her problem?"

Margaret frowned, lost in thought.

Outside Wright Manor, Evelyn hailed a cab. The night was ink-black, city lights streaking past the taxi windows in neon ribbons.

Eight days had passed since she last saw Liam, when he'd fallen ill at the manor.

Her phone connected instantly when she called, as if he'd been expecting her.

"Cassandra."

"Liam," her voice came out husky with emotion. "Where are you? I need to see you tonight."
###Chapter 297

"Where are you? I'll come to you." Liam's voice was uncharacteristically soft.

A warmth spread through Evelyn's chest. "Don't worry. I'm already on my way. Just tell me where to meet. Should we go to Blackwood Manor?"

"No, I'll send you the location."

"Alright. See you soon."

After hanging up, Evelyn received the coordinates from Liam. She relayed them to the driver, then stared out the window at the passing city lights, her heart heavy.

She still hadn't figured out how to bring up his engagement to Victoria. Meeting him like this had been impulsive—she just couldn’t stand the thought of him marrying her.

A man like Liam deserved so much better than a criminal.

Thirty minutes later, the car slowed to a stop. "We're here," the driver announced.

Evelyn glanced around before reaching for her purse. Just then, someone tapped on the driver’s window and handed over the fare.

"Thank you!" the driver beamed.

Before she could react, her door swung open.

"Come on, Cassandra." Liam's deep voice was like a soothing balm to her nerves.

Stepping out, Evelyn found herself face-to-face with the man she knew all too well—Liam.

Dressed in a crisp white shirt and dark trousers, he looked effortlessly elegant. They stood before the breathtaking Alpine Estate, its grand entrance illuminated by soft golden lights.

"Liam," she greeted, nerves tightening her throat. She hadn’t expected him to meet her outside.

"I’m with some friends inside. Join us, if you don’t mind," he said casually, one hand tucked into his pocket.

Evelyn nodded. "Of course."

They walked side by side down the tree-lined path, the branches strung with delicate fairy lights. Flower beds overflowed with vibrant blooms, their fragrance mingling with the cool night air.

"Liam, are you feeling better?" she asked gently.

"I’m fine." He glanced at her. "Why the urgency? Is something wrong?"

Clutching her phone, Evelyn gathered her courage. "Are you really going to marry Victoria?"

Liam hummed in response, slowing his pace to match hers.

Even though she’d braced herself, the confirmation still stung. Tears pricked her eyes as she turned to him. "Why? You know what kind of person she is. How can you marry her?"

Liam remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"There is no Victoria Dawson. Under what name is she marrying you?"

"As Cassandra Wright."

"Liam, have you lost your mind?"

He stopped walking when he realized she hadn’t followed. The pain in her gaze twisted something inside him.

A bitter smile touched his lips. "Tell me, Cassandra—were you ever in love with me? Before your amnesia, or after?"

Evelyn froze. The question hung between them, heavy and suffocating.

She couldn’t answer.
###Chapter 298

Liam's bloodshot eyes shimmered with desperate hope. Evelyn couldn't bear to witness his heartbreak, yet the truth remained trapped behind her clenched teeth.

"Was there ever real love between us?" Liam's voice cracked despite his forced composure.

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip. Seconds stretched into eternity as she wrestled with her conscience. "What difference does it make now that you're engaged to Victoria?"

"I understand." The meaning behind her evasion struck him like a physical blow.

A bitter smile twisted his lips as he bowed his head. Darkness seemed to pour over him like spilled ink.

Evelyn's heart shattered silently. She knew Liam would never comprehend the truth - that she loved him fiercely, but their worlds stood galaxies apart.

She could never become the wife of an Aldenrian general. Accepting his proposal meant abandoning her groundbreaking research in Solterra.

Love paled against the weight of national security. She'd already sacrificed her claim to the Wright fortune - how could she jeopardize more?

"Liam, you deserve better than Victoria. She's exploiting my identity, and I won't let this marriage happen."

Liam's laugh held no mirth. "She's already used her connections to have your Solterran identification papers reissued."

Evelyn's breath caught.

"While she wouldn't dare apply for citizenship," Liam continued, "she can use your identity to marry in Aldenria. Even without me, she'll find someone to secure the Wright inheritance."

"You have two choices - publicly reclaim your identity as Cassandra Wright, or let Victoria marry under your name and activate your grandfather's will."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "She will not use my identity to marry you. Never."

Cicadas screamed in the heavy silence.

Each word pierced Liam's heart like shrapnel. He turned toward the inky horizon, letting the night breeze dry his unshed tears.

In the dim amber light, Evelyn missed his anguish. "If I can't stop her, I'll expose my identity. I can maintain the amnesia charade with Julian as long as he remains unsuspecting."

"You'd rather risk everything than let Victoria marry me as you?" Liam's whisper dissolved into the wind.

"Cassandra Wright can never be your bride."

"Understood." Liam strode forward, forcing Evelyn to quicken her pace.

His voice emerged calm despite the bleeding wound in his chest. "I won't marry Cassandra Wright or Victoria Dawson since you object."

"Thank you, Liam." Her gratitude barely stirred the air.

Silence engulfed them as they traversed winding garden paths. When they pushed open the door to an elegant private room, every head turned. Evelyn froze mid-step.
###Chapter 299

Social gatherings were Evelyn's worst nightmare. The private dining room held a table set for twelve, each seat occupied by intimidating strangers.

She recognized only Benjamin and Victoria from the group.

Every guest appeared to be around Liam's age, radiating power and confidence. Evelyn's palms grew clammy as she considered making an escape.

"Go on," Liam murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

Evelyn forced herself forward.

"This is Cassandra," Liam announced smoothly once the door clicked shut behind them.

Evelyn shot him a startled glance before offering the room an awkward half-smile and nod.

"Cassandra, these are my closest allies," Liam said, his voice softening.

"Hello everyone," Evelyn managed.

"I've never seen Blackwood with a woman before—"

Victoria cut in sharply, "Am I suddenly invisible?"

The room erupted in laughter at her indignation.

Liam guided Evelyn to the seat beside him, arranging silverware before her. He leaned close, whispering, "They're all trustworthy. Just breathe."

Evelyn nodded, setting her phone down with trembling fingers as she studied the guests.

Their designer attire and commanding presence marked them as elites. Only those with significant influence—or deep personal ties—dared address Liam so casually.

Benjamin approached with a wine bottle. "Should I call you Evelyn or Cassandra?"

"Whichever you prefer." She forced another smile.

After filling her glass, Benjamin gestured to Liam's untouched drink. "Don't follow his example. No matter how we beg, the man refuses alcohol at gatherings. Absolute killjoy."

"There's no drinking requirement, Ben. Liam's demonstrating admirable restraint," Victoria interjected with a scowl.

"How tedious," Benjamin scoffed. Others joined in teasing Liam about his sobriety.

Benjamin raised his own glass. "Cassandra, a pleasure. Let's toast."

Evelyn reached for water, but Benjamin swiftly replaced it with wine. "Bottoms up."

He clinked her glass and drained his in one swallow.

Trapped, Evelyn stood nervously. "Benjamin, I really don't drink."

"Who abstains these days?" Benjamin chuckled.

Another guest chimed in, "Benjamin made the first move. You can't refuse now."

"Just a sip. Don't spoil the mood."

"Cassandra, humor him. A tiny taste won't hurt."

Pressure mounting, Evelyn frowned, took a deep breath, and raised the glass to her lips.

At the last second, strong fingers plucked it from her grasp.

Evelyn looked up to see Liam calmly draining her wine without hesitation.
###Chapter 300

The entire evening, the group had been pressuring Liam to drink, but he'd remained stoically indifferent. Now, he was stepping in for Evelyn and accepting the drinks himself.

The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Watching Liam drink was far more thrilling than seeing Evelyn take the shots.

"What's going on here?"

They quickly changed tactics, following Benjamin's lead. One by one, they approached Evelyn with toasts. Unsure how to refuse, she silently relied on Liam to handle the alcohol.

Victoria looked horrified. She grabbed Liam's wrist urgently. "Liam, you need to stop drinking. Nobody asked you to do this for her."

Evelyn sat frozen, watching as Liam's fair complexion flushed crimson. She'd never attended such a rowdy gathering before and felt completely out of her depth.

Benjamin pulled Victoria aside with an amused chuckle. "Let him be, Victoria. When was the last time you saw Liam drink? It's been ages!"

Another guest laughed in agreement. "That's absolutely true."

"Enough." Liam slammed down his glass and glared at Benjamin.

Benjamin smirked unrepentantly. "What? I'm not forcing you to drink. I'm toasting Cassandra."

He handed another full glass to Evelyn. "Cassandra, you're remarkable! First person to ever make Liam lose his self-control. That deserves a toast."

After downing his drink, Benjamin immediately refilled Evelyn's glass.

Liam intercepted the glass, his hand blocking the path. When Benjamin pushed forward, Evelyn's lips accidentally brushed against Liam's knuckles. She recoiled in embarrassment.

Liam confiscated the drink, fixing Benjamin with a dangerous stare. "She. Doesn't. Drink."

"It's just one glass. She won't get drunk." Benjamin laughed and clapped Liam on the shoulder. "Even if she does, you'll be here to take care of her, won't you?"

Liam drained the glass in one swallow. Setting it down firmly, he pulled Evelyn to her feet. "Continue without us. I'm taking her home."

Protests erupted immediately. "You just arrived! Why leave so soon?"
"She hasn't eaten anything yet!"
"Let her stay a while longer!"

Victoria stood abruptly, shooting Evelyn a venomous look. "Liam, I can escort her home."

"That won't be necessary. We're leaving now," Liam stated firmly, guiding Evelyn toward the exit.

Benjamin sighed dramatically. "The night's barely started. Are you really abandoning us?"

Evelyn hurried after Liam, her gaze fixed on their joined hands. His fingers looked particularly elegant tonight, and warmth blossomed in her chest.

"Liam, I can take a cab. You should stay with your friends," she offered hesitantly.

"I'm not going back." His voice was velvet-soft yet final.

Looking around, Evelyn realized with a start that he was leading her toward Blackwood Manor.
###Chapter 301

"Where are you taking me?" Evelyn asked as they walked through the moonlit gardens.

Liam remained silent, his grip firm yet gentle around her wrist. The crisp night air carried the scent of jasmine as they approached a secluded gazebo in the Blackwood Estate.

When he finally released her hand, Evelyn noticed how his fingers lingered for just a heartbeat too long.

She took in their surroundings - the manicured hedges, the marble fountain glistening under strategically placed lanterns. It was too perfect, too intimate.

Liam sank onto the wrought iron bench with a quiet sigh. "Stay with me," he said, his voice rough with emotion.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Liam, what are you talking about?"

His gaze burned into hers as he gave a humorless chuckle. "I won't touch you. Just...sit with me. That's all I ask."

She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks. Turning away, she focused on a climbing rose bush. "It's late. This isn't...proper."

"Proper?" Liam's laugh held an edge of bitterness. "We shared a bed for months when we were married. I never once took advantage. And now you think I'd hurt you?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone until her knuckles turned white.

Liam leaned back, the moonlight casting shadows across his face. His voice dropped to a whisper. "Evelyn or Cassandra - it doesn't matter. My heart only knows you."

A shudder ran through her body. His words struck like arrows, each one finding its mark.

"I thought I was the kind of man who moved on easily," he continued. "But I've spent a lifetime loving one woman. That won't change, no matter what name you go by."

Evelyn's breath caught. The night air suddenly felt too thick, too heavy in her lungs.

"You're drunk," she managed to say, noticing the flush creeping up his neck.

Liam pressed his fingers to his temples. "I'm not drunk. Just tired of pretending."

His next words came out raw, unfiltered. "I'm not asking you to love me. Just...don't disappear again. Don't cut me out completely like you did before."

Evelyn's vision blurred. She blinked rapidly, staring at the gazebo's ornate ceiling.

"Text me sometimes," Liam whispered. "Let me know you're happy. That's all I need."

The pain in her chest was physical now, sharp as broken glass. She turned away before he could see the tears spilling over.

"Liam, you should rest. I'll call Ryan to take you home," she said, voice trembling.

"I've booked a suite here for the weekend." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Go if you need to. But answer me one thing first."

Evelyn's fingers shook so badly she could barely operate her phone. More tears fell, hot against her chilled skin.

"Can't we at least be friends?" The vulnerability in his voice shattered what remained of her composure.

She hadn't expected it to hurt this much. Hadn't realized how deep the wounds still ran. The phone slipped from her numb fingers, clattering against the stone path.

In the silence that followed, only their uneven breathing and the distant chirp of crickets filled the space between them.
###Chapter 302

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper. "Liam, I'm sorry." The weight of guilt pressed heavily on her chest, each breath more painful than the last.

Liam forced a smile, tilting his head back as his arms fell limply to his sides. His eyelids fluttered shut. "I understand," he murmured.

She couldn't bear to meet his eyes. Turning abruptly, Evelyn fled the garden.

Liam didn't follow. He remained motionless on the wrought iron bench, face turned toward the twilight sky. Even with his eyes closed, hot tears traced paths down his stubbled cheeks. The golden glow of sunset painted his solitary figure in heartbreaking hues.

Evelyn vanished into the gathering dusk without looking back.

Liam pressed trembling fingers to his temples, attempting to stem the flood of emotion. A decade had passed since he'd felt this particular brand of agony. The familiarity made it no easier to endure.

The taxi ride home blurred through Evelyn's tears. The driver offered awkward condolences about "young love," mistaking her grief for a simple breakup. She let him talk, unable to explain these tears were for the man she loved too deeply to be with.

Rosalind answered the door at Wright Manor. One look at Evelyn's swollen eyes and she gasped. "Evelyn! What happened?" Her fingers tightened around Evelyn's wrist. "Who did this to you?"

"I'm fine," Evelyn lied, brushing past her.

Rosalind pursued her up the grand staircase. "Tell me who hurt you!"

Evelyn collapsed onto the canopied bed, burying her face in silk pillows. Rosalind perched beside her. "Where were you? I've been worried sick."

Shudders wracked Evelyn's frame. "He... he told me he loved me," she choked out. "And I had to say no."

"General Blackwood?" Rosalind breathed.

Evelyn's composure shattered. "He asked for so little! Just... just occasional messages. And I couldn't even give him that." She clutched at her chest. "I'm monstrous, aren't I? This pain... it's unbearable."

Rosalind gathered the weeping woman into her arms. "Evelyn... do you love him too?"

The silent answer spoke volumes. Rosalind stroked her hair. "You're doing what you must. He'll understand someday."

"Make it stop," Evelyn begged between sobs. "The pain... is there medicine? Anything?"

Tears welled in Rosalind's eyes. She'd never seen her strong-willed charge so broken. They cried together until exhaustion claimed them.

"Evelyn, please," Rosalind whispered later. "General Blackwood would support your decision if he knew—"

"Enough!" Evelyn cut her off sharply.

Rosalind bit her lip, glancing at the door. She stayed the night, watching over Evelyn's fitful sleep.

Morning light revealed the damage - puffy eyes, pale complexion. Yet the storm of tears had left Evelyn strangely hollow, numb.

She was halfway to Archibald's suite when Victoria's voice froze her in the grand foyer.

"Stop right there." The blonde lounged on a velvet settee, arms crossed. Her expression promised trouble.
###Chapter 303

Evelyn froze mid-step. Victoria sprang up from her seat, her manicured nails digging into her palms as she spat through clenched teeth, "What did you say to Liam? Why has he suddenly called off our engagement?"

Silence stretched between them. Victoria's eyes burned with venom as she enunciated each syllable, "Was it you? Did you meet Liam last night? Answer me, you mute little witch!"

"Yes."

"You conniving bitch. I knew you were behind this." Victoria's rage erupted like a volcano. Her hand flew up, poised to strike Evelyn's face.

Before the blow could land, Rosalind materialized between them, catching Victoria's wrist with bone-crushing precision. A strangled cry escaped Victoria's lips as white-hot pain shot up her arm.

Wrenching free, Victoria staggered back, cradling her injured wrist. Her wide eyes assessed the petite woman before her - delicate frame belying terrifying strength.

Rosalind positioned herself protectively in front of Evelyn, lips curling into a razor-thin smile. "Ms. Wright, we live in civilized society. Strike her face, and I'll break both your hands."

"You dare—" Victoria choked on her fury.

"Try me." Rosalind's glare could freeze hell.

"Winston! Get over here!" Victoria shrieked.

The butler appeared instantly, bowing slightly. "How may I serve you, Ms. Wright?"

Pointing an accusing finger, Victoria commanded, "Throw these trespassers out immediately. Ban them from Wright Manor permanently."

"At once, Ms. Wright." Winston produced his phone. Within moments, six uniformed guards materialized.

Rosalind shot Evelyn a panicked look. "Evelyn, we need to move."

Evelyn's mind raced. Staying meant danger, but leaving might be worse.

Victoria's smirk turned vicious. "Have them arrested for trespassing and assault."

The guards advanced. One reached for Rosalind—only to go flying from a spinning kick that left the others gaping.

Victoria paled, realizing the delicate woman was trained combat personnel.

"Take her down!" Victoria screamed.

Five guards charged simultaneously. Evelyn retreated as Rosalind's posture shifted—predatory grace replacing her usual demure stance.

Fists flew. Bodies collided. Within moments, three guards lay groaning on the marble floor.

Victoria's finger trembled as she pointed. "Who the hell are you?"

"Call the police!" Winston fumbled with his phone.

Rosalind darted back to Evelyn's side. "They're bringing authorities. We need to leave now."

"After that display? You're not going anywhere," Victoria sneered.

A commanding voice cut through the chaos. "Put that phone down."

All heads turned. Archibald Wright stood framed in the doorway, his presence radiating authority. Those ancient eyes missed nothing.

"Grandfather!" Victoria's demeanor shattered into tearful theatrics as she rushed toward him.
###Chapter 304

"Grandfather, you're awake!" Victoria rushed forward and clutched Archibald's arm. Forcing tears into her eyes, she exclaimed dramatically, "Grandfather, you've finally woken up! This is wonderful news."

Evelyn and Rosalind remained composed. Archibald gazed affectionately at Evelyn before instructing Victoria, "Help me to the sofa."

Victoria wiped her crocodile tears and assisted him. Evelyn and Rosalind followed silently behind.

Thirty minutes later, Julian burst through the doors. His face paled when he saw Archibald seated comfortably, guilt flashing across his features. Archibald sipped his tea calmly, refusing to even glance at his son.

Margaret arrived shortly after, her hands trembling visibly. Tears streamed down her wrinkled cheeks as she approached. "Archibald! Oh Archibald, you're awake at last. How are you feeling?" she cried. "Thank heavens you've recovered."

When Margaret reached to touch him, Archibald brushed her away impatiently. "Enough. Sit down."

Julian inhaled sharply before taking a seat. "Father," he said with feigned enthusiasm, "we're all so relieved you're awake."

Archibald responded with a noncommittal grunt. Julian's eyes darted between elegant Evelyn and unassuming Rosalind.

Once everyone was settled, Victoria pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn. "Grandfather, you must give me justice! This woman is despicable. Liam promised to marry me, but she somehow manipulated him!"

"She's even using our engagement to blackmail Grandmother into letting her stay here. You must help me!"

Archibald regarded Victoria with barely concealed disdain before turning to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter," he asked gently, "might I inquire why you've taken residence at Wright Manor?"

Evelyn answered calmly, "After divorcing Liam, I was left with nothing. Since Dr. Whitmore is my ex and Ms. Dawson contributed to our separation, I decided to move here."

Archibald feigned surprise. "Ah, so you were involved with Julian."

Victoria exploded. "Left with nothing? That's absurd! Grandmother offered her money and property, but she refused everything just to stay here. She's clearly scheming something!"

"Archibald, you should listen to Victoria. Both women seem highly suspicious," Margaret interjected.

"What possible conspiracy could two women be plotting?" Archibald demanded sternly.

"Have you gone senile? It's obvious! She rejects our generous offers yet insists on staying in our home. She's Victoria's romantic rival, for heaven's sake!" Margaret blurted out.

"How curious." Archibald turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, were you perhaps so heartbroken after your divorce that you wished to reconcile with Julian and make amends?"

Rosalind nearly gasped. Only Archibald could concoct such a theory. Evelyn smiled and nodded. "Mr. Wright, you've discovered my true intentions."

Julian gaped in disbelief.

Margaret shot to her feet. "This is outrageous! I won't allow it!"
###Chapter 305

Victoria Dawson shot up from her seat. "I object!" she declared loudly.

Archibald Hoffis paid no attention to the protest. His calm gaze settled on Julian Whitmore. "Julian, Ms. Wright came here for you. Do you still have feelings for her?"

Evelyn Carter turned her mesmerizing eyes toward Julian. That gentle gaze could melt any man's resistance. Though he knew her intentions weren't pure, he couldn't help but murmur, "Let her stay."

A grateful smile curved Evelyn's lips as she nodded at Julian.

"From this moment," Archibald announced with authority, "Ms. Wright and her companion shall be honored guests of the Hoffis family. No one may ask them to leave."

"Grandfather!" Victoria protested.

"You senile old man," Margaret Hoffis muttered under her breath.

Victoria's phone vibrated sharply. She pulled it out impatiently, scowling when she saw Julian's name on the screen. What could he possibly want now?

Julian tossed his phone onto the table with a grim expression. As Victoria read the message, her face darkened.

"Abort the mission to get close to Liam. Forget about inheriting the Hoffis fortune for now. Archibald's health appears stable - he could live for decades."

"The organization has confirmed: Evelyn Carter is still alive. Your priority is locating her and securing the remaining hydronium."

Victoria deleted the message with a sharp jab of her finger. "Fine," she spat. "She can stay. But cross me, and you'll regret it."

With that, she stormed upstairs. Julian offered a polite bow before retreating to his study. Margaret's glare burned into Evelyn's back.

Evelyn exchanged a relieved glance with Rosalind Baskins. They'd won this round.

One week later...

Rosalind burst into Evelyn's room, panic written across her face. "Evelyn! You need to see this!" she gasped, thrusting her phone forward.

Evelyn set aside her book, frowning. "What's wrong?"

Rosalind locked the door before rushing over. Her hands trembled as she pulled up the trending news. Evelyn's face drained of color as she read the headline:

"Purple Mushroom Cloud Over Aldenria Border"

The article detailed a massive explosion near the Aldenrian frontier, with a bizarre purple mushroom cloud rising into the sky. Casualty numbers remained unknown.

"Evelyn... it's purple," Rosalind whispered, her voice shaking.

Evelyn's breathing turned shallow. With trembling fingers, she dialed a number. "Rosalind, book us tickets to Aldenria. Now."

Rosalind swallowed hard. "Is there... radiation?"

"No," Evelyn answered sharply, phone pressed to her ear. Silent tears tracked down her cheeks when the call went unanswered. "Liam, please pick up!" she begged.

"Maybe General Blackwood isn't even in Aldenria," Rosalind offered weakly while searching for flights.

Evelyn tried three more times. No answer. She then called Adrian Castillo and Ryan Sullivan - both lines rang endlessly.

"Evelyn, there are no flights available."

Determination hardened Evelyn's features. She began throwing essentials into a bag. Rosalind rushed to do the same.

The world watched in horror as news of the mysterious purple explosion spread across every continent.
###Chapter 306

All transportation to the Aldenria border had been shut down. Renting a car was Evelyn and Rosalind’s only option.

They took turns driving through the night, exhaustion creeping in with every passing mile.

Evelyn kept dialing Liam’s number, her fingers trembling with each failed attempt. By dawn, they finally reached the checkpoint.

The scene before them was devastating. Emergency vehicles rushed past, sirens wailing. The sky was choked with a sickly violet haze, forcing everyone to wear protective masks.

A soldier stepped forward, his voice firm. "This area is restricted. Only authorized personnel are permitted beyond this point."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Where exactly was the explosion? Is the military base intact? Where’s General Blackwood? Is he alive?"

"I can’t disclose that information, ma’am. You need to leave."

Tears blurred her vision as she stared at the ominous sky. Her gaze fixed on the distant silhouette of the base.

Rosalind squeezed her hand. "Evelyn, he’s strong. Let’s find a place to stay nearby."

Evelyn shook her head, pointing at the toxic haze. "The contamination is severe. The water’s unsafe. People need medical help—those who inhaled the fumes, the injured—I can’t just walk away."

She turned back to the soldier, desperation lacing her voice. "Please. I’m a chemical researcher. I know how to handle this. You need me."

The soldier hesitated. "ID?"

Evelyn’s shoulders slumped. She had nothing. Rosalind gently pulled her back toward the car.

As Evelyn sank into the seat, she closed her eyes, the weight of helplessness crushing her.

"Do you think it was the hydronium?" Rosalind asked quietly.

Evelyn’s voice was barely a whisper. "Liam had two vials of it."

"But you said it was stable. How could it explode?"

"Only supersonic missiles can trigger it. The process is—"

Rosalind suddenly gasped, cutting her off. "Evelyn, look! Those are military vehicles!"

Evelyn bolted upright. A convoy had stopped at the checkpoint. Her heart pounded as she spotted a familiar face. "Ryan!"

Ryan Sullivan, behind the wheel, turned in surprise. "Evelyn?"

Then the rear window lowered.

And there he was.

Liam Blackwood, alive.

The world seemed to pause. Evelyn stood frozen by the roadside, her slender frame stark against the desolate landscape.

She wore a simple white shirt, jeans, and sneakers, her hair tied back. Only her eyes were visible above the mask—eyes that locked onto Liam’s.

Relief flooded her so violently her knees nearly buckled. She clenched her fists, fighting back tears.

He was alive.

And just like that, so was she.
###Chapter 307

Liam could see the storm of emotions swirling in Evelyn's eyes - worry, fear, something deeper he couldn't name. The way she clutched her bag told him more than words ever could.

He stepped out of the armored vehicle, boots crunching on the debris-strewn ground. The purple haze hung thick in the air between them.

Evelyn's hands trembled as she fumbled with a fresh dust mask. Before he could speak, she was reaching up, her fingers brushing against his jaw as she secured the straps. That simple touch sent electricity down his spine.

"Liam, the contamination levels are lethal," she whispered, her voice barely audible through her own mask. "You can't be out here unprotected."

"Turn around," he commanded, ignoring the way his pulse jumped at her proximity. "This isn't your fight."

Her chin lifted in that stubborn way he remembered too well. "Let me help. I have skills you need right now."

"We're at critical staffing levels." Liam gestured to the devastation around them. "I can't spare anyone to escort you back. Leave. Now."

The wind carried the acrid scent of burning chemicals between them. Evelyn didn't flinch. "I'm not asking permission, Commander Blackwood. I'm telling you I can solve this."

That old ache flared in his chest. "After everything you said? After walking away?" His voice roughened. "We're nothing to each other, remember?"

A beat of silence. Then, quietly: "I'm registered with Disaster Relief Corps. My credentials check out."

The bureaucratic answer shouldn't have stung, but it did. Liam turned away before she could see the effect she still had on him. "Your services aren't required."

"Liam." Her voice stopped him mid-stride. "Twelve hours post-detonation and your chem teams still can't neutralize this compound, can they?" She stepped closer. "I can have a counteragent synthesized in three hours."

When he turned, her gaze held the same fierce intelligence that had first drawn him to her. "Solterra University. Advanced chemical engineering." She tapped her temple. "You've seen what I can do."

Against his better judgment, Liam found himself nodding. The car door clicked open. "Get in."

Evelyn gestured to a black SUV idling behind them. "Rosalind's driving. We'll follow your lead."

Something dark flickered in Liam's eyes before he slammed his door shut. The convoy moved cautiously through the wreckage zone, the air growing thicker with each mile.

The military base loomed ahead, miraculously untouched by the blast. Through the bulletproof glass, Rosalind's awestruck whisper carried: "It's like a city unto itself. Thank God the detonation wasn't here."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her seatbelt. "Careful with your words," she murmured. "No one can know who I really am."

Rosalind nodded, eyes scanning the armed patrols. "Keep your head down, Ms. Wright. We'll get through this."
###Chapter 308

The military base's broad avenues were strewn with relief supplies for the displaced. Throngs of volunteers and soldiers moved urgently through the chaos.

Evelyn Carter and Rosalind Baskins stepped out of their armored vehicle, determination sharp in their gazes. The air smelled of dust and antiseptic.

"Liam." The voice was honeyed yet commanding. Victoria Hudson approached in full tactical gear, her focus solely on Liam Blackwood. "You're back already? Any breakthroughs?"

Her expression hardened when she noticed Evelyn. "Why is she here?"

Liam glanced at Evelyn before responding. "Appreciate you cutting your leave short for this. We need all hands."

"Of course. National security comes first." Victoria's tone softened only for him. Then, with a dismissive flick of her wrist toward Evelyn: "And her? Here to play damsel in distress?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms at their easy familiarity. She forced a polite smile. "Ms. Hudson. I'm here to assist."

Victoria's laugh was razor-thin. "With those delicate hands? You'll just slow us down."

Rosalind surged forward, fury darkening her features—but Evelyn caught her arm.

Liam noted the tension but prioritized the crisis. "Briefing's starting. Move out."

As they walked, Victoria suddenly winced, cradling her left arm.

"Injury?" Liam's concern was immediate.

"Just overworked since last night's op. It's nothing."

"Ryan," Liam called to his subordinate. "Escort her to medics."

Victoria gripped Liam's forearm. "Don't be ridiculous. A Blackwood wouldn't waste resources on a muscle strain." She flashed a brilliant smile, fingers lingering on his sleeve.

Evelyn watched them walk ahead—shoulders brushing, heads inclined in private conversation. Each shared laugh felt like shrapnel in her chest.

Victoria made sure to "accidentally" touch Liam twice more before he finally glanced back. Evelyn's mask of indifference had cracked; raw hurt flickered beneath.

He'd never seen her jealous before.

Victoria's voice pulled him away. "Did the Aldenrian specialists arrive?"

Liam quickened his pace. "Two full teams. They're prepping at the east wing."

Their voices faded as the crowd swallowed Evelyn and Rosalind. By the time they reached the elevator bank, the steel doors were already closing on Liam and Victoria's silhouettes.

Rosalind punched the wall. "That ice queen—"

Evelyn stared at the descending floor numbers. "We have work to do." Her voice didn't shake. She wouldn't let it.

The elevator dinged softly, as if mocking her resolve.
###Chapter 309

The next elevator arrived, and Evelyn Carter squeezed in with Rosalind Baskins. The cramped space was filled with Aldenria's top experts, all summoned to handle the aftermath of the catastrophic explosion. The air hummed with hushed, urgent whispers.

"What are these violet particles? I've never seen anything like them before."

"Rumors say it was triggered during hydronium missile development."

This is from N?velDrama.Org.

"Hydronium? But the lead researcher on that project died years ago. How is this possible?"

"Two vials remained, but they're likely destroyed now."

"Could the particles be a byproduct of hydronium reacting with something? The blast was catastrophic—half the continent shook. Earthquakes, tsunamis—"

"Quiet. We're here."

The elevator chimed, cutting off the conversation. Everyone filed out, tension thick in the air. Evelyn exchanged a glance with Rosalind before following the crowd into the expansive conference room.

Inside, the space was packed with military brass, elite engineers, and chemical researchers. Among them stood Ethan Reynolds and Benjamin Hart, faces Evelyn recognized from prior encounters. The atmosphere was grim, discussions laser-focused on disaster relief and reconstruction.

With limited seating, junior personnel stood along the walls. Evelyn and Rosalind positioned themselves in a corner, absorbing the heated debate. Liam Blackwood was so consumed by the crisis, he barely registered Evelyn's presence.

Benjamin Hart pulled up a presentation, detailing the experiment's failure, the devastation, and proposed solutions for airborne contaminants. Evelyn's expression darkened as she listened.

"General Blackwood, based on our analysis, this is the fastest method to mitigate pollution," Benjamin stated.

"How long?" Liam's voice was clipped.

"One week for air purification. Water decontamination will take sixty days. Nearby residents must evacuate immediately."

Skeptical murmurs erupted.

"Ten thousand personnel are stationed here, not counting equipment and armories. Relocating everything is impossible."

"Exactly. It's not feasible."

"Even if civilian numbers are low, we're still looking at thousands scattered across the region. Evacuation logistics are a nightmare."

Liam scanned the room. "Other options?"

The researchers scrambled through data, desperate for alternatives.

"Liam," Victoria Hudson interjected, "what about specialists from Solterra? They might have insights."

A shadow flickered across Liam's face before he schooled his expression.

"Ms. Hudson, we already consulted Solterra," the secretary-general replied. "Their hydronium explosion data was lost, and the lead researcher is deceased."

"So Dr. Hart's plan is our only solution?" Victoria pressed.

"For now, yes," the other scientists confirmed.

Rosalind leaned close to Evelyn, voice taut with worry. "Evelyn, surely you have ideas?"

Evelyn hesitated. Helping Liam without exposing her true identity was a razor's edge. The debate raged on, but no breakthroughs emerged.

Just as Liam moved to finalize the decision, Evelyn stepped forward. "Wait."

Every head turned. Liam's tense gaze softened imperceptibly.

Victoria scoffed. "Ms. Carter, you shouldn't even be here. This is no place for amateurs."
###Chapter 310

"Mrs. Blackwood? You're here too?" Ethan exclaimed, jumping to his feet with excitement.

"Mrs. Blackwood? General Blackwood divorced her years ago," Victoria stated casually, stirring her coffee without looking up.

Her words sent shockwaves through the room. It was audacious of Victoria to reveal Evelyn and Liam's marital status at such a crucial gathering. Only Evelyn seemed visibly affected, her cheeks flushing pink.

"Cassandra, do you have something to share?" Liam's voice was calm but carried undeniable authority.

"The purple particulates are actually hydronium fission byproducts. When they collide—"

Evelyn's explanation was cut short by Victoria's scoff. "Get to the point already. Nobody cares about your scientific babble."

The room fell silent.

"Cassandra, please continue." Liam's patience was evident in his measured tone.

"But Liam, she—"

Liam raised a hand to silence Victoria, who bit her lip and shot Evelyn a withering glare.

Simplifying her explanation, Evelyn continued, "We can deploy the Celestial Absorption method. Spraying the Celestial Elixir in free state from helicopters will cause it to react with the particles, transforming them into mist."

"This mist will then precipitate, purifying both air and water sources upon contact."

Ethan stood abruptly, eyes alight with curiosity. "What exactly do you mean by free-state Celestial Elixir? Ms. Carter, could you elaborate?"

Evelyn scanned the skeptical faces around her. Explaining complex chemical processes would only invite more doubt. "Give me a lab. I'll demonstrate."

Victoria laughed derisively. "Ms. Carter, even Solterra's top scientists couldn't solve this. What makes you think your amateur chemistry knowledge is sufficient? Where does this arrogance come from?"

Before Liam could respond, several senior researchers had already ushered Evelyn away.

Victoria gaped at their retreating backs. "Liam! Why are they humoring her?"

Liam ignored her, refocusing the meeting.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan burst into the conference room clutching two vials, hands trembling. "General Blackwood... it's possible."

"What's possible?"

Ethan held up a vial of concentrated purple contaminant. The entire room watched as he sprayed a fine mist into the container. The purple particles vanished instantly, leaving only harmless water vapor.

"Our tests confirm the resulting vapor is completely safe. Air quality meets all standards."

Liam stood abruptly. "How long to decontaminate the entire area?"

"Approximately five hours for complete air and water purification," Ethan replied.

A rare spark of excitement flashed in Liam's eyes. "Execute immediately."

"Wait," Victoria interjected. "Did Evelyn develop this solution?"

"Yes, Ms. Carter created a new free-state compound—the Celestial Elixir," Ethan confirmed.

"Who developed it is irrelevant. If it works, implement it. Now." Liam's command brooked no argument.

"But General Blackwood—" Ethan's expression darkened, hesitation clear in his voice.
###Chapter 311

Liam Blackwood stood unwavering, his voice radiating steady confidence. "Dr. Reynolds, speak your mind without hesitation."

Ethan Reynolds adjusted his glasses nervously. "To synthesize the Celestial Elixir for atmospheric purification, we require massive quantities of Azurium."

The room erupted in murmurs as Liam's face darkened.

"Valtoria lacks Azurium production capabilities," a minister interjected. "We're entirely import-dependent."

"Even a single pound costs billions of dollars on the black market," another added.

Victoria Hudson smirked from her seat. "Then Ms. Carter's proposal appears impossible."

Ethan wiped his brow. "General Blackwood, this concerns thousands of lives. Traditional methods would take months with inferior results."

Liam's fingers drummed the table. "Estimated quantity?"

"Initial projections suggest eighty pounds minimum," Ethan replied.

A procurement officer stood abruptly. "That's thirty-four billion dollars! The treasury can't possibly—"

"Are there alternatives?" Liam interrupted.

Ethan shook his head. "None effective."

Liam exhaled sharply. "We've allocated eight billion for relief efforts. This isn't feasible."

Just then, Evelyn Carter entered with Rosalind Baskins. Ethan's face lit up. "Ms. Carter! Please explain—"

She placed a dossier before Liam. His eyebrows shot up as he scanned the documents, then slowly nodded.

Evelyn's voice remained calm. "Have the Engineering Corps work through the night. We need these materials from Aldenria—approximately two tons."

She tapped the final page. "Total cost: 1.8 billion dollars for eighty pounds of synthesized Azurium."

The room fell silent.

"Preposterous!" someone muttered. "Only three nations possess this technology!"

Victoria rose abruptly. "Where did you obtain these schematics?" Her eyes narrowed. "This is classified military tech."

Rosalind stepped between them, snatching the documents. "These are beyond your clearance, Ms. Hudson."

Victoria scoffed. "In a crisis, transparency matters! What are you hiding?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened but she remained silent.

Rosalind glared at Liam. "As commanding officer, you know the sensitivity. These designs could shift global power balances."

Victoria crossed her arms. "I'd love to hear how an artist acquired restricted chemical weaponry blueprints."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened. Rosalind's hand drifted toward her sidearm as tension crackled through the room.
###Chapter 312

Victoria Hudson's voice cut through the tension. "Are these stolen designs?"

Rosalind Baskins turned to Evelyn Carter with frustration. "Evelyn, I warned you this wasn't worth the risk. Look at the mess we're in now! People are accusing you of theft."

Evelyn calmly took the documents from Rosalind and approached Liam Blackwood. "Liam, I need your word that these will remain confidential."

Liam's intense gaze never wavered as he replied softly, "Consider it done." Without hesitation, he personally rushed to the weapons facility with the blueprints, leaving the room in stunned silence.

"Why would General Blackwood trust her like this without consulting us first?"
"Who is she really?"
"She's his ex-wife."
"What does she do for work?"
"She doesn't work."
"A housewife designing Azurium machines? Developing this technology alone? Our country has struggled with this for a decade, and she acts like it's simple. This is madness!"

The whispers barely registered as Evelyn ignored them completely.

As she turned to leave, Victoria called out, "Ms. Carter, where did you obtain these designs? Are you wasting Liam's resources, or do you actually believe this will work?"

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "Success or failure, we'll know by noon tomorrow, Ms. Hudson. Why not wait and see?"

Victoria's expression turned icy as she stepped closer, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "If these are stolen and cause an international incident, I'll hold you personally responsible."

Unfazed, Evelyn replied, "Feel free to verify online, Ms. Hudson. These technologies aren't patented. It's simply a matter of capability."

Victoria clenched her fists, searching Evelyn's face for any sign of deception.

Understanding Victoria's protective instincts toward Liam, Evelyn didn't take offense. "I have work to do," she said simply, turning away.

Rosalind quickly followed.

Growing increasingly uneasy, Victoria consulted the specialists present. "Is it true only three nations possess this technology?"

The lead scientist nodded gravely. "Azurium is widely used but prohibitively expensive. Aldenria has spent ten years trying to replicate these machines, let alone master the refinement process."

"To think they could achieve it overnight is pure fantasy."
"This isn't some childish experiment."

For the next twenty-four hours, the weapons division worked tirelessly as raw materials poured in from across the country.

To observers, it seemed a fool's errand.

Everyone advised Liam against wasting resources, even President Harrison Pierce called repeatedly to intervene.

Amid disaster relief efforts, Liam remained steadfast, allocating significant assets to the project despite the criticism.

His unwavering faith stemmed from one truth - even if Evelyn didn't love him, she would never intentionally harm him.

Twelve hours later, the machines were operational. After two hours of refinement, purified Azurium emerged.

Evelyn, accompanied by Ethan Reynolds and Benjamin Hart, led specialized teams in increasing purity levels before personally producing 100 pounds of medicinal Elixir.

When the Azurium was finally produced, the room fell into shocked silence, as if witnessing a miracle.

On the third day, helicopters took to the skies, dispersing the Elixir. As it sprayed, the purple particles in the atmosphere instantly purified.
###Chapter 313

The entire research team stood in stunned silence. Through Evelyn Carter and the specialists' tireless efforts, an environmental crisis that should have required over a month to resolve was completely eradicated in just five days.

Representatives from Aldenria and international journalists swarmed the military base. Yet, only a single press officer was dispatched to handle the media frenzy.

Both the mechanical engineering and chemical research divisions now regarded Evelyn as their undisputed legend.

Every time she entered the mess hall, Evelyn found herself surrounded by eager scientists. A barrage of questions rained down on her.

Except for details about her identity and past, Evelyn answered every inquiry with unwavering honesty. Gradually, the specialists realized this seemingly soft-spoken woman was anything but ordinary.

Despite her youth, her depth of knowledge and expertise rivaled that of veteran professors.

Ryan Sullivan burst into Liam Blackwood’s office, urgency etched across his face. "General Blackwood."

Liam leaned back in his chair, eyes closed in exhaustion. "What is it?"

Ryan pressed on, "General Blackwood, Cassandra Wright is a Solterran. She studied chemistry at Solterra National Defense University. But beyond that, her background remains a mystery."

Liam responded with a weary hum, clearly drained from days of relentless work.

"General Blackwood, all the chemistry professors now vouch for her extraordinary abilities. They consider her a rare prodigy and are begging you to keep her at the base."

Liam frowned. "She divorced me without taking a cent. Her grandfather is the wealthiest man in Aldenria, yet she refuses to acknowledge him or inherit his fortune. How am I supposed to retain someone who couldn’t care less about money?"

After a brief pause, Ryan added, "General Blackwood, there’s more."

"What now?"

Ryan continued, "The engineers from the Armaments Division report that Ms. Carter effortlessly deciphers their blueprints. She even identified flaws in an automatic handwheel and proposed improvements."

"The resulting prototypes, refined based on her suggestions, have exceeded all standards with unmatched precision."

Liam’s eyes snapped open, his expression a mix of exhaustion and sharp intensity.

Equally stunned, Ryan whispered, "General Blackwood, I’m starting to worry. She doesn’t seem to be just Evelyn Carter or Cassandra Wright. She’s far more formidable than we imagined."

Liam grabbed his phone and stood. "Where is she?"

"She’s packing. She might leave today," Ryan replied, following him.

As they strode down the hall, Liam ordered, "Have security stop her. Don’t let her leave yet."

"Understood." Ryan quickly dialed a number.

Inside the dormitory, Rosalind Baskins was packing while Evelyn lounged on the couch, munching an apple while flipping through blueprints.

After scanning them, she chuckled. "This pistol performs well, but it’s hideous."

Rosalind zipped her suitcase shut. "Evelyn, enough. You’ve already helped them enough. Don’t forget—you signed a 15-year contract. Your skills belong to Solterra."

Evelyn nodded. "I know."

"What about the report on the Azurium machine and production tech? Have you thought about how to submit it?" Rosalind asked.

Evelyn shrugged. "Handle it however you want. Whatever punishment they give, I’ll accept it."

Rosalind sighed. "You’re too arrogant. You know Solterra values talent and won’t let you go easily. Yet you act so recklessly."

Evelyn smirked. "You think they’ll terminate my contract early?"

Rosalind scoffed. "Dream on. When the 15 years end, they’ll push for a lifetime contract. They won’t risk losing someone like you."

Evelyn took another bite. "The world is full of talent. I’m just one of many. Nothing irreplaceable about me."

Meanwhile, Liam and Ryan stood frozen at the doorway. Liam’s hand hovered mid-air, too stunned to knock.
###Chapter 314

Liam Blackwood emerged from the dormitory with Ryan Sullivan by his side.

The deserted roadside stretched before them as Liam came to an abrupt stop. His piercing gaze fixed on the distant horizon, shadows dancing in his storm-gray eyes.

Ryan tilted his head. "General Blackwood, why not confront her directly?"

A bitter chuckle escaped Liam's lips. "Confront her about what?"

"She clearly stated she's a scientist from Solterra with a fifteen-year contract," Ryan explained, adjusting his military cap.

Liam's smile faded as he turned fully toward Ryan, the weight of unspoken truths dimming his usual commanding presence. "Do you comprehend what such a long-term commitment means for a scientist of her caliber?"

Ryan shook his head slowly.

After a heavy silence, Liam's voice dropped to a confidential tone. "What we witnessed today never leaves this circle. Not a single word."

"Understood, General," Ryan replied, though his curiosity about Evelyn's scientific prowess burned brighter than ever.

Liam glanced back at the dormitory building, his jaw tightening before issuing orders. "You and Adrian remain here to oversee operations. I'm returning to Aldenria."

"Yes, sir," Ryan responded immediately.

"Go," Liam commanded with a dismissive wave.

Ryan offered a crisp salute before turning on his heel.

Liam stood motionless, his military boots planted firmly on the pavement as he awaited the inevitable.

Exactly ten minutes later, Evelyn Carter and Rosalind Baskins exited the building. Evelyn froze mid-step when she spotted Liam, her radiant smile dissolving into something more guarded.

Their eyes locked for a charged moment.

Evelyn approached cautiously while Rosalind marched straight to their waiting vehicle, loading luggage with practiced efficiency.

"Liam," Evelyn greeted, her voice softening in that peculiar way it always did around him - all shy glances and nervous fingers plucking at her sweater sleeves.

His expression gentled. "Returning to Aldenria?"

She studied the pavement. "Yes."

"Perfect timing. Mind if I hitch a ride?" Liam asked casually, though his knuckles whitened around his duffel strap.

Evelyn's head snapped up in surprise.

Liam gave her a lazy half-smile. "Everyone's occupied. No available drivers."

"I- You could- That is..." Evelyn stammered, her cheeks flushing pink. "It's not that I don't want to, it's just..."

Liam's smooth baritone cut through her flustered explanation. "I've been running on three hours of sleep for days. Probably shouldn't be behind the wheel."

Evelyn's thoughts whirled. Every logical instinct warned against prolonged proximity to Liam Blackwood, yet some traitorous part of her thrilled at the prospect of sharing the confined space.

"Evelyn, let's go," Rosalind called from the driver's seat, having finished loading.

Evelyn turned. "Rosalind, General Blackwood will be joining us."

Rosalind's eyebrows shot up before schooling her features into professional neutrality. "General, please get in."

Liam moved to open the rear passenger door, holding it expectantly. But Evelyn had already claimed the front seat, buckling herself in with deliberate focus.

For a heartbeat, Liam remained frozen, then with a quiet exhale, folded his tall frame into the backseat.

As the car pulled forward, they halted at the compound's security checkpoint for clearance verification.

A sharp rap on the window startled them.

Evelyn lowered the glass to reveal Victoria Hudson standing outside, designer suitcase in tow, her gaze flickering past Evelyn to Liam in the back.

"Ms. Hudson?" Evelyn forced polite curiosity into her voice.

Victoria's smile could have melted glaciers. "All returning to Aldenria?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

Victoria's grin widened. "Would you terribly mind a third passenger? Save me the dreadful commercial flight."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. A thousand refusals crowded her throat, but none polite enough to voice.
###Chapter 315

Though Evelyn held some reservations about Victoria, they paled in comparison to the sheer malice Victoria Dawson harbored. There had never been any real conflict between them. It would have been unthinkable for Liam to refuse such a simple request from Victoria.

"Of course, hop in," Evelyn replied warmly.

Rosalind popped the trunk open, allowing Victoria to stow her luggage before sliding into the back seat beside Liam.

"Liam, what a surprise! I didn’t realize you were here too," Victoria greeted him with practiced familiarity.

Liam responded with a curt, "Yeah."

The car sped along the open road after leaving the military base. The sky stretched endlessly above them, a brilliant blue canvas dotted with soft, drifting clouds. Rolling fields of golden grass flanked the highway, interrupted only by the occasional gentle rise of distant hills—a breathtaking landscape.

Evelyn couldn’t help but admire the view, though a quiet melancholy lingered in her chest.

In the back seat, Victoria chattered incessantly, jumping from topics of national politics to trivial gossip, from failed research projects to disaster relief efforts. Liam offered only the occasional monosyllabic response.

"I never expected Ms. Carter to be so remarkably skilled," Victoria suddenly remarked, her tone laced with curiosity. "What exactly did you do before all this?"

Evelyn hesitated briefly. "I don’t have much professional experience. I studied chemistry in university, so I have some foundational knowledge."

Victoria arched a brow. "Someone who can engineer machines and synthesize Azurium on their own is far beyond 'foundational knowledge.' The scientists at the base can’t stop talking about you. You’ve been the center of attention these past few days."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, offering a faint, noncommittal smile. Sensing she wasn’t getting anywhere, Victoria smoothly shifted gears.

"Liam." Her voice softened, taking on a nostalgic lilt. "Do you remember that field training exercise years ago? I twisted my ankle and couldn’t walk. You refused to leave me behind—carried me for twelve miles. Even when the mission failed, you stayed with me."

Liam frowned. He would’ve done the same for anyone. He had no idea why she was bringing this up now.

"Why mention that?" he asked, his tone flat.

The words settled heavily in Evelyn’s chest, leaving a bitter aftertaste. Logically, she knew she had no right to feel anything, but her heart refused to listen. The emotions churning inside her were beyond her control.

Victoria leaned back, casting a tender look at Liam. Her voice was thick with emotion as she murmured, "After that, I swore I’d never abandon you. No matter what happens in this life, I’ll stand by you."

"Unnecessary," Liam replied coolly, his expression unreadable.

Rosalind, gripping the steering wheel, rolled her eyes so hard it was a miracle they didn’t get stuck. Victoria’s theatrics were nauseating.

Victoria glanced at Evelyn’s stiff posture. Though she couldn’t see her face, a smug satisfaction curled in her chest.

"Liam, it’s been ages since our last barbecue. I’ve been craving your roasted eggplant and lamb skewers. Once everything settles, let’s have a feast at my place," she suggested eagerly.

"Fine," Liam muttered, closing his eyes.

Victoria beamed, leaning forward. "Ms. Carter, you should join us if you’re free."

Evelyn inhaled deeply, her fingers tightening imperceptibly on the edge of her seat. She forced her voice to remain steady. "Thanks for the invitation, but I’ll likely be occupied."

"What a shame," Victoria sighed dramatically. "Liam rarely cooks, but when he does, it’s divine. His barbecue could put professional chefs to shame."

"Is that so?" Evelyn managed a tight smile, her nails digging into the seat fabric.
###Chapter 316

Evelyn glanced through the rearview mirror, finding Liam resting peacefully with his eyes closed.

A sudden wave of bitterness and anger surged within her, but it was Liam's calm demeanor that infuriated her most.

Before discovering her true identity, he had claimed to adore her for a decade. Now, those words rang hollow. Was it all just retaliation for her rejection?

Meanwhile, Victoria kept chattering about her shared history with Liam. "For my birthday, Liam went above and beyond—he baked me a cake from scratch. Put his whole heart into it."

Evelyn's chest tightened painfully. Forcing a smile, she turned to Liam and softly called, "Liam."

Startled, he met her gaze. "Yes?" His voice was gentle.

Victoria's expression darkened as her eyes darted between them.

With a subtle smile, Evelyn said, "I'd love to try your cake too. Could you bake one for me?"

Liam's lips curved slightly. "Of course."

"When are you free?" she pressed.

His gaze softened. "Whenever you want."

"How about tonight?"

"No problem."

"I want chocolate flavor," Evelyn added playfully.

"Consider it done," Liam replied sincerely.

Rosalind stifled a laugh watching the exchange.

Victoria bit her lip, arms crossed as she stared out the window.

After three hours, they pulled into a rest stop.

Evelyn entered the shop, scanning the menu when Victoria's voice interrupted.

"Liam, I want the beef noodles, but the portion's too big. Been dieting. Share with me?"

Evelyn watched from the corner of her eye.

"They might make a smaller portion," Liam suggested.

Victoria nudged him. "That's wasteful!"

Evelyn's chest constricted. She looked away, unsettled by her own jealousy despite having no right.

Liam sighed. "Fine, order it."

As Victoria ordered, Evelyn told the waiter, "Seafood pasta, no onions or parsley."

Victoria teased, "Ms. Wright, you're quite particular."

Evelyn met her gaze coolly. "Having preferences isn't a crime."

Victoria then asked Liam, "Get me some yogurt?"

"Sure." Their long friendship made such requests natural. He turned to Evelyn. "What about you, Cass?"

Gripping her thumb tightly, she forced a smile. "Two plum juices."

Liam frowned. "You hate sour drinks."

"People change," she clipped.

"Alright." He left for the store.

At the table, Evelyn and Rosalind sat opposite Liam and Victoria—though originally, Evelyn and Liam were meant to face each other.
###Chapter 317

Victoria approached with a small bowl, intending to share the beef noodle soup between Liam and herself. Evelyn felt a sharp pang in her chest. She discreetly nudged Rosalind and murmured, "Let's switch seats."

Liam's eyes darkened as he watched Evelyn deliberately distance herself during their seating rearrangement.

Rosalind had chosen fried chicken, and when Evelyn handed her the plum juice, she eyed it suspiciously. "Why not get me a soda? What's with this sour stuff?" she questioned.

Evelyn remained silent as she twisted off the cap and took a sip, her face immediately scrunching up. "It's refreshing," she countered. "The tartness cuts through the grease of your chicken perfectly."

After setting down the bottle, Evelyn picked up her fork with deliberate calmness.

Victoria divided the noodles and pushed the larger portion toward Liam. "Liam, you should eat more."

Liam noticed his bowl overflowed with tender beef slices while Victoria's contained mostly broth with sparse noodles. Having known Victoria for years, he was well aware of her obsession with beef. Today's behavior struck him as peculiar.

Sliding his bowl toward her, he insisted, "Take some meat."

Victoria shook her head, though her hungry gaze remained fixed on his bowl. "You've been working too hard lately," she said sweetly. "You need the protein more than I do."

Noticing her barely concealed longing, Liam simply transferred several beef slices to her bowl.

Victoria's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Thank you, Liam," she cooed. "You always know how to take care of me."

Evelyn suddenly found her food tasteless, the atmosphere stifling.

Meanwhile, Rosalind tore into her fried chicken and asked bluntly, "Why are you two sharing one order? Broke or something?"

Victoria smiled demurely. "I'm watching my figure. Can't have full portions."

Rosalind snorted. "Then order a half portion. Don't shortchange General Blackwood."

Victoria turned wide, innocent eyes toward Liam. "Is this enough for you, Liam?"

"It's fine," he replied evenly.

Rosalind frowned, analyzing Victoria's performance before shifting her gaze to Liam. The gears turned in her head.

Liam was famously perceptive. How could he possibly miss Victoria's transparent act? It was practically a Broadway production!

Her attention shifted to Evelyn with newfound sympathy.

No wonder Evelyn wasn't eating. The plum juice wasn't just a drink choice - it was a coping mechanism for this jealousy-inducing spectacle.

Rosalind returned to her chicken with renewed vigor, savoring each crispy bite.

After lunch, they resumed their journey. Within minutes, Victoria succumbed to drowsiness and let her head fall onto Liam's shoulder.

Evelyn caught the intimate scene in the rearview mirror. A lead weight settled in her chest. She turned toward the window, resting her chin on her folded arms as melancholy washed over her.

Her thoughts swirled chaotically. She'd rejected Liam's advances. She had no right to feel this burning resentment, this acidic jealousy, this overwhelming urge to claim him.

"Rosalind," Liam called softly.

"Yes, General Blackwood?"

His voice remained gentle. "Pull over up ahead. I'll take the wheel."

Rosalind protested immediately. "We can't possibly let you drive, sir!"

Evelyn subtly elbowed her in understanding.

Liam caught the movement, his lips quirking slightly. "Let's stop here," he suggested.

Rosalind glanced at Victoria, now peacefully nestled against Liam's shoulder, and comprehension dawned.

"Understood, General Blackwood. Thank you for taking over."
###Chapter 318

The sleek black sedan came to a smooth halt by the curb.

Liam carefully adjusted Evelyn's head against the seat before stepping out and switching places with Rosalind.

As Rosalind settled into the backseat and clicked her seatbelt, her gaze flickered toward Evelyn, who was clearly feigning sleep.

She couldn't help but think Evelyn, with her respectable position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, should know better than to act this way. Only someone as oblivious as Liam would fail to notice. No wonder Cassandra seemed so troubled.

With a quiet scoff, Rosalind rolled up the window and leaned against it, watching the city lights blur past as the car moved again.

Cassandra shifted slightly, tension coiling in her shoulders. Yet as she stared ahead, her mood gradually lightened.

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn finally opened her eyes. She frowned at Cassandra and Liam in the front seats, biting her lip before closing her eyes again, resuming her charade.

Dusk had settled over Aldenria by the time they arrived.

The car stopped in front of Blackwood Manor, directly across from Hudson Estate. With a polite word of thanks, Evelyn stepped out and disappeared into the night.

Liam unbuckled his seatbelt but didn’t move. After a beat of silence, his voice softened. "Still interested in trying my homemade cake?"

Cassandra hesitated, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag. She wanted to say yes—desperately—but the weight of recent events pressed down on her.

"Maybe another time," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

The words came out colder than she intended, and Liam visibly deflated, sinking back into his seat with a quiet exhale.

He wasn’t ready to let go. "When, then?"

Cassandra lowered her head, silence stretching between them like an unbridgeable chasm.

Liam waited, his hope dwindling with each passing second. He would have walked through fire for her, faced any danger—if only she’d asked. But she didn’t. The realization that she didn’t need him cut deeper than any blade.

Without another word, he pushed open the door and stepped out, walking away without looking back.

Cassandra lifted her gaze, unshed tears glistening as she watched him disappear into the night. Her chest ached with the weight of everything left unsaid.

Rosalind slid back into the driver’s seat, sensing Cassandra’s turmoil. She didn’t press. Starting the engine, she pulled away swiftly, leaving the tension hanging thick in the air.

By the time they reached Wright Manor, dinner was already in full swing.

Cassandra and Rosalind entered the dining room, offering polite greetings to Archibald and Margaret. Archibald’s eyes crinkled with warmth, his smile inviting, while Margaret and Victoria exchanged exasperated glances.

Julian’s expression remained unreadable as his gaze flickered between Cassandra and Archibald.

"Evelyn, Rosalind, you must be starving. Join us," Archibald said warmly.

Rosalind didn’t hesitate, taking her seat with a grateful nod. "Thank you."

Cassandra offered a small smile as she gracefully settled into her chair.

Archibald set down his fork, leaning toward her with genuine curiosity. "Where have you been these past few days?"

Cassandra shrugged casually. "Just exploring a few tourist spots."

His smile softened. "Did you enjoy yourself?"

She nodded. "It was nice."

"Good. After dinner, give me your number—I’d like to stay in touch."

"Of course."

Archibald beamed. "Now, eat. You must be starving."

Margaret and Victoria exchanged stunned looks.

Archibald had always been stern, his authority unquestioned. Yet here he was, speaking to an outsider with a tenderness they’d never seen before.

Margaret narrowed her eyes. "Archibald, have you lost your mind?"

Victoria slammed her fork down, pouting. "Grandpa, I’m your actual granddaughter, and you’ve never been this sweet to me. What’s going on? Are you having an affair with her?"

The room went deathly silent.

Even Julian looked like he wanted to vanish into the floor.

Margaret smacked the table, her face red with fury. "How dare you!"

The sudden noise made Cassandra flinch, her brows knitting together as she studied Margaret.

She’d always known Margaret was blunt, but this level of thoughtlessness was staggering. Did she even realize how reckless her words were?
###Chapter 319

Evelyn's reckless behavior infuriated me. She hadn't thought things through at all.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself not to lose my temper with Margaret. After all, she'd been manipulated by that scheming Victoria.

Liam's jaw clenched as he fixed Margaret with a dangerous glare. "You—"

After enduring Julian and Victoria's constant pressure, he couldn't tolerate being pushed to the edge by his unreasonable wife.

Now he understood why Evelyn hesitated to reveal the truth. With Margaret's irrational behavior, telling her would be pointless.

Margaret pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn. "Whether it's Liam or Julian, don't get any ideas. Allowing you to stay here is already stretching my patience."

Evelyn offered a placating smile. "Please don't upset yourself, Mrs. Hoffis. It won't happen again. Let's eat."

Margaret huffed and returned to her meal.

Victoria studied Evelyn with narrowed eyes. "Tell me honestly - have you really cut all ties with Liam?"

"Completely," Evelyn confirmed.

Victoria pressed further, "Then why did he agree to marry me, only to change his mind? If not because of you, then what?"

Rosalind muttered under her breath while eating, "Aside from your family's money, you have nothing to offer. General Blackwood isn't blind. Why would he want you?"

Victoria's face flushed crimson. She grabbed a spoon and hurled it at Rosalind.

With astonishing reflexes, Rosalind dodged the flying utensil, leaving everyone stunned. She slammed the table and rose aggressively, catching Victoria off guard.

Evelyn quickly restrained Rosalind, signaling her to stand down.

Throughout dinner, Julian remained silent but watchful, his piercing gaze fixed on Evelyn. She sensed his growing suspicion.

Liam's sharp command cut through the tension. "Enough. Everyone focus on eating."

The meal, more like a battlefield, finally concluded.

As night fell, Rosalind crept onto the balcony outside Victoria's room to eavesdrop. What she discovered shocked her.

Julian entered Victoria's room and locked the door. Without warning, he delivered a stinging slap.

"You're an idiot. I can't understand why the organization chose someone as dim-witted as you."

Victoria retorted, "How dare you hit me? Is this because of Evelyn?"

Julian warned coldly, "Listen carefully. Your primary mission is to find Evelyn, not Liam."

"I was sent here to get close to Liam and steal Aldenria's secrets."

"You? You'll never get near Liam in this lifetime."

Victoria smirked. "Just wait. In two months, I'll not only marry Liam but carry his child."

Julian scoffed in disgust.

Rosalind gasped, slowly backing away before slipping onto the rooftop. She hurried to Evelyn's room.

Evelyn had just settled in bed when she heard movement. She sat up to find Rosalind entering through the balcony door.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn asked.

Rosalind climbed onto the bed and whispered urgently, "Evelyn, I've discovered something crucial."

"What is it?"

"Julian and Victoria belong to an organization. Julian's mission is to find you, while Victoria's is to infiltrate General Blackwood's circle and steal Aldenria's secrets."

Evelyn's expression darkened. Though she'd suspected, hearing it confirmed still shocked her.

Rosalind added, "I couldn't catch the organization's name."

Evelyn spoke slowly, recalling Liam's investigation. "It's the Obsidian Circle."

Rosalind's eyes widened. "The Obsidian Circle?"

Evelyn nodded.

Excited, Rosalind covered her mouth. "Could your parents be their prisoners?"

Evelyn sighed. "After all this searching, I finally have leads."

"How do we find their hideout?"

Evelyn's eyes hardened. "We capture their intermediary. Then we'll locate their headquarters."
###Chapter 320

"Must we continue waiting?" Rosalind's voice trembled with urgency.

"Yes."

"But this can't wait," she insisted, fingers twisting the fabric of her skirt. "Victoria is scheming against General Blackwood."

"What exactly is she planning?"

"She intends to force marriage within two months - possibly even conceive his child," Rosalind revealed.

Evelyn's breath caught, her nails digging into the mattress as shock rippled through her.

"That viper plans to drug him first. She'll likely slip something into his drink and then... take advantage."

Evelyn's knuckles turned white against the sheets. The horrifying image played behind her eyelids.

Taking a steadying breath, she countered, "Liam's no fool. He keeps his distance from her."

"But what about his staff? His family?" Rosalind pressed. "Victoria's resources run deep. Gold buys loyalty where trust fails."

Each word tightened the knot in Evelyn's stomach. "You should call him. Warn him immediately."

"And have him suspect every meal? Every handshake?" Evelyn's voice rose. "He can't live in constant paranoia!"

Rosalind chewed her lip. "Then what do you propose?"

Evelyn's fingers closed around Rosalind's wrist. "You go. Stay by his side."

"Me?" Rosalind recoiled. "I can't shadow a general day and night! Besides, he'd never allow it."

Evelyn punched the mattress, frustration boiling over. "Then what? Let that witch have her way?"

"Doesn't he have aides?"

"What if she's already bought them?"

Rosalind gave a humorless laugh. "Then I suppose General Blackwood is destined to become Victoria's trophy husband."

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes as she pounded the bed. That scheming harpy would stoop to drugging Liam? Forced marriage?

A man of honor like Liam would take responsibility if Victoria conceived. That single thought made Evelyn's blood run cold.

She sat bolt upright, damp hair clinging to her flushed cheeks. "Over my dead body."

Rosalind tilted her head. "If you trust no one else... why not go yourself?"

Evelyn froze, moisture gathering in her widened eyes. "Me?"

"Yes, you," Rosalind said gently. "He won't refuse you. Not his former wife. Not after everything."

Heat flooded Evelyn's face. "Absolutely not!"

She couldn't risk being near Liam again. Not when her heart still ached at the memory of his touch.

Rosalind shrugged. "Then we drop it. If Victoria succeeds... well, we'll wish them marital bliss."

Evelyn shot upright. "I'll go!"

Rosalind patted her shoulder. "Remember - we're protecting him from her schemes. Don't let your feelings complicate things."

Evelyn's cheeks burned. She grabbed Rosalind's waist. "What nonsense are you implying?"

Rosalind shrieked with laughter as they tumbled onto the bed. "Oh? Did I strike a nerve?"

"You wretched girl!" Evelyn growled, tickling mercilessly as Rosalind squirmed.

Their laughter filled the room, a brief respite from the storm gathering around Liam Blackwood.
###Chapter 321

The first light of dawn had barely touched the horizon when Evelyn Carter began packing her belongings.

Her hands moved with practiced efficiency, betraying her earlier claims of indifference toward Liam Blackwood's safety.

Rosalind Baskins still slept soundly in the adjacent room.

With her luggage prepared, Evelyn slipped quietly to Archibald Hoffis's chamber to bid farewell.

The elderly man glanced nervously at the walls, speaking in hushed tones. "Take care of yourself, child," he murmured, pressing a black credit card into her palm.

Evelyn shook her head, pushing the offering away.

The farewell was brief but heartfelt.

As she stepped through the grand gates of Wright Manor, Julian Whitmore materialized before her like a specter.

"Up before sunrise?" His lips curled in amusement as he blocked her path. "Where might you be going with all that luggage? And where's your little shadow?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her suitcase. The sight of him made her blood run cold. "Just some personal business," she replied through clenched teeth.

"Allow me to escort you," Julian offered with mock chivalry.

"That won't be necessary."

His smile turned predatory. "How curious. You told my parents you came here because of me, yet now you treat me like a stranger. What game are you playing, Evelyn?"

She remained silent, her jaw set.

Julian's eyes gleamed with malicious delight. "Still pretending? Or have you forgotten our history... ex-girlfriend?"

The words struck like a physical blow.

Evelyn recoiled as if scalded, her eyes widening in shock. She turned to face him fully, searching his expression for deception.

Julian's smirk deepened. He reached out, his voice dropping to an intimate whisper. "I mean every word, Evelyn. Give us another chance."

"Release me." She jerked her arm away, disgust twisting her features. "I don't have time for your delusions."

"Marry me." His tone shifted abruptly, the intensity in his gaze bordering on madness.

A shiver of primal fear raced down Evelyn's spine.

At first, she'd assumed this was another of Julian's twisted tests - a ploy to confirm whether her memories had returned. But the fanatical light in his eyes suggested something far more dangerous.

The very idea made her stomach churn. Even without blood relation, the moral violation was enough to make her skin crawl.

She regretted not waking Rosalind. With sudden violence, she wrenched her arm free. "Julian, enough!"

"I'm proposing," he insisted, his grip tightening.

"The answer is no." Her voice cut like steel. "I wouldn't touch you if you were the last man on earth."

Something dark flickered across Julian's face.

Before she could react, he produced a handkerchief from his pocket and clamped it over her mouth and nose.

Evelyn's scream was muffled by the fabric. A cloying, chemical scent filled her senses. Her vision swam, limbs growing heavy as lead.

The world tilted.

Then darkness.

Julian glanced furtively about before scooping Evelyn's limp form into his arms. Within moments, he had her secured in his vehicle and was speeding down the estate's private drive.

At precisely eight o'clock, Rosalind rose and completed her morning routine. She knocked lightly on Evelyn's door, ready to assist with final preparations for their journey to Blackwood Manor.

"Evelyn? Are you awake?" The persistent knocking yielded no response.

Concern creased Rosalind's brow as she pushed the door ajar. The room stood half-empty, personal effects conspicuously absent.

A wry smile touched her lips as she reached for her phone. "Couldn't wait even a few hours, could you?"

She shook her head, murmuring to herself, "Left without a word, didn't even let me help pack. Just how desperate are you to get back to General Blackwood?"
###Chapter 322

"Evelyn, your little game is becoming quite transparent."

Rosalind dialed Evelyn's number repeatedly, but each attempt went unanswered. On her third try, the line went dead without ringing.

A cold dread crept down Rosalind's spine as she sprinted downstairs. "When did Ms. Wright leave?" she demanded from the maid.

"Before dawn, around seven," came the reply.

Rosalind's fingers trembled as she paced the marble floors of Wright Manor. She quickly dialed Liam's private number.

The general answered on the second ring, his voice clipped. "Report."

"Sir, has Cassandra arrived at Blackwood Manor?" Rosalind's voice shook.

Liam's tone turned razor-sharp. "Why would she be coming here?"

"She left hours ago to see you!" Rosalind's nails dug into her palm. "The staff said she departed at seven, but it's past eight now. She should have reached Sudvi by—"

"Find her." Liam's command sliced through the line like tempered steel. "Now."

Rosalind raced to the security office, her boots echoing through the corridollars. "Call me if she appears at your estate," she gasped before hanging up.

The surveillance footage revealed everything. At precisely 7:03 AM, Evelyn had dragged her suitcase past the east gate. The cameras captured her turning the corner toward the service road—then nothing.

Rosalind froze the image. "Whose vehicle is that?" She pointed to the black sedan idling near where Evelyn vanished.

"Mr. Whitmore's car, ma'am," the guard confirmed.

Rosalind's blood turned to ice. Julian. Of course it would be Julian.

Her hands shook violently as she redialed Liam. He answered before the first ring completed. "Status."

"General Blackwood...she's gone." Rosalind's voice cracked. "I believe Julian took her."

The silence on the line was more terrifying than any outburst. When Liam finally spoke, each word carried lethal precision. "You will locate her. Or I will hold you personally responsible."

Rosalind nearly dropped the phone. "Yes, sir. I'll search Wright Manor for clues."

Meanwhile, consciousness returned to Evelyn in painful waves. The first thing she registered was the oppressive scent of antiseptic. Then the restraints—thick leather straps securing her wrists and ankles to a medical bed.

Her muffled screams died against the gag. Memory flooded back: the needle prick in the alley, Julian's smiling face swimming in her vision before darkness claimed her.

She forced herself to breathe. Panic wouldn't help now. Julian had planned this meticulously—just as he'd orchestrated her parents' disappearance.

The door creaked open. Evelyn turned her head slowly.

Julian stood framed in the doorway, immaculate in his tailored white coat. Gold-rimmed glasses glinted as he adjusted them with a surgeon's precision. "Awake at last, my dear niece. We have so much to discuss."
###Chapter 323

Julian stood with his hands buried deep in his pockets. His lips curved into a deceptively tender smile, but his eyes burned with something far more dangerous.

The air around him seemed to drop several degrees.

Evelyn remained perfectly still. Her gaze locked onto his with unsettling calmness.

He moved toward the bed with predatory grace, perching on its edge. One hand braced against the mattress as he leaned closer, invading her personal space. His other hand reached out to trace the delicate line of her jaw.

His fingertips trailed downward with agonizing slowness. They mapped the column of her throat, danced across her collarbone, and hovered dangerously close to forbidden territory.

Bile rose in Evelyn's throat. Her skin crawled with revulsion, every nerve ending screaming in protest.

Yet her expression remained an impenetrable mask. Only her eyes reflected cold indifference.

This reaction gave Julian pause. His hand froze just below her collarbone. "Aren't you afraid?" he demanded, eyes flashing with something wild.

The gag in Evelyn's mouth prevented any response.

Julian was exactly the type of monster who thrived on fear. Any reaction would only fuel his sick desires.

"Do you know why I've taken you?" he murmured, voice dripping with false sweetness.

"Taken?" The word sent ice through Evelyn's veins. She'd thought this was a simple abduction - not something more permanent.

When she still refused to react, Julian yanked the cloth from her mouth.

Evelyn exhaled sharply as the painful pressure vanished. But she remained silent - no tears, no pleas, no screams.

"You could scream now," Julian taunted, lips twisting in amusement.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Why am I here?" she asked instead, voice steady.

Julian's hand resumed its exploration, fingers skimming back up to cup her face. "I proposed to you," he countered softly. "Why did you refuse?"

"I have no memory of you," Evelyn lied smoothly. "How could I accept a stranger?"

Julian chuckled darkly. His fingers tangled in her hair, tightening painfully. "Have you really forgotten everything?" he purred, voice laced with menace.

"It's the truth," Evelyn insisted, fighting to keep her breathing even.

She'd seen glimpses of Julian's cruelty. The possibilities of what came next made her stomach churn. All she could do was maintain this fragile calm and buy time.

"Why move into Wright Manor?" Julian's voice turned razor-sharp. "Don't lie. I'm not as gullible as Victoria."

Evelyn considered her answer carefully. "I still have feelings for Liam," she admitted. "I went to Wright Manor to watch Victoria. I wanted to stop their wedding."

Julian's laughter sent shivers down her spine.

His fingers tapped against her cheekbone. "I don't believe you."

Evelyn held his gaze. "That's your choice. What do you want from me?"

Julian's smile turned feral. He braced both hands on the bed and leaned in to claim her lips.

Evelyn jerked her head away, eyes burning with unshed tears. "Don't touch me!" she spat.

Undeterred, Julian pressed his mouth to her cheek instead.

When she continued to resist, his patience snapped. He seized her face, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Listen carefully," he growled, voice thick with possession. "From this moment, you belong to me. Your body, your heart, your very soul - they're all mine now. Whether you like it or not."
###Chapter 324

In Blackwood Manor, Liam Blackwood sat in deep contemplation after reviewing the surveillance footage Rosalind Baskins had brought.

The footage provided no definitive proof that Julian Whitmore had abducted Evelyn Carter. Yet the circumstantial evidence was too compelling to dismiss.

Rosalind paced anxiously. "Mr. Blackwood, we must send search parties immediately. Every moment we delay puts Cassandra in greater danger!"

Liam's brow furrowed as he responded, "He claims to care for her. I doubt he'd harm her."

"That's ridiculous!" Rosalind snapped. "That madman orchestrated her parents' deaths and performed unauthorized surgery to erase her memories."

"If Cassandra remains in his clutches, who knows what he'll do? You must act now!"

Liam's fist clenched as he studied Rosalind with an inscrutable expression, masking his inner turmoil. "My men are already searching."

"But why was Cassandra coming to see me with luggage at dawn? What was her intention?"

Rosalind's pulse quickened as she revealed the truth. "I overheard Victoria Dawson's scheme last night. She's planning a forced marriage to trap you."

Liam's face darkened, his eyebrows knitting together in shock. The revelation caught him completely off guard.

Perched nervously on the sofa's edge, Rosalind fought the urge to join the search. Without leads, she'd be as effective as a headless chicken - wasting precious time and energy.

A bitter chuckle escaped Liam's lips. "So Victoria plotted a shotgun wedding, and Cassandra wanted to protect me?"

Rosalind nodded confirmation.

Lowering his head, Liam smiled wryly, touched despite the absurdity. "She could have simply told me. I have capable people at my disposal."

"Cassandra trusts no one but herself... and you." Rosalind hesitated before continuing, "She originally assigned me to protect you personally, but..."

"I refused, deeming it inappropriate. So she decided to protect you herself, but left without informing me. That's when she disappeared."

Leaning back in his chair, Liam regarded Rosalind with unfathomable intensity. "We're divorced. She's been distant."

"Why would she concern herself with my personal affairs? Why protect me at all?"

"She cares about you," Rosalind blurted.

Liam's piercing gaze searched Rosalind's face across the desk, seeking hidden truths.

After a weighted pause, he probed further. "Her name is Cassandra Wright, formerly Victoria Dawson. Why do you insist on calling her Cassandra?"

"Force of habit," Rosalind replied casually, then tensed as she noticed the odd glint in Liam's eyes - bright yet confused.

"Which Cassandra?" Liam pressed. "Her full name?"

Rosalind grew increasingly agitated. "Names don't matter now! Finding her does!"

"We'll have news soon," Liam reassured, deftly changing subjects. "Which university did she attend?"

"Solterra National Defense University," Rosalind answered.

"Her degrees?" Liam continued.

Rosalind snapped impatiently, "Dual Ph.D. in chemistry and engineering. Shouldn't you know this? Why ask me?"

Liam's confusion surfaced. "Chemistry... engineering... dual doctorate?"

Though he masked it well, his pupils dilated slightly and his hands clenched involuntarily. He knew Cassandra studied chemistry, but engineering? A dual Ph.D.? Her academic credentials far exceeded his expectations, raising disturbing questions he dared not pursue.

"Where does she work?" Liam pressed onward.
###Chapter 325

Rosalind answered curtly, "It's a research facility."

"What sort of research facility?" Liam demanded.

"Just a regular one. I'm her personal aide, not her research assistant."

With each passing moment, Liam's pulse quickened. His fingers tightened around the armrest as he pressed further, "Then where is her research assistant?"

Rosalind's expression darkened. "He's deceased."

"Her assistant was that renowned elderly professor, correct?"

Rosalind's eyes widened in shock. She scrutinized Liam intensely, her unspoken question hanging in the air. For several heartbeats, she stood frozen, offering no reply.

The truth became evident to Liam from Rosalind's reaction. Even without verbal confirmation, the pieces fell into place. Yet without concrete proof, his mind refused to accept the horrifying possibility.

A sharp rap at the office door shattered the tense silence.

"Enter," Liam commanded.

Ryan burst in, his breathing ragged. "General Blackwood, we've located her."

Liam shot to his feet. In one fluid motion, he retrieved a pistol from his desk drawer and stormed out.

Seeing the weapon, Rosalind hesitated only momentarily before rushing after him.

A convoy of armored vehicles screeched to a halt before an opulent private estate.

The security guard moved to intercept the imposing group, but paled when weapons were drawn. The gates swung open immediately.

Liam led the charge into the mansion's grand foyer, his sharp gaze sweeping the lavish surroundings. Rosalind trailed behind, positioning herself at the rear of the group.

"Who dares trespass here?" A maid appeared, her voice trembling with outrage.

Ryan's icy glare silenced her. "Summon Julian. Now."

Before the maid could respond, Julian materialized on the second-floor balcony, hands casually tucked in his pockets. He regarded Liam with calculated calmness from his elevated position.

Liam's head snapped up, their gazes locking in a silent battle of wills. The air crackled with tension.

"Liam," Julian feigned surprise, his lips curling into a mocking smile. "To what do I owe this... military invasion?"

Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "Where's Evelyn?"

Julian chuckled darkly. "While Evelyn is my former lover and currently resides at Wright Manor, our relationship isn't as intimate as you imagine." He spread his hands theatrically. "If you're seeking her, why come to me?"

Rosalind could no longer contain herself. She surged forward, finger jabbing accusingly. "Release Cassandra immediately, or you'll regret it!"

Julian descended the staircase with infuriating leisure. "I've no idea what you're implying," he said with exaggerated confusion.

"Don't play dumb! She vanished after leaving here this morning. Your vehicle was the only one that departed Wright Manor all day!" Rosalind's voice shook with fury.

"Allegations require proof," Julian countered smoothly. "Where's yours?"

Rosalind's fists clenched until her knuckles whitened. "Then let us search the premises. We'll find her."

Julian settled onto a plush sofa with deliberate casualness. "No warrant, no search." His smirk widened as he addressed Liam. "Unless you'd like to violate protocol, General?"

Rosalind trembled with the urge to strike him. If not for Julian's machinations years ago, Cassandra wouldn't have lost her memories. Her family wouldn't have disappeared.

"Cassandra! Cassandra!" Rosalind shouted desperately. "Can you hear me? Make any sound!"

Liam moved beside her, his voice a controlled whisper. "Enough. Remember his profession."

Understanding dawned on Rosalind, and she fell silent, though her eyes burned with unshed tears.
###Chapter 326

Julian was a skilled physician, which meant sedating someone came as second nature to him.

Adjusting his glasses with deliberate slowness, Julian remarked, "Liam, you've always been the epitome of composure. What possessed you to act so recklessly now?"

He continued smoothly, "Breaking into my residence with armed men? That's trespassing with criminal intent."

Alexander settled onto the sofa with practiced ease. His voice remained steady as he countered, "Feel free to add another charge while you're at it."

Julian's brow furrowed. "What are you implying?"

Ignoring the question, Alexander issued a single command with quiet authority. "Search."

His team scattered instantly, combing through every inch of the mansion. Rosalind rushed toward the bedrooms with particular urgency.

Julian shot to his feet, his complexion paling. "Liam, are you truly willing to violate protocol like this?" His voice held genuine disbelief.

"I am upholding the law," Alexander responded calmly.

"You'd better find something," Julian warned, his voice turning icy. "Otherwise, I'll pursue legal action until your career is in ruins."

Alexander's expression remained unreadable. He said nothing.

Settling back onto the sofa, Julian draped his arms over the backrest with false casualness. "I never imagined you'd risk your reputation for a woman. She must mean everything to you."

Silence stretched between them.

Julian chuckled darkly. "I used to admire your devotion to Victoria. How amusing that all that loyalty evaporated so quickly."

He leaned forward suddenly. "What I can't comprehend is why you divorced her if you love her so deeply."

Alexander's answer came measured and quiet. "True love means wanting someone's happiness above all else."

"It means respecting their choices, not imprisoning them with your desires."

Understanding dawned in Julian's eyes. "Ah... So she didn't love you. That's why she left."

A shadow crossed Alexander's features. He turned abruptly toward the staircase, avoiding Julian's mocking gaze.

The truth hung between them, and Julian erupted into cruel laughter.

One by one, Alexander's men returned empty-handed.

"General Blackwood, the second floor is clear."

"Sir, we've searched the grounds and found nothing."

Rosalind stormed back, her voice shaking with rage. "Julian! Where are you keeping Evelyn?"

Julian sighed theatrically. "You should be more concerned about explaining yourselves to a judge. Illegal search and seizure carries serious consequences."

Alexander rose without reaction. "We're leaving."

Rosalind's panic was immediate. "Sir! We can't abandon her! Evelyn's in danger—"

Alexander was already striding toward the exit, his team falling in behind him.

Rosalind stamped her foot in frustration, torn between Julian's smug expression and Alexander's retreating back. Helplessness washed over her.

"Staying for tea?" Julian taunted. "Or shall I call the authorities now?"

With a final glare, Rosalind hurried after the departing team.

Julian stepped onto the sunlit balcony, a victorious smirk playing on his lips.

Leaning against the railing, he watched the military convoy disappear down the driveway. "Pathetic," he murmured. "Can't even protect the woman you claim to love."

Once the last vehicle vanished from sight, Julian turned back inside, making straight for his study.

The moment the study door clicked shut, Alexander emerged from the balcony's shadowed corner. He vaulted over the railing with silent precision, his gaze locked on the study door as he advanced with lethal purpose.
###Chapter 327

Julian stepped into the dimly lit study, his fingers clicking the lock shut with deliberate precision. His eyes darted across the room like a predator scanning its territory before settling on the antique bookshelf.

With practiced ease, he swept aside a row of leather-bound volumes, revealing a concealed button nestled in the mahogany paneling. The moment his finger made contact, the entire bookshelf parted with a whisper of hidden mechanisms.

The secret chamber beyond glowed with sterile white lighting, its clinical brightness a stark contrast to the study's warm tones. The bookshelf slid back into place behind him, sealing him inside this private sanctuary.

Evelyn lay motionless on the medical bed, her limbs heavy with sedatives. Her eyelashes fluttered weakly against pale cheeks as she fought the chemical fog clouding her mind. Every attempt to focus sent waves of nausea through her system.

"Poor little songbird," Julian murmured as he approached, his fingers making quick work of the restraints at her wrists. "Did you enjoy our little performance earlier?"

Her lips parted soundlessly, the words dying before they could form. The drugs had reduced her to little more than a breathing doll, her consciousness trapped behind unresponsive flesh.

"Your precious Liam came searching for you," Julian continued, his voice dripping with mock sympathy. "But even with all his military resources, he'll never think to look here. How deliciously ironic - the great General Blackwood, brought to his knees by a woman."

He trailed a finger down her bare arm, pausing at the faint surgical scar. "Tell me, Evelyn darling, do you remember anything about this?" His touch turned clinical as he examined the nearly invisible mark. "About the little technological secret hidden beneath your skin?"

Tears welled in Evelyn's glassy eyes as she gave the slightest shake of her head. She knew about the standard monitoring chip - every Solterra researcher carried one. But something in Julian's tone suggested there had been more.

"Nothing at all?" Julian pressed, his fingers tightening slightly. "No memories of special projects? No late-night sessions in restricted labs?" When she remained silent, his lips curled into a satisfied smile. "Perfect."

His hands grew bolder, sliding the straps of her gown from her shoulders. The fabric pooled around her waist as he studied her with clinical detachment. "Has Liam touched you like this?" he asked, his voice thick with perverse curiosity.

Evelyn's breath hitched, her body trembling with the effort to recoil. The drugs kept her paralyzed, but her eyes screamed with raw terror.

"Shhh," Julian soothed, catching a tear with his thumb. "There's no need for that. Soon you'll come to appreciate my touch." He leaned closer, his breath hot against her cheek. "I can be very... persuasive."

His lips brushed her tear-streaked skin, trailing toward her mouth. Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, her entire being recoiling from the violation.

Then - impact.

The sudden crash of bodies sent Evelyn's eyes flying open. Liam stood over Julian, his fist connecting with the doctor's jaw in a satisfying crunch of bone meeting bone. The general's face was a mask of primal fury, his military precision replaced by raw, protective rage.

"You," Liam growled, hauling Julian up by his collar, "are going to regret every second you spent in this room."
###Chapter 328

At that moment, Evelyn's racing heart suddenly stilled. Relief and exhilaration flooded through her. The emotions were too intense to put into words.

Liam Blackwood's fist connected with Julian Whitmore's abdomen again. The doctor coughed up blood, collapsing to the floor.

Julian's terrified gaze locked onto Liam's face—twisted with fury, like a demon from hell.

Liam didn't stop. He seized Julian by the collar and delivered another brutal punch to his face. Blood splattered. Bruises bloomed. Julian lay there, barely conscious, his features swollen beyond recognition.

Once finished, Liam snatched Evelyn's discarded clothes and hurried to drape them over her trembling form.

Even though she still wore her undergarments, his chest ached at the sight of her humiliation.

A few seconds later, and Julian would have—

The thought made Liam's blood boil.

He wrapped Evelyn tightly in a blanket, then kicked Julian one last time before stepping over him.

"Don't... go..." Evelyn's whisper was barely audible.

Liam froze. "Cassandra?" He leaned closer. "What did you say?"

"Please... don't leave me..." Her head lolled weakly against his chest.

"I'm taking you home," he murmured.

Evelyn closed her eyes, gathering strength. Then, with effort, she spoke again. "Search... his house..."

Liam glanced at Julian's motionless body. Understanding dawned.

He carefully laid Evelyn back on the bed and began combing through the room. Drawers. Cabinets. Nothing.

Then he moved to the study.

More rifling. More frustration.

Until—

Four cruise tickets. Solterra to Aldenria. Purchased three years ago.

Liam scooped Evelyn into his arms and carried her out.

In the car, he held her close, ensuring the blanket stayed secure.

For the first time in hours, Evelyn felt safe. The tension drained from her body. Exhaustion won.

She slept.

When she woke, dusk painted the room in gold.

Blackwood Manor. Her own bed.

Rosalind Baskins hovered nearby, guilt etched across her face.

"Evelyn! Thank God you're awake."

Evelyn smiled weakly. "Don't blame yourself. I'm fine."

Rosalind hesitated. "If—"

"No 'ifs.'" Evelyn sat up, waving her off. "Where's Liam?"

"In his study. Dealing with Julian." Rosalind's jaw tightened. "That bastard kidnapped you. Tried to—"

Evelyn shook her head. "We can't charge him with kidnapping."

"Why not?"

"Aldenrian law. Illegal search and trespassing carry equal weight. If we press charges, Liam could face repercussions too."

Rosalind's eyes flashed. "So he gets away with it?"

"Hardly." Evelyn smirked. "Liam already beat him half to death."

"But what if Julian reports him?"

"Then he'd have to admit to kidnapping. A felony." Evelyn patted Rosalind's shoulder. "Liam might get a slap on the wrist, but Julian? He'll rot in prison."

She exhaled. "Trust me. He'll swallow this defeat quietly."

GET
###Chapter 329

A sudden realization dawned on Evelyn. She let out a soft chuckle. "So Julian can't possibly harm Mr. Blackwood."

"Exactly," Cassandra replied, peeling back the covers and swinging her legs off the bed.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Cassandra, where are you going?"

"I need to speak with Liam," Cassandra answered, smoothing her wrinkled clothes and moving to the vanity to fix her disheveled hair.

"Mr. Blackwood specifically told me to inform him when you woke up," Evelyn said quickly. "There's no need for you to go to his study. I'll call him here."

Cassandra shook her head. "I've been lying down too long. My muscles ache. I need to move around."

Without waiting for a response, Cassandra strode out of the bedroom.

Evelyn hurried after her.

They ascended to the second floor, Evelyn trailing closely behind as Cassandra made her way toward the study.

Cassandra suddenly turned, waving her hand dismissively. "You don't need to follow me. Go attend to your own duties."

Evelyn's expression turned serious. "You vanished three years ago, then disappeared again yesterday. I won't take any chances. From now on, I'm sticking to you like glue - 24/7 protection."

Cassandra frowned at the younger woman's intensity.

"Except for bathroom breaks," Evelyn amended solemnly. "But we're sharing a bedroom tonight."

A reluctant smile tugged at Cassandra's lips. Touched by the concern, she reached out to ruffle Evelyn's hair. "Alright. You can sleep in my room."

"But this is Blackwood Manor," Cassandra continued gently. "You really don't need to worry about me here."

Evelyn snorted, crossing her arms defiantly. "Blackwood Manor or not, I kidnapped you from here once without breaking a sweat."

Cassandra couldn't argue with that logic.

"I'm just going to see Liam," Cassandra reassured. "It may be out of your sight, but I'll still be under his watch. He won't let anything happen to me."

Evelyn pointed behind Cassandra.

Before Evelyn could speak, Cassandra added, "I need to thank him privately. I'll return shortly. Really, there's no need to follow."

"No thanks necessary," a warm voice interrupted from behind.

Cassandra's heart skipped a beat as she whirled around to face Liam. He wore casual gray athletic wear that somehow still managed to look elegant on his tall frame.

A thousand words crowded her throat, but now that he stood before her, she found herself tongue-tied.

She stood frozen, drowning in the depths of his striking eyes.

Evelyn took the hint and tactfully retreated downstairs, leaving them alone.

Cassandra's hands hung awkwardly at her sides. She glanced out the window at the darkening sky. "How long was I asleep?"

"From yesterday noon until this evening," Liam answered.

That explained the persistent growling in her stomach.

"Liam," Cassandra began hesitantly, her cheeks flushing before she could continue.

Liam waited patiently, his gaze intense yet gentle.

"Yes?" he prompted when she hesitated.

Cassandra lowered her head, gathering her thoughts before meeting his eyes again. Her gaze held determination, but the words wouldn't come.

Liam gave a rueful smile. Recognizing her struggle, he took the initiative. "Evelyn mentioned Victoria planned to harm me?"

Cassandra nodded vigorously.

"She... she wanted to drug you," Cassandra blurted out, her nerves making her voice tight. "Force you into marriage."

Liam chuckled darkly. "That's rather diabolical."

"Extremely," Cassandra agreed emphatically.

"Do you know who she planned to use?" Liam asked.

Cassandra shook her head. "I don't."

Liam's lips quirked in amusement. "Then I'm completely defenseless against her schemes."

After a thoughtful pause, Cassandra suggested, "Liam, if you trust me, let me stay with you—"

"Done," Liam interrupted before she could finish.

His sudden enthusiasm startled her. "I'd feel much safer with you protecting me," he declared.

Cassandra blinked, momentarily thrown by his immediate acceptance.
###Chapter 330

Evelyn stood frozen in place, her fingers twisting nervously at the hem of her blouse. The silence stretched between them like an endless chasm.

She recalled every cruel word she'd hurled at Liam weeks ago. The way she'd demanded he never contact her again, that he erase her from his life completely.

Yet here she was, shamelessly inserting herself back into his space. Even if it was for his protection, would he ever believe her? Would he think she'd lost her mind?

"Was there something else?" Liam's deep voice broke through her thoughts.

Evelyn shook her head too quickly, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "No, nothing at all."

Liam gestured toward his desk. "Then I should finish these reports."

"Of course." Her lips pressed into a thin line as heat crept up her neck. "I'll...I'll leave you to it. I won't disturb you further."

He gave a curt nod.

Evelyn turned to leave but hesitated at the doorway. "I'd like to stay in the guest room upstairs. With Rosalind."

Liam's gaze softened slightly. "That's fine."

The ghost of a smile touched her lips as she slipped out.

Once in the hallway, Evelyn pressed a hand to her racing heart. Her cheeks burned, and an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest.

When she'd first developed feelings for Liam, it had been simple nervousness. Butterflies.

Now? Knowing he'd loved her since childhood and still carried that torch? It was like standing too close to a bonfire. Every glance sent flames licking through her veins.

Just seeing him made her pulse erratic. Her entire body thrummed with electricity. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once.

To realize the man she loved beyond reason returned those feelings...it was overwhelming.

Yet their circumstances made it impossible. She could never confess. Never act on these emotions.

Better to remain silent. Better to let him move on.

Evelyn collapsed onto the living room sofa, picking up a random book. Her eyes kept darting toward the study door.

She pretended to read while keeping watch, though the words blurred before her eyes.

Hours slipped by unnoticed. Rosalind came twice, urging her to rest.

Evelyn refused both times, sending her assistant back to bed.

At precisely 1:17 AM, the study door finally creaked open.

Liam paused mid-step when he spotted her curled on the couch. He approached silently, kneeling before her sleeping form.

His chest tightened at the sight of her peaceful expression. "Cassandra," he whispered.

No response.

Liam reached out, fingers hovering just above her cheek. The moment his skin brushed hers, he froze.

His entire body tensed. Blood roared in his ears as he fought the urge to trace the curve of her jaw.

Even with his rank and reputation, he felt utterly powerless before her. The mask he wore for the world always crumbled in Evelyn's presence.

Swallowing hard, he withdrew his hand.

Instead, he carefully slid one arm beneath her knees, the other supporting her back.

The instant he lifted her, Evelyn's eyes flew open. She clung to him, disoriented.

For one heart-stopping moment, fear flashed across her face—a remnant of her kidnapping ordeal. Then recognition dawned, and she relaxed with a shaky exhale.

"I thought you were asleep," Liam rasped, throat suddenly dry. "I was taking you to your room."

"Oh." Evelyn self-consciously tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Finished with work? Are you...turning in?"

Liam straightened, hands slipping into his pockets. "Why were you sleeping out here?"

Evelyn sat up, smoothing her wrinkled clothes. "I was keeping watch."

"Watch?" His brow furrowed.

She offered an awkward half-smile. "In case someone tried delivering poisoned supper or something."

The corner of Liam's mouth twitched. "You were guarding me from...midnight snacks?"

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson. "It's a valid concern!"
###Chapter 331

Liam pressed his lips together tightly. The corners of his mouth twitched with suppressed amusement as he reached out to tousle Evelyn's hair. "I don't do late-night snacks," he murmured. "You should get some rest."

Evelyn stifled a yawn behind her hand, her voice thick with sleep. "You should go to bed too." She hesitated before adding, "If anything happens, call me immediately. I'll come running."

The notion struck Liam as unexpectedly endearing. Never in his life had he imagined needing protection from this delicate woman who barely reached his shoulders. "Understood," he replied simply.

"Put my number on speed dial," Evelyn insisted, suddenly wide awake again.

Without protest, Liam retrieved his phone and programmed her contact into the emergency shortcut. "Done," he said, displaying the screen. "Satisfied now? Time for bed."

Evelyn chewed her lip, clearly wrestling with another concern. "Don't accept food from anyone else," she blurted out. "From now on, let Rosalind handle all your meals. She's just as skilled as Oliver in the kitchen."

A warm sensation spread through Liam's chest at her earnestness. "Your wish is my command," he agreed, more touched than he cared to admit.

"Goodnight then, Liam," she said with a small wave before disappearing up the staircase.

Liam watched her retreating form with complex emotions swirling in his chest. The truth was, he'd never truly worried about Victoria's schemes or potential drugging attempts. He'd always been several steps ahead of her marriage ploys.

This entire charade served one purpose - to keep Evelyn close just a little longer, to steal more moments in her presence.

Dawn found Evelyn unusually alert, her internal clock reset by recent events. She invaded the kitchen before sunrise, determined to assist Rosalind with breakfast preparations.

No amount of gentle discouragement could sway her. The old Evelyn had never lifted a finger for domestic chores, famously declaring such tasks beneath her genius. But this new version stubbornly chopped vegetables with intense concentration.

Rosalind sighed, wiping flour-dusted hands on her apron. "Evelyn, darling, why don't you go sketch in the garden? Or work on your formulas? This really isn't necessary."

"I want to learn," Evelyn insisted with uncharacteristic determination.

"But why? You have staff for this sort of thing."

"Just... because," Evelyn muttered, focusing intently on slicing mushrooms.

Rosalind's lips curved knowingly. "Is this for Mr. Blackwood, by any chance?"

Evelyn's knife clattered against the cutting board. "Don't be ridiculous!" she snapped, cheeks flushing. "Why would I bother learning to cook for him?"

"Of course, my mistake," Rosalind conceded with poorly concealed amusement.

They worked in companionable silence until Liam descended for breakfast. He settled at the dining table, scrolling through security reports on his phone.

Evelyn emerged triumphantly from the kitchen, balancing a laden breakfast tray. "Morning, Liam!" she chirped, her apron dusted with flour.

Liam looked up, his stern expression softening at the sight. "Good morning, Cassandra," he replied, using her given name with deliberate gentleness.

"I made this for you," she announced proudly, setting the tray before him before taking the opposite seat. She propped her chin on folded hands, watching him with eager anticipation.

"All by yourself?" Liam arched an eyebrow.

Evelyn nodded vigorously.

Liam surveyed the plate - perfectly golden scrambled eggs, roasted cherry tomatoes glistening with herbs, and artfully arranged toast points. The presentation rivaled professional chefs, the aroma promising deliciousness.

Setting aside his phone, Liam sampled the tomatoes first. A slow smile spread across his face as the flavors exploded on his tongue.

"Well?" Evelyn leaned forward anxiously. "How is it?"

"Delicious," Liam confirmed between bites, his usual military precision giving way to genuine enjoyment.

Encouraged, Evelyn dashed back to fetch her own portion. Rosalind remained in the kitchen, steadfastly eating her own cooking and refusing to touch Evelyn's experimental dishes.

Evelyn huffed, determined to prove her culinary skills weren't completely hopeless.
###Chapter 332

Evelyn picked up her fork, only to find Liam had already finished his entire breakfast.

Liam dabbed his lips with a napkin. "The meal was exquisite," he murmured.

With such high praise, Evelyn grew genuinely curious about the taste.

She speared a roasted tomato and popped it into her mouth.

An overwhelming sweetness exploded across her tongue, making her wince. The tomato wasn't terrible, just excessively sugary.

She must have mistaken sugar for salt. And used far too much of it.

The buttered toast proved equally sweet, as did the scrambled eggs.

With each bite, her embarrassment grew. She kept her gaze firmly downward.

Liam's lips curved. "It's truly delightful. I enjoy it."

His words brought her some comfort. Slowly, she set down her utensils - the cloying taste was simply too much.

Changing subjects, she asked, "Liam, what's your schedule today?"

His expression darkened. "No official duties. Donovan's been discharged from hospital. I'm visiting him."

Evelyn's hands tensed against the table. "I haven't seen Donovan since he woke. How is he recovering?"

Liam's jaw tightened at her evident concern. "Would you like to accompany me?"

"Absolutely," Evelyn answered without hesitation. Protecting Liam meant staying close.

"After breakfast then," he said.

Evelyn touched her disheveled hair, glancing at her casual attire. She hastily removed the apron. "Wait for me, Liam. I need to change."

She dashed upstairs.

Liam leaned back, his stormy gaze fixed on the table. Evelyn's enthusiasm about seeing Donovan unsettled him.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn descended the stairs where Liam waited.

Her hair was now in a sleek bun, wearing a crisp white blouse and fitted jeans - the picture of effortless elegance.

"Ready," she announced, skipping down the steps. "Let's go, Liam."

Though displeased, Liam managed a tight smile.

On the final steps, Evelyn's foot caught. "Ah!" she cried, pitching forward.

Liam's arms shot out, catching her firmly.

She landed against his chest, his hands securing her waist. The thin fabric between them did little to mute the electricity of their contact.

Both froze. Their gazes locked, intensity crackling between them. Hearts pounded wildly despite their stillness.

Their faces hovered inches apart, sharing each other's breath.

"Ev-" Rosalind, preparing the car, entered and immediately pivoted on her heel upon seeing them.

Liam swallowed hard, carefully righting her. He averted his eyes, voice rough. "Watch your step."

"Thank you," Evelyn breathed, cheeks flaming as she stepped back. "Let's go," she mumbled, brushing past him with lowered head.

Liam adjusted his tie, composing himself before following.

Behind Blackwood Manor's main residence stood a summerhouse nestled within the pine arboretum.

The secluded structure was surrounded by whispering conifers and...
###Chapter 333

The summerhouse stood eerily silent as Liam Blackwood and Evelyn Carter approached. Not a single staff member was in sight.

Liam knocked firmly before pushing the door open with deliberate slowness.

Darkness swallowed the interior completely. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, broken only by their own breathing.

Evelyn and Rosalind Baskins, who had been admiring the gardens moments before, now shivered at the sudden temperature drop.

"Get out!" A gravelly voice roared from the shadows, raw with exhaustion and pain.

Evelyn jumped instinctively, her fingers tightening around Liam's forearm in reflex.

Liam glanced down at her hand before covering it gently with his own.

The faint light from the doorway revealed only the silhouette of a figure hunched in the corner.

"Donovan. It's Liam," he announced, stepping forward with Evelyn close behind.

Summoning courage, Evelyn called out, "Donovan, I've come to see you."

A deafening crash shattered the silence.

Rosalind clapped hands over her ears while Evelyn pressed closer to Liam. Drawing a shaky breath, she kept her gaze fixed on the darkness.

Liam gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before addressing his brother. "Donovan, I brought Cassandra to visit. We're not here to upset you. Please let us stay."

"I said LEAVE!" Donovan's voice cracked like thunder, the anguish in it reminiscent of a wounded animal facing its end.

Another violent crash followed - the sound of shattering glass and toppling furniture.

A vase exploded near Evelyn's feet, sending shards skittering across the floor.

Liam swiftly pulled her back from the doorway.

Rosalind stood frozen, eyes wide as she stared into the abyss of the room.

Was this really the same man she'd heard stories about?

"Donovan, calm down," Liam said softly. "We'll come back when you're ready."

He closed the door with finality.

Turning, Liam found Evelyn's eyes shimmering with unshed tears. The sight caught him off guard.

Her pulse raced as she whispered, "What's happened to Donovan?"

Liam guided them away from the summerhouse to a nearby gazebo.

Rosalind joined them, propping her chin on folded hands as she studied Liam's expression.

His face darkened with sorrow. "Physically, Donovan survived. But what remains is worse than death."

"He resents us for saving him. Hates that we denied him a warrior's end."

Evelyn's heart ached. "But life is precious. What could matter more than that?"

Liam's lips pressed into a thin line. "For him, living is the torture."

"Why?" Evelyn wiped at her cheeks.

"His corneas were destroyed - permanent blindness. Spinal nerve damage left him paralyzed." Liam's voice grew thick. "There are still shards near his heart too dangerous to remove. The pain never stops."

Evelyn covered her mouth. Rosalind paled visibly.

Liam's eyes reddened as he continued, voice breaking. "But it's not the physical wounds destroying him. It's his first love."

Evelyn's throat burned. She couldn't speak past the lump forming there.

Rosalind frowned. "After everything, he still pines for her?"

Liam's expression turned grim. "She's the one who betrayed him."

"No!" Rosalind gasped.

Evelyn stared at Liam in shock.

That ring Donovan clung to as he lay dying - hadn't it symbolized true love? How could it end in betrayal?
###Chapter 334

Evelyn's chest tightened as she turned back toward the entrance of Blackwood Manor, her voice laced with worry.

"Liam, Donovan is blind and paralyzed. With his volatile temper, who will look after him?"

Liam's piercing gaze held hers as he murmured, "He's drunk himself into oblivion. Once he passes out, the maid will clean his room and the doctor will administer IV nutrients and therapy."

Evelyn couldn't bear watching Donovan self-destruct like this. It felt like witnessing a slow-motion suicide. "I need to see him."

With resolve, Evelyn stood and strode toward the manor.

"Evelyn." Liam rose abruptly, debating whether to stop her, but ultimately restrained himself.

She only wanted to pull Donovan from his despair. He should be grateful for her compassion.

As Evelyn disappeared from view, an unfamiliar wave of desolation crashed over Liam, accompanied by turbulent emotions.

Her genuine care for Donovan was unmistakable.

Rosalind observed Liam's conflicted expression. "Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn has always been kind-hearted, so—"

"No explanation needed," Liam cut her off.

While he struggled with Evelyn's affection for another, he still hoped for Donovan's recovery.

Liam sat back down, pulled out his phone to handle business matters, and waited patiently for Evelyn's return.

Minutes ticked by.

They waited endlessly, but Evelyn never emerged.

Suddenly, Rosalind's phone chimed twice.

She glanced at the screen, then looked up startled. "Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn just texted asking me to prepare soup and bring it in."

Liam stood immediately. "I'll handle it."

Rosalind followed him.

Another half hour slipped away.

Outside the kitchen of Blackwood Manor, Liam handed the tray to Rosalind. "You should take this in. Donovan rarely opens up to anyone but Evelyn."

"Perhaps let her stay longer to comfort him."

"But what about you?" Rosalind asked.

"I'll manage. Donovan needs her more," Liam replied with a bitter smile.

"Alright." Rosalind took the tray and left.

Liam exhaled heavily, the weight in his chest growing. An indescribable ache spread through him.

Under the scorching sun, he departed Blackwood Manor alone.

Inside, Evelyn found Donovan collapsed on the floor.

She guided him to bed, tended to his injuries, then requested soup.

Taking advantage of his drunken state, she carefully spoon-fed him.

Two hours later, Evelyn emerged to find Liam gone.

Frantic, she searched around. "Where's Liam?"

Rosalind answered, "He left. Said Donovan needed you more and asked you to stay."

"Donovan does need care, but when he wakes, he won't recognize anyone. I can't reach him—staying changes nothing," Evelyn said anxiously, heading out. "But Liam could be in danger any moment."

Rosalind followed, reassuring her, "Evelyn, don't worry. Liam's highly capable with reliable staff. He'll be fine."

Evelyn hurried down the garden path toward the gates, breathless. "Some dangers can't be avoided."

"Evelyn, ultimately there are two types of drugging. One renders victims helpless and manipulable."

"The other enhances desires beyond control."
###Chapter 335

The tension in the room was palpable.

Evelyn Carter stood frozen, her fingers trembling around the cold metal of the gun. Liam Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto hers, unreadable as always.

"You don't have to do this," he said, voice low and steady.

But she did.

The weight of her past pressed down on her—the lies, the betrayals, the faces of those she'd lost.

Victoria Dawson smirked from the corner, her arms crossed. "Oh, but she does, Liam. She's always been a liability."

Evelyn's grip tightened.

A sudden crash shattered the silence. The door burst open, and Ryan Sullivan stormed in, blood streaked across his face. "We have to go. Now."

Liam didn't hesitate. He grabbed Evelyn's wrist, pulling her toward the exit.

But it was too late.

The sound of boots echoed down the hall.

They were surrounded.

Evelyn met Liam's eyes one last time.

Then everything went black.

"What are you implying?" Evelyn didn't slow her pace.

Rosalind kept up with her, breathing slightly harder. "Drugging a man would definitely involve the second type."

Evelyn turned to her, confusion flickering across her face.

Rosalind pressed on. "Evelyn, your worry for Mr. Blackwood has clouded your judgment. Think logically. He knows Victoria has ulterior motives. He won’t let his guard down."

Silence stretched between them, so Rosalind elaborated.

"First, Mr. Blackwood’s assistants would never betray him. The consequences would be catastrophic for them."

She took a breath. "Second, to drug a man, he’d need to be disoriented and aroused. If Mr. Blackwood carries a sedative, even an aphrodisiac wouldn’t work."

"Lastly," she finished, "I doubt Victoria is a real threat. You’re overreacting."

Evelyn finally stopped, stepping out of Blackwood Manor with Rosalind close behind. "Rosalind, do you think Liam would find it ridiculous—even ironic—that I came here to protect him?"

"Why would you think that?"

Evelyn stood by the curb, a bitter smile twisting her lips as she hailed a cab. "I told him we couldn’t even be friends. That I never wanted to see him again. And now, here I am, contradicting myself."

"Evelyn, you had your reasons," Rosalind said gently. "And it doesn’t seem like Mr. Blackwood holds it against you."

The bitterness lingered. A cab pulled up, but Evelyn hesitated before getting in.

"Rosalind, you’re right. Liam doesn’t need my protection. He’s more than capable of handling himself." She exhaled sharply. "Should I even go back to Blackwood Manor?"

"I think you should stay there for now," Rosalind said, opening the door. "Get in. We can talk more inside."

Evelyn relented, sliding into the cab with Rosalind following.

As they settled in, Rosalind spoke calmly. "Julian was only crippled by Mr. Blackwood—not killed."

Her voice lowered. "If you go back to Wright Manor now, he won’t show mercy. And Mr. Blackwood won’t allow it either."

Evelyn fell silent, lost in thought.

Forty minutes later, the cab stopped at the gates of Royal Heights. Evelyn and Rosalind stepped out, heading toward Blackwood Manor.

As they walked, Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed.

She had been preoccupied with Donovan at Blackwood Manor, and it was already past lunch. She had no idea where Liam was.

The call connected after a few rings.

"Liam, where are you?" she asked.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Home."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What’s wrong?"

"Nothing."

Her unease deepened. Liam’s voice was usually strong, commanding. Even when tired, it never sounded this weak.

Panic surged through her. She broke into a run.

Rosalind hurried after her, bewildered.

Five minutes later, Evelyn reached Blackwood Manor.

Just as she was about to enter, she spotted Oliver Whitmore, the chef, rushing out, his face pale.

Evelyn blocked his path. "Oliver, didn’t I tell you to take the day off? Why are you here?"

His smile faltered. He glanced nervously behind him before answering. "Ms. Carter, I left my recipe book in the kitchen. I came back for it—and to prepare lunch for Mr. Blackwood."

"Has he eaten?"

"He has." Oliver shifted uncomfortably. "I didn’t know you and Rosalind were back, so I didn’t make extra. My apologies. Let me treat you both to make up for it. I appreciate you looking out for me."
###Chapter 336

"Invite us out for dinner?" Rosalind Baskins gasped, her eyebrows shooting up in surprise.

Evelyn Carter's face darkened at the unexpected proposal, her pulse quickening with concern. She brushed past Oliver Whitmore without hesitation, rushing into Blackwood Manor as the chef tried desperately to follow.

Rosalind caught Oliver's wrist, her lips curling into a knowing smirk. "Oliver, what's gotten into you today? You're shaking like a leaf."

Oliver jerked his arm free. "It's nothing. I should leave."

Rosalind stepped into his path, blocking the exit. "Not so fast. Let's wait here a moment."

Oliver's eyes darted nervously toward the house again, his fingers twitching at his sides.

Rosalind didn't miss a single tell. With years of combat training, her instincts screamed that something was terribly wrong.

Without warning, she executed a perfect takedown, pinning him to the gravel driveway.

Evelyn burst into the grand foyer just as Victoria Dawson's persistent knocking echoed through the marble halls.

"Liam, darling, open up! It's Victoria! Liam—" The blonde's saccharine voice carried as she continued rapping on the study door. "Please, we need to talk!"

Evelyn's gaze snapped to the antique grandfather clock. 2:07 PM. Lunch hour had long passed.

Taking the stairs two at a time, Evelyn found Victoria draped in a scandalously sheer lace dress, her barely-there lingerie leaving nothing to the imagination.

"What the hell are you doing?" Evelyn demanded, her voice trembling with barely contained rage.

Victoria froze mid-knock before turning slowly, her expression shifting from surprise to cold calculation.

Adjusting her plunging neckline with deliberate slowness, Victoria countered, "What are you doing here? Weren't you—"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to slits. "Weren't I what?"

Victoria's mouth snapped shut.

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Oh, did you think I'd be rotting in Julian Whitmore's basement by now?"

Victoria forced a smile and retrieved her designer clutch from the floor. With practiced nonchalance, she pulled out her phone and dialed.

When the call went unanswered, she frowned. "Where could Julian be?"

Evelyn remained stone-faced. "Probably bleeding out in his penthouse. But you—why are you dressed like a high-end escort at Blackwood Manor?"

Victoria shrugged. "This was always meant to be our marital home. Liam designed every detail for me. Even the security code is my birthday."

The word "marital" twisted like a knife in Evelyn's chest.

Liam had indeed decorated this estate to Victoria's tastes—the very reason Evelyn had fallen in love with it.

Evelyn advanced on her rival.

At that moment, Ryan Sullivan arrived with two armed guards. Reaching the second-floor landing, they found Evelyn already confronting the intruder.

"Ms. Carter! You're back?"

Evelyn gave a curt nod. "Obviously."

After brief greetings, Ryan fixed Victoria with a withering glare. "Ms. Dawson, explain your presence."

Victoria adjusted her dress with false modesty. "I'm here to see Liam."

Ryan's voice turned glacial. "Mr. Blackwood expelled you from this property. Have you no shame?"

Victoria's jaw clenched. "I need to speak with him."

"Mr. Blackwood has made his position clear. We'll escort you out. Now." Ryan signaled his men.

Frustration boiling over, Victoria turned back to the study door and resumed pounding. "Liam! It's me! We grew up together—have you forgotten all our memories? How can you treat me this way?"

Ryan nodded to his subordinates, who seized Victoria's arms, dragging her toward the grand staircase.

Victoria thrashed violently. "Unhand me! Do you know who I am?"

Ryan followed them downstairs to deal with the disturbance.

In that moment, icy dread flooded Evelyn's veins.

She'd never imagined Victoria would dare bribe household staff to infiltrate Blackwood Manor.
###Chapter 337

It was absolutely inconceivable that Liam could have been drugged during a simple family dinner at Blackwood Manor.

Evelyn's concern grew as Liam remained locked in his bedroom for hours. The usually composed military general was behaving completely out of character.

She knocked gently on the oak door. "Liam? It's Cassandra. Victoria has been taken away by Ryan and his team. Could you please open the door?"

His voice came through muffled but firm. "I'm fine. Don't worry about me."

The unnatural strain in his tone made her uneasy. "Please let me in. If you're not feeling well, I can drive you to the hospital."

"I said I'm fine."

"Then just unlock the door so I can see for myself."

"That won't be necessary."

Evelyn softened her voice, pressing her palm against the cool wood. "Liam...please."

His response came sharp and unexpected. "Cassandra, are you really this naive?"

The words stung. In all their time together, Liam had never spoken to her so harshly, let alone called her naive.

"Why are you snapping at me?" Her fingers curled into fists. "I'm just worried about you. I care about you. How can you accuse me of being naive?"

The more she thought about it, the more her frustration mounted. "If you're perfectly fine and capable of handling Victoria's schemes alone, then clearly you don't need me here. I'll take my leave!"

As she turned to go, the door suddenly swung open.

Before she could react, strong hands pulled her inside.

The door clicked shut behind her.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn found herself pressed against the wall, Liam's imposing frame caging her in.

Her breath hitched as she took in his appearance.

His bare torso glistened with droplets of water, the defined muscles of his abdomen contracting with each breath. The subtle scent of sandalwood soap clung to his damp skin.

His usually neat hair was tousled, damp strands falling across his forehead. A faint flush colored his chiseled features, spreading down his neck and across his chest.

But it was his eyes that held her captive - dark, intense, burning with an emotion that made her knees weak.

Evelyn swallowed hard, her lips pressing together as her pulse raced. Heat crept up her neck, matching the blush on Liam's skin.

In a rough whisper that sent shivers down her spine, he murmured, "See? I'm perfectly fine."

She could only nod mutely.

"Where were you going?" His voice was deeper than usual.

"You seem...capable enough," she managed. "And Oliver Whitmore, the chef who took the bribe, has been apprehended."

"If you can handle difficult situations alone, then my presence here is unnecessary."

"Victoria might try to bribe Ryan next," Liam countered, his breath warm against her temple. "I'll need your...protection."

Evelyn studied his strained expression. "You were drugged, weren't you?"

A curt nod. "Yes."

She frowned. "Are you in pain? Why did you take your shirt off?"

His smoldering gaze never wavered. "It's hot. I took a cold shower."

Fingers twisting in the fabric of her blouse, Evelyn looked away. "Why did you call me naive earlier?"

A bitter smile touched his lips. "I clearly said I was fine and asked you to keep your distance. Yet you insisted on seeing me. Isn't that naive?"

"I was just concerned about—"

"You bring trouble wherever you go," he interrupted, his voice rough.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Are you...angry with me?"

Liam closed the remaining distance between them slowly, until his warm breath fanned across her lips. Every nerve in her body came alive, yet she remained frozen against the wall, afraid to move.

His deep voice dropped to a seductive murmur. "Angry? Did you insist on seeing me because you wanted to...comfort me?"
###Chapter 338

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson as she quickly looked away, unable to meet Liam's intense gaze. Her breathing became shallow and rapid. "I-I'll take you to the hospital," she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper.

Liam's voice was low and husky when he spoke. "Are you trying to give the paparazzi more material to work with?"

She shook her head vehemently. "That's not what I meant at all."

His dark eyes burned into her as he took in her flushed face, his throat working as he ran his tongue over suddenly dry lips. The delicate floral scent of her perfume wrapped around him, making his pulse race with barely restrained desire. The cold shower he'd taken earlier seemed completely ineffective now.

His hands clenched into tight fists before he forced himself to step back. "You should go," he commanded roughly.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What?"

"Stay at Blackwood Manor. Don't go anywhere else," Liam ordered, his voice strained.

"But what about your condition? Are you really okay?" Her concern was evident in the way her brow furrowed.

Liam found himself distracted by the way her rosy lips moved as she spoke, each syllable drawing him in like a siren's call - intoxicating yet dangerous. He knew exactly how sweet those lips tasted.

"I'm not going to die," he rasped.

Remembering Victoria's reaction earlier, Evelyn asked, "Liam, Victoria seemed completely unaware of what happened to Julian. Can you tell me?"

His expression darkened immediately. "Do you care about him?"

"Not like that," Evelyn rushed to explain. "I'm worried he might be dead, I can't find my parents, and..." She hesitated before adding quietly, "I'm also concerned you could face legal consequences if something happened to him."

Liam took a deep breath, exerting every ounce of his self-control. "He's alive. You need to leave now."

"Where is he?"

"In the hospital."

"Did you save him?"

Liam was rapidly losing his patience. His voice dropped to a dangerous growl. "Cassandra, are you leaving or not?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn's mind was consumed with questions about Julian's fate after her rescue. She completely missed the signs of Liam's deteriorating condition, both mentally and physically affected by the drugs still in his system.

Persistent as ever, she continued, "If Julian's alive, can I press kidnapping charges against him?"

Without warning, Liam grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward the massive four-poster bed.

"Liam! What are you doing?" Her voice trembled with sudden panic.

He guided her to the edge of the bed, his strong arm trapping her as one knee pressed between her thighs, effectively pinning her to the mattress.

Evelyn's face burned as her body trembled with nervous anticipation. "L-Liam, what are you p-planning to do?" she stuttered.

"Do you have any idea how much pain I'm in right now?" he whispered harshly.

She nodded, her wide eyes glistening with unshed tears.

"Do you know how many times I've told you to leave?"

This time she shook her head.

"Are you staying because you want to take advantage of this situation?"

Evelyn looked genuinely confused by his third question. "Advantage? What advantage?"

Liam couldn't help the helpless smile that tugged at his lips. She'd been lingering in his room asking irrelevant questions. Didn't she realize she was playing with fire with Victoria gone?

Without another word, he captured her lips in a searing kiss.

Evelyn froze in shock, her entire body tensing. Her wide eyes took in his handsome features so close they blurred together, leaving her completely disoriented.

The kiss was all-consuming, his warm breath fanning across her face like a man dying of thirst finally reaching an oasis. It left her dizzy and weak, as if all the oxygen had been sucked from the room.

When realization hit, she tried to push him away but found herself powerless against his strength. He kissed her until her limbs turned to jelly and her thoughts scattered.

Liam's muscular frame pressed against hers, seeking comfort and release. Her heart pounded uncontrollably as heat spread through her body.

A soft moan escaped her lips as her hands came to rest against his solid chest.

He teased and tasted her lips with skillful precision, his hands roaming her curves with possessive intent. Unfamiliar sensations coursed through her, leaving her body tingling and her mind clouded with desire.

When she felt his body's response, a mix of apprehension and anticipation flooded her senses. Tentatively, she wrapped her arms around his neck, closing her eyes as she surrendered to the pleasure he offered.

Liam kissed her deeply yet with surprising gentleness, the last shreds of his control preventing him from giving in completely to his baser instincts. His lips trailed from the corner of her mouth to her ear, inhaling the sweet scent of her hair as his breathing hitched.

Closing his eyes, he whispered against her skin, "Cassandra, will you marry me?"
###Chapter 339

The aftermath of passion left Evelyn breathless, her arms slipping from Liam's neck as she stared blankly at the ceiling, emotions churning like a storm within her.

Liam traced his fingers through her hair, pressing a lingering kiss to the shell of her ear. His voice was rough with emotion, barely above a whisper. "Cassandra, I'll give you everything. A future brighter than the stars. My heart, my soul—all of it. Marry me."

The words struck like a blade. Evelyn's chest tightened, tears burning behind her eyelids. She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms as she fought to keep herself together.

If she were still lost in amnesia, still believing herself to be Cassandra, she would have melted into his arms, nodding through joyful tears.

But she wasn't Cassandra.

She was Evelyn Carter—a woman who couldn't afford to be bound to the leader of Aldenria's military.

"I'm sorry, Liam." Her voice cracked, tears blurring her vision. "I can't accept."

Liam's breath hitched. He buried his face against her neck, his next words laced with raw pain. "Is it because you don't love me... or because you can't?"

Her heart shattered.

If she admitted she loved him but refused anyway, he wouldn't let it go. He'd dig deeper, unraveling the truth she couldn't afford to reveal.

Tears spilled freely as she forced her voice steady. "I don't love you. And we can't be together."

Liam went rigid, agony ripping through him. A bitter smile twisted his lips, his eyes reddening with unshed tears.

The pain in his chest eclipsed everything else—worse than any wound, any battle scar. Slowly, he pulled away.

Evelyn reached for him, fingers brushing his jaw as she met his devastated gaze. The sorrow there nearly broke her.

Her voice trembled. "Liam... I'm willing."

Bracing a hand on the bed, Liam gently caught her wrist with the other, studying her from above. "Willing to do what?"

"To sleep with you." The admission came without shame. But seeing the fresh wave of hurt in his eyes, her own heart ached in response.

Liam exhaled sharply, his smile strained as he brushed a thumb over her cheek. "Don't be ridiculous," he murmured before pushing off the bed and striding toward the bathroom.

The moment the door clicked shut, the warmth of his presence vanished, leaving only a hollow ache in her chest.

She lay there, silent tears slipping down her temples, dampening her hair.

He had wanted to propose before taking things further.

Even now, rejected, he refused to claim her body when he couldn't have her heart.

The thought carved deeper into her soul, stealing her breath. Wiping her face, she sat up, the weight of her decision crushing. She couldn't bear to see him in pain any longer.

Looking back, she regretted not realizing Liam's feelings for her years ago. When she left Aldenria, she had severed all ties, never considering the scars she left behind.

She wouldn't make that mistake again.

She wouldn't give him false hope, only to disappear once more.

The next time she left, it might be for years.

Or forever.

Stepping out of Liam's room, Evelyn felt the weight of sorrow settle over her like a shroud.

She had no idea of the torment Liam endured that night—whether physical or emotional, it consumed him.

Yet the next morning, he was composed.

Despite her rejection, Liam treated her with the same quiet gentleness, holding no resentment.

He didn't pursue her with jewels or grand gestures, with lavish gifts or empty promises.

Instead, he loved her in silence—through respect, through freedom. Willing to give her anything, demand nothing.

His love was boundless, yet restrained.

And though Evelyn felt everything, her identity shackled her. She couldn't ask him to wait another five years.

If something kept her from returning, the guilt would haunt her forever.

Days passed.

While Evelyn remained wary of Victoria's next move, Rosalind delivered devastating news.

"Evelyn... Victoria is getting married."
###Chapter 340

Evelyn remained composed, her eyes never leaving the pages of her novel. "She won't succeed in this marriage."

Rosalind leaned closer, her voice urgent. "She's not marrying Mr. Blackwood. Realizing she can't win his affection, she's using her wealth to manipulate connections in Solterra to obtain your identification documents. She plans to marry under your identity."

Evelyn's book slipped from her fingers as she stared at Rosalind in disbelief.

Rosalind's expression darkened as she sat beside Evelyn. "Your grandmother is already preparing the wedding arrangements. Do you know who the groom is?"

"I don't care who he is. How could Grandfather allow this?" Evelyn's voice trembled with suppressed anger.

Rosalind sighed heavily. "Your grandfather objected, of course. But he couldn't sway Victoria's determination, nor your grandmother's unreasonable support."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "Victoria will stop at nothing to claim the Wright family fortune."

"What should we do?" Rosalind grasped her hand tightly. "Evelyn, if she marries into Aldenria's elite using your identity, the consequences will be disastrous."

"An elite?" Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously.

Rosalind nodded. "The groom's father is the city mayor."

A cold wave of realization washed over Evelyn as she understood the severity of the situation.

If this marriage proceeded, she'd face another round of political scrutiny upon returning to Solterra.

Then there would be the complications of dealing with a fraudulent marriage in Aldenria.

Endless problems would follow like shadows.

"But the troubles aren't what worry me most," Evelyn murmured thoughtfully. "What truly terrifies me is Victoria gaining inheritance rights in Aldenria."

"Once she controls my grandparents' will, she might harm them without hesitation."

Rosalind's anxiety spiked. "Then why are we waiting? Tomorrow they're holding the engagement banquet at the Royal Heights Hotel."

"And the day after, they plan to officially register the marriage. The wedding ceremony will likely happen within a month."

Evelyn hesitated. "But what about my parents if I reveal my true identity?"

Rosalind reasoned firmly, "Evelyn, your parents may already be gone. Even without finding their bodies, you can't keep enduring this humiliation. Letting Victoria exploit your identity endangers your grandparents!"

Evelyn's face darkened as conflicting emotions warred within her.

"Should I consult Liam about this?" she proposed.

Rosalind exhaled in frustration. "Evelyn, can't you see? Mr. Blackwood has wanted Victoria and Julian gone for years. He's only tolerated them because of you."

Determination flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "Very well. Tomorrow at the Royal Heights Hotel, we'll stage a spectacular scene and expose Victoria's true nature!"

Rosalind's face lit up with excitement. "Evelyn, what's your plan?"

"Since Vincent and Dominic are still imprisoned, we'll need to bring her biological mother Dorothy, along with Rosalind Fairchild."

"Understood," Rosalind agreed, reaching for her phone. After a moment's thought, she asked, "Should we prepare a DNA report?"

Evelyn shook her head confidently. "Unnecessary. Leave the rest to me. There won't be any mistakes."

"Very well," Rosalind replied, trusting Evelyn completely. When Evelyn was certain about something, it always worked out perfectly.

The next day, headlines buzzed with news of the engagement between Aldenria's most prominent family's granddaughter and the mayor's son.

The crème de la crème of Aldenria's business and political circles gathered for the lavish engagement banquet.

Having anticipated Victoria's schemes, Liam remained calm when receiving the invitation.

He instructed Ryan to position an armed elite squad outside the venue.

If Cassandra chose not to intervene, he would silently follow her lead.

But if she decided to disrupt the banquet, he would provide full support.

At the Royal Heights Hotel, the grand ballroom glittered with exquisite floral arrangements and crystal chandeliers, creating a magical atmosphere.

The expansive space featured a raised platform for the couple, surrounded by gourmet delicacies and fine wines. The constant clinking of glasses added to the celebratory mood.

Evelyn hadn't received a formal invitation. Instead, Archibald discreetly provided her access.

She arrived in an elegant white gown, her long hair cascading like a waterfall. Her understated beauty resembled a pristine magnolia—fragrant yet unpretentious.

Rosalind wore a practical pantsuit, ready to protect Evelyn if needed.

The two women stood in a corner, holding wine glasses, listening to the string quartet's melodies.

They observed the glittering crowd, patiently waiting for Victoria and her fiancé's grand entrance.
###Chapter 341

A voice dripping with sarcasm cut through the air. "Well, this is an unexpected surprise."

Evelyn turned to see Beatrice Thornton, Liam's aunt, standing there in her usual designer ensemble. She offered a polite nod. "Good evening, Beatrice."

The older woman's lips curled in disdain. "You're no longer married to my nephew. I insist you address me properly as Ms. Thornton."

Evelyn remained unfazed. "My apologies, Ms. Thornton."

"All the guests here tonight are distinguished individuals." Beatrice's eyes raked over Evelyn's simple dress. "What exactly are you doing here? Who could have possibly invited you?"

Evelyn chose not to respond. Beside her, Rosalind bristled, ready to fire back, but Evelyn subtly squeezed her wrist in warning.

The Blackwood family approached, their expressions varying from surprise to displeasure. Despite the divorce, Evelyn greeted each of them courteously.

Richard and Eleanor returned her greeting warmly, while Maxwell and Penelope remained stone-faced. Sebastian and Isabella wore identical expressions of disgust, as if Evelyn's mere presence tainted the prestigious event.

"How utterly shameless," Isabella sneered. "First stealing someone's first love, now stalking another woman's fiancé?"

Rosalind couldn't contain herself. "Who exactly are you calling shameless? If you've got something to say, say it plainly."

Isabella arched a perfectly groomed brow. "I'm talking about Evelyn Carter. Isn't it obvious? What kind of woman crashes her ex-husband's cousin's engagement party?"

"You—" Rosalind's hands clenched into fists.

Evelyn stepped between them, offering Isabella a thin smile. "If my presence offends you, Isabella, you're welcome to leave. There's no need to embarrass yourself with such petty behavior."

Isabella's face darkened, but before she could retort, Richard intervened sharply. "This is the Winslows' and Dawsons' celebration. Don't make a scene."

Beatrice immediately defended her niece. "Richard, Evelyn is no longer part of our family. Remember where your loyalties should lie."

Evelyn had no interest in continuing this pointless argument. With a final nod to Richard and Eleanor, she guided Rosalind away.

As they moved through the crowd, Rosalind muttered, "Why does General Blackwood have such insufferable relatives? And why couldn't I put that woman in her place?"

"Remember our purpose here tonight," Evelyn reminded her quietly.

"I haven't forgotten," Rosalind grumbled.

Suddenly, Evelyn collided with a solid chest. She stumbled back, murmuring apologies. "I'm so sorry."

The man before her had unremarkable features but strikingly intense eyes. "No harm done," he said with an easy smile. "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine, thank you." Evelyn made to leave, but the man caught her wrist. Her pulse jumped as she tried to pull away without success.

Rosalind reacted instantly, shoving the man back and positioning herself protectively in front of Evelyn. "What do you think you're doing?"

The man barely glanced at Rosalind before focusing on Evelyn. "Nathaniel Winslow," he introduced himself smoothly. "I'd very much like to know you better. Your name? Perhaps your number?"

Recognition dawned - this was Victoria Dawson's fiancé, the co-host of tonight's event, whose photo adorned the entrance hall.

Rosalind answered before Evelyn could. "She's not interested. Especially not in another woman's future husband."
###Chapter 342

Donovan Blackwood stood with his hands casually tucked in his tailored suit pockets, his expression unreadable. He gave an admiring glance toward Evelyn before shrugging nonchalantly.

Evelyn didn't spare him another word. She turned sharply, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor as Rosalind Baskins followed closely behind. They found Rosalind Fairchild waiting near the grand staircase.

This was Rosalind Fairchild's first high-society gala, and her nervous energy was palpable. She clutched her champagne flute too tightly, her eyes darting around the opulent ballroom filled with strangers. When Evelyn approached, relief washed over her face.

"Rosalind." Evelyn's voice was warm yet controlled.

Rosalind immediately grasped Evelyn's hands. "I've been waiting all night to see you." The dampness of her palms betrayed her anxiety.

Evelyn gave her a reassuring smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Relax. Everything's going according to plan."

"I lost track of Dorothy. She was right here a moment ago," Rosalind said, scanning the crowd.

"After tonight," Evelyn murmured, leaning closer, "Dorothy Simmons is no longer my mother. And I'm no longer Evelyn Carter."

Rosalind's brows knitted together. "Then who are you?"

"Cassandra Wright," Evelyn whispered the name like a sacred vow.

Rosalind's face lit up. "What a perfect name. Cassandra... it suits you."

"Liam chose it," Evelyn admitted with an uncharacteristic giggle.

Before Rosalind could process this revelation, the orchestra's tempo shifted dramatically. The chandeliers dimmed as spotlights illuminated the central stage.

All conversation ceased as every guest turned toward the dramatic reveal. Victoria Dawson emerged in a blood-red couture gown, her arm linked with Donovan's. Her smile was blindingly bright.

Donovan delivered a predictably dull speech thanking family, friends, and his "beloved" fiancée. The crowd applauded politely while Evelyn's sharp eyes cataloged every important attendee - media moguls, legal experts, government officials, and most importantly, Defense General Liam Blackwood.

Rosalind Baskins pressed close to Evelyn's ear. "When do we make our move?"

"Are my grandparents in position?" Evelyn asked without turning.

Rosalind gestured discreetly toward the stage's left wing. "Seated in the front row. They're scheduled to speak next."

Evelyn's lips curved into a predatory smile. "No more waiting. Begin."

Rosalind's fingers closed around the remote in her clutch. With deliberate slowness, she pressed the button.

The romantic montage on the massive LED screens dissolved into stark black text: "SHE'S NOT VICTORIA DAWSON. SHE'S A FRAUD."

Gasps rippled through the ballroom like wildfire. Donovan and Victoria whirled around, their expressions frozen in shock.

Victoria's porcelain complexion drained of color. "Who did this?" she shrieked, her voice cracking. "Turn it off immediately!"

"Me." Rosalind Baskins stepped forward, her voice cutting through the murmurs like a blade.

Every head turned as she strode confidently toward the stage. Without breaking stride, she vaulted onto the platform with athletic grace, hands clasped behind her back like a general inspecting troops.

Donovan's face darkened with recognition. Victoria recoiled as if struck, the resemblance to Evelyn triggering her buried guilt. "Security!" she screamed. "Remove this woman! She's crashing our event!"

Five uniformed guards rushed the stage. Rosalind dispatched them with brutal efficiency - a spinning kick here, a precise elbow strike there. Within seconds, they lay groaning on the polished floor.

Victoria's composure shattered completely. "You incompetent fools!" she spat at the guards before turning desperately to Donovan. "Your father's the mayor! Call the police! Arrest her!"
###Chapter 343

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel with a piercing gaze. "Mr. Winslow, don't you want to know if your fiancée is an imposter?"

Reginald Winslow, Nathaniel's father, stepped forward with thunderous authority. "Unless you can prove these outrageous claims, young lady, you'll be spending the next decade behind bars!"

Victoria clutched Nathaniel's arm, her voice trembling. "Make her leave! She'll destroy everything we've built."

Nathaniel patted her hand reassuringly. "Truth has nothing to fear from scrutiny. If she's lying, I'll handle it personally. Let's hear what she has to say."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. His response confirmed her suspicions - he had no idea the woman beside him was both a fraud and an Obsidian Circle operative. Her finger hovered over the remote's next button.

The screen flickered to life, displaying a family portrait of the Hoffis clan from a decade prior. There stood young Victoria at fourteen, flanked by her grandparents, parents, and Julian - frozen in time before her supposed overseas studies.

Margaret Hoffis staggered toward the stage, fury radiating from her frail frame. She tried to rush to Victoria's defense, but Archibald restrained her with surprising strength.

"That treacherous girl!" Margaret spat, her voice shaking with rage. "She lived under our roof as Suzanne's friend, and now she dares accuse our Victoria? I won't stand for this!"

Archibald held his wife firmly, his expression grim. "Patience, my love. The truth will reveal itself."

"How can you say that? Our granddaughter is being slandered!"

A shadow crossed Archibald's weathered face. "Open your eyes, woman! That's not our blood standing there!"

Before Margaret could respond, Archibald gestured toward the stage's edge. "Your true granddaughter is here. Just watch."

The crowd gasped as Cassandra Wright ascended the steps with regal composure.

The resemblance between Cassandra and the young girl in the photograph was uncanny. Victoria's facade cracked momentarily before she regained control. "That's Suzanne! Not me!"

Cassandra's voice remained steady. "Interesting accusation. I never claimed to be Victoria."

The music cut abruptly. Every eye in the grand ballroom locked onto the stage, the air thick with anticipation. Who was telling the truth? The mysterious accusers or the blushing bride?

Victoria knew retreat wasn't an option. She advanced toward Cassandra, their gazes locking in silent combat. The tension between them could have powered the city for a week.

"Suzanne?" Cassandra Blake whispered, her champagne flute slipping from numb fingers.

Penelope Hart clutched her sister's arm. "It can't be..."

Isabella Sinclair's eyes narrowed. "First she ruined Victoria's chance with Liam, now she's sabotaging this engagement? What game is she playing?"

The whispers swirled through the crowd like a gathering storm.

Victoria's voice dripped venom. "How dare you call me an imposter? I have DNA proof and family videos!"

She signaled to her maid of honor, who produced a tablet with trembling hands.

The screen displayed an intimate family moment - Victoria and her parents gathered on a plush sofa, their expressions carefully arranged. "Happy birthday, Dad," the couple chorused.

"Happy birthday, Grandpa," Victoria added sweetly before leading them in an off-key rendition of "Happy Birthday." The video ended with the trio offering stiff congratulations to Archibald.

The crowd erupted. Everyone recognized Victoria's parents. The video evidence seemed irrefutable.

Victoria lifted her chin triumphantly. "As you can see, I have both genetic proof and family records. I am Victoria Dawson, beyond any doubt!"
###Chapter 344

"You can fabricate videos and forge DNA results, but memories can't be falsified," Evelyn said calmly, turning to face the crowd. Her gaze finally settled on Liam. There was an undeniable strength in his steady eyes—a silent promise that steadied her racing heart.

No matter what happened today, whether she succeeded or failed, she wouldn’t be alone.

Evelyn took a deep breath and continued, "My name is Cassandra Wright. I'm 25 years old, originally from Solterra. At birth, I was named Victoria Dawson, born in Aldenria. And most importantly—I am Archibald's granddaughter. The people in that video are my parents, who are currently missing."

Seizing Archibald’s momentary distraction, Margaret broke free from his grip and rushed toward the stage. "Lies!" she shouted, her voice trembling with fury. "How could someone like you, with that altered face, possibly be my granddaughter?"

Evelyn met her gaze with quiet sorrow. "Grandmother, I am Cassandra. When I was ten, you took me abroad because you were obsessed with a famous opera singer. You even bought her a five-million-dollar diamond necklace."

Margaret froze. That was a secret only she and her granddaughter had shared.

Archibald stormed forward, his face dark with rage. "You spent five million on a singer?!"

"Grandfather, it was a woman!" Evelyn quickly clarified.

But Margaret was too stunned to react to Archibald’s anger. She took a shaky step back. "Is it really you?"

Both Evelyn and Victoria reached out to steady her, but Victoria got there first.

"Grandmother, don’t listen to her," Victoria said smoothly. "Anyone could dig up old gossip online."

"Then ask me anything," Evelyn countered. "Anything from my childhood. I’ll prove it."

Tears welled in Margaret’s eyes as she looked between the two women. Evelyn exhaled softly and turned her attention back to the crowd.

"Many of you here today watched me grow up. By the age of ten, I was fluent in three languages. By fourteen, I had mastered five."

She glanced at Victoria. "I doubt this imposter knows any of that."

Victoria’s expression tightened.

Just then, an elderly man with silver hair stepped forward. "Do you remember me? I’m your great-uncle," said Alfred Wright, Archibald’s younger brother.

Evelyn hesitated. "Could you give me a hint?"

Alfred chuckled. "When you were eight, you destroyed something priceless in my study—cost your grandfather a fortune to replace."

Recognition flashed in Evelyn’s eyes. "Great-Uncle Alfred! The antique jade vase!"

"You really are Cassandra!" Alfred exclaimed.

More people began stepping forward to confirm her identity.

A well-dressed man in his twenties approached next. "If you’re really Cassandra, do you remember me? I’m Gregory Thornton—your deskmate in elementary school."

Evelyn barely recalled his face, but the name was familiar. "You weren’t my deskmate. You sat next to Liam."

Gregory blinked. "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely. I was younger than both of you. I skipped three grades just to be in the same class."

Her gaze drifted to Liam, who watched her with quiet intensity. She had pushed herself relentlessly back then, determined to keep up with him.

"I sat in the front row because I was small. You were the tallest in class—always in the back. And you were class president for three years straight."
###Chapter 345

"She's the real Cassandra Wright!" Gregory Thornton exclaimed.

The entire ballroom erupted in gasps. The Blackwood family stood frozen, their eyes locked on Evelyn standing center stage. Some guests whispered excitedly, while others shook their heads in disbelief.

"Liam." A voice cut through the murmurs. "You grew up with her. You'd know better than anyone - is that really Cassandra?"

Liam Blackwood's gut twisted at the mention of their childhood. It had taken him far too long to recognize her. His voice carried across the silent room. "That's Cassandra Wright."

The declaration silenced all doubts. Whispers spread like wildfire. "No wonder General Blackwood married her. This explains everything."

Margaret Hoffis collapsed onto her knees. Victoria immediately clung to her grandmother's arm. "Grandmother, please! I'm your real granddaughter! She's lying - that test was forged!"

"We've video called every week for years! How could you forget? DNA results can't be faked!"

"The video doesn't lie. Would my own parents not recognize their daughter?"

Suddenly, Margaret seemed to regain her composure. She stood protectively beside Victoria. "It's true! We've had countless video calls. Would Cassandra's parents not know their own child?"

She turned toward Archibald. "Even Archibald has spoken with her on video! Though Cassandra hasn't returned to Aldenria in a decade, she's looked exactly the same!"

"Archibald, explain this to everyone! They're accusing an innocent girl of fraud! She's willing to take another DNA test. Don't you trust science? Don't you trust Cassandra's own parents?"

Tears welled in Margaret's eyes. Archibald's face darkened with barely contained rage. Clutching his chest, he bellowed, "You foolish woman! Get down from there! Stop harassing Evelyn!"

The crowd's sympathy shifted back to Victoria. No one could imagine parents failing to recognize their child.

Nathaniel Winslow had long forgotten this was supposed to be his engagement party. His lips curled as he watched Evelyn. "This just keeps getting better."

Suddenly, Dorothy Simmons burst forward. "That's my daughter, Evelyn Carter!"

She rushed the stage and grabbed Evelyn's wrist, addressing the crowd. "I apologize, everyone! This is my daughter Evelyn. She's... unwell. Please forgive this disturbance!"

Evelyn struggled against her grip. "Let me go!"

Rosalind Baskins charged onto the stage, followed closely by Ryan Sullivan on Liam's orders. They each seized one of Dorothy's arms, dragging her aside.

"Evelyn, have you lost your mind?" Dorothy shrieked. "You're embarrassing yourself at Mr. Winslow's engagement!"

"Is this how you think you'll win his affection? The DNA tests proved twice you're my daughter!"

"Silence!" Rosalind snapped.

Nathaniel's lips twitched in amusement at the suggestion Evelyn wanted to marry him.
###Chapter 346

The chaos was escalating beyond containment. The crowd below the stage had begun swallowing Victoria's lies whole. With Margaret Hoffis' testimony added to the mix, everyone became convinced Evelyn was the fraud.

"Two DNA tests don't lie. What could be more accurate than science?" a voice rang out from the audience.

Someone pointed accusingly at Evelyn. "Your own mother came forward with proof. Two DNA tests confirm you're her daughter."

The murmurs grew into a deafening uproar.

Evelyn stood tall, her voice cutting through the noise. "Science is reliable, but results can be fabricated. Dorothy Simmons is not my mother. For three years, I lived as her daughter because of her real child." Her finger swung toward Victoria. "She stole not just my identity, but my entire family."

Then she turned her piercing gaze to Victoria, enunciating each word. "After my memory loss, she sent me to her family to serve them."

"You're the liar here!" Victoria shrieked. "I have DNA proof. Videos of my parents and relatives testifying for me!"

This seemed like irrefutable evidence of Victoria's identity, while Evelyn had nothing but her fractured memories.

Meanwhile, Reginald Winslow burned with humiliation as his son's engagement party descended into farce because of Evelyn.

Desperate to regain control, he whispered to Police Chief Theodore Graves. "Have your men escort her to the station to cool off. Investigate quietly after the party concludes."

"Understood, Mr. Winslow," Graves nodded.

Two officers ascended the stage, flashing badges in Evelyn's face. "You're coming with us to the station."

Evelyn froze. Rosalind Baskins released Dorothy, rushing to shield Evelyn. "You should be arresting the impostor, not us!"

"This is Mr. Winslow's engagement party, not an interrogation room," the officer snapped.

Rosalind glanced back at Evelyn for guidance. A subtle head shake conveyed their predicament - walking out with police would cement Victoria's legitimacy in the public eye.

For Reginald, only the political alliance with the wealthy family mattered. He didn't care if Victoria was truly a Hoffis. He knew Nathaniel's marriage would collapse if Evelyn proved to be the real heiress.

"Now," the officer pressed gently.

Evelyn's eyes sought Liam Blackwood in the crowd. He watched intently, allowing her to handle the situation independently unless absolutely necessary.

But when he saw the helplessness flicker across her face, he leaned toward Ryan Sullivan with quiet instructions.

As the officers advanced, Rosalind and Evelyn retreated step by step.

"We have another witness!" Rosalind suddenly declared, pointing to Rosalind Fairchild in the audience. "She's Evelyn's closest friend. She can testify!"

All attention swung to Rosalind Fairchild, who trembled under the sudden scrutiny. Taking shaky steps forward, she pointed at Victoria. "Sh-she's not Cassandra Wright. She's my childhood friend, Evelyn Carter."

Victoria flushed crimson. "I've never met you! You're conspiring with them to frame me!"

Rosalind Fairchild pulled out her phone, scrolling through photos. "Look at my gallery. We have pictures together. Even with plastic surgery, the changes aren't that drastic."

"Photos can be edited," Victoria countered.

The officer gestured at Rosalind Fairchild. "You're coming to the station too. All three of you will be questioned together."

As two officers seized Evelyn and Rosalind Baskins, the situation spiraled out of control. The trap was closing around them.
###Chapter 347

The grand ballroom doors burst open as armed soldiers stormed in with military precision.

A stunned silence fell over the glittering crowd. The soldiers swiftly secured the perimeter while Liam Blackwood ascended the stage flanked by two armed officers.

"General Blackwood, explain this outrage!" Nathaniel Winslow snarled from the center stage.

Liam remained impassive, ignoring the furious demand.

Reginald Winslow approached with a politician's smile that didn't reach his eyes. "General, this is my son's engagement celebration. Bringing armed forces here is highly inappropriate."

The steel in Liam's gaze never wavered.

Theodore Graves swaggered forward, police insignia glinting. "You're overstepping your jurisdiction, General. Fraud cases fall under my department."

"Is that so?" Liam's voice cut like ice.

Ryan Sullivan exchanged a glance with Liam before roughly detaining Victoria Dawson, forcing her to her knees beside Loretta. Victoria's screams pierced the air.

"Stop! Release her this instant!" Margaret Hoffis beat her frail hands against Ryan's armored vest.

Reginald's face purpled with rage. "This is Aldenria! You can't make arrests without cause!"

Theodore looked ready to draw his weapon. "Liam Blackwood! You'll answer for this!"

Liam's voice carried across the silent hall. "She's not just a fraud. She's a Valtorian spy."

Reginald staggered back as if struck. Theodore's jaw went slack. The revelation sent shockwaves through the elite gathering.

"Dear God... espionage carries the death penalty!"

"No wonder the Defense Ministry mobilized!"

"Reginald's future daughter-in-law is an enemy agent! His political career is finished!"

"Do you think he was complicit?"

Reginald's arrogant demeanor crumbled. "General, this isn't... this can't be serious!"

Liam's glacial stare answered him.

"I had no knowledge of this!" Reginald babbled. "Nathaniel only met her twice! Investigate thoroughly!"

Dismissing the panicking officials, Liam approached the trembling Margaret. Taking her shaking hands, he said gently, "Madam Hoffis, this woman isn't your granddaughter."

Margaret's world spun. Tears blurred her vision as she watched Victoria being restrained. Her heart shattered at the sight.

"Grandmother, please! It's me, Victoria!" the imposter wailed.

Caught between disbelief and despair, Margaret covered her face, her sobs echoing through the hall. Archibald couldn't bear her denial any longer and stormed out in disgust.

Ryan marched Victoria out at gunpoint, the soldiers forming an impenetrable escort.

The society event of the year ended in scandal. News outlets would be buzzing within the hour.

Dorothy Simmons collapsed to the marble floor, staring blankly at Evelyn. The truth had been staring her in the face all along - Evelyn's kindness, intelligence, and gentle nature were nothing like the cruel imposter.

She'd clung to those DNA results like gospel. Now the devastating truth left her hollow.
###Chapter 348

Rosalind Fairchild approached Dorothy Simmons and gently helped her up. "Dorothy, she's not Evelyn. The woman they took away is Evelyn. How could you not recognize your own daughter?"

"I refuse to accept a traitor as my daughter!" Dorothy cried out in anguish, tears streaming down her weathered face. Her desperate gaze locked onto Evelyn as she insisted, "She's Evelyn! My flesh and blood!"

Rosalind guided the distraught woman away. "Stop this, Dorothy. That woman isn't your daughter at all. She's the celebrated artist Isabella Grayson - a virtuoso pianist fluent in eight languages."

"She possesses encyclopedic knowledge, particularly in chemistry and military strategy. How could your daughter possibly have such expertise? Face the truth."

Dorothy's resistance crumbled, her heart breaking as she finally accepted reality. As she was led out, she cast one final, lingering look at Evelyn.

The three years of mother-daughter bonds they'd shared would forever remain etched in her memory.

Under the Wright family's direction, guests began dispersing from the venue.

In a quiet corner, Margaret Hoffis sat slumped on a sofa, her face buried in her hands as if carrying the weight of the world.

Evelyn approached slowly with Rosalind Baskins at her side. "Grandmother," she said softly.

Margaret lifted her head slowly. Tears glistened in her eyes, but they weren't for Evelyn - they were for the imposter who'd deceived them all.

A flicker of anger burned in Margaret's gaze as if Evelyn bore responsibility for the entire deception.

Evelyn knelt before her grandmother, resting trembling hands on the older woman's knees. "Grandmother, I'm your true granddaughter. I've never had cosmetic surgery. This is my natural face."

"Look at me carefully. Don't I resemble my childhood photos? Don't I look like Mother?"

Margaret brushed Evelyn's hands away with cold indifference and stood to leave. Rosalind Baskins gaped in disbelief, barely restraining herself from cursing the stubborn old woman.

Evelyn's heart constricted painfully as tears spilled down her cheeks. She stood abruptly, voice catching. "Grandmother..."

She couldn't comprehend Margaret's continued rejection. Rosalind squeezed her shoulder comfortingly. "Evelyn, forget her. You're better off without such a grandmother."

Evelyn's breathing grew ragged. Tears streaked her ruined makeup, and every attempt to wipe them away only worsened the mess.

Then a crisp white handkerchief appeared before her. She looked up through blurred vision to see Liam Blackwood. His gentle eyes and soothing voice offered unexpected comfort. "Need help with that?"

Evelyn shook her head, accepting the handkerchief. She dabbed carefully at her ruined makeup.

"Give her time. She'll come around," Liam reassured her.

Evelyn responded with a quiet hum.

"Julian's been arrested. I'll make sure they confess everything about your parents' disappearance. I'll find them - whether they're alive or..." His voice trailed off.

"Thank you, Liam," Evelyn whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

"Come on, I'll drive you home," he offered.

Evelyn started to nod, then hesitated. "No... I need to return to Wright Manor. I have to make Grandmother understand one more time."

Liam's smile faded, the light in his eyes dimming. A shadow of disappointment crossed his features as he asked, "Will you be coming back to Blackwood Manor?"

Evelyn paused before answering softly, "N-No... I won't."
###Chapter 349

Liam's smile was laced with bitterness. His usual confident demeanor had crumbled into something fragile.

Evelyn noticed the shift in his mood, and her heart ached. But reality was a cruel mistress. Her voice trembled as she spoke. "Liam, I'm going back to Solterra after I explain everything to my grandparents at Wright Manor."

A storm of emotions darkened Liam's expression. For a long moment, he couldn’t speak. He just stared at her, his gaze heavy with unspoken words. Evelyn couldn’t bear it—she lowered her head, unable to meet his eyes.

"I'm renouncing the Wright inheritance," she continued softly. "All I want is for my grandparents to live long, happy lives. Whether their fortune goes to the state or someone else, I won’t be returning to Aldenria."

"Will you at least look for your parents?" Liam asked, his voice rough.

"I will. If they're still alive, they're probably in Solterra."

Liam had no reason left to keep her. His chest burned as if pierced by a blade. Tears threatened to spill, but he tilted his head back, staring at the star-speckled ceiling to hold them at bay.

Evelyn kept her gaze down, helpless. The distant hum of the emptying party filled the silence between them.

Most guests had already left. Only a few waiters remained, clearing the remnants of the evening. Rosalind had slipped away earlier, but she lingered in the shadows, watching them with sorrow. She wished she could do something—anything—to ease their pain.

Liam exhaled heavily. "Cassandra," he murmured, using the name only he knew her by. "Can we stay in touch? Not for work. Just… so I know you're okay."

Evelyn pressed her hands to her face and shook her head. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to. But the rules of her country forbade it.

As a researcher with access to classified state secrets, private contact with foreign military officials was strictly prohibited.

"I’ll wait another five years," Liam said, his voice breaking. "Just… reach out to me then. Even once."

Tears spilled down Evelyn’s cheeks. She looked at him, stunned. Why would he wait another five years? Had he uncovered something about her past?

He’d already waited ten years for her. And gotten nothing in return.

She wanted to ask, but the words lodged in her throat. If she spoke, she’d shatter completely.

Liam swallowed his own pain, forcing steadiness into his voice. "I know who you are now. I understand. And I respect it. I won’t stand in your way."

Evelyn’s tears stopped. She stared at him, breathless.

He didn’t want her to see his own tears. Instead, he pulled her into a tight embrace, burying his face in her shoulder. He inhaled the familiar scent of her hair, letting his own silent tears fall.

"You’ll always be my Cassandra," he whispered. "Even if the world knows you as Evelyn now."
###Chapter 350

Evelyn stood frozen, her vision swimming with unshed tears. A crushing weight pressed against her chest as the realization struck her.

Liam had known everything from the beginning.

Finding her had been Harrison Pierce's direct order, yet he'd played along with her charade, pretending not to recognize her true identity.

With a choked sob, Evelyn threw herself against Liam's chest, burying her face in the crisp fabric of his uniform. Her fingers clutched desperately at his waist.

"I'm so sorry, Liam."

She felt his strong arms encircle her as he rested his chin atop her head. His voice came out rough with emotion. "Tell me this isn't because your feelings have changed. Tell me you had no choice."

Evelyn's body shook with violent sobs that stole her breath. No words could form past the lump in her throat. Time lost meaning as she melted into his embrace, drawing comfort from his familiar cedar scent.

For the first time, she understood what true belonging felt like. The safety of his arms became her entire world, and the thought of leaving them sent panic coursing through her veins.

"General Blackwood, we're running out of time." Ryan Sullivan's urgent voice shattered the moment.

Before Evelyn could react, Liam had already stepped back. He turned away without a word or backward glance. Though his posture remained rigid with military precision, she caught the glimmer of moisture in his steel-gray eyes.

The car ride back to Wright Manor passed in a haze. Evelyn leaned against the window, her swollen eyes burning. She kept them shut tight, willing the world to disappear.

Rosalind Baskins, ever perceptive, maintained a respectful silence throughout the journey.

Upon arrival, Evelyn immediately noticed the shift in atmosphere. Winston and the household staff moved with new deference, their eyes filled with awe and curiosity.

Word of her true identity had clearly spread through the manor like wildfire.

While most of the household had accepted her as a Wright, Margaret Hoffis remained locked in her chambers, refusing all meals and visitors for an entire day.

When Margaret finally emerged, she maintained her icy distance, avoiding Evelyn at every turn. The rejection cut deeper than Evelyn cared to admit. She couldn't comprehend her grandmother's continued attachment to the imposter.

At lunch the next day, Evelyn pushed food around her plate while Archibald studied her with kind eyes.

"Something troubling you, my dear?"

Evelyn sighed, resting her chin in her palm. "Grandfather, it's been three days. Why won't Grandmother even look at me?"

Archibald's smile held centuries of wisdom. "Shall I arrange a DNA test to convince her?"

"No, that's not necessary."

"But she—"

"Knows the truth," Archibald interrupted gently. "She simply refuses to acknowledge it."

Evelyn set down her fork with a clatter. "I don't understand."

Dabbing his mouth with a linen napkin, Archibald leaned back. "The depth of her love for you makes the deception unbearable. Accepting you means admitting she was fooled by an imposter."

"That doesn't make sense," Evelyn protested.

"You've always been the rational one, my dear. Your grandmother... she operates from the heart. Sometimes to the point of irrationality."

"I never treated her poorly," Evelyn said defensively.

Archibald chuckled. "Not intentionally, perhaps. But you were always impatient with her emotional displays."

Evelyn opened her mouth to argue but stopped. Fragmented memories surfaced—of an insistent grandmother bearing trays of sweets, only to be dismissed with an absentminded wave.

"Your grandmother would bring you treats while you studied," Archibald continued. "You'd shoo her away, claiming she disrupted your concentration."

His expression turned wistful. "Eventually, you even posted a sign: 'Grandmother—Do Not Disturb.'"

The revelation struck Evelyn like a physical blow. She'd been so focused on her work, so determined to prove herself, that she'd pushed away the very people who loved her most.
###Chapter 351

Evelyn sighed deeply. "It's because Grandma kept coming into my room too frequently. It was disrupting my work."

Archibald gave her a knowing look. "That was her way of showing affection, darling. Your constant irritation wounded her deeply."

The realization hit Evelyn like a physical blow. Guilt twisted in her stomach.

"You never even opened the gifts she bought you," Archibald continued gently. "They just gathered dust in your closet."

Evelyn bit her lip. It wasn't that she disliked Margaret's presents. They simply didn't align with her interests.

Her passions lay in quantum physics, molecular biology, astrophysics - the mysteries of the universe. Yet Margaret persisted in giving designer dresses, diamond jewelry, and expensive perfumes.

"After three sentences, you'd start checking your watch when she talked to you," Archibald pointed out. "Yet you could discuss particle physics with me for hours without blinking. She noticed, Evelyn. It broke her heart."

He sighed, thinking of Margaret's sacrifices. "She didn't have your education. Gossip and small talk are her world. It's not that she didn't try to understand you."

Evelyn's shoulders slumped. She'd never considered how her behavior affected her grandmother.

"Despite everything, she adores you," Archibald said softly. "That imposter Victoria is everything you're not. She doesn't bury herself in research papers or speak in equations Margaret can't comprehend."

His voice grew firmer. "She devours the cookies Margaret bakes. She gushes over every gift. She listens raptly to all the neighborhood gossip. She even enjoys those tedious afternoon teas you always avoided."

Evelyn's hands trembled. "She's the granddaughter Margaret always wanted."

"Exactly." Archibald's eyes were sad. "Margaret isn't rejecting you, Evelyn. She just can't accept that the granddaughter who returned still seems to dislike her as much as before."

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks. "I never hated her," she whispered hoarsely. "Even as a child... I was just... preoccupied."

Archibald patted her hand. "I understand. But Margaret needs simpler expressions. More obvious affection."

Through her tears, Evelyn managed a small smile. "So it's not that she prefers Victoria. She just thinks I don't love her."

Archibald nodded grimly. "And now she's convinced she's lost you forever, especially after how cruelly she treated you while defending that imposter."

Evelyn glanced toward Margaret's closed door. "I never blamed her. She's being too hard on herself."

"Frankly, you'd be justified in resenting her," Archibald muttered around a mouthful of food. "The woman couldn't recognize her own flesh and blood."

"Liam didn't recognize me either," Evelyn said bitterly.

"That's different," Archibald countered. "Ten years is a long time, and young people trust science over intuition. But Margaret? You video-called her every year until you disappeared. Three years shouldn't have erased your face from her memory."

Evelyn's thoughts darkened again. She remembered Liam's words at the gala, his promise to wait five more years for even a single message from her.

The memory was both comforting and devastating.
###Chapter 352

Before her memories returned, Evelyn had forgotten Liam for an entire decade.

Yet he had loved her unconditionally all those years, waiting patiently without any promise of reunion.

Evelyn suddenly lost her appetite. She stood abruptly, phone in hand. "Grandfather, please excuse me. There's something I need to attend to."

"Of course, dear," Archibald replied gently.

Retreating to her room, Evelyn closed the door and perched on the edge of her bed. Her thumb hovered over Liam's contact in her phone, hesitating.

The longing surprised her. Only two days without hearing his voice, yet she ached to know his whereabouts, his activities. Normally so composed, she found herself battling unfamiliar emotions when it came to him. Before she realized it, her finger had pressed call.

Her pulse raced. Palms grew damp as the line connected. Then came his warm baritone: "Cassandra? Is everything alright?"

"Must there be trouble for me to call you?" she countered, sharper than intended.

Silence stretched on Liam's end. Usually, Evelyn only reached out when she needed something. Could this simply be... because she wanted to hear his voice?

She could practically hear his smile through the phone. "No, of course not."

Suddenly tongue-tied, Evelyn lay back on the bed, cheeks warming. The silence between them stretched comfortably until Liam finally spoke.

"Have you eaten?"

"Yes."

"How are your grandparents?"

"Grandmother isn't well."

"Give it time."

"I know."

Another pause. Evelyn remembered Liam was never one for small talk. If she wanted conversation, she'd have to lead.

"Liam... where are you?" she asked softly.

"Blackwood Manor."

"You didn't return to base?"

"My current assignment keeps me in Aldenria. Nothing urgent."

His deep voice wrapped around her like a warm blanket, filling the hollow space in her chest. In that moment, she understood why he'd always hoped she'd call - not for business, but simply to connect.

"Cassandra," he murmured.

"Yes?"

"Can we meet?"

Her breath caught. Staring at the ceiling, she felt her heartbeat accelerate.

"Some friends are coming to the manor for dinner tonight. You've met them before. Will you join us?"

The thought of seeing him alone terrified her, but with others present... "Alright. What time?"

"Five o'clock. I'll send Ryan to collect you."

"I'll be there. See you soon, Liam," she answered, smiling.

"Looking forward to it." His reluctance to hang up was palpable.

Evelyn ended the call first, springing from bed with sudden energy. She practically flew to her closet, searching for the perfect outfit. Her heart had already left to meet him.

By nightfall, Blackwood Manor's gardens would be transformed - tables set, food prepared, the barbecue waiting.
###Chapter 353

Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Manor with Rosalind. After introducing Rosalind to the Hudson siblings, they all settled in the garden for afternoon tea.

Evelyn's gaze darted around the terrace, searching for Liam. Victoria noticed her restlessness and said, "He's in the kitchen prepping for dinner."

"Personally handling the preparations?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

"All staff were given leave. He insists on doing everything himself until new hires are vetted," Victoria replied with a meaningful glance.

"I should go help," Evelyn said, rising from her seat.

Victoria stood abruptly, blocking her path. "I wouldn't recommend that," she said with thinly veiled disdain. "You're accustomed to being waited on. The last thing we need is you ruining dinner."

Rosalind's expression darkened at the hostility. Evelyn forced a smile, swallowing her irritation as she returned to her chair.

Footsteps approached. Evelyn turned to see Liam carrying a silver tray, his warm gaze locking onto hers. Her pulse quickened, cheeks flushing as she murmured, "Liam."

His lips curved into that familiar smile. After setting down the tray, he placed a crystal glass of juice before Evelyn. "Freshly squeezed, just how you like it."

"Thank you," she whispered, touched by his thoughtfulness.

The contrast was stark - while Benjamin, Victoria and Rosalind drank soda and beer, Evelyn had hand-pressed juice. Liam's favoritism couldn't be more obvious. He then moved to the stone grill, arranging cuts of meat with military precision.

"Liam, have your men handle that," Benjamin called out.

"My men serve their country, not my personal needs," Liam responded without looking up.

Evelyn admired his principles. Setting aside her phone, she approached the grill. "Let me help?"

Liam turned, his expression softening. He wanted to tell her to just stay by his side, but instead handed her two skewers of jumbo shrimp. "Watch these. Flip every minute until they turn coral."

"I've got this," Evelyn beamed, focusing intently on her task despite the smoke stinging her eyes. Liam leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. "Let me take over if it's too much."

Before she could respond, Victoria shoved between them, snatching the skewers from Evelyn's hands. "Ms. Wright," she said with false sweetness, "someone of your... delicate constitution shouldn't be near open flames. What if you burned those perfect hands?"

Liam gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Go sit. Almost ready."

A bitter taste filled Evelyn's mouth as she watched Liam and Victoria work side by side, Victoria chattering animatedly while deliberately ignoring her.

Returning to her seat, Evelyn slumped into the chair. Rosalind slid the juice toward her, whispering, "General Blackwood adores you. His heart belongs to you alone - no one can change that."
###Chapter 354

Evelyn took a slow sip of the tangy orange juice, forcing a tight-lipped smile. "I don't mind," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Really?" Rosalind leaned forward, her eyes searching Evelyn's face.

Evelyn's gaze flickered toward Liam and Victoria again. A bitter taste rose in her throat that had nothing to do with the juice. They looked... perfect together. Both prominent figures in Aldenria, sharing the same ambitions and social circles.

"Two of Aldenria's most influential leaders," Evelyn murmured. "With matching ideals and compatible backgrounds."

Rosalind didn't miss the quiet anguish in Evelyn's words.

"Evelyn, are you absolutely certain about this?" Rosalind pressed, frustration creeping into her tone.

Evelyn lowered her head, a humorless smile playing on her lips.

"What are you two whispering about?" Benjamin interjected, his curiosity piqued.

"Nothing important," Evelyn replied with practiced ease.

Rosalind took a long swig of beer and exhaled heavily. Benjamin scooted closer to Evelyn, grinning. "So what should I call you now? Ms. Wright? Cassandra? Or should I stick with Evelyn?"

"Evelyn will do. Cassandra Wright ceased to exist a decade ago."

"Why's that?" Benjamin's eyebrows shot up.

"Solterra doesn't recognize dual citizenship."

"But you're the sole heir to the Wright fortune. Why renounce that? Planning to settle in Solterra permanently?" Benjamin's questions came rapid-fire.

Evelyn offered an awkward smile and busied herself with her drink. Sensing her discomfort, Benjamin smoothly changed topics. "You and Liam seem fated, you know. Even with amnesia, you still ended up married to him."

Evelyn merely smiled enigmatically.

"I heard he's been crazy about you since childhood. True story?" Benjamin pressed.

"Ben, can we not do the relationship talk?" Evelyn pleaded.

Benjamin shrugged. "Fine, no more romance talk."

Just then, Liam arrived with a platter of grilled seafood and meats. Victoria followed close behind, both taking their seats.

"Try our culinary skills," Victoria offered with a bright smile.

Rosalind dug in immediately. "Delicious," she complimented between bites.

Liam carefully peeled two large shrimp and placed them on Evelyn's plate. "These are the ones you like. Try them."

"Thanks," Evelyn said, giving a thumbs-up as she tasted them.

Liam's gaze lingered on Evelyn with unmistakable tenderness. Victoria's smile faltered as she noticed Liam's attention remained solely fixed on Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Benjamin and Rosalind were thoroughly enjoying themselves, savoring the barbecue and beer beneath the starlit sky.

"This beef is amazing," Benjamin remarked, grabbing another skewer. His eyes then caught Victoria's downcast expression and Liam's affectionate gaze toward Evelyn. Clearing his throat loudly, he announced, "Let's play a game!"

"What kind?" Rosalind perked up immediately.

All eyes turned to Benjamin. Spotting a tissue box on the table, he pulled out five sheets. After plucking a blade of grass from the ground, he concealed it in one tissue before crumpling all five into small balls.

"Everyone picks one. Whoever gets the grass blade chooses truth or dare for their punishment."

"Sounds fun! Let's do it!" Rosalind clapped her hands excitedly.

Benjamin scattered the tissue balls across the table. Each person selected one.

"Who's our lucky winner?" Benjamin asked dramatically.

"Not me," Victoria said with a strained smile.

Evelyn unfolded hers to reveal nothing. She peeked at Liam's tissue and couldn't suppress a giggle when she spotted the grass. "Liam, you've got it."

"Truth or dare?" Benjamin asked with exaggerated enthusiasm.

His brow furrowed when he noticed Liam glancing at Evelyn. "Why are you looking at Evelyn for answers?"
###Chapter 355

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson as she quickly averted her gaze from Liam.

"I'll take the Truth," Liam declared without hesitation.

Benjamin pondered for a brief moment before posing his question. "What's your ideal type of woman?"

Rosalind frowned in disapproval, shaking her head slightly.
"What a pointless waste of an opportunity," she muttered under her breath.

Victoria, however, leaned forward with keen interest. After casting a meaningful glance toward Evelyn, Liam answered calmly,
"Cassandra is my perfect match."

Victoria's expression soured instantly. Benjamin looked stunned, realizing too late he'd squandered his chance to ask something more revealing. Everyone already knew Liam's feelings for Cassandra. A warm sensation spread through Evelyn's chest, her heartbeat accelerating as she took an awkward sip of her juice.

"Forget it," Benjamin said shamelessly. "We all know you're smitten with her. Let me ask something else."

"Go ahead," Liam unexpectedly agreed.

Just as Benjamin opened his mouth, Victoria interjected sharply. "If you had to choose between love and your military career, which would you pick?"

Liam's face grew serious. Rosalind and Benjamin exchanged shocked looks before turning back to Liam. The question was clearly designed to trap him.

"What kind of question is that?" Rosalind demanded.

Victoria shot her a glare. "There are no restrictions on questions in this game."

"You—" Rosalind sputtered with frustration. She glanced at Evelyn and noticed her grim expression.

Liam took a deep breath before downing his drink in one gulp, his chest tightening visibly.

Benjamin quickly tried to diffuse the tension. "Let's change the—"

"No changes," Victoria insisted firmly. "Answer the question, Liam. Career or love?"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy as she stared at Victoria. "Career," she stated decisively.

Victoria scoffed. "I was asking Liam, not you."

"That's his answer," Evelyn countered stubbornly.

"How would you know?" Victoria challenged. "You're not him."

Evelyn clenched her teeth, recognizing Victoria's ploy to force Liam to verbally prioritize his career. She took a large gulp of juice to quell the fire burning in her chest.

After composing herself, Evelyn continued, "He's the General of Aldenria's military - the cornerstone of our nation's defense and weapons development. National duty outweighs personal feelings. What's there to question?"

Liam gave a bitter smile. "Is that what you truly believe?"

Victoria looked astonished. Everyone turned to Liam simultaneously. His eyes darkened with sorrow as he absentmindedly sipped his drink and sighed.

When his gaze met Evelyn's, unshed tears glistened in his eyes. "Any capable soldier could become General of Aldenria. Our nation has no shortage of heroes like Donovan. But there's only one Cassandra Wright in this world."

Evelyn stood frozen, completely stunned. She'd assumed Liam would naturally choose his career, just as she would have. Rosalind and Benjamin appeared deeply moved by his words.

Victoria's face flushed with anger. "Liam, do you even realize what you're saying?"

Liam remained composed. "I want both my career and love. But if forced to choose, I choose Cassandra."
###Chapter 356

Victoria Hudson's hands shook with barely contained fury. Her nails dug into her palms as she hissed, "I was talking about your affection, not Cassandra."

"Cassandra is my affection," Liam Blackwood replied smoothly, swirling the amber liquid in his glass.

A storm of emotions crossed Evelyn Carter's face. She stared at her intertwined fingers, feeling both cherished and devastated simultaneously.

Victoria let out a bitter laugh. "Tell me, Liam, are you still the same man I knew all those years ago?"

Liam lifted his whiskey tumbler, clinking it gently against Victoria's in silent apology for disappointing her.

After taking a measured sip, Victoria arched an eyebrow. "Even if you love her, that doesn't guarantee she returns your feelings."

"Then there's nothing more to discuss," Liam said, his voice laced with quiet resignation.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. "Excuse me," she murmured, rising abruptly. "I need to freshen up."

Liam's gaze followed Evelyn's retreating form with unmistakable tenderness.

Benjamin Hudson chuckled darkly. "Well, this certainly isn't the drinking game I expected. More like your dramatic confession hour. Your courting tactics grow bolder by the day - even fabricating such elaborate lies."

Liam's expression turned grave. "Since childhood, I've only ever wanted to become a doctor."

The abrupt declaration left all three listeners stunned. Liam exhaled sharply, tilting his head back to study the starless sky before draining his glass.

"Donovan dreamed of military glory," Liam continued quietly. "He believed higher rank meant greater responsibility - more ways to serve our nation and its people. His ideals were always... noble."

Rosalind Baskins paused mid-bite, grilled meat forgotten as she studied Liam's profile.

"If both your dreams were equally honorable," Victoria pressed, "why become Donovan's idealized soldier instead of pursuing medicine?"

Liam's shoulders slumped slightly. "Cassandra has idolized Donovan since we were children. He's likely her personal hero."

Rosalind nearly choked on her food. The idea that the ever-confident General Blackwood had spent his life molding himself into someone Cassandra might admire was staggering.

Victoria turned away, discreetly wiping at her eyes. The painful truth settled over her - no matter what she did, she could never compete with Cassandra Wright.

Benjamin sighed, lifting his glass. "A toast then, Liam. To you."

After refilling their drinks, Liam clinked his tumbler against Benjamin's.

"You improve yourself when inspired by someone exceptional," Benjamin declared. "Half your achievements exist because of Cassandra. To your devotion and her brilliance."

"Cheers," Liam murmured. "To her flourishing career."

Benjamin blinked. "Whose career?"

"Cassandra's remarkable career," Liam clarified with a wry smile, downing his whiskey in one swallow.

As Benjamin set down his empty glass, he frowned. "She refuses to inherit the Wright fortune and plans to return to Solterra. What career could she possibly have there?"

Liam refilled Benjamin's drink. "Let's not discuss that. Change of subject."

Rosalind stared at Liam with dawning horror. Had he discovered Evelyn's true identity? "General Blackwood," she ventured nervously, "are you drunk?"

Liam ignored her, continuing his quiet drinking session with Benjamin, their conversation drifting to safer topics.
###Chapter 357

Evelyn noticed Liam's dark mood immediately. He was drowning his sorrows in whiskey, glass after glass. Victoria rose from the table with a heavy heart and stepped outside.

As she reached the veranda, Cassandra emerged from inside the manor. Victoria stopped her with a determined look. "We need to talk."

Cassandra waited silently, her expression unreadable. Victoria took a steadying breath before confessing, "I'm in love with Liam."

"I know," Cassandra replied softly, feeling the familiar ache in her chest. Even after all this time, the words still cut deep.

Victoria studied Cassandra carefully. She wasn't conventionally beautiful, but there was an undeniable grace about her - her delicate features, slender frame, gentle demeanor, and that melodic voice.

Beyond her natural charm, she was the heiress to the Wright fortune. Victoria knew no man could resist such a package.

Especially when Liam had loved her since childhood. Their bond had been forged over decades, unshakable and irreplaceable. Victoria understood she could never compete.

"Do you love him?" Victoria pressed.

Cassandra remained silent, her gaze steady.

"Will you return to Solterra eventually?" Victoria asked next.

A quiet hum was Cassandra's only response.

Victoria's shoulders relaxed slightly. "To me, Donovan could never measure up to Liam. There's simply no comparison. I suppose love really is blind."

Cassandra frowned, confused by the sudden mention of Donovan.

"You have everything - the man you love, a country waiting for you, a brilliant career, a whole life elsewhere. You don't belong here with Liam. Please stop giving him false hope," Victoria pleaded, her voice breaking.

Cassandra's hands clenched into fists, tears welling in her eyes.

Victoria stepped closer, her voice firm. "No matter how deeply he loves you, once you're gone, I'll help him move on. Whether it takes one year or fifty, I'll wait as long as it takes to free him from this pain."

At first, Cassandra didn't understand why Liam needed "freeing" from his own feelings. Then it hit her - he'd loved her unconditionally for years without reciprocation.

They'd been legally married once, but she'd never truly been his Wanda.

Blinking back tears, Cassandra whispered, "Ms. Hudson, if you had to choose between your diplomatic career and Liam, what would you pick?"

Victoria answered without hesitation. "Liam. Always Liam."

A sad smile touched Cassandra's lips. She turned away, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. Wiping her tears discreetly, she felt her heart shatter. Victoria's love ran deeper than hers ever had.

Some people risked everything for love. Others sacrificed for science. Both were valid paths, neither superior to the other.

When Cassandra finally composed herself, she turned back. "I wish you both every happiness."

Relief flooded Victoria's features. "Thank you."

"Love him well," Cassandra murmured, the words laced with quiet agony.

"I will. When are you leaving?" Victoria asked eagerly.

Cassandra walked past her, pausing only to say, "I'd like one more month with my grandparents."

Victoria watched her retreating figure, calling after her, "Promise me you'll leave Aldenria after that month. You must keep your word."
###Chapter 358

Evelyn and Victoria returned to their seats one after another. Benjamin had already prepared fresh tissues for the next round of their drinking game. "Let's continue," he announced with a grin.

Evelyn drained her glass and set it down with a hollow thud. "Actually, I just remembered an urgent matter," she said abruptly. "I should get going. Enjoy your evening."

Rosalind studied Evelyn's face carefully before standing up. Evelyn gave everyone a polite nod and turned to leave, but Liam's hand shot out, gripping her wrist like a vice.

The entire garden froze.

She stood rigid while he remained seated, his fingers locked around her delicate wrist like iron shackles. All eyes dropped to where their skin touched. Shadows obscured Liam's expression as he held on, his touch burning through her sleeve.

Evelyn's heart constricted painfully at the familiar warmth of his palm.

"Liam, I really must go," she lied smoothly. "Grandmother is expecting me." She tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened.

The alcohol amplified Liam's anguish a thousandfold. A storm raged in his chest - so many words he wanted to say, needed to say, yet his tongue remained leaden in his mouth.

His gaze dropped to her empty glass instead.

With agonizing slowness, his fingers uncurled from her wrist. The pain was excruciating - each breath felt like swallowing shards of glass. Finally, his arm fell limply to his side.

Evelyn forced a brittle smile. "Rosalind and I will take our leave now. Goodnight."

She walked away without looking back. The streetlights blurred past as she strode down the path, unshed tears glistening like diamonds in her eyes.

Back at the garden table, Benjamin turned to Liam, who looked utterly shattered. Liam stared blankly at Evelyn's empty glass, his broad shoulders slumped in defeat. Even in the dim golden light, the redness around his eyes was unmistakable.

"What are you still doing here?" Benjamin demanded. "Go after her!"

Liam ignored him, reaching instead for the beer bottle.

"For God's sake, Liam! If you love her, fight for her!" Benjamin slammed his fist on the table. "You're Liam Blackwood! Is there any woman you can't win over?"

Victoria elbowed her brother sharply. "Benjamin, stop. What's the point? Not every woman deserves that kind of pursuit. Besides," she added pointedly, "she doesn't belong in our world. She'll leave eventually."

Liam continued drinking in silence. Benjamin smacked the table again. "Then make her stay!"

"She doesn't love him!" Victoria snapped.

"Feelings can grow! He's loved her for years, given her everything! Doesn't he deserve—"

"Since when does love guarantee returns?" Victoria cut in coldly.

Benjamin fell silent.

"Besides," Victoria continued scornfully, "Cassandra has always been selfish. They were childhood sweethearts. He worshipped her, gave her the world."

"And how did she repay him? The moment she went abroad, she cut all ties. Blocked him everywhere."

"If not for her amnesia, she probably would have ignored him for the rest of her life! Why should Liam waste his heart on someone like that?"

Benjamin opened his mouth, then closed it. He glanced at Liam, who had already emptied two more bottles.
###Chapter 359

Liam Blackwood downed another shot as Victoria Hudson's words cut through him like shards of glass. The pain was so overwhelming that he couldn't bring himself to speak.

"Liam, listen to Victoria. You need to let her go," Benjamin Hudson sighed heavily.

Victoria stood abruptly, snatching the whiskey bottle from Liam's grasp. "Enough. You're drowning yourself."

A bitter smile twisted Liam's lips as he leaned back in his chair, bloodshot eyes closing. He bowed his head, shielding his raw grief from their concerned gazes.

Benjamin took a careful sip of his drink. "You planned this whole dinner just for her. Thought having company would make her comfortable. Yet she barely touched her food before leaving."

Victoria settled beside Liam, her fingers gently wrapping around his trembling hand. "You deserve someone who sees your worth."

"Victoria's right," Benjamin agreed quietly.

"I was never good enough for her," Liam murmured after a long silence, voice breaking.

Benjamin froze mid-sip.

Hot tears streamed down Victoria's face as she snapped, "That's ridiculous! Cassandra Wright never appreciated you. Not really."

"Victoria—" Liam's voice wavered in warning.

"She never loved you!" Victoria continued mercilessly. "She only married you after losing her memory because she needed security. Once she remembered her old life—her real love—you became invisible to her!"

"Stop." Liam's command came out strangled.

Victoria scoffed. "Am I wrong?"

Liam staggered to his feet. When Victoria reached for him, he stiffly pushed her away. "I need to lie down. Enjoy the rest of your evening."

"Let me help you upstairs—"

"No." The icy rejection made her flinch.

He swayed dangerously as he moved toward the staircase. Victoria rushed forward again, only to be shoved back harder this time.

After several failed attempts, Victoria finally stayed put, watching his retreating form with silent tears. She returned to the table in a fury, downing her drink in one gulp.

"You don't understand men," Benjamin observed carefully.

"Men are fools!" Victoria hissed. "Always chasing what they can't have!"

Benjamin gave a humorless chuckle. "Or maybe the woman they can't have happens to be the one they love most?"

"Same difference. Still stupid!" Her grip tightened around the glass.

Benjamin's expression darkened. "By that logic, what does that make you? Clinging to Liam when you know Cassandra owns his heart? Aren't you—"

He bit back the word "stupid," seeing Victoria's furious glare.

"How can you say that to your own sister?" Her eyes burned with unshed tears.

"Victoria, listen. Liam doesn't love you. Forcing this will only bring misery," Benjamin said gently.

"We haven't even tried!"

"Real love isn't about possession. Liam understands that. He's a decorated Aldenrian general—if he wanted, he could force Cassandra to stay. But he loves her too much to see her unhappy."

Victoria stood abruptly, voice glacial. "I'm no saint. I fight for what I want."

With that, she stormed out, leaving her half-finished drink and bewildered brother behind.
###Chapter 360

"Victoria—" Benjamin called out, but Victoria strode away without a backward glance. Left alone at the table, Benjamin exhaled a long, weary sigh.

Evelyn returned to Wright Manor, clutching a small pastry box in her hands.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, Margaret hastily set down her silverware and made a beeline for her room.

But Evelyn had already spotted her grandmother at the dining table. She darted forward, cutting off Margaret’s escape.

Margaret lifted her chin, feigning indifference to mask her guilt. She refused to meet Evelyn’s gaze, stubborn as a child caught misbehaving but unwilling to admit fault.

"Grandmother," Evelyn said softly, a gentle smile playing on her lips. "Why do you keep avoiding me?"

Margaret turned her face away, lips pressed into a thin line. Evelyn moved closer, but Margaret pivoted again, presenting her back. Undeterred, Evelyn circled around and held out the box. "I brought your favorite almond tarts."

"I don’t deserve them," Margaret muttered, her voice thick with pride.

Evelyn’s heart clenched. "You’re my grandmother. Why wouldn’t you deserve something as simple as pastries?"

Tears welled in Margaret’s eyes, but she scoffed. "Don’t pretend to be kind. I know what you’re thinking."

Evelyn tilted her head. "And what am I thinking?"

Margaret’s hands trembled. "That I’m a foolish old woman. Blind. Arrogant. I couldn’t even recognize my own granddaughter. I insulted you. I—" Her voice cracked.

The more she spoke, the more her anger dissolved into shame. She swallowed hard, forcing out the words. "I’m rude. I’m ignorant. A burden. But this is who I am. If you hate me, so be it."

Evelyn’s chest ached. Margaret was drowning in self-loathing, yet too proud to reach for help.

"Who told you that?" Evelyn asked gently.

Margaret bit her lip, refusing to let the tears fall.

"You’re the most wonderful grandmother in the world," Evelyn whispered, her own tears spilling over. "How could I ever hate you?"

Margaret crossed her arms, turning away. Silent sobs shook her shoulders.

"Please don’t be angry with me anymore," Evelyn murmured, stepping closer. "I’m sorry."

"I have no right to be angry," Margaret choked out.

Evelyn’s heart shattered. She had spent years abroad, buried in her studies and work.

She’d called home occasionally, but most of her video chats had been with Archibald. Margaret had always tried to keep the conversations going—asking about her day, her health—but Evelyn had often responded with only a word or two.

Margaret had loved her unconditionally, only to be met with indifference. No wonder she believed Evelyn found her irritating.

Handing the pastry box to Rosalind, Evelyn wrapped her arms around Margaret, pressing her cheek against her grandmother’s shoulder.

Margaret stiffened—then trembled, overwhelmed by the unexpected embrace.
###Chapter 361

"Grandmother, please don't think that way." Evelyn's voice trembled with emotion as she pressed closer to Margaret. "When I saw how you doted on that impostor pretending to be me, I burned with jealousy."

Margaret Hoffis bit her quivering lip, silent tears streaming down her wrinkled cheeks.

"For years I didn't know if my parents were alive. I tolerated that fraud because I hoped she might lead me to answers." Evelyn's fingers tightened around her grandmother's frail hand. "I should have told you the truth sooner. This is all my fault. Please forgive me."

The way Evelyn nuzzled against Margaret's shoulder like she used to as a child shattered the older woman's defenses. That simple gesture transported them both back twenty years, when little Cassandra would curl in her grandmother's lap.

"Can you find it in your heart to forgive me, Grandmother? Just this once?" Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper as she gently swung their clasped hands.

Margaret's shoulders shook with silent sobs. She covered her face with trembling hands. "No, my darling... I'm the one who should beg forgiveness."

"You've done nothing wrong!" Evelyn's radiant smile broke through her tears. With one hand she cradled Margaret's face, using her thumb to wipe away tears. "Not one thing."

Margaret's red-rimmed eyes searched Evelyn's face desperately.

The sight tore at Evelyn's heart, but she maintained her cheerful expression. "Come, let's sit in the parlor. I brought those lemon tarts you adore from Patisserie Royale."

Margaret started to nod, then hesitated. "You must be exhausted from your work. Don't trouble yourself with me—"

"Being with you isn't trouble," Evelyn interrupted firmly, blinking back fresh tears at her grandmother's continued attempts to please her. She guided Margaret to the velvet settee.

Accepting the pastry box from Rosalind, Evelyn flipped open the lid with a flourish. The sweet citrus aroma filled the space between them. "I want to be here. With you."

Margaret stared in wonder as Evelyn selected the most perfect tart and lifted it to her lips. "Open wide, Grandmother. Let me feed you like you used to do for me."

Margaret hesitated, eyeing the offering with heartbreaking wariness. "You...you're truly my Cassandra? Not another imposter?"

Evelyn's laughter rang out, though melancholy tinged its edges. She'd never treated her grandmother with such tenderness before. "I'm your granddaughter through and through. The same girl who—" she leaned close to whisper, "—when I was eight and had that terrible fever..."

Margaret's breath caught.

"Everyone said no cold treats, but you smuggled in that enormous tub of mint chocolate chip." Evelyn's eyes sparkled with the memory. "We hid under your quilt giggling until Grandfather discovered us—"

"—and I threw the entire tub at his head!" Margaret finished, bursting into surprised laughter. "Oh, he was furious! Said I'd be the death of you with my coddling."

Evelyn wrapped both arms around Margaret's thin shoulders. "You could never harm me. You've always loved me best."

The laughter died on Margaret's lips. Fresh tears spilled over as she clutched at Evelyn. "But I did hurt you! I'm monstrous! When I think how I kept you and Liam apart—"

"Shhh." Evelyn rocked her gently. "You protected me. That's all you've ever done."

Margaret's anguished sobs filled the parlor. "I broke your heart! I saw how you looked at him, and still I—"

"You acted out of love." Evelyn pressed their foreheads together. "Just as you always have."
###Chapter 362

"Liam and I were never truly a couple, Grandma. So how can you claim to have broken us apart?" Evelyn questioned.

"I caused your divorce," Margaret admitted.

"That marriage wasn't even legally registered in my name. It was invalid from the start."

Margaret still insisted. "But you and Liam were married for over six months, you—"

Evelyn cut her off. "It was a marriage in name only. We hadn't been functioning as a couple for most of that time."

Margaret stared at Evelyn with wide eyes. Evelyn maintained her composure, picking up a scone and taking a delicate bite before offering one to her grandmother.

"Liam and I can't be together."

"Why not? You love each other! You understand each other perfectly! You're meant to be!"

Evelyn leaned against Margaret's shoulder, closing her eyes. "Grandma, I'll explain everything later."

"You two—after six months of marriage, you never even... Is Liam incapable in bed?" Margaret asked with genuine concern.

"That's not it, Grandma. Please don't jump to conclusions," Evelyn sighed.

"Then it must be another woman! I'll have words with that boy—" Margaret's hands clenched into fists.

"No! Don't confront him." Evelyn's voice held sudden panic.

Margaret fell silent, already plotting ways to reunite them.

Meanwhile, at Royal Heights, Harrison Pierce's hands trembled as he studied the report. "Remarkable! Absolutely remarkable! We've finally located Cassandra Wright. Excellent work, General Blackwood. But why is there no photograph?"

"She's a high-value target. Photographic evidence could endanger her safety," Liam responded calmly.

Harrison understood military protocols. "What's your next move? Can you convince her to return to Aldenria?"

"She's Aldenrian by birth. She only became Solterran to gain access to their research facilities. She wouldn't have qualified otherwise."

"That simplifies matters. With her knowledge, she should serve her homeland!"

Liam shook his head. "Researchers aren't soldiers. National pride doesn't drive them."

"This is from N?velDrama.Org."

"Science knows no borders. Researchers care only about advancing human knowledge, regardless of location."

"Furthermore, Solterra possesses superior resources and technology. Returning would mean abandoning years of research. For someone like her, starting over would be worse than death."

"So you're saying she can't bring her hydronium research with her?" Harrison pressed.

"Impossible."

After consideration, Harrison declared, "We must try anyway. She's a world-class chemist and top military engineer. Even without hydronium, her potential is limitless."

"She's bound by a five-year contract." Liam's tone darkened.

"With Solterra?"

A nod.

"What are the terms? The penalties for breaking it?"

"Unknown."

"Find out."

"I will."

"How can I send negotiators when I don't even know what she looks like or where she lives? This report gives me nothing."

"Forgive me, Mr. President. Her safety depends on secrecy," Liam replied.
###Chapter 363

"Not even I have clearance for that information?" Harrison Pierce frowned deeply.

"I'll persuade her to join Aldenria," Liam Blackwood stated firmly.

"Excellent. Then I'll leave this in your capable hands. We can't afford to lose this once-in-a-century genius—our nation's future depends on it." Harrison sighed heavily.

Several days later, as the golden hues of dusk painted the sky, warmth lingered in the air.

The living room of Wright Manor was so silent that even the faintest sound would echo. Evelyn Carter reclined on the sofa, completely engrossed in a book detailing complex mechanical schematics.

"Cassandra! Cassandra, guess who's here!" Margaret Hoffis's cheerful voice shattered Evelyn's concentration.

She turned toward the doorway just as Margaret burst in, her smile radiant. Close behind her was Liam, impeccably dressed in a tailored black suit, exuding an effortless elegance that made Evelyn's pulse quicken.

Clutching the book, she rose to her feet. It felt like an eternity since they'd last seen each other.

She had missed him—achingly so—but had no excuse to seek him out. That he had come to her was unexpected.

"Liam," she greeted softly, setting the book down on the coffee table.

He stepped closer, his gaze filled with an intensity that made her breath hitch. There was something unbearably tender in his eyes as he asked, "Cassandra, are you busy?"

She shook her head. "Not at all."

His attention flickered to the book she'd just abandoned. The cover displayed intricate blueprints of an advanced fighter jet, annotated in a language he didn't recognize.

It was clearly a classified military manual—one far beyond standard comprehension.

"There's something I need to discuss with you. Will you come with me?" he asked.

Evelyn hesitated, uncertainty flickering in her eyes. They had already laid their feelings bare—what more was there to say?

Before she could respond, Margaret nudged her forward with a knowing grin. "Go on, take your time. No need to rush back."

Evelyn stumbled, colliding with Liam's chest. Instinctively, his hands settled at her waist, steadying her. His touch was warm, grounding.

Heat flooded her cheeks. She knew Margaret had orchestrated this.

Avoiding Liam's piercing gaze, she tried to step back, but Margaret seized her hand and pressed it into Liam's. "Of course she'll go," she declared.

Liam didn't close his fingers around hers. Instead, he brushed his thumb lightly over her knuckles, sensing her hesitation.

Her heart stuttered. She tucked her hand behind her back, realizing she had no choice but to comply.

"Where are we going? Should I change?" She glanced down at her casual attire, then back at Liam's polished appearance.

A flicker of amusement lit his eyes. "No need. You're perfect as you are."

He stepped aside, gesturing for her to lead the way. Evelyn grabbed her phone, nerves fluttering as she walked past him.

Liam fell into step beside her, his gaze never leaving her face, as if afraid she might vanish if he looked away.

Margaret watched them go, her smile widening. Hope bloomed in her chest.
###Chapter 364

Liam led Evelyn to the secluded beach as the sun dipped below the horizon. The ocean shimmered like scattered sapphires under the fading light.

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder. A discreet security detail maintained a respectful distance, ensuring their privacy.

"Liam, why here?" she asked, the salt-kissed breeze tousling her hair.

His gaze remained fixed on her. The twilight painted her in hues of gold and violet, stealing his breath. "No listening devices. No prying eyes. Just us."

The intensity in his storm-gray eyes told her this wasn't a social visit. She gave a knowing smile. "I thought you of all people understood my position."

"I do." His jaw tightened. "But duty demands this conversation."

"Then convey my apologies to President Pierce."

Liam exhaled sharply. "Aldenria needs you, Evelyn. Our people won't brand you a traitor to Solterra—they'll recognize the sacrifice."

"Public opinion means nothing." Her voice remained steady as the tide. "Only results matter."

"We'll mobilize every resource to continue your research if you return."

"My contract—"

"Solterra respects human rights laws. We'll void it and absorb any penalties."

A shadow crossed her features. "The price is too steep."

"What price?"

She met his gaze squarely. "Complete surrender of all hydronium patents and research termination." Her fingers curled into fists. "That formula is my life's work, Liam. The only existing prototype exists in my mind."

The desperation in her voice silenced him. Researchers' obsessions weren't foreign to him.

"Five years then," he bargained. "When your contract expires—"

"Hydronium-based sonic weapons require decades, not years."

A muscle twitched in his temple. "So you'll remain in Solterra indefinitely."

"Yes."

The word hung between them like a death sentence.

Her gaze dropped to the shifting sands. "When my parents sent me abroad, they dreamed I'd return to serve Aldenria." A bitter laugh escaped her. "But scientific progress demands sacrifice. Solterra offered resources, freedom to research... at the cost of my citizenship."

She plucked at her sleeve. "For eight years, I've lived in a research compound. Two months annual leave. No external communications. Not even to my family." A tremor entered her voice. "I didn't abandon you deliberately. I never knew..."

"But now you do." Liam closed the distance, his presence overwhelming. "Give us this chance."

Evelyn retreated until waves lapped at her heels. "You're Aldenria's Iron General. I'm Solterra's top-secret asset. Any contact constitutes espionage."

His hands gripped her shoulders, anchoring her. "Is there nothing here worth risking for?"

The raw vulnerability in his eyes unraveled her defenses. In that moment, no equations or formulas existed—only him.

"Your grandparents," he pressed. "Donovan. Not even a sliver of doubt?"

Darkness swallowed the last light as the tide rushed between them.
###Chapter 365

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes as she struggled to contain her emotions.

The night had fallen, obscuring Liam's features, but his silhouette remained achingly perfect against the dim light. Her heart clenched as tightly as her fists. "If you return to Solterra now, you might never come back to Aldenria. Are you really leaving without a second thought?" Liam's voice was heavy with unspoken pain.

Evelyn's throat tightened.

She couldn't bear the thought of leaving Archibald and Margaret, but the idea of losing Liam was unbearable.

At least with her grandparents, she could still visit during holidays. They could even come to Solterra.

But Liam?

Once she stepped onto that plane, they would become strangers. He would vanish from her life completely.

Three years ago, this separation might have hurt, but not like this.

Those three lost years had bound her heart to his irrevocably.

Now, the pain was suffocating.

Torn between her life's work and the man she loved, she chose science—but it felt like her heart was being ripped in two. Silent tears traced paths down her cheeks.

Liam caught the glimmer of them in the moonlight. He cradled her face, thumbs brushing away the wetness. "Are these tears for your grandparents... or for Donovan?"

Evelyn bowed her head, shoulders trembling. The grief was too raw to question why he kept mentioning Donovan now.

"Cassandra," Liam murmured, voice rough. "If you stay in Aldenria, the government can negotiate with Solterra. We'll handle your contracts, patents—everything. We'll fight to get your projects back."

Evelyn shook her head, voice breaking. "It's not just one project. There are over twenty unfinished."

Liam stiffened.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Liam, I abandoned more than a dozen when I disappeared. The hydronium research is the most critical—and the most complex."

She gently pushed his hands away and stepped back. "I can't stay."

The sea breeze tangled in her hair but sliced through Liam's chest. He stared at her, but the darkness hid her expression.

His own eyes burned, but he forced a smile. "It's getting late."

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain—"Liam, I—"

He cut her off. "Don't feel guilty. Just give me your answer, and I'll report to President Pierce."

Her heart shattered.

"I respect your decision." Liam turned away. "Come on. I'll take you home."

The car ride was silent. Both lost in their thoughts, staring out opposite windows.

When they reached Wright Manor, Evelyn stepped out. The car sped off before she could even shut the door. She lifted a hand in farewell, but the words died on her lips.

What was the point?

Liam had done what he could. No long speeches, no desperate pleas.

He knew.

Nothing would ever make Evelyn choose him over her life's work—over hydronium, over Solterra, over her career.

And true to his word, he never contacted her again.

In the following days, Evelyn poured herself into time with Archibald and Margaret, burying her longing for Liam deep.

She braced for the emptiness ahead.

No calls. No meetings. Just... forgetting.

A month later, morning sunlight spilled into the room as Rosalind packed her suitcase. Evelyn and Rosalind Fairchild sat on the edge of the bed.

"Will I see you again?" Rosalind asked softly.

Evelyn nodded. "Yes. I'll be reachable a month before and after Christmas. You can always visit me in Solterra."
###Chapter 366

Rosalind lowered her head with a bittersweet smile. "I'll never be able to afford plane tickets to visit you."

Cassandra reached for her hand. "I'll cover all your travel expenses."

Shaking her head, Rosalind pulled away. "I still owe you more than four hundred thousand. After you're gone, I'll keep working to pay you back."

Cassandra's eyes softened with compassion. "Rosalind, forget about the debt."

"That wouldn't be right." Rosalind squared her shoulders. "I know you're the heiress of Wright Manor and money means nothing to you. But for someone like me, dignity is everything. Our friendship can only exist between equals."

A sigh escaped Cassandra's lips. "I just hate seeing you struggle."

Rosalind's face brightened. "You've already changed my life. Getting me that position at Dawson Industries when I barely graduated vocational school? I'm making ten thousand a month now - more than I ever dreamed possible."

"Your future will only get brighter," Cassandra murmured, pulling Rosalind into a gentle embrace.

Leaning into the hug, Rosalind closed her eyes. "Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me."

When they parted, Rosalind asked, "What time's your flight?"

"Tomorrow at dawn."

"I'll come see you off."

Cassandra shook her head. "It's too early. Get your rest. I'll message you when I arrive."

Her expression turned solemn. "I won't be reachable for about ten months once my assignment begins. If you hear from me, it means I'm on leave."

"I'll be waiting," Rosalind promised with a smile.

Cassandra hesitated, struggling with unspoken words. Rosalind noticed the tension. "What's wrong? Is there something else?"

Forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes, Cassandra blinked back tears. "Rosalind... could you be friends with Liam?"

Rosalind's eyebrows shot up. "General Blackwood? A military commander befriending a nobody like me? You're giving me too much credit."

"But I introduced you months ago. You even have his contact information."

"Cassandra, be realistic. Why would someone like him have any interest in me?"

Cassandra gripped Rosalind's hands tighter. "He may seem stern, but he's actually kind and respectful. A truly good man."

"That's how you see him because you're special to him." Rosalind chuckled. "The rest of us see the Ice General of Aldenria."

Cassandra's voice grew urgent as she stroked Rosalind's hand. "Just... stay in touch with him. Not as lovers, just as—"

"You want me to keep you updated about him after you leave?" Rosalind guessed.

Cassandra bit her lip. "Would you?"

"Why not contact him yourself? Even if romance is off the table, friendship is still possible."

Cassandra looked away, unable to meet Rosalind's questioning gaze. The unshed tears glistening in her eyes spoke volumes. Changing the subject abruptly, she asked, "Rosalind, what matters most to you in life?"

"Money," came the instant reply. "Money solves everything."

Cassandra turned to where Rosalind Baskins was packing. "What about you, Rosalind?"

Snapping her suitcase shut, the bodyguard declared, "You matter most in my life, Ms. Wright."

Warmth flooded Cassandra's chest, though she scoffed. "Don't be ridiculous."

Rosalind Baskins knelt before her, taking both her hands. "I mean every word. I'll never forget what you've done for me."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I was left to die in that collapsed mine shaft. You pulled me out, helped me get justice, and gave me this new life."

Cassandra gently stroked her hair. "The military would have rescued you eventually."
###Chapter 367

Evelyn's lips curved into a soft smile. "You didn't just save my life, Rosalind. You're the only family I have left."

Across the table, Rosalind Fairchild studied Evelyn with complex emotions swirling in her gaze before shifting her attention to Cassandra Wright's face. She marveled at how someone with such genuine kindness could exist in this world.

Born into the prestigious Wright family, Cassandra could have lived a life of luxury. Yet she chose to work in Solterra's research facilities. Her compassionate nature couldn't tolerate seeing others suffer - she'd rescued Evelyn from certain death and loaned Rosalind a substantial sum during her darkest days.

Cassandra frequently hosted live-streamed art sessions to raise funds for charity, donating generously from her personal fortune.

"Cassandra," Rosalind asked curiously, "what matters most to you in life?"

Liam Blackwood's face immediately flashed through Cassandra's mind.

"Her work," Evelyn interjected before Cassandra could respond.

Rosalind pressed further. "I've always wondered - what exactly does Cassandra do for work?"

Evelyn simply smiled knowingly.

"I'm just an ordinary mechanical engineer," Cassandra answered modestly.

"What kind of machines? What are they used for?" Rosalind persisted.

Cassandra deftly changed the subject. "Let's not bore you with work talk. Tell me more about your-"

A ringing phone interrupted them. Both women turned to Evelyn, who answered with brief exchanges before extending the device to Cassandra. "It's Colonel Sullivan - General Blackwood's aide. He's asking for you."

"Who?" Cassandra's body tensed immediately.

"Ryan."

Any mention of Liam or his affairs made Cassandra's pulse race. Her reluctance to leave grew stronger, yet with her scheduled return to Solterra tomorrow, she didn't want to complicate matters further.

Her decision was firm. "Tell him I won't be seeing Liam anymore."

Evelyn's expression turned grave, her outstretched hand freezing mid-air. "Cassandra, at least hear what he has to say. Don't live with regrets."

The intensity in Evelyn's demeanor unsettled Cassandra. She took the phone with trembling fingers. "Ryan? What is it?"

"Ms. Wright," Ryan's voice carried unmistakable grief. "I know you're leaving Aldenria tomorrow. General Blackwood ordered me not to tell you so you could return peacefully, but I must."

Ryan's tone sent chills down Cassandra's spine. "Tell me. What's happened?"

"It's General Blackwood," Ryan blurted out, his voice breaking. "He's in serious trouble."

Cassandra's heart stuttered as an invisible weight crushed her chest, stealing her breath. "What's happened to Liam?"

Ryan explained mournfully, "Two weeks ago, Obsidian Circle kidnapped two researchers from our chemical division. Last time, we contained the hydronium explosion quickly."

"They suspect you're part of our research team, so they took our scientists. General Blackwood sent negotiators, but..." Ryan's voice cracked. "They were all executed."

"Obsidian Circle demanded General Blackwood negotiate alone, or they'd kill the researchers and target more Aldenrian scientists. He had no choice but to-"

"Where is Liam now?" Cassandra's voice rose in panic.

"General Blackwood's been missing five days. All tracking signals are dead. We've lost all contact." Ryan's voice choked with emotion. "I fear he may have..."

Tears streamed down Cassandra's face as her throat constricted and the room spun. "No! Liam has to be alive! He must be!"

"I'm sorry, Ms. Wright. General Blackwood-"

"Enough!" Cassandra shouted through her tears, abruptly ending the call. Wiping her face, she turned to Evelyn with newfound determination. "Cancel my flight. Find me everything on Obsidian Circle's location. I'm bringing Liam home."
###Chapter 368

The next morning, Evelyn found Ryan Sullivan extracting prisoners from the high-security facility.

Her heart pounded as she learned the Obsidian Circle had demanded Aldenria exchange Julian Whitmore for their two captured researchers. Julian's life meant nothing compared to the value of those scientists.

At the prison gates, Julian was led away in shackles, a black hood covering his head as armed guards shoved him into an armored vehicle. Evelyn grabbed Ryan's arm urgently. "Where's Liam? Any news?"

Ryan's expression darkened. "Ms. Wright, General Blackwood has been missing for six days now."

"Did Obsidian Circle take him?" Her fingers trembled violently as tears threatened to spill.

"They're only admitting to kidnapping the researchers. This trade is solely for Julian." Ryan glanced around before lowering his voice. "The original rescue squad was ambushed. So General Blackwood led a covert team himself."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "How many went with him?"

"A dozen elite operatives. Adrian Castillo joined them."

"That makes no sense!" Evelyn's voice cracked. "When Dominic sold me to the border traffickers, Liam mobilized an entire battalion with air support!"

Ryan shook his head grimly. "Different situation, Ms. Wright. That was within our borders. Obsidian Circle's base is in Valtoria - foreign soil. Any military incursion would trigger their missile defenses."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. She clutched Ryan's sleeve desperately. "Let me go after him."

"Absolutely not." Ryan pulled away sharply.

Evelyn blocked his path. "I'm begging you, Ryan."

He rubbed his temples in frustration. "You're not trained for combat. How exactly would you rescue a Special Forces commander? You'd just become another liability."

"But—"

"I only told you this because I need you to stay here and wait." Ryan's voice softened. "If...if the General doesn't make it back, at least you'll have the chance to—"

The word "dead" struck Evelyn like a physical blow. A sharp pain radiated through her chest as silent tears traced down her cheeks.

As Ryan departed with the prison convoy, Evelyn numbly approached Rosalind Baskins' waiting car.

"Any news?" Rosalind asked urgently as Evelyn slid inside.

"Nothing." Evelyn stared blankly ahead as the car accelerated. After a long silence, she whispered with sudden conviction, "He's at Obsidian Circle's base. I know it. And he's still alive."

Rosalind's grip tightened on the wheel. "Evelyn, I won't let you risk your life on some suicide mission."

Evelyn leaned back, closing her eyes. Her mind raced with rescue plans.

Days later in Aldenria, news arrived that the researchers had been safely exchanged - but with no word of Liam. Obsidian Circle had taken Julian but left Evelyn behind, proving Julian's importance to their organization.

Despite Rosalind and Ryan's vehement protests, Evelyn quietly purchased a one-way ticket to Valtoria. She would find Liam Blackwood or die trying.
###Chapter 369

Valtoria, often dubbed the "Raging Beast" of the world, was a small yet formidable military power. Ruthless and relentless, they pursued their ambitions without hesitation—whether it was wealth, resources, or territory.

On the fringes of Valtoria lay Shadowmire Island, home to thousands of operatives. These were elite spies from various nations, trained by the infamous Obsidian Circle.

Though shrouded in secrecy, the Obsidian Circle was backed by the Valtorian government.

The sunset over Shadowmire was breathtaking. As the speedboat docked, two armed men escorted Evelyn Carter ashore. Moments later, the boat vanished into the horizon. Blindfolded, Evelyn followed obediently.

After traversing a stretch of beach, she was loaded into a sightseeing vehicle for a ten-minute ride. Only then was her blindfold removed.

She found herself inside a vast, ornately decorated house, its design reflecting Valtoria’s rich cultural heritage.

Rubbing her eyes, she scanned the room. Four armed guards stood at each corner, their cold stares piercing through her.

Victor Holloway, leader of the Obsidian Circle, lounged on a bed before her. A stocky man in his sixties, he exuded an air of casual menace.

A lavish spread of food and wine lay before him. He took a slow sip, chewing on a piece of spiced jerky before finally addressing her. "Where did you get this?"

Evelyn had handed over a small sample of hydronium to gain their attention. Now, she met his gaze with icy resolve. "I want to see Liam. Not a word until I do."

Victor remained unfazed, leisurely enjoying his meal as if she weren’t there. "I don’t know him. Never met the man."

"Then I have nothing to say," Evelyn retorted, chin lifted in defiance.

"Aren’t you afraid of dying?" Victor smirked.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "I didn’t come here expecting to leave alive. Bring Liam if you want Cassandra Wright’s location. That’s my only condition."

"I told you—I don’t know him." Victor slammed down his jerky, his glare turning glacial.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Her legs trembled, her back slick with sweat.

Raised in sheltered academia, she had never faced such danger. Terror clawed at her, but she refused to buckle.

Clenching her fists, she pressed on. "Don’t you want the hydronium? Don’t you want Cassandra?"

Victor’s expression twisted. "Do you want to die right now?"

Silence. Evelyn held his gaze, unflinching. This was the boldest gamble of her life. Even if she died here today without seeing Liam, she wouldn’t regret it.

Victor’s anger slowly melted into amusement. He leaned forward, voice dripping with mockery. "We’ve captured two Aldenrian researchers. Killed their soldiers who infiltrated us. But it was all to save Julian."

"As for Liam Blackwood—he’s Aldenria’s top general. Capturing him would mean war. Do you think we’re that reckless?"

Evelyn’s eyes hardened. "You may not have the guts to admit what you’ve done, but your dirty dealings are undeniable."
###Chapter 370

Victor Holloway's laughter echoed through the chamber, his aged frame shaking with mirth. The sound was abruptly cut off when the doors swung open to reveal a sharply dressed newcomer.

Julian Prescott moved with calculated grace, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. His piercing gaze immediately locked onto Evelyn.

With a practiced smile, he approached. "Julian Prescott," he introduced smoothly. "Vice Commander of Obsidian Circle. Given Mr. Holloway's... declining condition, you'll be dealing with me now."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her bag strap. "I came to trade information about Cassandra Wright for Liam. Release him, and I'll give you everything - including the location of forty hydronium canisters."

"Agreed," Julian nodded, his smile never reaching his eyes.

Victor's face purpled with rage. He snatched a crystal decanter and hurled it at Julian, who sidestepped effortlessly. "You treacherous snake!" Victor roared. "How dare you move against the Blackwood heir without my knowledge!"

Julian calmly retrieved the unbroken decanter, placing it back on the side table with deliberate care. "Mr. Holloway, age has made you weak. Your hesitation will be our downfall. It's time for new leadership."

Victor trembled violently, veins bulging at his temples. His furious glare met Julian's composed expression in stark contrast.

To Evelyn, Julian's calm demeanor was far more terrifying than Victor's outburst. True monsters always wore masks.

After a charged silence, Victor spat, "Are you trying to destroy Obsidian Circle by provoking the Blackwoods?"

Julian's lips curled. "Should I fear a corpse?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "What did you do to Liam?" Her voice cracked with barely contained panic.

Julian's eyebrows lifted slightly. "Remarkable. Facing death yet still bargaining. You must be holding something truly valuable."

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision. "Where is he? Let me see him now!"

"Bring him up from the cistern," Julian ordered his men.

Evelyn's heart pounded against her ribs. Victor appeared diminished now - an aging lion usurped by a younger predator. No wonder he hadn't known about Liam's capture.

The doors crashed open. Two guards dragged in a soaking wet figure and dumped him unceremoniously on the floor.

Evelyn's world tilted. The broken man lying in a spreading pool of water and blood barely resembled the proud soldier she knew. She fell to her knees, trembling hands cradling Liam's battered face.

Tears splashed onto his waxen skin as she choked out his name. "Liam... Liam, look at me. It's Cassandra. I'm here to take you home." Her voice broke. "Open your eyes, please!"

No response. His skin felt like ice beneath her fingertips. She pressed her ear to his lips - no breath warmed her cheek.

A sob tore from her throat. "Liam! Wake up! Don't do this to me!" She shook him gently, then more desperately when he remained limp.

Julian's voice cut through her anguish. "I delivered my part of the bargain. Now - where is Cassandra Wright?"
###Chapter 371

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face, her expression twisted in agony and fury as she glared up at Julian. "Why did you take his life? Tell me why!"

Julian merely smirked, his voice dripping with arrogance. "I eliminate whoever I please. No explanations needed."

Evelyn's sobs suddenly transformed into hysterical laughter. Each salty tear that touched her lips carried the bitter taste of despair.

Collapsed on the cold ground, she cradled Liam's lifeless form, her arms supporting his head as she pressed her cheek against his chilling skin. Silent tears rained down onto his pale face.

No more screams. No more protests.

Just endless trembling as she clung to him, her body shaking violently while tears continued their relentless descent.

Taking a shuddering breath, she whispered through her raw throat, "Liam's gone. You'll never get hydronium now. You'll never find Cassandra either. Just kill me and be done with it."

"Where is Cassandra?" Julian demanded, his voice sharp with anger.

Evelyn tightened her embrace around Liam. For the first time, she understood the soul-crushing pain of losing someone irreplaceable.

The agony ran so deep that living seemed impossible. The world had lost all meaning.

"Kill me," she repeated, her voice breaking with desperation.

Julian strode forward, grabbing Evelyn's collar and yanking her upright. His icy gaze bore into hers. "Do you really think I'd grant you that mercy?"

Evelyn trembled violently, her eyes swollen and red. In a sudden burst of defiance, she provoked him deliberately. "Do it! Shoot me, you coward! You're nothing but scum, trash! A true monster would finish what he started!"

The taunt hit its mark. Julian immediately drew his pistol, pressing the cold barrel against Evelyn's forehead.

An odd sense of peace washed over her. Without flinching, she closed her eyes slowly. Her only wish now was to reunite with Liam in death, to find their parents together in whatever came after.

"I'm sorry, Liam," she whispered through fresh tears. "Wait for me, please."

She braced for the gunshot, her heart aching with unbearable pain yet yearning for the release it would bring.

"No!" A frantic shout shattered the moment.

Evelyn felt the gun being knocked away from her head. A familiar voice, laced with panic, pleaded, "Don't do this!"

Blinking through tears, Evelyn saw Julian standing before her.

He wrestled Julian's gun away, shoving Evelyn aside with surprising force. "Mr. Prescott, I beg you, spare her life."

Julian sneered at Evelyn. "No one insults me and lives to tell about it. She's made her choice."

Julian's gaze darted between Liam's motionless form and Evelyn's broken expression. He understood - if Liam died, Evelyn wouldn't survive either.

"Cassandra, stop provoking him," Julian urged desperately before dropping to check Liam's pulse. Finding the faintest flutter, he immediately began chest compressions.

Hope flared in Evelyn's chest. She scrambled to Liam's side without interfering with Julian's efforts. Gently grasping Liam's hand, she rubbed warmth into his cold fingers.

Holding her breath, Evelyn watched Liam's ashen face, her shimmering tears reflecting in the dim light.

In her heart, she made a silent vow: "Liam, if you survive this, I'll do anything. Anything at all."
###Chapter 372

A thin sliver of sunlight crept through the barred window of the cramped cell.

Evelyn Carter sat slumped at the edge of the narrow cot, her fingers tightly entwined with Liam Blackwood's limp hand. Exhaustion had finally claimed her, pulling her into a restless sleep.

The golden light painted her delicate features, casting a fragile warmth around her motionless form.

Liam's eyelids fluttered open, his body aching with every shallow breath. His gaze traveled across the cracked ceiling before taking in their bleak surroundings. A bitter taste filled his mouth. After cheating death itself, he'd been dragged back to this hellish prison.

Then he felt it - the gentle pressure of Evelyn's hand clutching his. His entire body tensed when he saw her curled beside him. This was his worst nightmare come true. He'd rather die a thousand deaths than have her trapped in the Obsidian Circle's stronghold.

With a pained groan, Liam tried to sit up, praying this was just another fever dream.

The movement startled Evelyn awake. Her eyes widened when she saw him conscious. "Liam!" She scrambled up, pressing a cool hand to his forehead. "Thank God you're awake."

Reality crashed over him. His fingers closed around her wrist like a vice. "What the hell are you doing here?" His voice came out rougher than intended.

Evelyn ignored his question, concern etching her features. "You've been out for two days. How are you feeling?"

Every muscle screamed in protest as Liam forced himself upright. "Answer me, Evelyn. Why are you here?"

She bit her lip, hesitation flashing across her face.

A storm of emotions raged within Liam - anger, fear, and overwhelming protectiveness. The thought of Evelyn in the lion's den made his blood run cold. "Have you lost your damn mind?" he roared.

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes at his outburst. The raw fury in his voice shook her to the core.

"Yes!" she fired back, her voice breaking. "I lost it when I thought you were dying! If I hadn't come, you'd be dead right now!"

Liam's chest heaved with ragged breaths. "I'd rather be dead than have you risk your life for me."

The words hung between them like a physical blow. Evelyn's tears spilled over as she released his hand and turned toward the heavy iron door.

But escape wasn't an option. Guards stood watch outside. She could only press her forehead against the cold metal, silently wiping her cheeks.

She understood his anger stemmed from fear for her safety. Yet the harsh words still cut deep.

A sudden thud shattered the tense silence. Evelyn whirled around to see Liam collapsing onto the concrete floor.

All anger forgotten, she rushed back to his side. "Liam!"

As she reached for him, strong arms yanked her into a crushing embrace. Liam buried his face in the crook of her neck, his entire body trembling.

"Nate?" she whispered, using his childhood nickname.

"I'm sorry," he choked out, his voice raw with emotion. "God, I'm so sorry, Cass." The pet name slipped out unbidden, his arms tightening around her.

Evelyn stroked his back soothingly. "It's okay," she murmured. The fight drained from her as quickly as it had come.

She helped him back onto the cot, tucking the thin blanket around his shaking form.

When they'd both calmed, Liam fixed her with an intense stare. "How did you even get in here? Are you alone?"

Evelyn nodded. "I told them I had information about Cassandra Wright's whereabouts... and offered them a sample of hydronium as proof."
###Chapter 373

"This isn't a place you should have come to." Liam's face darkened with concern.

Evelyn gave him a soft smile, her lips curving gently. "But I'm glad I did."

His stern gaze softened as it lingered on her face, worry churning in his chest.

"How did they capture you?" she asked, tilting her head curiously.

A bitter laugh escaped Liam's lips as he closed his eyes briefly. "Adrian betrayed me. They bought him."

Evelyn's breath caught. She'd suspected but never wanted to believe it. The revelation left her momentarily speechless.

She couldn't imagine the pain of being betrayed by someone he'd trusted implicitly. To be handed over to enemies by his own man.

Without thinking, she leaned into Liam's embrace, pressing her cheek against his bandaged chest. Her hands came up to gently stroke his shoulders, offering silent comfort.

The sudden contact froze Liam completely. Shock gave way to overwhelming joy - this was the first time Evelyn had initiated physical affection between them.

His hand hovered uncertainly before lightly settling on her back. But before he could pull her closer, Evelyn suddenly straightened up, eyes alight with determination. "Liam, we can't just wait here to die. We need an escape plan."

Still dazed from the unexpected embrace, Liam could only nod in agreement.

She carefully adjusted his blankets, murmuring, "I'll distract them. You focus on recovering your strength first." Her fingers brushed his shoulder reassuringly. "Then we'll make our move."

Liam's sharp eyes swept their prison cell. Aside from the narrow bed, a small cabinet, and a partitioned bathroom area, the space was barren.

"You've been here with me for two days?" he asked suddenly.

Evelyn nodded, tucking a stray hair behind her ear.

His frown deepened. "Where have you been sleeping?"

She patted the edge of the thin mattress. "Right here."

Liam's expression darkened further as he struggled to sit up.

Evelyn immediately pressed a firm hand to his shoulder. "What are you doing?"

"You need proper rest," he insisted, voice rough with concern.

"You're the injured one," she countered, pushing him back down. "You need the bed more."

"These wounds are nothing," Liam grunted, throwing the covers aside. "You haven't slept properly in days."

"Liam, stay down." Evelyn pushed him back with surprising strength and readjusted the blankets.

He resisted, face tight with worry, attempting to rise again.

With a quiet sigh, Evelyn settled onto the edge of the bed, stretching out beside him and curling into his side.

Liam's entire body went rigid, his breath catching. One arm remained suspended awkwardly in the air, unsure where to land.

Gently, she guided his arm down, keeping her face turned away to hide her blush. "If you don't mind... I'll sleep here," she whispered.

Liam swallowed hard, his breathing uneven. When he spoke, his voice was barely audible. "I don't mind at all."

Evelyn buried her face against his chest, avoiding his gaze. "Tell me if I hurt your injuries."

"Okay," he murmured. "Now sleep."

Her unexpected initiative left him reeling. Was it their dire circumstances that had lowered her barriers? It had been so long since she'd willingly been this close to him.

A small, contented smile touched Liam's lips as he carefully adjusted his hold, drawing her closer. Closing his eyes, he allowed himself this rare moment of peace.

True to his resilient nature, Liam's condition improved dramatically after proper rest. His injuries seemed trivial to a man of his endurance.

Morning light found them still entwined, Evelyn safely cradled in Liam's arms.

Their moment shattered when armed guards arrived, roughly separating them to take Evelyn away. When they finally returned her to the cell, Liam immediately seized her shoulders, scanning every inch of her for signs of harm.

Evelyn offered him a reassuring smile. "I'm fine, really." Her fingers brushed his wrist gently. "Everything's going to be okay."
###Chapter 374

Liam's voice was sharp with urgency. "Where did they take you? What did they do?"

Evelyn moved closer, her hand shielding their conversation from prying ears. Her whisper was barely audible. "I struck a deal with them. I promised to reveal hydronium's location if they spared your life."

Liam's expression darkened instantly. "You told them?"

She nodded, brows knitting in confusion. "What's wrong?"

"If they find hydronium, your identity will be exposed." His words were laced with barely contained panic.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Yes. Only Cassandra Wright knows its exact coordinates. Once they retrieve it, they'll know who I really am."

"Did you lie to them?"

"No," she admitted. "I told them it's secured in a high-security facility in Solterra. It won't be easy to obtain."

Liam released her abruptly, fingers raking through his hair in agitation. His mind raced with restless thoughts.

Evelyn reached for his hand, her touch feather-light. "Liam, if I hadn't cooperated, neither of us would be alive. This is our only chance to get you back to Aldenria safely."

A sharp pang twisted in his chest. Without hesitation, he growled, "I'm not leaving you behind."

"We leave tomorrow," she murmured.

Closing the distance, Evelyn pressed her palm against his chest. The unexpected contact made Liam stiffen, his pulse accelerating beneath her fingertips.

"Are your injuries healed?" Her voice was soft, almost tender.

A faint smile tugged at his lips. She could have just asked, but she chose to check for herself.

Gently, he caught her wrist and guided it away, his voice rough. "Yes."

"Do you have a plan?"

Liam scanned their surroundings. "I need a weapon. Tomorrow, arrange a meeting with Julian Prescott. Find an excuse to bring me along."

"You're using him as leverage?"

"Yes," he confirmed, his resolve unshakable.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why not Victor Holloway?"

"Victor's influence is long gone," Liam muttered, rummaging through the cupboard. "If he still had power, he wouldn’t have dared lay a finger on me."

She sighed. "Julian is ruthless."

Liam picked up a toothbrush, turning it over in his hands, contemplating how to sharpen it quickly.

"Liam, are you sure about this?" Worry threaded her voice.

His jaw tightened. "Whether we succeed or fail, I won’t let you suffer here alone."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Liam!"

Anticipating her protest, he cut in firmly, "I’d rather die than surrender."

"Fine." She stepped closer, hands settling on his shoulders as she rose onto her toes, lips brushing his ear.

The contact sent an electric jolt through him. His body tensed, heart hammering as he instinctively leaned back.

But Evelyn hooked a hand behind his neck, pulling him closer. Under her relentless proximity, his thoughts blurred. Her warm breath teased his skin, igniting a fire in his veins.

Then, in a whisper barely louder than a sigh, she murmured, "I have a gun."

Liam froze, locking eyes with her in disbelief. It sounded impossible—absurd, even.

How could she have smuggled a weapon into this heavily guarded cell?

Evelyn took his hand and led him into the bathroom.

She positioned him by the door, her voice low. "Keep watch."
###Chapter 375

Evelyn gracefully pulled the ornate hairpin from her dark tresses. Instantly, her silken locks cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall of midnight, framing her face with ethereal beauty.

Liam found himself utterly transfixed. His gaze drank in her radiance, completely unaware of the concealed weapon in her hand.

Noticing his captivation, Evelyn twirled the hairpin between her fingers. "Liam, look closely."

Puzzled, he examined it. "It appears to be an ordinary jade hairpin - slightly thicker than usual, with a hollow core."

A mysterious smile played on Evelyn's lips as she bent to retrieve translucent beads from her shoe's hidden compartment. Placing them in Liam's palm, she murmured, "Bulletproof ceramic beads - harder than sapphires. My own design."

Liam studied the beads, his admiration for Evelyn's ingenuity growing with each revelation.

Turning slightly away, Evelyn discreetly retrieved a miniature spring from her corset. Respecting her modesty, Liam averted his gaze as she adjusted her bodice.

Within moments, she had produced an array of minuscule weapon components from various concealed locations on her person. With practiced efficiency, she handed them to Liam before assembling the pieces with surgical precision.

Liam watched, mesmerized, his eyes shifting between her delicate hands and the intense concentration on her exquisite face. She shone like the rarest celestial body - breathtaking yet untouchable.

When complete, Evelyn presented the assembled weapon. It resembled an elegant fountain pen, complete with decorative tassel and discreet activation button.

Liam whispered in awe, "I've never encountered a firearm like this. Your creation?"

Evelyn nodded. "Specifically designed for covert operations. The materials evade all known detection methods. Compact, lightweight, and utterly concealable."

She handed him the weapon before gathering her hair into an elaborate updo, securing it with the pen-gun.

Liam's brow furrowed. "What if it discharges accidentally?"

"Impossible," she assured him. "The safety mechanism is foolproof despite its size."

Liam responded with a warm smile, his gaze burning with intensity. In that moment, all reservations evaporated.

A woman of Evelyn's caliber belonged to no man or nation - she was a force unto herself. Destined to blaze her own trail across the heavens, creating miracles. Whatever nation benefited from her brilliance would be fortunate indeed.

Evelyn took Liam's hand, her voice barely audible. "Tomorrow I eliminate Victor, then take Julian hostage."

Liam's curiosity sparked. "Why risk confronting Victor first?"

Evelyn gestured to the hairpin weapon, leaning closer. "If I aimed this at you, would you suspect it's lethal?"

"To send a message. Understood," Liam replied, his Adam's apple bobbing as he gently created distance between them. Her proximity was becoming dangerously distracting.

Evelyn noticed his withdrawal immediately.

Her brow furrowed with suspicion as she challenged, "Liam, didn't you once claim to adore me?"

The question caught Liam completely off guard, his eyes widening with startled confusion.
###Chapter 376

Evelyn found Liam's response disheartening. A shadow of dissatisfaction crossed her delicate features. It seemed he was deliberately avoiding the truth.

Meanwhile, Liam remained deep in thought, his piercing blue eyes focused on some distant point.

Evelyn changed the subject abruptly. "Liam, if we escape from this place, what are your plans?" Her voice held a note of curiosity.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, Liam answered casually, "I intend to dismantle the Obsidian Circle."

"This is Valtoria, not Aldenria," Evelyn reminded him, settling beside him until their shoulders touched. "How do you plan to destroy such a powerful organization here?"

"By eliminating their leadership. Without heads, the body will collapse," Liam explained matter-of-factly.

"Brilliant. Count me in." Evelyn's lips curved into a warm smile.

Liam glanced at her, confusion flickering in his gaze. He couldn't comprehend her statement. After their escape, Evelyn would return to Solterra.

Under Liam's intense scrutiny, Evelyn felt a blush creeping up her neck. Gently, she took his large hand and placed it on her lap, caressing it tenderly.

Liam stiffened slightly, watching her actions with growing bewilderment.

His pulse quickened as he observed her delicate fingers tracing patterns on his skin. Even during their brief marriage, she had never shown such affection.

Evelyn continued stroking his hand, her voice soft but firm. "We will get out of this place safely, Liam. I believe in you."

Liam slowly withdrew his hand. "This behavior might give me the wrong impression."

Evelyn paused as Liam pulled away, a bittersweet expression crossing her face. She couldn't suppress a small smile.

A straightforward man like him needed clear words to understand her feelings.

Blushing, Evelyn remained silent, letting the moment pass.

They then turned to more detailed planning, preparing for any contingencies. Evelyn felt an unusual calm settle over her.

No matter the outcome, as long as she remained Evelyn Carter, she held the power to ensure Liam's safe return to Aldenria.

Deep in the night, they received an unexpected summons from Victor Holloway - an opportunity presenting itself without their seeking.

Entering the opulent meeting hall bathed in golden light, they found themselves amidst a crowd. Among the attendees stood Adrian Castillo and Julian Whitmore, an unexpected sight that piqued their curiosity.

On the central table rested a familiar high-tech container, its presence instantly darkening Evelyn's expression.

Noticing her tension, Liam leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "What's wrong? Are you unwell?"

With a subtle nod, Evelyn gestured toward the container. Liam followed her gaze.

"What is it?" he whispered.

"Forty-eight vials of hydronium," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely audible. "I never imagined they'd acquire it so quickly from Solterra's heavily guarded research facility."

Liam considered this revelation. "Could there be Solterran spies among them?"

Evelyn's expression soured as realization dawned.

Meanwhile, Julian Prescott lounged with crossed legs, his sharp gaze fixed on Evelyn. After a deliberate pause, he demanded, "What are you two whispering about?"

Confused by the Valtorian language, Liam frowned at the question.

Evelyn offered a practiced smile. "Congratulations on securing the hydronium so swiftly."

Julian pointed at the container, skepticism evident. "Is this truly hydronium? We couldn't open it. That's why we brought you here - to verify its contents."

Evelyn's smile faltered. She had assumed the contents had been verified already.

Julian's gaze hardened. "Well? Can you open it or not?"
###Chapter 377

"Thank the stars you didn't open it," Evelyn said with chilling calmness. "This substance reacts violently even with oxygen exposure. Had you lifted that lid, this entire facility would've been reduced to rubble."

"Sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel," Julian Prescott remarked, his fingers hovering over the transparent container holding forty-eight vials of hydronium. The substance shimmered like liquid crystal.

"It requires specialized containment," Evelyn warned. "Remember the Aldenria border explosion? That massive crater and the toxic purple fog that poisoned an entire province?"

Victor Holloway's face darkened as his gaze shifted between Adrian Castillo and Julian Whitmore.

Adrian gave a grim nod, confirming her claim.

Evelyn shot Adrian a look of pure disgust. Once she'd considered him honorable, even trusted him. Now the sight of him turned her stomach.

She stole a glance at Liam Blackwood's expression. His face remained an unreadable mask. Was he restraining himself from tearing Adrian apart right now?

Victor suddenly sat upright on the medical bed, crossing his legs with predatory grace. "Who exactly are you?"

"I'm Cassandra Wright." Evelyn gestured toward Julian Whitmore. "His so-called niece, though we share no blood relation."

A slow smirk spread across Victor's face. "You're Evelyn Carter."

The room erupted in gasps. Every eye locked onto her with a mixture of shock and dawning horror.

Liam leaned down, his whisper brushing her ear. "Why that reaction? What did he say?" Evelyn pressed closer, murmuring back, "He knows my true identity."

Liam didn't seem surprised. With the hydronium exposed, her cover was blown.

Julian Whitmore took two staggering steps forward. "You're really Evelyn Carter?" Evelyn answered with nothing but icy silence.

Julian Prescott's laughter rang out, rich with triumph. "How delightful - the legendary Evelyn Carter waltzing right into our trap like a lamb to slaughter."

Evelyn's voice cut like a blade. "Find this amusing? My answer remains unchanged. No force on earth can make me comply against my will."

Julian Prescott drew his pistol, inspecting the barrel with theatrical care. "Once we have you, your consent becomes irrelevant. Refuse, and I'll put a bullet through his skull."

As the gun swung toward Liam, Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed - but she refused to show fear.

With calculated indifference, she shrugged. "Kill him if you wish. If you want my cooperation, you'll return my parents first."

Victor turned to Julian Prescott. "Who are her parents?"

After a beat of hesitation, Julian Prescott jerked his chin at Julian Whitmore. "Where are they?"

Julian Whitmore's face went ashen. Their original plan had been simple - use Evelyn's family as leverage to plant Victoria Dawson in Liam's inner circle.

Julian Prescott pressed the gun into Julian Whitmore's shoulder. "I asked you a question. Where. Are. They?"

A whisper: "Dead."

Evelyn staggered as if struck. "Liar! Their graves were empty!"

"Empty because we dumped their bodies at sea after they'd served their purpose."

The world tilted. Evelyn's knees buckled as hot tears spilled down her cheeks. Liam caught her, crushing her against his chest.

Burrowing into his embrace, she sobbed in her native tongue, "They're lying! My parents can't be dead! They can't!"
###Chapter 378

Liam couldn't stand seeing Evelyn's pain. He pulled her into a fierce embrace, whispering comforting words against her ear. "Cassandra, you need to stay strong."

Evelyn buried her face in Liam's chest, her body shaking with violent sobs. "Liam, that monster murdered my parents."

His lips brushed her temple as he murmured, "You must be strong now. Justice will be served."

She gave a determined nod, tears still streaming down her face. "Alright."

"Are you ready?" Liam cradled the back of her head gently, drawing her so close their bodies melded together, confusing the armed men surrounding them.

Evelyn nodded again. In one fluid motion, Liam plucked the decorative hairpin from her updo and fired at Victor Holloway lying on the bed.

The suppressed gunshot was barely audible. Before anyone could react, a perfect crimson dot appeared on the old man's forehead.

Victor's body went rigid, his eyes frozen open in death.

As Julian Prescott realized what happened, he reached for his weapon - only to find Liam aiming the hairpin gun directly between his eyes.

Every gun in the room swung toward the couple.

"Please," Julian begged, sweat beading on his forehead. "Don't kill me."

Liam swiftly disarmed him and handed the weapon to Evelyn.

She accepted it calmly, wiping her tears before pressing the barrel against Julian's temple.

"Release Mr. Prescott," one gunman demanded, "or we'll shoot you both."

Evelyn moved with deliberate grace, retrieving the case containing the Azurium and slipping it into her pocket.

She addressed the room coolly, "Try anything, and I'll use him as my personal shield."

Julian raised his hands, though a smirk played on his lips as he studied the device in Liam's hand.

Never had he encountered such an ingenious weapon - compact yet deadly, disguised as an ordinary hair accessory. No one would suspect its lethal potential.

"How..." Julian's voice shook. "How did you smuggle that in?"

Evelyn stepped closer. "Tell me, do you know Cassandra Wright?"

"We've hunted her for years. Of course we know her," Julian replied.

A humorless laugh escaped her lips. "But do you know her other profession?"

Julian's face drained of color. His throat worked before he rasped, "Systems engineer."

Evelyn hummed in confirmation. Then she gestured to the others. "Arrange a speedboat if you want him alive."

"Move!" Julian barked at his men. "Now!"

His subordinates scrambled to obey.

Julian glanced at Victor's corpse, eyes still wide in shock. The old man had died without even realizing he'd been shot.

"Why kill him but keep me?" Julian asked, genuinely puzzled.

Evelyn's voice remained steady. "If we'd taken him hostage, your men would have killed us all - including him. If we take you, his men would do the same."

"Neither of you would compromise for the other. With him dead, you're in charge. You're the logical hostage."

A cold smile touched her lips as she examined the weapon. "Let me demonstrate the firepower of my little invention."
###Chapter 379

"You truly are Cassandra," Julian Prescott breathed, his shock evident in every syllable.

Cassandra Wright gave a resigned smile. "Victor outsmarts you at every turn. You've got courage but lack strategy, relying solely on brute force."

Julian's eyes darkened, burning with barely contained fury.

His subordinate rushed back with urgent news. "Mr. Prescott, the speedboat is ready."

Cassandra addressed the group calmly. "Don't bother planting explosives. Julian will be leaving this island with us. We'll release him at Valtoria airport."

Hearing this, the subordinate immediately sprinted to disarm the bombs. Liam Blackwood whispered, "Cassie, is everything going according to plan?" Not understanding Valtorian, he could only follow Cassandra's lead as the situation developed.

Security personnel thoroughly searched Julian, confiscating all weapons and devices to neutralize any threats.

"They planned to bomb the speedboat?" Liam sought confirmation.

"Give it a moment. He's disarming the explosives now," Cassandra said, patting Julian's shoulder reassuringly.

She nodded in confirmation.

Soon the subordinate returned, panting heavily. "It's done."

Cassandra and Liam pressed their guns against Julian's temples, escorting him outside.

The island night was eerily quiet, moonlight painting silver trails across their path as they moved toward the docks.

Adrian Castillo and Julian Whitmore, accompanied by armed guards, followed at a distance until they reached the waiting vessel.

Liam turned to Cassandra. "Can you pilot this thing?"

She shook her head. Liam handed her his gun. "No worries. Just shoot if he makes any sudden moves."

Cassandra tensed. Her fingers tightened around the weapon as she aimed it precisely at Julian's head.

As the boat accelerated away from shore, back on land, Adrian suddenly grabbed a subordinate's rifle and took aim at the departing vessel.

Julian Whitmore grabbed his arm, voice shaking. "What are you doing? Mr. Prescott is still on board!"

Adrian roared, "I know Liam Blackwood! The moment they're safe, he'll execute Julian first. Then it'll be our turn!"

Shoving Julian aside, Adrian raised the rifle again.

Julian intervened once more, applying pressure to stop him. "You can kill Julian and Liam, but Cassandra stays unharmed."

With a brutal kick, Adrian sent Julian sprawling. "Your pathetic sentimentality is getting in the way!"

Julian crashed to the ground.

Adrian opened fire, unleashing a hailstorm of bullets toward the speedboat. The deafening gunfire echoed across the water.

"Cassie, get down!" Liam shouted, throwing himself over Cassandra as he guided her to the boat's floor.

The bullets rained down indiscriminately until the magazine emptied with a final click.

Seizing the chaos, Julian Prescott dove overboard.

Cassandra trembled in Liam's protective embrace, her body shaking from the sudden violence. She struggled to steady her breathing.

Frantic, she touched Liam's face. "Liam, are you hurt? Talk to me!"

His breathing was labored, voice rough. "I'm fine. What about you? Any injuries?"

"I'm okay. Who was shooting? They were firing wildly - even at Julian," Cassandra said, still shaken.

"Had to be Adrian."

"Why?"

Liam sighed, resting his head against her shoulder as his strength waned. "He's served beside me for years. Probably anticipated my next move."

"Julian took advantage of the chaos and jumped," Cassandra observed.
###Chapter 380

Liam's response came as a barely audible whisper.

Evelyn's pounding heart gradually steadied as she lifted her gaze to the celestial tapestry above, its shimmering constellations wrapping her in a cocoon of tranquility.

Her cheeks burned crimson when she timidly inquired, "Liam, how much longer will you keep us drifting? We're veering off course."

With deliberate slowness, Liam attempted to push himself up, only to collapse back onto Evelyn with a pained grunt.

The crushing weight of his muscular frame made breathing difficult, sending tendrils of panic through her body.

"Liam! What's wrong? Are you hurt?" Her hands flew to his waist, frantically patting down his back.

When her fingertips brushed against his left shoulder, they came away slick with warmth. Bringing her hand to her nose, the coppery scent confirmed her worst fear.

Her heart constricted violently as she pressed against the wound, her voice breaking. "Liam...you've been shot."

His breath ghosted across her ear, weak but steady. "Don't...fret...I'll survive."

Swallowing her sobs, Evelyn carefully rolled him off and scrambled to her knees.

Clutching his injured form, she feared he might slip away with every drop of blood staining her hands.

"You absolute fool," she choked out, feeling utterly powerless.

"Cass...help me sit up," Liam rasped.

Supporting his arm, Evelyn guided him upright against the boat's edge.

With trembling fingers, Liam pointed toward the southern sky. "See that...brightest star?"

Following his gesture, Evelyn wiped her tears and nodded. "Yes, it's brilliant."

"Steer...that direction," he instructed between labored breaths.

Adjusting their course, Evelyn secured the navigation before returning to Liam's side. "Liam?" Her voice quivered with barely contained terror.

He remained motionless.

Her entire body trembled as she cradled his face. "Liam, please answer me!"

Only the faintest rise and fall of his chest gave any sign of life.

In desperation, she threw her arms around his neck, tears soaking his collar. "Liam!"

"Not...dead yet," came his deep rumble in the stillness.

Relief flooded through her, though fear still gripped her heart. "Then why won't you respond?" she demanded between sobs.

His hand found the back of her head, fingers tangling in her hair. "Cass...would you mourn me if I were gone?"

She shoved him away angrily. "Look at me! Can't you see what you're doing to me? Do my tears mean nothing?"

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "You've always been...so sensitive. Crying over every challenge...every injustice. Even wept when the neighbor's cat died."

Wiping her face roughly, she huffed, "I was a child then. I'm an adult now."

His chuckle turned into a wince. "Still my little crybaby."

Evelyn's lower lip trembled. "Promise me...no more reckless heroics," she pleaded. "You're Aldenria's general. Your life isn't yours to throw away."

Liam's smile faded as his eyelids fluttered. "You, Cass...mean more than any nation. And Evelyn Carter...is Aldenria's most precious treasure."
###Chapter 381

The helicopter blades whirred as Evelyn kept vigil beside Liam's unconscious form. His shoulder wound bled through the makeshift bandage, staining her trembling fingers crimson.

They couldn't risk the open sea back to Aldenria. Not with Liam bleeding out. The pilot set course for the nearest coastal hospital in Valtoria.

Evelyn pressed two fingers to Liam's neck. The weak pulse beneath her fingertips sent relief flooding through her veins. Alive. Still alive.

The moment they touched down, Evelyn flagged down a passing medic. Within minutes, Liam was rushed into surgery while she paced the sterile hallway, counting each agonizing second.

Five hours. The longest five hours of her life.

When the surgeon finally emerged, Evelyn's knees nearly buckled. "Doctor—is he—"

"Your husband will recover," the doctor said, removing his mask. "The bullet missed major arteries. He's lost considerable blood but should regain consciousness soon."

Husband. The word sent an unexpected warmth through Evelyn's chest. She didn't correct him.

In the recovery room, Evelyn traced the lines of Liam's face—the stubborn set of his jaw even in sleep, the dark lashes fanning across pale cheeks. The steady beep of the heart monitor became her lifeline.

A sharp knock shattered the silence.

Ryan Sullivan burst in, military boots scuffing the linoleum. "General Blackwood! Status report!"

Evelyn barely had time to respond before Victoria Hudson swept past Ryan in a cloud of expensive perfume. The sight of Liam's childhood friend sent ice through Evelyn's veins.

"Liam darling," Victoria cooed, claiming the bedside chair Evelyn had just vacated. Her manicured fingers brushed his bandaged shoulder. "Who did this to you?"

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists. "Don't touch his wound."

Victoria's lips curled. "I have every right—"

"The doctor said no disturbances." Evelyn stepped between them, her voice steel wrapped in velvet. "You can see him when he wakes."

Ryan cleared his throat. "The foreign minister's sending a private jet. We'll transfer him to Aldenria Military Hospital at dawn."

Victoria's eyes flashed. "I'm coming."

Evelyn said nothing, turning back to watch the rise and fall of Liam's chest. Let Victoria scheme. The only thing that mattered now was the man fighting his way back to her.

And when he woke, they'd have much to discuss about Julian Whitmore's betrayal.
###Chapter 382

Evelyn remained silent as she watched Victoria.

Ryan glanced around the room and asked, "Ms. Wright, where's Adrian and the others?"

Evelyn pulled Ryan outside the door. She lowered her voice and said, "I don't know the details. We'll have to wait for Liam to wake up before I can explain, but Adrian betrayed us."

Ryan's face paled. His voice cracked as he shouted, "That's impossible!"

Evelyn knew they had been as close as brothers. The truth was a bitter pill to swallow.

"Liam was injured because of him," she said quietly.

Ryan's fists clenched, his knuckles turning white. Anger burned in his veins, his jaw tightening until his eyes reddened. He turned away, tilting his head back to take deep, steadying breaths, forcing the rage and grief down.

Evelyn didn’t know how to comfort him. His pain was raw, his fury barely contained.

But she knew Liam was suffering a hundred times worse.

The thought of him made her leave Ryan and return to the hospital room.

When she stepped inside, she froze.

Victoria sat beside the bed, elbows resting on the mattress, Liam's hand pressed against her cheek. Her gaze was intense, filled with emotion as she stared at him.

Then, slowly, she lifted his hand and pressed a soft kiss to his knuckles.

The sight was so intimate that Evelyn hesitated, unsure whether to interrupt or leave. Should she tell Victoria to let go? Or reassure her that Liam would be fine?

But she had no right to demand anything. All she could do was swallow the ache in her chest.

Evelyn stepped forward. "Ms. Hudson—"

Before she could offer any comfort, Victoria cut her off without even looking up. "You can go now. I'll handle things here."

Evelyn stiffened.

Victoria finally lifted her head, irritation flashing in her eyes as she took in Evelyn’s lingering presence. She released Liam’s hand and asked coolly, "Is there something else?"

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "I want to stay until Liam wakes up."

"That’s unnecessary," Victoria replied. "Ryan will notify you when he’s conscious."

Evelyn said nothing.

Victoria continued, "You can have Rosalind pick you up, or take a cab. Once Liam wakes, Ryan and I will arrange for his transfer to Aldenria for recovery."

Silence stretched between them.

Victoria added, almost as an afterthought, "By the way, thank you for risking your life to rescue Liam from Obsidian Circle’s headquarters. We’ll never forget your bravery."

We?

Since when had she and Liam become a we? Was it during the past month—when Evelyn had deliberately avoided him, preparing to return to Solterra?

Now, witnessing Victoria’s possessive gestures, Evelyn felt a sharp pang.

This wasn’t how friends acted. This was something deeper—something reserved for lovers.

Her stomach twisted. She thought of the times in Shadowmire’s prison when she’d accidentally brushed against Liam, only for him to stiffen and pull away.

Had he changed?

Evelyn couldn’t stop herself from asking, "Ms. Hudson… are you and Liam—?"

Victoria’s gaze snapped up, sharp and assessing.

After a long pause, Evelyn forced the words out. "Are you two together?"

Victoria hesitated for a heartbeat before answering firmly, "Yes. We’ve been official for a month."

The words hit like a knife to the chest. Pain radiated through Evelyn’s body, leaving her numb.

Tears pricked her eyes, but she forced a weak smile. Her mind went blank, unsure how to react without breaking.

A month.

The same month she had rejected Liam and prepared to leave.

No wonder he hadn’t come to see her.
###Chapter 383

The truth hit me like a freight train.

Victoria noticed Evelyn's pale complexion and distant gaze. "Are you alright?" she asked, genuine concern lacing her voice.

Evelyn forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "I'm fine."

Victoria rose from her chair, studying Evelyn's face. "Did you just find out about Liam and me? He didn't tell you?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips as she shook her head. Tears threatened to spill over. "It's not his fault," she said, voice trembling. "I was the one who cut ties. Told him we couldn't even be friends anymore."

"I see," Victoria replied softly.

Evelyn's fingers unconsciously traced the box in her pocket, feeling the weight of the hydronium through the fabric. "When are you returning to Solterra?" Victoria asked.

"Soon," Evelyn answered vaguely.

Victoria tilted her head. "Why do you keep leaving? Your grandfather's empire, your family... are you really willing to walk away from all that?"

Evelyn's gaze drifted to Liam's unconscious form. The pain in her chest was unbearable. "No," she whispered. "I'm not."

That single word held all her unspoken feelings - not for the wealth, but for the man lying in that hospital bed.

Victoria's expression darkened slightly. "So you're... staying?"

Evelyn discreetly wiped her eyes before looking up. "No. There are matters I must attend to."

"Good luck with your work."

The words were like salt in Evelyn's wounds. She stole one last glance at Liam, memorizing his features. Now, even looking at him felt like trespassing.

He belonged to someone else now. Soon, he would build a life with Victoria.

The thought was excruciating, yet Evelyn forced herself to smile. "I wish you both happiness."

Victoria beamed. "Thank you. We will be."

Evelyn turned abruptly before her composure shattered completely. Hot tears streamed down her face as she hurried from the room. The pain was physical, a crushing weight on her chest.

She knew better than to expect anyone to wait forever. A man like Liam Blackwood? He had galaxies to conquer.

He'd promised to wait five years once. She'd rejected him. This was the consequence of her choices.

Outside the ward, she collided with Ryan. "Ms. Wright?" he asked, noticing her red-rimmed eyes. "Is everything alright?"

Evelyn wiped her face hastily. "I need to go."

"Go where?" Ryan frowned.

Evelyn looked toward the horizon. "Back to Solterra."

"But..." Ryan hesitated. "Aren't you waiting for General Blackwood to wake up?"

A shuddering breath escaped her. "He has Victoria now. My presence isn't necessary."

Ryan's jaw tightened. Disappointment radiated from him in waves. Evelyn could practically see his opinion of her plummeting.

She'd risked everything to save Liam, only to walk away now. To Ryan, it must seem like the ultimate betrayal.

"Ryan," she said softly, "when Liam wakes up... could you let me know he's okay?"

A cold scoff escaped him. "I don't think that's necessary. General Blackwood has Ms. Hudson now."

The words were daggers to her heart. Evelyn turned away before he could see her crumble completely. She walked briskly down the corridor, tears falling freely now.

She had no one to blame but herself. When she'd finally been ready to love Liam properly, it was already too late.
###Chapter 384

Evelyn stepped out of the hospital with trembling hands. The afternoon sun burned her swollen eyes as she searched for an ATM.

Her fingers shook as she inserted the card. The machine beeped, mocking her grief. She withdrew enough cash for a one-way ticket to Aldenria.

The flight attendant gave her concerned looks throughout the journey. Evelyn didn't care. Silent tears carved paths down her cheeks the entire six-hour flight.

When she landed in Aldenria, her reflection in the airport windows startled her. Puffy red eyes. Pale skin. A ghost of the woman she used to be.

Rosalind gasped when she opened the door. "Evelyn! My God... Is Liam...?" The unfinished question hung between them like a guillotine.

That was all it took. Evelyn collapsed into Rosalind's arms, sobbing so violently her entire body convulsed. The dam had broken.

"Shhh... I'm so sorry, darling." Rosalind stroked her hair, tears welling in her own eyes. "But you must be strong now. The living must go on."

Exhaustion finally claimed Evelyn during the car ride to Wright Manor. She slept like the dead for fifteen straight hours.

Archibald and Margaret hovered anxiously outside her door. "What happened?" Archibald demanded in a hushed tone.

Rosalind swallowed hard. "General Blackwood... he's gone."

The color drained from Margaret's face. Archibald immediately pulled out his phone. "We need confirmation. Call Ryan."

Margaret put the call on speaker. Her voice trembled. "Ryan... is it true about Liam?"

Silence. Then Ryan's confused reply: "Madam Wright? General Blackwood is resting at Blackwood Manor. He's injured but stable."

Three stunned faces exchanged glances.

"But... then why..." Margaret gestured helplessly toward Evelyn's room.

Ryan sighed through the phone. "Perhaps General Blackwood sent her back to Solterra? He's been quite insistent she leave for her safety."

Rosalind nodded slowly. "That would explain it."

Margaret composed herself. "Please give Liam our regards for a speedy recovery."

As Ryan hung up, the three shared another bewildered look.

At Blackwood Manor, Ryan pocketed his phone just as Victoria Hudson approached. "Good afternoon, Ms. Hudson."

Victoria's gaze flicked upstairs. "How is he?"

Ryan gestured upward. "Awake but weak. The injuries were... extensive."

Her perfectly shaped eyebrows arched. "Life-threatening?"

"Nearly bled out after two days in a water cell," Ryan admitted. "Then took another bullet during extraction. It's a miracle he's alive."

Without another word, Victoria ascended the grand staircase.

Her knock was answered by Liam's hoarse but eager voice: "Come in."

The disappointment on his face when she entered was palpable. His shoulders slumped as he returned to staring at his silent phone.

Victoria smirked, perching on the edge of his bed. "Expecting someone else? Cassandra perhaps?"

Liam's jaw tightened. His thumb brushed over the screen - a message thread filled with his unanswered texts and voice notes. The last one dated a month ago.

"You know," Victoria said sweetly, "maybe if you stopped sending novels and just wrote 'I'm alive'..."

Liam powered off the screen with a sharp click. He leaned back against the headboard, closing his eyes as if the very act of hoping exhausted him.
###Chapter 385

Victoria Dawson smiled as she pulled up a chair beside Liam Blackwood's hospital bed.

Her voice was soft, almost soothing. "Liam, I understand. The woman you fell for in your youth—she's like an unforgettable first love. Those memories stay with you forever."

She leaned closer. "Then fate brought her back as your wife. Sweet, delicate, charming. So heartbreakingly gentle and kind. What man wouldn't be drawn to her?"

Her tone shifted. "But have you considered that no matter how much you love her, the cruelest truth is that she doesn’t love you back?"

Liam's jaw tightened. A sharp pain twisted in his chest, as if a blade had been driven deep. Even breathing hurt.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Then why did she risk her life to save me?"

Victoria gave his shoulder a gentle pat. "Maybe she was caught too? Did you ever ask her?"

After a pause, she reached for his phone. "I can’t watch this anymore. If you love her, just confess."

She smirked. "It’s not like this is the first rejection. Maybe after a few more, you’ll finally let go."

Liam snatched the phone back, his gaze icy. "Stay out of my business with her."

Victoria huffed. "I just think it’s ridiculous. You took a bullet for her, didn’t you?"

Silence. He tucked the phone beneath the blanket.

Her lips pursed. "You’d die for her, but what does she do? Drops you at the hospital and leaves."

Her voice rose. "Ryan and I barely arrived when she was already rushing out. We couldn’t even convince her to stay—she insisted on returning to Solterra."

Victoria scoffed. "Solterra? Please. She’s probably still asleep at Wright Manor."

She shook her head. "Liam, I feel sorry for you. There are so many women out there—why her?"

Her words grew sharper. "If she cared, fine. But she doesn’t. Not even a call or text. You’re bedridden, and she can’t spare half an hour to visit? Heartless."

Liam’s expression darkened. "Are you done?"

Victoria smirked. "Not even close. I was so furious when Evelyn left that I chased her down and told her we were together."

His eyes snapped to hers, sharp as daggers.

She swallowed. "Don’t look at me like that. I was trying to help. But she didn’t care—she even wished us happiness."

Liam’s voice was dangerously calm. "Did she leave because of what you said, or was she already leaving?"

Victoria hesitated. "Does it matter? She doesn’t want you."

"It matters."

She looked away. "She was leaving anyway. I just... said it."

Liam’s fists clenched. He shut his eyes, leaning back against the headboard.

Victoria bit her lip. "Are you mad?"

Silence.

She sighed. "We’ve been friends for years, Liam. You know I just want what’s best for you."

Still, he said nothing.

"Love yourself. If she won’t, others will."

Liam’s voice was flat. "Don’t say things that could mislead people about us."

Victoria laughed bitterly. "Won’t happen again. Evelyn’s probably packing for Solterra. You’ll never see her again."

Liam pulled the blanket over his head. "Leave."

She patted the covers. "Rest. I’ll visit tomorrow."

The next day, Blackwood Manor

Ryan Sullivan nearly collided with Evelyn at the entrance.

She stepped back, breathless. "Ryan."

He frowned. "What are you doing here?"

Her voice was tight with worry. "How is Liam?"

Ryan’s reply was curt. "Thanks to Ms. Wright, he’s stable."

Evelyn exhaled, but the weight in her chest remained.

He crossed his arms. "The Blackwoods just returned from visiting him. So why were you coming from inside?"

She gestured toward the garden house. "I was seeing Donovan."

Ryan’s face paled. He braced a hand against the wall.

His voice was low, strained. "He gave you space. He moved on. Then you risk your life to save him? What did you expect him to feel?"

Evelyn froze.

So Liam had truly moved on in just a month. Maybe Victoria, his longtime confidante, made it easier.

Her chest tightened as Ryan listed her "sins."

"He took a bullet for you. And you couldn’t even wait to see him wake up?"

His voice cracked. "You just left."
###Chapter 386

The following morning, the Blackwood family traveled to Blackwood Manor to see Liam. By midday, Ryan was driving them back to the Blackwood estate.

As they arrived at the gates, Ryan nearly collided with Evelyn.

Evelyn had just stepped out from the main house when she spotted Ryan. She rushed toward him, calling out his name urgently.

Ryan halted abruptly, his brow furrowing as he regarded her.

"How is Liam?" she asked anxiously, fingers twisting together.

"Thanks to Ms. Wright's intervention, General Blackwood is recovering well," Ryan answered tersely.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, though her chest remained tight with unspoken worries she couldn't articulate.

"The entire Blackwood family visited him at dawn," Ryan continued pointedly. "They've only just returned. So why were you coming from inside the residence?"

Evelyn gestured toward the garden pavilion. "I went to see Donovan."

Ryan inhaled sharply through his nose. He planted his hands on his hips, complexion paling.

The thought of ever falling for someone as callous as Evelyn made him consider self-strangulation a preferable alternative.

"Ms. Wright," he ground out between clenched teeth, "exactly how much does General Blackwood inconvenience you that you must avoid him like some contagious disease?"

Evelyn's expression darkened with confusion. "What are you implying?"

Crossing his arms, Ryan studied her innocent face with exasperation. "Anyone acquainted with General Blackwood knows his first love - the woman he cherished deeply - was Victoria Dawson. Or rather, Cassandra Wright."

Evelyn recoiled as if struck.

"You're aware of this too," Ryan pressed on. "You know exactly how he feels about you. Yet you treat his affection like some burdensome obligation to be dodged at every turn."

"General Blackwood respects you. He's given you space and freedom. When he finally moved on and chose to start anew, you suddenly risked your life to save him. What did you expect him to feel?"

Evelyn stood frozen, the weight of his words pressing down on her.

So Liam had truly moved on within a month, already building a new life. Perhaps with Victoria being his longtime confidante, transitioning into a relationship came easily.

As Ryan continued listing her "transgressions," Evelyn's despondency deepened.

"He took a bullet for you. Risked everything. Yet you couldn't even wait at the hospital long enough to see him wake. Insisted on leaving immediately. Claimed you were returning to Solterra, yet here you remain in Aldenria."

"You have time to visit Donovan, but none for General Blackwood? Is your schedule so precious you can't spare him a single moment?"

A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips, her heart turning to ice. "Ryan, do you despise me so much? Have I offended you somehow?"

"Not at all," Ryan muttered, clearly displeased.

"Could've fooled me," Evelyn countered with that same wounded smile.

Ryan exhaled sharply. "Did you notice I'm trying to get you to visit General Blackwood?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, fingers plucking nervously at her hemline - a telltale sign of internal conflict Ryan recognized immediately.

He was thoroughly exhausted. "Even if it were a complete stranger who saved your life, wouldn't visiting them be the decent thing to do?" he reasoned.

Evelyn blinked as realization dawned. Of course visiting her savior was appropriate.

Victoria's opinions shouldn't matter. This was about checking on an injured person, not stealing someone's partner. Why hesitate?

Meeting Ryan's gaze with newfound determination, Evelyn asked, "Could you drive me to Blackwood Manor?"

Ryan's grin appeared lightning-fast. With exaggerated politeness, he swung the car door open. "Ms. Wright, your chariot awaits."

The complete attitude shift made Evelyn suspect his earlier anger had been performative. Shaking her head ruefully, she climbed in, even requesting stops at a florist and gift shop en route.

By their arrival at Blackwood Manor, dusk had fallen.

Clutching her bouquet, Evelyn drew a steadying breath before rapping lightly on the door.

"Enter," came a weary, hollow voice from within.

Hand trembling slightly, Evelyn turned the knob and stepped inside.
###Chapter 387

The afternoon sun cast golden streaks across the luxurious bedroom, painting Liam Blackwood's chiseled features in a soft glow as he rested against the plush pillows. His usual commanding presence was softened by exhaustion, the faint shadows beneath his eyes betraying his weakened state.

Evelyn Carter had rehearsed her composure the entire ride over. He's engaged now. No lingering thoughts. No foolish hopes.

Yet the moment she stepped inside and saw him, her pulse betrayed her, fluttering wildly against her ribs.

She moved forward quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Liam."

His body tensed. Dark lashes lifted, revealing piercing eyes that locked onto her with startling intensity. She wore a delicate blush-pink dress, her chestnut waves spilling over her shoulders. In one hand, she clutched a bouquet of white zinnias—his favorite. In the other, two meticulously wrapped gift boxes.

Awkwardness clung to her posture.

But when she smiled, it reached her eyes, transforming her face into something breathtaking.

Against his will, Liam felt his own lips curve in response. "You came."

"I brought supplements," she said, lifting the packages slightly.

"Set them there." He gestured to the mahogany coffee table.

She obeyed, then hesitated, flowers still in hand. "Where should I put these?"

Liam patted the nightstand beside him. The moment she leaned in to place them, her vanilla scent enveloped him. Too close.

Evelyn quickly retreated, dragging a chair to his bedside. "How are you feeling?"

The formality stung. Where was the woman who'd once traced idle patterns on his palm during long conversations?

"Better," he lied smoothly.

"Does your shoulder still hurt?"

"Occasionally."

"Can you walk yet?"

He didn't answer. The truth—that blood loss left him dizzy and frail—wasn't something he'd admit. Instead, he turned the tables. "Why did you visit?"

Her fingers twisted in the fabric of her dress. Because I've thought of nothing but you. Because I needed to see you breathing, whole.

But Victoria Hudson's ring on his finger loomed between them.

Liam misinterpreted her silence. His jaw tightened. "Ryan brought you, didn't he?"

"Yes. I went to see Donovan first. Ryan was driving your family back from the estate when I arrived, so we came together."

The words lanced through him. He'd rather she hadn't come at all than know she'd only accompanied Ryan as an afterthought.

"How is Donovan?" Liam forced neutrality into his voice.

"The same. Not well."

"When are you returning to Solterra?"

"I might not."

His grip on the blanket turned white-knuckled. "Why the change?" The question emerged rougher than intended. He tempered it. "Did something happen?"

Evelyn's lips curved faintly. "Don't you want me to stay and serve Aldenria?"

"More than anything." The admission slipped out—both as a general and a man. If she remained, there was still hope.

"My grandparents are aging," she offered casually. "I'd like to be near them. I'm still deciding."

The unspoken words hung between them, heavy as the flowers' perfume. I'm still deciding if I can bear seeing you with someone else.
###Chapter 388

"Chubs," Liam murmured. His lips curved into a tender smile as his gaze lingered on her with unmistakable warmth.

Evelyn lifted her eyes, their depths shimmering like morning dew. "Hmm?"

His voice was thick with emotion. "Aldenria needs you."

A delicate smile played on her lips. "And what about you?"

Liam froze, his expression flickering between surprise and something deeper, more conflicted.

Evelyn instantly regretted her words. The realization struck her like icy water—he wasn’t hers to ask such things anymore. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Before he could respond, she forced a laugh, waving a dismissive hand. "Forget I said that. Just a bad joke."

His reply died in his throat.

The silence grew unbearable. Evelyn stood abruptly, smoothing her skirt. "You should rest, Liam. I should go."

"Chubs—" His voice cracked with urgency. She couldn’t leave. Not yet.

But she was already moving toward the door.

He called after her, but her steps only quickened. Desperation clawed at him. "Cassandra Wright!"

The sound of her full name halted her mid-step. Her fingers hovered over the doorknob. Slowly, she turned.

The moment she faced him, Liam’s weakened legs gave out. He stumbled forward, collapsing against her.

Evelyn gasped as her back hit the doorframe. Instinctively, her arms wrapped around his waist, holding him upright.

Liam braced himself against the door, his weight pressing her into the wood. His breath came in ragged bursts.

Panic fluttered in Evelyn’s chest. "Liam! What’s wrong?"

He hadn’t realized how frail he was until now. Standing took everything he had.

Ignoring the dizziness, he fought to stay conscious. The scent of her hair—vanilla and something uniquely her—anchored him.

"Cassandra," he whispered, his voice barely audible.

She tightened her grip. "Let me help you back to bed."

His fingers dug into the doorframe. "Do you understand?" he rasped. "Donovan... my brother... his first love destroyed him. He still can’t let go."

Evelyn’s throat tightened. Loving a Blackwood only led to heartbreak.

Tears pricked her eyes. "Liam, let me call Ryan. You need help—"

"Just... let me stay like this. A little longer." His head dropped to her shoulder, his breath warm against her skin.

She didn’t protest. Her hand drifted up, fingers tracing slow circles on his back. A silent promise.

Tears spilled over. In this moment, she admitted the truth: she loved him. Hopelessly.

When they’d pulled him from that waterlogged cell, barely breathing, she’d wanted to die with him. The world had scientists, innovators—but there was only one Liam.

Her decision was made. She’d return to Aldenria, serve her country... and him.

So why? The question burned. Why did you choose her?

"Liam," she whispered, her voice breaking. "Why did you follow me?"
###Chapter 389

"There's something I need to clarify with you," Liam murmured. His breathing grew uneven as he spoke the words against her shoulder.

"What is it?" Evelyn asked.

"Victoria and I... we're not together."

Evelyn froze. Her mind went completely blank for a moment before a whirlwind of emotions crashed over her. Relief, joy, confusion, anger - they all battled for dominance in her racing heart.

She could still feel Victoria's venomous glare from earlier. The woman's underhanded tactics left a bitter taste in Evelyn's mouth.

As her emotions settled slightly, Evelyn tightened her arms around Liam's waist. "Liam... Victoria told me you two were dating."

That was precisely why Liam felt compelled to explain. Regardless of Evelyn's feelings for him, he refused to let misunderstandings dictate their relationship.

As long as Evelyn remained unmarried and he stayed single, hope still flickered between them.

"Yes, Victoria mentioned that to me too," Liam admitted.

A cold dread settled in Evelyn's chest. If Liam hadn't clarified, she would have carried this misunderstanding forever.

With the truth revealed, Victoria's actions would simply be seen as defending a friend. She had manipulated the situation masterfully, ensuring Liam couldn't blame her. Evelyn realized with dismay that such cunning women still existed in this world.

She suddenly felt utterly outmatched against Victoria's schemes.

"Liam," Evelyn whispered, her breath brushing his ear, "did you chase after me just to tell me this?"

"Yes," he admitted simply.

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Victoria probably didn't anticipate this."

"Anticipate what?" Liam asked, pulling back slightly.

"She didn't expect that you'd..." Evelyn paused deliberately, then continued slowly, "She didn't expect you to clarify this with me."

Liam straightened, putting some distance between them. His intense gaze studied Evelyn's flushed cheeks and emotional eyes. "I know you don't care," he said quietly.

"I do care. Very much." The words nearly tumbled out, but Evelyn caught herself at the last moment.

No, this wasn't the right time for confessions. She needed to resign from Solterra Research Institute first, to terminate their professional contract.

Only after regaining her Aldenrian citizenship would she have the confidence to speak her heart.

If Solterra refused to release her and she couldn't return to work in Aldenria, giving Liam false hope would only lead to greater disappointment later.

The pain would be unbearable. She couldn't bear to hurt him like that again.

Noticing Evelyn's distant expression, Liam turned slowly and moved toward the bed, his steps weak and unsteady.

Evelyn snapped from her thoughts and rushed to support his arm.

Liam glanced at her hand, then met her gaze.

"Let me help you," Evelyn said with a sweet smile.

Liam remained silent but allowed her to guide him to the bed.

She helped him lie down, tucked the blanket around him, then pulled a chair close to sit beside him.

Leaning forward with her elbows on the bed and chin resting on her hands, she gazed at him with gentle affection.

Liam frowned slightly. "Aren't you leaving?"

Evelyn blinked innocently, her mind already strategizing how to counter Victoria's moves. Ignoring his question, she asked softly, "Liam, who's been taking care of you?"

"Oliver handles meals," Liam replied, closing his eyes. "The maid cleans and makes tea."

"What about wound care? Bathing? Getting dressed?" Evelyn pressed. "Who helps you with those?"

"I'm weak, not disabled," Liam grumbled.

Summoning her courage, Evelyn spoke in a shy whisper, "I'm not busy anyway. I'll stay and take care of you."

Liam's eyes flew open. A faint blush colored his pale cheeks.
###Chapter 390

The woman who had been desperate to leave mere moments ago now lingered, her demeanor shifting to one of unexpected tenderness as she offered to care for him.

Liam's lips curved into a faint smile. "What changed your mind so suddenly?" he inquired, curiosity lacing his voice.

Evelyn pressed her lips together thoughtfully before answering with a soft smile. "You got hurt protecting me. It's only fair I look after you now."

A deep chuckle rumbled in Liam's chest as his gaze held hers with quiet intensity.

With playful mischief dancing in her eyes, Evelyn added, "In medieval tales, when a damsel had nothing else to offer her rescuer, she'd often give herself as repayment."

Heat surged through Liam's body, prompting him to push the blanket down slightly. His voice dropped to a husky timbre. "Is that what you're offering?"

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "I'm offering myself."

Liam's expression grew serious. "Don't tease me about this, Evelyn. I might actually believe you."

"I'm completely serious," she affirmed without hesitation.

Liam closed his eyes, feigning rest, though his pulse raced beneath his skin.

Evelyn remained silent, gently pulling the blanket back up to his shoulders.

With eyes still shut, Liam slowly pushed it down again, letting it rest at his waist.

Frowning, Evelyn tugged the blanket up once more.

Again, Liam pushed it down, his closed eyelids fluttering slightly.

Just as Evelyn reached for the blanket again, Liam's hand shot out, capturing her wrist. "I'm burning up," he murmured without opening his eyes.

"You're weakened," she countered softly. "We can't risk you catching a chill."

With a resigned sigh, Liam released her hand, allowing her to tuck the blanket around him properly this time.

Evelyn lingered awhile longer, watching his steady breathing until she was certain he slept. Then she slipped quietly from the room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Liam's eyes flew open, fixed on the doorway with unmistakable longing.

When Ryan entered moments later, his manner was noticeably more polite. "Ms. Wright, shall I arrange your transportation?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm staying."

Ryan blinked in surprise before breaking into a knowing grin. "Excellent. General Blackwood's recovery will surely accelerate with your care."

"I'll take my leave then," Ryan said tactfully, vanishing before she could change her mind.

Evelyn rose abruptly when Oliver approached with a tray. "Is that Liam's dinner?"

"Let me," she insisted, extending her hands.

After a brief hesitation, Oliver relinquished the tray.

As she turned toward the stairs, thermos in hand, she nearly collided with Victoria Hudson.

Their eyes locked in an electric moment of recognition, tension crackling between them despite their composed expressions.

Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Ms. Wright, what brings you here?"

Evelyn matched her polite tone. "Liam was injured protecting me. Where else would I be?"

Victoria's lips thinned momentarily before she gestured to the tray. "How thoughtful. Why don't you let me handle his meal?"

Evelyn stepped back instinctively, but Victoria had already seized the tray.

"I've prepared beef stew," Victoria offered sweetly. "Would you care for some?"
###Chapter 391

Evelyn stood empty-handed, watching Victoria's domineering display. A suffocating pressure built in her chest. "No, it's fine," she managed to say.

"Liam must be hungry. I should get going," Victoria said with false politeness, her words a thinly veiled dismissal.

With that, she ascended the stairs with the food tray.

Evelyn's fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms. Seeking relief, she stepped onto the balcony where the evening breeze cooled her flushed cheeks.

She couldn't remain passive any longer. Though Liam loved her, he was still a man. Victoria was cunning, and their years of friendship could easily blossom into something more.

If she didn't act now, she might lose him forever.

Decision made, Evelyn spun on her heel and rushed upstairs. She pushed open the bedroom door without knocking to find Victoria helping Liam out of bed.

Both turned at the intrusion.

Heat rose to Evelyn's cheeks, but she forced a smile. "I came to see if Liam needed any help."

Liam's expression shifted from surprise to quiet delight, his gaze warming as it settled on her.

He'd thought she'd left. Her unexpected presence brought a rare smile to his usually stern face.

Victoria's lips thinned. "That won't be necessary, Ms. Wright. Haven't you had dinner? Perhaps Oliver could prepare something before you leave."

Evelyn's smile turned sweet. "I'm not hungry. Besides, I wasn't planning to leave."

Liam's eyebrows shot up at her bold declaration.

Victoria's forced smile looked painful. "It's hardly proper for an unmarried couple to be alone together."

"I don't mind." Evelyn turned her most radiant smile on Liam. "Do you, Liam?"

"Blackwood Manor's doors are always open for you," Liam replied evenly, lifting the blanket.

As he moved to rise, Victoria's expression darkened. She grabbed his arm. "Where are you going?"

When she realized his destination, she insisted, "Let me help you to the bathroom."

Liam shook his head. "I can manage."

Evelyn stepped forward. "I'll assist him."

Victoria's voice turned sharp. "Ms. Wright, didn't you hear? He needs privacy."

Evelyn met her glare unflinchingly. "We were married for six months. We shared meals, a bed, and I've seen every inch of him."

Victoria's face went slack with shock.

Liam's brows knitted together in bewilderment.

Victoria's mind raced—what exactly had Evelyn seen?

"Come, Liam." Evelyn's cheeks burned as she told this brazen lie, too embarrassed to meet his eyes.

A slow smile spread across Liam's face as he allowed her to guide him into the bathroom.

Inside, Evelyn lifted the toilet seat with trembling hands. Her face flamed as her gaze flickered downward before darting back up to his face.
###Chapter 392

"Do you need assistance?" Evelyn asked softly, noticing Liam's hesitation by the bathroom door.

Liam had been waiting for her to leave. Her question only deepened his embarrassment. "I'm fine. You can go," he replied stiffly.

Evelyn's lips pursed when she remembered Victoria waiting outside. "I'll stay until you're finished, then help you back to bed."

Liam exhaled sharply, warmth creeping up his neck. His breathing grew uneven as he muttered hoarsely, "Cassandra, how am I supposed to... with you watching?"

Evelyn turned her back abruptly, cheeks burning. "I won't look. Just... proceed."

"Cassandra—" His voice held equal parts exasperation and affection.

"Stop stalling," she interrupted, fiddling with her sleeve hem. The awkwardness made her voice sharper than intended.

Liam couldn't bring himself to move. Her presence made the simple act impossible.

"Liam," she said softly, staring at the tiles. "Think of us as an old married couple. There's nothing to be shy about."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "We have been married for half a year, even if we haven't... you know."

Defeated, Liam finally complied, jaw clenched tight against the humiliation.

To distract them both, he asked, "When exactly did you see me naked?"

Evelyn's ears turned crimson. "I may have... exaggerated that part."

"Do you help Donovan like this too?" Liam's tone darkened noticeably.

Evelyn stiffened. "Donovan's like family! I'd never—"

The toilet flushed. Liam moved to the sink in silence, washing his hands methodically.

Evelyn grabbed a towel before he could. "Donovan's just a dear friend. Don't misunderstand."

If Donovan was just a friend, what did that make him?

Liam dropped the towel without comment, allowing Evelyn to guide him back.

Once seated, Evelyn picked up a fork. "Let me feed you," she offered brightly.

Victoria's expression soured as she glared at Evelyn.

Ignoring her, Evelyn speared a bite of shepherd's pie and brought it to Liam's lips.

Liam glanced between the women, comprehension dawning. He accepted the bite without protest.

Evelyn beamed as he chewed.

"Victoria," Liam said after swallowing, "you should go. Cassandra can manage my care."

Victoria shot up, chair scraping loudly. "I'll return tomorrow," she bit out before storming away.
###Chapter 393

Liam reclined in his chair, exhaustion lining his features. "You're swamped with work. No need to visit daily," he murmured. "A few days' rest is all I require."

Victoria Hudson offered a polite smile. "Very well. Get your rest then."

Evelyn remained silent by the window.

As Victoria reached for the door handle, their gazes locked in an unspoken duel. The air thickened with tension until the door clicked shut behind her.

Only then did Evelyn exhale. She speared a roasted potato and meatball with her fork, extending it toward Liam.

He turned his face away, shadows crossing his expression. "No need for pretenses now that she's gone."

Evelyn's hand froze mid-air. "Liam, I—"

This wasn't an act. She genuinely cared for his wellbeing. Though admittedly, provoking Victoria had been an irresistible bonus.

Liam took the fork himself and began eating mechanically. "I don't mind being your pawn," he said quietly.

"Pawn for what?"

"To unsettle her."

His words struck like a physical blow.

"You should leave," Liam continued. "Don't torture yourself with forced gestures. It's pointless."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Why do you assume that's my only motive?"

Liam pushed his plate away, appetite gone. "Whatever history you two share, I won't speculate."

The silence between them grew leaden.

As Evelyn moved toward the exit, Liam's voice stopped her. "Don't give me false hope, Cassandra."

"I've petitioned the State Department for repatriation to Aldenria. The process is grueling, but I'm making progress. Just... give me time."

"Nobody can intervene," Evelyn said, worry creasing her brow. "Unless Solterra shows mercy, I'll remain branded as a defector—an international fugitive forever."

Their eyes met across the quiet room, speaking volumes without words.

After a prolonged silence, Liam ventured, "If you could return... would we still—"

Be friends?

The unfinished question hung between them.

Evelyn's lips curved in a shy smile. "We could still be husband and wife."

With that, she slipped through the door.

Liam sat motionless, heart pounding. The unexpected declaration left him breathless with hope.
###Chapter 394

Evelyn descended the grand staircase, her footsteps echoing through the marble foyer. Rosalind stood waiting in the sitting room, clutching a garment bag.

"Here are the clothes you requested," Rosalind said, handing over the bag. Her brow furrowed with concern. "Evelyn, why this sudden move to Blackwood Manor? How is Mr. Blackwood recovering?"

Accepting the bag, Evelyn sank into the plush sofa beside Rosalind. "He's sustained two life-threatening injuries before," she explained, fingers tightening around the fabric. "His constitution remains fragile - he needs round-the-clock care now."

Rosalind fell silent, her lips pressing into a thin line of worry.

"Any news from Solterra?" Evelyn asked, changing the subject.

Rosalind's expression darkened as she leaned closer. "Evelyn, you know your position. Solterra won't simply let their top scientist walk away. They're still trying every tactic to bring you back."

A sigh escaped Evelyn's lips, laced with quiet remorse. "Please keep handling negotiations for me. We must resolve this diplomatically - no provocations, no offenses taken."

Rosalind's eyes burned with unanswered questions. "I still don't understand why you'd abandon hydronium research, leave Solterra, and return to Aldenria. You always said science transcends borders - that knowledge belongs to humanity."

She leaned forward urgently. "If you stay in Aldenria, you'll lose everything - Solterra's unlimited resources, your research team, years of groundbreaking work. The Genesis Award was within your grasp! This could have been your life's crowning achievement."

Evelyn's shoulders slumped slightly as she stared at her hands.

"Perhaps you should reconsider," Rosalind pressed gently.

Evelyn lifted her chin with quiet determination. "My mind is made up. Continue negotiations with Solterra. I'll accept any reasonable terms they propose - as long as it guarantees my permanent return."

"But Evelyn—" Rosalind began urgently.

Evelyn raised a hand, cutting her off. "Please, no more."

Rosalind's voice turned grave. "Is this about Liam? Are you letting emotions cloud your judgment?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's not just him."

"Then what?" Rosalind demanded.

Taking Rosalind's hand, Evelyn spoke with quiet intensity. "The truth is, science does have borders."

Rosalind frowned in confusion.

"Solterra and Aldenria may be allies now, but politics shift like sand. If conflict ever arises, the weapons I developed could be turned against my homeland."

"You're not Aldenrian anymore," Rosalind countered. "These aren't your people."

"I was born and raised in Aldenria. Educated there. Before going abroad, I dreamed of seeding knowledge and returning to serve my country."

Rosalind sighed. "The scenario you fear may never happen."

Seeing she couldn't sway Evelyn, Rosalind exhaled in resignation.

"If I must choose between happiness and honor, I choose happiness," Evelyn said softly. "The Genesis Award seems distant now, and there's no guarantee of happiness even if I stayed."

"Both paths are uncertain," she continued. "But right now, I can't risk losing him."

Rosalind stood abruptly, smoothing her skirt. "Very well, Evelyn. I'll monitor the situation. Though it would be best if you handled negotiations personally."

"If I set foot in Solterra again," Evelyn said quietly, "I'll never make it back to Aldenria."

Understanding dawned in Rosalind's eyes, and she nodded silently.

"Thank you, Rosalind."

"No thanks needed." Rosalind moved toward the door. "I should go now."

Evelyn saw her out, then went to dine alone before carrying her clothes to Liam's chambers.

She found him already finished with dinner, propped against the headboard, his attention wholly absorbed by the laptop balanced on his knees.
###Chapter 395

After neatly arranging her clothes in the wardrobe, Evelyn moved toward Liam. She leaned down to peek at the screen of his laptop.

His dark hair blocked her view instantly. Liam looked up, startled, his stern expression softening as he studied her delicate features.

Multiple windows cluttered his screen - classified military reports, inventory spreadsheets, encrypted emails, and several confidential documents.

Evelyn kept her position, slowly turning her head to meet his gaze.

At this proximity, Liam noticed how flawless her complexion was. The subtle floral scent of her shampoo teased his senses.

His throat moved visibly as his stare intensified.

"You should rest now, Liam," Evelyn murmured, her voice like velvet. "Put your work away for tonight."

With deliberate slowness, Liam closed the laptop.

Pleased, Evelyn took it from his hands and placed it on the dresser across the spacious bedroom.

"Would you prefer to shower or take a bath?" she asked, maintaining a respectful distance despite her nervousness.

Liam checked his watch - 8:15 pm. "You don't need to fuss over me. Go get some rest in your own room."

Evelyn stepped closer, hands clasped behind her back. "I'd like to stay with you tonight."

His eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"Not like that!" she clarified hastily. "Just in case you need assistance during the night - water, or help moving around."

Liam's intense scrutiny made her fidget. She couldn't decipher his thoughts.

Gesturing to the massive bed, she added, "This California king has plenty of space. I promise not to disturb your injuries."

A reluctant smile tugged at his lips. "Evelyn, I have my phone. If I need anything, I'll call you."

"But I'll worry," she insisted.

His voice dropped an octave. "So sharing my bed will ease your concerns?"

"I just want to take care of you."

"We're not married. Not even dating," he reminded her.

Evelyn chuckled. "When we were married, you barely noticed me. In your current state, you can hardly stand without help."

Having secured his reluctant agreement, Evelyn practically glowed. She hurried to the ensuite bathroom to prepare his bath.

As she helped Liam rise, his hand heavy on her shoulder, he eyed her skeptically. "We?"

"I can manage alone," he protested.

"I'm neither helpless nor a child," Evelyn countered smoothly.

Liam sighed. "This feels inappropriate, Evelyn. We don't have that kind of relationship."

"I never took you for a prude, Liam Blackwood," she teased, meeting his gaze without flinching.

In the bathroom, Evelyn tested the water temperature before turning to assist him. Liam caught her wrist.

"You're seriously going to help me bathe?" His ears turned pink.

Evelyn nodded earnestly.

"Doesn't this make you uncomfortable?" he pressed.

"It's just basic caregiving," she maintained calmly.

Watching her composed demeanor, Liam finally relented. As he removed his shirt, he stole a glance at Evelyn's reaction.

She froze, her cheeks blooming crimson as her eyes darted away.

Amused, Liam unfastened his pants. Evelyn spun around immediately, presenting him with her back.
###Chapter 396

"I'm just uncomfortable," Liam murmured, his voice strained.

Evelyn assumed he meant his injury. "I'll be gentle and avoid your wound," she promised softly, her fingers already dipping into the warm bathwater.

Liam's brow furrowed. "Don't you understand?"

Ignoring his question, Evelyn's hand moved across his abdomen, the washcloth gliding over his skin.

When Liam opened his eyes, his intense gaze locked onto her face. Suddenly, he seized her wrist and guided her hand lower.

Evelyn recoiled as if burned. Her breath hitched, cheeks flaming crimson as she jerked her hand back.

Liam's actions made his discomfort painfully clear - he wanted her to leave.

Flustered, Evelyn turned away from his piercing stare. "Are you sure you don't want me to go?" Liam asked.

"No, I'm staying. Just... get undressed," Evelyn replied, keeping her back to him.

"Alright then." The rustle of clothing followed.

Evelyn's pulse raced, her skin prickling with awareness. "Why are you announcing it? Just hurry up," she snapped, nerves making her voice sharper than intended.

Silence. Then the sound of water displaced by his body.

When Evelyn finally dared to look, she found Liam submerged to his shoulders. She exhaled in relief and knelt beside the tub, reaching for the soap.

"Is your shoulder wound waterproof?" she asked.

Liam leaned back, eyes drifting shut. "Not entirely."

"Then I'll work around it."

"Fine."

An awkward silence fell.

Evelyn squeezed body wash into her palm. "Should I... wash here too? How should I—" Her hand brushed lower.

Liam jerked as if electrocuted. Desire surged through him with startling intensity.

Evelyn froze at his reaction. Liam caught her wrist, his breathing ragged. "You did that on purpose," he accused hoarsely.

Innocent eyes met his. "What's wrong?"

Liam exhaled sharply, heat flooding his body. Words failed him.

Evelyn noticed his flushed ears. "Liam, is the water too hot? Your face is red."

"Do you really think it's the temperature?" he ground out.

"Then what?"

"It's your touch," Liam admitted bluntly. "When you bathe me... my body reacts. Strongly."

Evelyn's mouth fell open, shock and embarrassment warring on her features.
###Chapter 397

Evelyn felt a peculiar mix of embarrassment and delight swirling in her chest. Liam's body had proven to be unexpectedly sensitive, reacting strongly to their intimate moment.

"Eve," his voice came out strained, "could you wait for me outside? Just by the door."

"Of course," she replied, biting back a smile as she averted her gaze. With practiced nonchalance, she rose and exited the bathroom, maintaining perfect composure until the door clicked shut behind her.

The moment she was alone, Evelyn's carefully constructed calm shattered. She pressed both hands against her burning cheeks, muffling her giggles against her palms.

The memory replayed vividly - the warmth of his skin beneath her fingers, the way his breath had hitched when she'd touched him.

Looking down at her hands, Evelyn marveled at her own boldness. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined she'd have the courage to touch Liam so intimately.

The wave of embarrassment crashed over her anew. She practically sprinted to the bed, diving beneath the covers and burying her face in Liam's pillow. His distinctive scent surrounded her, making her heart race all over again.

No matter how she tried to clear her mind, the images persisted, replaying on an endless loop that left her breathless.

When Liam finished his shower, Evelyn took her turn. Emerging later, she found him already asleep - or pretending to be. Either way, she curled up beside him, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest until sleep claimed her too.

The following days found Evelyn shadowing Liam's every move, relieved of mundane chores as she focused solely on his recovery. His strength returned quickly - by the fourth day, he was back to his rigorous exercise routine: morning runs, push-ups, boxing sessions that left him glistening with sweat.

Evelyn, meanwhile, preferred sleeping in. This morning was no different - she woke to find his side of the bed empty once more.

Running fingers through her tangled hair, she shuffled to the bathroom. After freshening up, she selected a flowing floral sundress from the wardrobe.

Dressed, she hurried to the balcony hoping to spot Liam training in the garden below. Instead, her eyes landed on an unwelcome sight at the iron gates.

+15 BONUS

Victoria Hudson stood waiting, clutching something in her hands as the security guard admitted her.

Evelyn had almost believed Victoria had given up after several days' absence. Yet here she was again.

She dashed back inside and down the stairs, finding Liam lounging on the sofa, absorbed in his phone.

"Morning, Liam," she called, descending quickly.

He looked up, smiling softly. "Good morning."

Before he could question her haste, Evelyn launched herself at him, straddling his lap in one fluid motion. Liam barely had time to set his phone aside before she wrapped her arms around his neck in an unmistakably possessive embrace.

His phone clattered to the sofa as his hands instinctively found her waist. "What's going on?" His voice came out rough as his Adam's apple bobbed.

Evelyn tightened her hold, whispering against his shoulder, "Victoria's here to see you again."

Liam chuckled darkly, pulling her closer. His breath tickled her ear as he murmured, "Must you always cause trouble, little minx?"

"I'm fresh out of ideas for dealing with her," she admitted.

Right on cue, Victoria's voice rang through the foyer. "Liam?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn cupped Liam's face and pressed her lips to his in a searing kiss. His surprise lasted only a second before he responded in kind.

Victoria froze in the doorway, shock and humiliation warring on her face as she witnessed the intimate scene unfolding before her.
###Chapter 398

Evelyn simply wanted Victoria to witness her intimate moment with Liam.

After their first tender kiss, Evelyn shyly pulled away from Liam's lips.

Victoria considered intervening, but before she could react, Liam moved faster.

His strong hand cradled the back of Evelyn's head while his other arm encircled her slender waist, pulling her forcefully against him. Then he captured her lips in a deep, passionate kiss that left no room for hesitation.

The sudden intensity took Evelyn by surprise. She found herself pressed flush against Liam's broad, muscular chest with no space between them.

In that moment, it felt like the world around them ceased to exist.

Victoria's face darkened with barely contained fury before she spun on her heel and stormed out.

With Evelyn's delicate hands resting against Liam's chest, he kissed her with such consuming passion that her knees weakened. Her entire body felt weightless, as if floating in his embrace.

His powerful arms enveloped her completely while his kiss grew more demanding. He teased and claimed her lips with an urgency that spoke of long-suppressed desire, losing himself in the moment without any intention of stopping.

Gone was the innocence of their first kiss - now Evelyn responded with equal fervor.

Her position straddling his lap left no doubt about their intimacy, allowing her to feel his unmistakable arousal pressing against her.

The moment was electrifying and overwhelming.

Evelyn's heart raced wildly as heat flooded her body. The intensity of their kiss left her breathless, her chest rising and falling in erratic bursts.

Their passionate exchange seemed to last an eternity before Evelyn gently pushed against Liam's chest, signaling she needed air. He reluctantly released her lips but kept their foreheads pressed together, both breathing heavily as their warm breaths mingled.

"That was your first time kissing me," Liam murmured in that deep, gravelly voice that sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn remained dazed, still floating in the cloud of passion. Her body felt deliciously warm and pliant, with an unfamiliar ache building low in her abdomen - a sensation she'd never experienced before.

"Liam," she whispered shyly, her fingers lightly gripping his broad shoulders, uncertain how to voice her thoughts.

"Yes, darling?" His response was rough with desire.

"She's gone," Evelyn managed, her voice thick with embarrassment.

"I noticed."

"We should..." Evelyn trailed off, heat flooding her cheeks. From head to toe, she burned with need yet couldn't find the courage to voice her desire.

All she wanted was for Liam to sweep her off to their bedroom.

Yet hesitation crept in - Liam had only recently recovered. Perhaps indulging their passion wasn't wise just yet.

As Evelyn wrestled with her thoughts, Liam's warm breath tickled her ear as he whispered, "Could you get down first?"

"Hmm?" Evelyn blinked, startled from her daze.

Without waiting for response, Liam's strong hands gripped her waist and lifted her effortlessly onto the nearby sofa.

Silently, he stood and strode purposefully toward the stairs.

Evelyn watched his retreating form with confusion. What just happened? Did I do something wrong? Why is he leaving so abruptly?

After smoothing her dress and composing herself, Evelyn moved to the dining room for a solitary breakfast. Meanwhile, upstairs, Liam tore off his shirt and marched straight to the bathroom.

Turning the shower to its coldest setting, he stepped beneath the icy spray, willing his racing pulse to slow.

The freezing water cascaded over his heated skin as he fought to control his breathing.

Gradually, the physical intensity of his desire lessened, but the memory of Evelyn's soft body against his refused to fade.

He tilted his face upward, letting the water run over his clenched jaw. Gripping the shower wall, he took several deep, steadying breaths.

When Evelyn was still Cassandra, he'd never experienced such overwhelming desire, despite their marriage and his deep care for her.

But now, every touch, every kiss with Evelyn ignited an uncontrollable fire within him.

After thirty minutes beneath the cold water, Liam finally emerged, wrapping a towel around his waist. He grabbed another to dry his hair as he moved toward the closet.

Suddenly, he froze - his gaze locking onto Evelyn who stood waiting by the closet door.

Having finished breakfast, Evelyn had come upstairs to find Liam, only to discover him showering. She hadn't expected him to emerge shirtless, water still glistening on his toned torso.
###Chapter 399

Liam stepped out of the shower, his damp dark hair clinging to his forehead. Water droplets glistened on his sculpted shoulders as he toweled off.

The crisp morning light highlighted every defined muscle along his torso. That tantalizing V-line disappeared beneath the towel wrapped around his narrow hips.

Evelyn stood frozen just three paces away, catching the fresh scent of his cedarwood body wash. The aroma wrapped around her like an intoxicating spell.

Even after all this time, the sight of his bare torso made her pulse quicken. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she fought to maintain composure.

"Liam," she managed, voice slightly higher than usual. "Why are you showering so early?"

He cleared his throat, the sound rough from exertion. "Morning sparring session with Ryan." His damp footsteps echoed as he moved past her toward the walk-in closet.

The abandoned towel hung carelessly over the chair back. Evelyn trailed after him, leaning against the closet doorframe with undisguised appreciation.

When Liam pulled a crisp white shirt from the rack, he caught her staring. "Problem?" One dark eyebrow arched.

Evelyn bit her lower lip, the flush spreading to her collarbones. She tilted her chin up defiantly. "Can't I admire my husband?"

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. Liam braced one hand against the mirror beside her head, leaning down until their breaths mingled. His dark eyes held that dangerous glint she knew too well.

Her wide, innocent gaze met his smoldering one - the perfect contrast of purity and temptation. "Like what you see?" His voice dropped to that rough whisper that never failed to make her shiver.

When she nodded, his grip on the shirt tightened almost imperceptibly.

Liam exhaled sharply through his nose. "When did you become so bold?" His warm breath fanned across her lips as he spoke.

Heart pounding, Evelyn placed one tentative hand on his shoulder. The moment her fingers made contact, she felt the subtle tension coiling through his muscles.

Her touch traced the cool planes of his chest, following the ridges of his abdomen with featherlight strokes. Lower...

Liam's breathing hitched. That cold shower might as well have never happened.

When her fingers hooked into the towel at his waist, he caught her wrist with startling speed. "Evelyn," he warned, voice thick with restraint.

Undeterred, she rose onto her toes and captured his lips. The kiss started soft but quickly deepened as she teased his mouth open with her tongue.

Liam reacted instantly - one hand tangling in her hair while the other pinned her wrist to the mirror. When they broke apart, his chest heaved like he'd run a marathon.

"Please," he ground out between clenched teeth, "don't."

Evelyn frowned. She'd felt his desire pressing against her moments ago. Why was he pushing her away now? Hadn't he just yesterday whispered his love against her skin?

The rejection stung. Was she not attractive enough? Not desirable?

She knew he'd been training harder lately - morning runs, boxing sessions, weight training. This wasn't about physical limitations. He simply didn't want her.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, looking away as humiliation burned through her. "I won't... bother you again."

Liam caught the wounded look in her eyes before she could hide it. Releasing her wrist, he gently tilted her chin up. "What's wrong?" The concern in his voice only confused her more.
###Chapter 400

Evelyn forced a fragile smile, concealing the storm within beneath practiced composure. "I'm fine. I should go," she murmured with deliberate casualness.

Her fingers slipped from Liam's grasp like water through fingers. Before he could react, she'd already darted out of the walk-in closet, her hurried footsteps echoing through the bedroom.

Liam turned to watch her retreating figure, his chest tightening with unspoken questions. The enigma that was Evelyn Carter continued to baffle him.

Why did she keep drawing him into this intoxicating dance if her heart remained uncommitted?

Her earlier words haunted him: "When you return, we can still be husband and wife."

Liam pressed his palms against the cool mirror surface, bowing his head as if in prayer. A sharp ache pierced through his ribcage as he inhaled deeply.

He understood geopolitical strategies better than most men understood their own wives. Evelyn still had five years remaining on her Solterra contract - they'd never let their prized scientist stay in Aldenria indefinitely. Whether it took five years or fifty, Liam was prepared to wait.

Yet doubt gnawed at him. Would the Evelyn of tomorrow feel the same as she did today? Did she truly see him as a life partner, or was this another fleeting whim?

One thing remained certain - until vows were exchanged, he would never take what wasn't freely given. Not even a kiss, no matter how desperately he longed to claim one.

The thought of her potential regret terrified him more than any battlefield.

Downstairs, Evelyn sat curled on the sofa, a forgotten book limp in her hands. The words blurred before her eyes as her thoughts kept drifting upstairs to Liam.

The sound of polished shoes on marble snapped her from reverie.

She looked up just as Liam descended the final steps, his tailored suit accentuating his military bearing. The dark fabric hugged his broad shoulders perfectly, the silver tie clip catching the light like a blade.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Even after all this time, his effortless elegance still made her pulse stutter.

"Liam, are you leaving?" She scrambled to her knees on the couch cushions, fingers gripping the backrest.

Adjusting his cufflinks, he moved toward her with that predatory grace. "The Valtorian vice chancellor's visit. State banquet." His gaze softened as it met hers. "Protocol demands my presence."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn's face. Her hand flew to her lips. "Earlier... when Victoria came looking for you... she was supposed to accompany you, wasn't she?"

Liam's faint smile confirmed her suspicion.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks as she ducked her head. "Then what I just did-"

His fingers gently carded through her hair. "It's alright," he murmured. "Unless specifically ordered, I don't require an escort."

"Will you be back for lunch?" Her voice sounded small even to her own ears.

"Don't wait meals for me." His thumb brushed her cheekbone.

Evelyn nodded, watching as he turned toward the door. At the last moment, she called out, "Liam, be safe."

He pivoted back, his stern features softening at the worry in her eyes. In three long strides he was before her again, cradling her face with surprising tenderness. "Evelyn," he breathed, "wait for me at home."

"Always," she whispered back, her smile blooming like dawn as she gazed up at him.

Liam's throat worked as he fought the urge to close the distance between them. With visible effort, he stepped back and turned away.

Evelyn scrambled after him in her slippers, reaching the grand foyer just as Ryan Sullivan opened the car door outside. To her surprise, Victoria hadn't left but stood waiting by the vehicle with military patience.

An unfamiliar unease twisted in Evelyn's stomach. Unlike Victoria Dawson's petty manipulations, Victoria Hudson's devotion was genuine - the kind that endured years and distance without expectation.

Had Liam not fallen for Evelyn first, he might have married this remarkable woman already. They shared a world Evelyn could never fully inhabit - the same profession, the same values, the same unspoken understandings.

Leaning against the marble column, Evelyn watched the car disappear down the drive, her chest constricting with emotions she couldn't name.
###Chapter 401

Evelyn's phone vibrated in her pocket. She pulled it out with trembling fingers, the screen illuminating her pale face.

A bank notification flashed - Rosalind had transferred another payment.

Month after month, Rosalind kept sending these small installments. Evelyn felt a knot form in her stomach.

Despite living paycheck to paycheck, Rosalind never missed a payment. Her determination was admirable.

If Evelyn hadn't been living under the alias Cassandra, she'd never have met someone like Rosalind - a woman fighting against all odds.

Rosalind had no fancy degree, no powerful connections. Just two hands and an unbreakable will to save her dying father.

The medical bills were astronomical. They'd sold everything - the house, the car, even family heirlooms.

To Evelyn, the money meant nothing. She didn't need repayment. But Rosalind insisted - it was about dignity.

The thought of Rosalind working three jobs made Evelyn's chest tighten.

She hit dial.

"Cassandra?" Rosalind's voice came through, hushed. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn smiled. "I got your transfer. Really, you don't have to pay me back right now. Wait until-"

"Is it not enough?" Rosalind interrupted.

"You know that's not what I mean."

Rosalind sighed. "I know you don't want my money. But our friendship isn't about you being the famous artist Isabella or the heiress to Aldenria's fortune. Understand?"

"I do."

"I'm at work right now. Can't talk long."

"Where are you working today?"

"Day off. Selling handmade jewelry by the pier," Rosalind said.

Evelyn made a decision. "Send me your location. I want to help."

"Sure thing."

The call ended. A pin dropped on Evelyn's map.

She grabbed her bag and dashed out.

In the taxi, Evelyn rolled down the window. The wind whipped through her hair as buildings blurred past.

Suddenly, the car slowed.

"Damn accident up ahead," the driver grumbled.

Evelyn's heart jumped. She leaned forward.

Through the windshield, she spotted familiar figures. Her breath caught when she recognized Liam.

He stood between two crumpled cars, seemingly unharmed.

"Stop the car!" Evelyn demanded.

"Lady, we're in the middle lane!" the driver snapped.

Frantically, Evelyn dialed Liam's number, eyes locked on him as the call connected.

Then she saw it - Victoria taking Liam's hand, leading him toward another car.

The gesture looked intimate. Natural.

Evelyn's throat tightened as the phone rang. A cold weight settled in her chest.

Why wasn't Liam pulling away?

"Hello, Cass," Liam's voice came through.

Evelyn pushed down her unease. "Liam! Are you hurt? I saw the accident!"

Before he could answer, Victoria's voice cut in. "She tracking you now? How'd she know about this?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Just how close were they that Victoria could hear their conversation?
###Chapter 402

Liam fell silent for a long moment.

Instead of questioning how Evelyn had discovered his car's identification, he asked anxiously, "Cassandra, are you outside?"

Evelyn answered casually, "Yes, I was on my way to meet Rosalind when I spotted you."

Concern laced Liam's voice as he pressed, "Do you have security with you? Is Rosalind there?"

There was a brief pause before Evelyn replied, "I'm alone. Didn't bring anyone."

Liam's voice grew urgent. "Share your location. I'll send someone immediately."

Silence stretched between them again as Evelyn realized Liam hadn't even acknowledged her discovery about his car. Despite her concerns, he seemed solely focused on her safety.

"Liam, it's fine," she reassured him. "Just meeting a friend. Rosalind will join me soon."

Liam's tone turned stern yet caring, like an overprotective older brother. "Next time you go out, you must inform me first. Never go anywhere alone, understood?"

Evelyn mumbled her reluctant agreement, then countered, "And what about you?"

Liam exhaled before remembering to update her. "Got rear-ended by another vehicle. Nothing serious though."

"Are you hurt?" Evelyn's voice tightened with worry.

"No, I'm fine," Liam assured her.

A pang of jealousy shot through Evelyn as she recalled Liam holding hands with Victoria. She wanted to confront him but couldn't find the words.

Victoria's mocking voice suddenly cut through the silence. "Even spare tires need emotional maintenance these days. With how she fusses over you, when will you upgrade her from backup status?"

Evelyn's heart went numb at the words.

Since when had she ever considered Liam a backup?

Was Victoria deliberately stirring trouble?

Evelyn suppressed a sigh and whispered, "Liam, is that constant buzzing noise coming from Victoria?"

"You heard that?" Liam sounded surprised.

Evelyn forced a bitter smile. "Would you prefer I hadn't?"

"That's not what I meant," Liam quickly clarified.

Her mood darkened further. "How close is she to be eavesdropping? Her voice carries right through the microphone."

The prolonged silence that followed made Evelyn wonder if Liam had muted the call to speak privately with Victoria.

Her frustration grew at Victoria's habitual boundary-crossing and manipulative tendencies. She could only hope Liam would recognize Victoria's behavior and maintain distance.

But Liam's next words left her speechless.

"Cassandra, Victoria has a habit of speaking casually. Her comment wasn't meant to offend you. It was just our usual banter, not directed at you."

Evelyn responded with a disdainful snort, choosing silence.

Receiving no reaction, Liam grew uneasy and added, "Victoria and I are like siblings. She doesn't filter her words around me either."

Evelyn couldn't contain her scorn any longer. "Very well then," she said icily. "I wish you and your sibling-like relationship all the best."

With that, she abruptly ended the call.
###Chapter 403

Evelyn's blood boiled with barely contained fury. The realization that Liam remained oblivious to Victoria Hudson's blatant admiration for him made her grip her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

What kind of bond did he think they shared? Was he truly this blind to the way Victoria practically worshipped him?

The moment Evelyn ended their call, Liam's number flashed across her screen again.

She declined with a sharp tap, only for it to ring a second time.

"My battery's dying," she typed hastily before powering off her device completely.

The cab pulled up along the bustling riverside promenade.

Tourists meandered between colorful stalls lining the wide boulevard, their laughter mixing with the scent of street food.

Evelyn wove through the crowd until she spotted Rosalind's stall at the far end.

"Cassandra!" Rosalind's face lit up like sunshine, jumping from her stool to wave enthusiastically.

Evelyn forced a smile as she approached, though her heart ached at the sight of Rosalind's modest display - handmade trinkets and costume jewelry arranged neatly on a folding table.

Even if Rosalind sold everything, she'd barely clear five hundred dollars.

Rosalind gestured to the lone stool. "Sit! I've been swamped all morning - couldn't even check my messages!"

"Business is good today?" Evelyn asked softly, watching as Rosalind crouched beside her.

Rosalind beamed. "Hit two hundred already! If this keeps up, I might make six hundred by closing."

Evelyn's smile faltered as she reached for Rosalind's calloused hands.

A customer interrupted, picking up a beaded bracelet. "How much?"

"Fifteen dollars," Rosalind answered smoothly, springing up. "The celestial pattern complements fair skin beautifully."

The woman tried it on, then set it down and walked away without another word.

Rosalind waved cheerfully before squatting again. "Bored yet?"

Evelyn shook her head. She wasn't bored - she was calculating how to help without offending Rosalind's pride.

"Rosalind," she began carefully, "you work six days a week at the hospital, then do this on your only day off. It's not sustainable."

Rosalind patted her hand. "I'm tougher than I look."

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Is there a stationery shop nearby?"

"About three blocks east." Rosalind tilted her head. "Why?"

"I'll be back," Evelyn said, already striding away with purpose in her steps. The solution had come to her in a flash of inspiration.
###Chapter 404

The crisp afternoon air carried the scent of freshly brewed coffee from nearby stalls as Evelyn returned, her arms laden with supplies. Rosalind's brow furrowed in confusion when she saw the small folding table and art supplies.

With practiced ease, Evelyn set up the makeshift workstation. She selected a pristine sheet of paper and began mixing ink with precise movements. The brush danced across the surface as she wrote in elegant calligraphy: "Free original ink painting with purchases over 100 dollars."

Rosalind's gasp was audible. "Isabella, these people are simple market-goers. They wouldn't recognize fine art if it-"

Evelyn silenced her with a knowing smile. Her fingers flew across her phone screen as she logged into her official Isabella Grayson account. The post went live instantly: "Supporting a friend's stall today. Special offer - complimentary painting with qualifying purchases."

"Just wait," Evelyn murmured, arranging her brushes with ceremonial care.

Rosalind twisted her apron nervously. "Your paintings sell for thousands at galleries. My entire inventory isn't worth one stroke of your brush. Please, don't devalue your art for me."

Evelyn held up the freshly inked sign. "I donate paintings to charity auctions regularly. Consider this another form of philanthropy." She dipped her brush with a flourish. "Besides, these quick pieces won't be gallery quality."

The skepticism lingered in Rosalind's eyes until the first luxury sedan arrived. Then another. Within thirty minutes, twelve high-end vehicles lined the curb, their polished surfaces reflecting the afternoon sun like mirrors.

A procession of sharply dressed men formed an orderly queue. Their tailored suits and polished shoes seemed out of place among the market's colorful chaos. Art dealers. Personal assistants to collectors. All bearing the same request: "I'll take everything. Might I request your signature on the artwork?"

Evelyn's refusal was polite but firm. "No signatures. No photographs. No framing services."

She knew authenticated pieces could fetch astronomical prices at auction. That wasn't the point today. Yet despite her conditions, demand became frenzied.

Rosalind's entire stall sold out within the hour. Customers clutched their purchases like winning lottery tickets, eagerly awaiting their free masterpieces. The crowd swelled with each passing minute.

Word spread like wildfire through art circles. Isabella Grayson giving away original works? The resulting stampede cleared Rosalind's inventory down to the folding chairs. "100 dollars! 1000! Name your price!" desperate collectors begged.

Media vans arrived, their satellite dishes sprouting like metallic flowers. The entire street benefited from the sudden influx of wealthy patrons. By the second hour, #IsabellaGraysonMarket had trended nationwide.

In a quiet café nearby, Evelyn savored the shepherd's pie Rosalind had insisted on buying. Across the table, her friend stared at her phone in stunned silence, fingers trembling as she refreshed her banking app.

"I always knew you were talented," Rosalind whispered. "But seeing your influence firsthand..." Her voice trailed off in awe.

Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin. "So? How much did we make today?"

Rosalind's laugh bordered on hysterical. "I stocked maybe 300 dollars worth of crafts." She turned the screen to reveal the balance. "They paid 100 dollars just for my rusty cash box!"
###Chapter 405

Evelyn smiled, genuinely pleased she could assist Rosalind. The concerns about Victoria Hudson and Liam Blackwood had long faded from her mind.

As Rosalind prepared to take a bite of her pie, she hesitated. "Cassandra, I saw in the papers that one of your paintings sold for millions. Is that true?"

Evelyn's soft smile remained as she set her fork down, dabbing her lips with a napkin. "Some do, yes. But not all. The more common pieces range from tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand."

Rosalind frowned. "Why such high prices?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Talent matters, but fame and hype drive the market. When I first started painting online for charity, my grandfather secretly bought one of my pieces for two million."

She paused, swirling her water glass. "I donated every cent to rural schools. That’s when my name exploded overnight, and everything snowballed from there."

Rosalind nodded in understanding. "So now the public sees your work as collectible masterpieces. People even replicate your style."

Evelyn gave a small, acknowledging tilt of her head.

Between bites, Rosalind mused, "The world of the wealthy is beyond me. But I envy you—having someone who loves you that deeply."

Evelyn caught the fleeting sorrow in Rosalind's eyes when she mentioned family.

"How is your father doing?" Evelyn asked gently.

Rosalind's fingers tightened around her fork. "He passed last month." Her voice wavered as she stared at her plate.

Evelyn froze, regret tightening her chest.

Rosalind had poured every penny into his treatments, even taking on debts. The surgery had seemed successful—until it wasn’t.

Misfortune always struck hardest where life was already fragile.

Evelyn reached across the table, squeezing Rosalind’s hand. "I’m so sorry."

Rosalind mustered a bright smile, shaking her head. "It’s okay. Really."

After a beat, Evelyn shifted topics. "Rosalind, weren’t you a volunteer counselor at a psychiatric hospital?"

Rosalind confirmed with a nod. "I provided free therapy for depression patients."

Evelyn considered this before offering, "There’s a part-time position available. Pays two thousand a day. Interested?"

Rosalind’s eyes widened. She clutched her chest dramatically. "What kind of job pays that much? You’re not recruiting me for something illegal, are you?"

Evelyn laughed, tossing a napkin at her. "Do I look like a criminal mastermind to you?"

Rosalind grinned. "Just checking."

"You’d be perfect for this," Evelyn said earnestly.

Curious now, Rosalind leaned in. "Alright, what’s the job?"

Evelyn lowered her voice. "Psychological counselor and caregiver for Donovan Blackwood."

Rosalind frowned. "Who’s that?"

"Liam’s older brother. He was a decorated anti-narcotics officer before... well, before everything went wrong."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. "He’s blind, paralyzed, and completely broken. Lost all will to live."

Rosalind’s hand flew to her mouth, eyes glistening. "An anti-drug officer? I’d do it for free. Tell me where to sign up."
###Chapter 406

Evelyn shook her head, releasing a quiet exhale. "No, you'll receive your payment. Otherwise, you wouldn't last thirty minutes."

Rosalind blinked in surprise. "Is the situation truly that dire?"

Driven by both financial need and admiration for the decorated anti-narcotics officer, Rosalind finally nodded in agreement.

Evelyn carefully explained Donovan's former occupation, the details of his injury, and his current medical condition to Rosalind.

As the sunset painted the horizon in crimson hues, Evelyn and Rosalind exited the restaurant, fingers intertwined.

Their footsteps halted abruptly when they spotted Liam on the main thoroughfare.

Standing before a sleek black sedan were Liam, Victoria, and Ryan.

Liam approached with stormy eyes. "Where's Rosalind Baskins? And where are the bodyguards you were supposed to have?"

Rosalind looked perplexed, unable to comprehend Liam's sudden hostility toward Evelyn. Evelyn tilted her face toward the darkening sky - clearly, Liam's diplomatic banquet had concluded early.

Her gaze traveled from Liam to Victoria, and an uncomfortable chill ran down her spine.

Instead of answering directly, Evelyn countered, "How did you know I'd be here?"

Hands buried in his pockets, Liam responded frostily, "You're practically a celebrity now. Did you truly think your movements wouldn't be noticed?"

Evelyn fell silent.

Though she understood Liam's protective instincts, seeing Victoria standing so close to him ignited something ugly in her chest.

Sensing the mounting tension, Rosalind attempted to mediate. "Actually—" she began.

Victoria cut her off, stepping forward to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Liam.

"You've been ignoring Liam's calls all afternoon before shutting off your phone completely," Victoria accused. "Do you have any idea how worried he's been?"

"Because of your childish behavior, he couldn't focus during the entire state dinner. For someone claiming to be an adult, you're remarkably irresponsible."

Evelyn stared at Victoria, momentarily speechless at her audacity.

Who did Victoria think she was? What gave her the right to lecture Evelyn about her relationship?

Evelyn refused to dignify Victoria's interference with a direct response. Instead, she turned to Liam, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears of confusion and hurt.

Did Liam share Victoria's opinion? Did he too think her immature? She searched his face for answers, but he remained frustratingly silent.

With a bitter smile, Evelyn finally addressed Victoria. "I texted Liam that my battery died."

Victoria's expression darkened. "That's a lie. Your phone's been fully charged this entire time."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists at her sides as she continued staring at Liam. The betrayal stung more than she cared to admit.

She didn't give a damn about Victoria's opinions. She only needed to understand why Liam seemed to endollarse this public humiliation.

Rosalind noticed the subtle tremor in Evelyn's fingers. The anguish radiating from her friend was palpable.

Rounding on Victoria, Rosalind snapped, "Who appointed you relationship counselor? This is between the two of them."

Victoria's face twisted in outrage, her eyes flashing dangerously at Rosalind's interference.

Rosalind merely scoffed. "What? Did I strike a nerve? Or was I mistaken?"
###Chapter 407

Victoria Hudson arched a perfectly sculpted brow, crossing her arms as she shot Evelyn a disdainful look. "What exactly is your relationship with Liam? Does she even consider you his girlfriend? Or are you just stringing him along without any commitment?"

Ryan Sullivan quickly intervened, pulling Victoria back with a hushed warning. "Ms. Hudson, please don't make a scene."

Victoria shook off Ryan's hand, her irritation palpable. "I feel sorry for Liam. How dare you play with his feelings like this?"

Evelyn remained silent, her tear-filled eyes locking with Liam's as an unbearable weight settled in her chest.

Did Liam truly agree with everything Victoria said? Was she really that terrible?

Her heart heavy, Evelyn grasped Rosalind's hand and turned away, her voice barely above a whisper. "Rosalind, let's go."

"Of course," Rosalind replied, falling into step beside her.

Just as they moved to leave, Liam stepped forward, blocking Evelyn's path. His intense gaze bore into hers, his voice deceptively soft. "Where do you think you're going?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip, struggling to contain her emotions. She met his gaze with quiet resignation, accusation burning in her eyes.

Yet Liam remained oblivious to her turmoil. "Come back to Blackwood Manor with me," he said firmly. "Bring your friend. It's not safe for you to be wandering around."

Rosalind scoffed. "What danger could there possibly be? Aldenria has excellent security—cameras everywhere, police patrols. There's no need for your concern, Mr. Blackwood."

Liam sighed, shooting Rosalind a look that clearly said 'ignorance is bliss.'

Evelyn, however, knew better. After her identity had been exposed at Obsidian Circle's headquarters, nowhere was truly safe for her.

Finally regaining her composure, Evelyn spoke in an icy tone. "Mr. Blackwood, I appreciate your concern, but I won't be returning to your home."

"I wouldn't want your 'close friend' accusing me of leading you on without commitment," she added, emphasizing the words 'close friend' with bitter clarity.

With that, she took Rosalind's hand and walked past Liam.

Liam felt as if he'd been struck.

Not coming back?

The words cut deeper than any blade.

Had all their shared moments meant nothing? The nights she'd stayed by his side while he recovered, the intimacy they'd shared—had it all been an act?

Was she so eager to leave now that he was healed?

A cold, humorless smile twisted Liam's lips as his chest tightened with barely contained fury. His fists clenched at his sides, nails biting into his palms.

After a moment, he spun on his heel and caught up to Evelyn in three long strides. His hand closed around her arm, pulling her away from Rosalind.

Evelyn stumbled back, her face draining of color as she found herself mere inches from Liam's stormy expression.

The intensity in his dark eyes was terrifying—a turbulent mix of affection, anger, and something far more dangerous. The air around them grew thick, suffocating.

Before Evelyn could steady her racing heart, Liam's commanding voice cut through the tension. "You're coming home with me."

"I don't want to," Evelyn shot back defiantly.

Liam's grip tightened imperceptibly, his gaze turning glacial. "Is it in your nature to be this capricious?" he accused.

Evelyn recoiled as if struck, the words settling like ice in her veins.

First she was accused of toying with his feelings, now she was being called fickle?
###Chapter 408

Evelyn's thoughts spiraled deeper into despair. Her eyes flickered toward Victoria, who stood behind Liam like a shadow.

That woman must be reveling in this moment. Victoria probably found twisted pleasure watching their relationship crumble.

A lump formed in Evelyn's throat as tears threatened to spill. She recognized her mistakes, every misstep that led them here.

But she needed Liam to choose her - not just as someone he liked, but as the woman who held his heart. The realization made her vision blur with unshed tears.

With forced indifference, she said, "Yes, I'm that capricious. You got hurt because of me, and I nursed you back to health. Consider my duty fulfilled."

"Duty?" Liam's voice cracked on the word.

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "So you only feel responsible for my physical wounds?"

Evelyn gnawed on her lower lip, unable to meet his gaze.

She knew exactly how her words wounded him, yet they'd tumbled out anyway. Instant regret flooded her senses.

Liam's breath hitched, his eyes turning glassy. His grip on her arm tightened - as if she might vanish the moment he let go.

"Sweetheart," he murmured, voice thick with emotion, "my recovery isn't complete. Your responsibility remains unfulfilled."

"I'll stay as long as you need. But when you're ready, I'll take you home."

The tenderness in his words melted Evelyn's resolve. Despite Victoria's venom, despite Liam not defending her, the fight drained from her.

Victoria's sudden outburst shattered the moment. "Liam! Why are you debasing yourself? Have you lost all self-respect?"

The intrusion hardened Evelyn's heart again.

Ignoring Victoria, she locked eyes with Liam. "Should outsiders be meddling in our affairs?"

Before Liam could respond, Victoria's voice rose shrilly. "I'm his oldest friend! I won't stand by while you break his heart. What? You can play with his feelings but I can't speak up?"

Evelyn's composure snapped. "How exactly am I playing with him?"

Victoria planted her hands on her hips. "He had an entire medical team! You're not special for playing nurse for a few days."

"And that kiss? If you don't love him, why lead him on? Disgusting behavior."

The verbal assault left Evelyn trembling. She clenched her fists, unable to counter the accusations.

Tears welled in her bloodshot eyes as she searched Liam's face. Never had she expected such public humiliation.

The nearly deserted street seemed to close in around them.

Twilight painted the scene in melancholic hues, the soft glow of streetlights casting long shadows.

Evelyn bit her quivering lip, tears clinging to her lashes. She silently pleaded for Liam to intervene.

"Do you... feel the same way?" The question scraped her throat raw.

Liam's gaze held oceans of unspoken words, but he remained silent.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Do you believe I've been toying with you?"

When Liam reached for her hand, hope flickered in her chest. "Then give me a real place in your life," he said.

Her heart shattered. Not only had he failed to defend her, he'd essentially taken Victoria's side.
###Chapter 409

Was he protecting Victoria?

The thought flashed through Evelyn's mind. She even suspected Liam was merely clinging to some childhood nostalgia, some unrequited affection from their youth. He couldn't possibly love her that deeply.

He wouldn't even hurt Victoria for her sake.

Evelyn drew a shaky breath before violently wrenching her wrist from Liam's grasp. Tremors of rage coursed through her as bitterness flooded her senses, her heart constricting painfully.

"Don't touch me!" she screamed.

Tears cascaded down her cheeks uncontrollably. She staggered backward, putting distance between them.

She scrubbed at her face desperately, but the gesture only made her feel more wretched - like some pitiful creature no one could understand or love.

Rosalind couldn't bear to watch. "Let's go," she murmured, seizing Evelyn's hand and pulling her away. Evelyn kept wiping her tears as she cried, unable to resist one last glance over her shoulder.

Ryan trailed behind them.

Liam and Victoria remained frozen in place.

Her heart shattered beyond repair. Every decision she'd made now seemed catastrophically wrong.

Liam wasn't worth abandoning her research career at Solterra. He wasn't worth returning to Aldenria for.

The more Evelyn dwelled on it, the more devastated she became. This time, she didn't look back as Rosalind led her away. Beneath the streetlights, Liam watched Evelyn's silhouette dissolve into the night. His expression darkened, features hardening into something terrifying.

Victoria exhaled in relief. She approached him cautiously. "Liam, don't waste your energy on her. That sort of woman isn't worth-"

"What sort of woman?" Liam's voice could have frozen hell.

Victoria flinched at his glacial tone. She swallowed hard before trying again. "Don't dwell on it. Let's just head back."

Liam's piercing gaze locked onto her. "Victoria, I'll admit I'm despicable. Using your connections to pressure Cassandra into giving me status."

Victoria gaped, speechless.

"You should know I'm utterly devoted to her," Liam continued, voice laced with warning. "If you value our friendship at all, learn your place."

"But I was only-"

"I don't need your defense."

"What has Cassandra done to bewitch you like this?"

Liam's expression shifted dangerously. He brushed past her. "Consider our friendship terminated."

Victoria panicked, darting in front of him. "I'm sorry! I swear I won't interfere or speak against Cassandra again! We've been friends for decades - you can't just end it like this!"

Liam paused, features softening slightly.

Encouraged, Victoria pressed, "If you love her so much, why let her walk away devastated? Why not chase after her? Liam?"

Liam remained silent, face unreadable. He strode past her toward his car.

Victoria hurried after him. When she reached for the passenger door, she found it locked.

She rapped on the window. "Liam? I'm still out here!"

Liam didn't spare her a glance. The engine roared to life as he sped away.
###Chapter 410

The night was deep, but Blackwood Manor remained illuminated like daylight.

In the grand living room, Liam Blackwood sat slumped on the leather sofa. His muscular frame sank into the cushions as one hand covered his tired eyes, shielding them from the harsh light. The other arm draped carelessly over the sofa's back.

His tailored suit jacket lay discarded nearby. The silk tie hung loosely around his neck, its knot undone. The top buttons of his crisp white shirt gaped open, revealing a glimpse of his toned chest.

He didn't move. His powerful body remained frozen in position, the picture of exhaustion in his disheveled state.

An aura of profound loneliness clung to him like a second skin.

The alcohol from tonight's diplomatic banquet was finally taking its toll. The liquor burned through his veins, amplifying his anguish tenfold. He couldn't erase Evelyn's tear-streaked face from his mind - those wounded eyes haunting his every thought.

Had he lost his mind? How could he possibly expect Evelyn to define their relationship under Victoria's cruel pressure?

Friends? Lovers? Was he truly this desperate for validation?

He'd always maintained strict boundaries with women. But this was Cassandra Wright. For her, he'd throw every rule out the window.

If she wanted to play with his heart, flirt shamelessly, even take him to bed - he'd gladly comply if it brought her happiness.

The sudden ringing of his phone shattered the silence.

Liam lowered his hand and straightened. He grabbed the buzzing device from the coffee table, his voice rough with emotion as he answered, "Is she back?"

Ryan Sullivan's tense voice replied, "General Blackwood, Ms. Wright went bar-hopping with her friend. She even danced with some stranger."

Liam bent forward, elbows on knees, face buried in his hands. "Let her enjoy herself. But keep her safe. Bring her home when she's done."

Ryan sounded exasperated. "Sir, I've tried multiple times. Ms. Wright refuses to return to Blackwood Manor. She insists on going back to Wright Estate when she's finished."

Several heartbeats passed before Liam responded, his tone turning steely. "If she won't come willingly, then carry her back by force."

"Yes, General," Ryan acknowledged before ending the call.

Tossing the phone aside, Liam leaned back and closed his burning eyes.

Two hours later, the clock struck 1:30 AM.

The sound of tires crunching gravel jolted Liam awake. He sprang to his feet and strode outside.

Ryan emerged from the driver's seat and opened the rear door. Liam approached, his piercing gaze locking onto the figure slumped in the backseat.

"General, Ms. Wright drank heavily. She's completely intoxicated," Ryan reported.

Liam's jaw tightened. "Did you see her friend home safely?"

"Yes, sir. She's secure."

Without another word, Liam leaned in and gathered Evelyn into his arms.

Her glassy eyes focused hazily on his face. Suddenly her delicate features twisted in anger. Small fists pounded weakly against his chest. "Put me down, Liam, you bastard!" she slurred, struggling weakly. "Don't touch me... Go carry your precious Victoria instead!"

Liam carried her inside with measured steps, heading straight for the staircase.

Evelyn thrashed drunkenly until tears spilled down her flushed cheeks. "Liam..." she sobbed against his shoulder, "I hate you... I'll never... never love you again..."

As Liam entered the bedroom and moved to lay her down, her words struck him like a physical blow. He froze, his entire world tilting on its axis.

His heart plummeted into an endless void - dark, hollow, consuming. The freefall left him gasping, adrift in unbearable emptiness.

A bitter smile twisted his lips as infinite sorrow filled his eyes. "Then who do you love?" he whispered into the darkness.
###Chapter 411

Evelyn drifted in and out of consciousness when she heard the question.

"Who do you love?"

Her eyelids fluttered open, the world swimming before her. Blinking slowly, the shadowy figure before her came into focus.

Liam's chiseled features filled her blurred vision.

A bitter smile touched her lips before she closed her eyes again without answering.

The velvet softness of his voice came again. "Cassandra, who holds your heart? Tell me who you love."

Her chest tightened painfully. The nausea worsened as she whispered, "Liam."

He froze, his entire body going rigid.

Had she just confessed? Or was she simply calling his name?

The sickness rose higher in her throat. She squirmed in his arms, repeating weakly, "Liam."

Understanding dawned. "Yes?" he responded.

"I'm going to be sick," Evelyn gasped, fighting the rising bile.

Liam swept her into the bathroom, supporting her as she collapsed before the toilet.

The moment her knees hit the cold tiles, Evelyn wretched violently. Liam's strong hands steadied her shoulders while he grabbed tissues.

When the spasms subsided, he handed her mouthwash and a fresh towel.

Water splashed onto her blouse as she rinsed. The vomiting left her momentarily clear-headed but weak.

Liam lifted her effortlessly, his arms encircling her from behind at the sink. Evelyn melted against his solid chest, her back pressed flush against him as he guided her hands under the cool stream.

"Liam," she murmured drowsily, "my clothes... wet... uncomfortable."

He dried her hands with tender care. "I'll get your sleepwear. Can you manage alone?"

A small nod. "Yes."

After seating her carefully on the closed toilet lid, he warned, "Don't move. I'll be right back."

Her head drooped in exhausted agreement.

Liam strode to her walk-in closet, rummaging through drawers until he found silk pajamas. His fingers hesitated over delicate lace undergarments before selecting a simple white set.

The sound of running water stopped him cold.

He burst back into the bathroom - and immediately regretted it.

The sight before him stole his breath. Swearing under his breath, he retreated, slamming the door behind him.

Leaning against the hallway wall, Liam dragged in ragged breaths. Heat flooded his body from neck to ears.

She'd been standing there, gloriously unclothed beneath the shower spray.

Reason returned slowly. Showering while intoxicated was dangerous - she could fall, hit her head...

Steeling himself, he reentered, wrapping a towel around her dripping form before shutting off the water.

Evelyn blinked up at the showerhead in confusion. "Why'd it stop?"

Without answering, he lifted her into his arms.

"Put me down," she protested weakly. "I'm burning up..."

His pulse hammered wildly as he carried her to bed, laying her gently on the sheets before covering her with a blanket.

Yet the image of her curves remained burned behind his eyelids, stirring something primal within him.

Too shaken to dress her properly, he simply tucked the blanket tighter.

"Cassandra," he murmured near her ear, "stay awake just a little longer. Let's get you dressed."
###Chapter 412

The mattress dipped slightly as Evelyn curled into the sheets, surrendering to exhaustion.

"Cassandra?" Liam's fingertips grazed her forehead, carefully sweeping aside the tousled strands of hair. He tucked them behind her ear with unexpected tenderness.

His brow furrowed. "Cassandra, wake up," he murmured in that dangerously smooth baritone. "You can't sleep like this." The blanket slipped from her shoulders again. "You'll freeze without covers."

A faint buzzing filled Evelyn's ears. She swatted at the air irritably before rolling onto her side with a huff.

Liam exhaled through his nose. He pulled the duvet back over her trembling form.

The tension in his jaw was visible as he dragged an air mattress onto the floor. Better to put distance between them tonight.

Sleep came in fits. He found himself waking every hour to check if she'd kicked off the blankets again.

Dawn found him bleary-eyed, having spent the night in silent vigil.

Golden sunlight streamed through the balcony doors when Evelyn finally stirred. She blinked against the brightness, disoriented.

Fragmented memories surfaced. The argument with Liam. Rosalind dragging her to that speakeasy. Too many tequila shots.

Her eyes flew open.

Flashes of strong arms carrying her. Cool glass pressed to her lips. The scent of bergamot and something distinctly masculine as warm hands guided her under a shower spray.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She yanked the covers higher.

Her fingers encountered bare skin beneath the silk sheets.

"Oh god." She squeezed her eyes shut. What had she done last night?

The blanket became a shield as she peeked beneath it. A strangled gasp escaped her. "No. No no no."

She burrowed under the covers completely. Heat flooded her cheeks.

This couldn't be happening. Her first time - lost to a drunken blackout? She pounded the mattress in frustration.

Anger warred with embarrassment. At herself for drinking recklessly. At Liam for taking advantage.

Yesterday's argument still burned fresh. How dare he cross that line when she was vulnerable?

If he wanted her, why not wait until she could actually remember it? Until she could feel every—

Her teeth ground together. That insufferable man.

All those times she'd flirted, he'd played the stoic soldier. Yet the moment her defenses were down...

"Absolute bastard," she muttered, clutching the sheet to her chest. Her gaze landed on neatly folded clothes at the foot of the bed.

She dressed mechanically, mind racing. The bathroom offered temporary refuge.

No soreness. No telltale stiffness between her thighs. Wasn't the first time supposed to...?

Her phone became a frantic research tool. Search results varied wildly - some women bled, some didn't. Pain levels differed. A few reported no discomfort at all.

An hour later, she emerged no wiser.

The living room revealed Liam bent over his laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard. Morning light sculpted his profile in gold.

Her pulse skyrocketed. Every inch of skin prickled with awareness. She pressed a hand to her suddenly racing heart.
###Chapter 413

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Evelyn drew in a shaky breath, steeling herself as she took deliberate steps toward Liam.

His head lifted at the sound of her approaching footsteps, those piercing gray eyes locking onto hers.

Evelyn didn't offer any greeting. She sank onto the opposite couch with practiced indifference, her carefully constructed icy demeanor barely concealing the flush creeping up her neck. She deliberately avoided his gaze, pressing her lips into a thin line.

Liam's brow furrowed slightly as he took in her appearance - the way her cheeks burned with suppressed emotion, the telltale tension in her shoulders that betrayed both anger and something more vulnerable.

"Still feeling unwell?" His voice was impossibly soft, barely audible, but she caught the concern lacing his words.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. She forced her voice to remain steady. "Do you honestly think what you did was acceptable?"

The memory of her tear-streaked face from last night flashed through Liam's mind. He snapped his laptop shut with deliberate slowness. "I owe you an apology. It won't happen again."

Her expression twisted at his words. The implication stung like a physical blow.

It wouldn't happen again? Was that all she meant to him? Some fleeting mistake to be brushed aside?

"Liam," she ground out between clenched teeth, unshed tears making her vision swim. "What exactly are you saying?"

His chest constricted at the sight of her distress. Setting the laptop aside, he leaned forward. "Why are you crying? If my apology isn't enough, tell me what you need."

What did she need?

The bitter truth settled in her stomach - as long as she remained a researcher at Solterra, there could be nothing between them. No public relationship. Certainly no future.

"Why did you bring me back here?" The question tore from her throat, laced with months of pent-up frustration.

Liam answered without hesitation. "You're safer here with me."

A humorless laugh escaped her. She couldn't argue with his logic, which only fueled her resentment. Wordlessly, she stood to leave.

Before she could take three steps, Liam was there, his hand closing around her wrist. He turned her to face him, both hands now gripping her shoulders as he searched her face.

"Let's talk this through properly," he murmured, his thumbs brushing against her collarbones.

Evelyn wrenched away. "There's nothing to discuss."

The pain in Liam's eyes was palpable. "Tell me what's wrong," he pleaded quietly. "Don't shut me out like this."

She remained stubbornly silent, glaring up at him with wounded pride.

Liam exhaled sharply. "Cassandra," he breathed, his voice rough with emotion. "Do you have feelings for me?"

Evelyn bit down hard on her lower lip. "No," she lied after a beat.

The hurt that flashed across his features nearly undid her. "Then why the jealousy over Victoria? Why drown your sorrows at that bar?"

She jerked free of his grasp, putting distance between them. "You knew I was upset, yet you still took her side. Is that how you treat someone you care about?"

Liam's breath hitched. "You admit it then? You do feel something?"

"No!" The denial came too quickly. "I don't... not anymore."

The words hung between them like a death sentence. Liam's hands trembled as he reached for her, only for Evelyn to twist away.

His arms fell uselessly to his sides.

"Not anymore?" he repeated hoarsely. A bitter smile twisted his lips. "So there was a time when you did?"

Evelyn inhaled sharply, struggling to maintain her composure. "You still don't understand what you've done wrong."

"Then explain it to me," Liam demanded, his voice breaking. "Because I'm clearly missing something vital here."
###Chapter 414

Evelyn struggled to contain her emotions as her fingers curled into tight fists. When she finally regained composure, her voice trembled as she asked, "Between me and Victoria, who would you choose?"

Liam didn't hesitate. "I choose you."

"Then why did you treat me that way yesterday?" Evelyn's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "Even when Victoria said those horrible things to me, you didn't defend me. You agreed with her."

"I'm sorry," Liam murmured.

Evelyn turned away sharply. "I don't accept your apology."

"Cassandra—" His voice cracked with emotion as he watched her walk away.

In three long strides, he caught up and wrapped his arms around her from behind, holding her so tightly she couldn't escape.

Evelyn froze. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.

Liam buried his face in the curve of her neck. "I want to be with you," he confessed, his voice raw. "Not just as your protector, but as your partner. That's why I let Victoria test you."

His arms tightened. "Do you think it didn't kill me to see you hurting? I was dying inside."

Evelyn discreetly wiped her cheeks.

Liam exhaled shakily, his warm breath ghosting over her skin. "I needed to know if I mattered to you. If you'd feel anything for me."

Evelyn's knees nearly buckled at his proximity.

"I already told you," she whispered. "If I can return to Aldenria safely, we'll get married. Wasn't that promise enough?"

Liam wished he could keep her locked in his embrace forever. "Tell me you love me," he begged. "Tell me this marriage isn't just duty."

Evelyn squirmed in his grasp. "I can't make any promises right now."

"I'll wait," he vowed.

Her voice dropped to a shy whisper. "Does that mean... you won't touch me anymore?"

Liam pulled back slightly, confused. "I'm touching you right now."

"You said it wouldn't happen again," she accused, cheeks flaming.

Realization dawned. Liam turned her to face him, tilting her chin up. "You remember last night?"

Evelyn shook her head violently. "Not really. Did you... or was it me?"

A slow smile spread across Liam's face. "It was definitely you."

Evelyn groaned in mortification. "I'm so sorry, Liam."

His expression turned serious. "Don't be. Just take responsibility."

"I—" Evelyn's protest died as she tentatively slid her arms around his waist. "I can't do that right now."

Liam pressed a tender kiss to her forehead. "I'll wait," he repeated. "However long it takes."

Evelyn rested her head against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. For the first time since the incident, she felt safe. Protected. Wanted.

Neither noticed Victoria watching from the shadows, her nails digging bloody crescents into her palms.
###Chapter 415

Ryan's sudden cough shattered the intimate moment.

Evelyn immediately pulled away from Liam's embrace, her cheeks flushing as she lowered her gaze.

Liam's eyes remained tender as he reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear with deliberate gentleness.

Ryan tactfully averted his gaze. "General Blackwood, Rosalind is here to see Ms. Wright."

Evelyn brightened instantly. "Rosalind? Where is she?"

Moments later, Rosalind entered, offering a respectful nod. "Mr. Blackwood. Evelyn."

Evelyn rushed forward, clasping Rosalind's hands eagerly. "What brings you here?"

Rosalind's expression was unusually solemn as she addressed Liam. "Sir, I need to take Evelyn out for a while."

"Take Ryan with you," Liam insisted, noting the gravity in her tone.

Rosalind glanced at Evelyn, silently seeking her approval.

Sensing her hesitation, Evelyn turned to Liam. "Liam, we'll be fine. Rosalind can protect me."

Liam knew arguing was futile. He respected her independence too much to force the issue.

"Alright," he conceded, though concern lingered in his voice. "Be careful."

Evelyn nodded. "I will."

Rosalind assured him, "She'll be safe with me."

With that, Evelyn led Rosalind out of the room.

Ryan hesitated. "Should I follow them discreetly, sir?"

Liam sank onto the sofa, opening his laptop. "No. Let her handle her affairs."

Ryan marveled at the depth of Liam's devotion—something he'd never witnessed before.

Outside, Evelyn slid into the passenger seat of Rosalind's car.

As the vehicle merged into traffic, Evelyn broke the silence. "How are things in Solterra?"

Rosalind's grip tightened on the wheel. "Not well. The institute and government are pushing back. They want you back immediately."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, leaning back.

Rosalind continued, "They've sent someone to persuade you."

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "It won't work. My decision is final."

Rosalind hesitated. "It's Nathaniel Winslow."

Evelyn froze, her pulse quickening.

Rosalind confirmed with a grim nod. "Solterra isn't letting you go without a fight."

"I know," Evelyn muttered, closing her eyes. "Where are we going?"

"To see the imposter. She's been sentenced to life imprisonment."

Evelyn's eyes snapped open. "Life? She murdered someone and was a Valterian spy. That's all?"

Rosalind sighed. "Aldenria abolished the death penalty."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "Can I see her?"

"Already arranged."

Thirty minutes later, they faced each other through thick glass in the prison's visitation room.

The woman on the other side was a shadow of her former self—pale, haggard, yet her smirk remained icy.

Evelyn lifted the receiver.

After a prolonged silence, the woman followed suit.

"Who should I address you as?" Evelyn asked coolly. "Genevieve or Victoria?"

The woman's lips curled. "I'm Genevieve Prescott."

The name confirmed her Valterian allegiance.

"Genevieve, your organization has discarded you."

Genevieve shrugged. "I failed. Even if they wanted to rescue me, they couldn't. Not that I care."
###Chapter 416

Evelyn's brow furrowed deeply. "You really don't know? Julian's already been rescued by them," she stated coldly.

Victoria's face darkened as she shot Evelyn a suspicious glare.

Evelyn continued mercilessly, "They kidnapped two renowned researchers from Aldenria as bargaining chips to exchange for Julian."

"They specifically demanded Julian's release but left you rotting here. It wasn't that they couldn't save you - you're simply worthless to them. That's why they abandoned you."

Victoria's complexion turned ashen. "You're lying!" she screamed hysterically.

Evelyn remained impassive. "I've no reason to deceive you."

A bitter, mocking laugh escaped Victoria's lips.

Her voice trembled with barely contained rage as she spat, "I should have killed you when I had the chance! If I hadn't listened to Julian's orders to spare you, I wouldn't be in this hellhole now!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Was it you who tried to assassinate me repeatedly when you realized Liam was falling for me again?"

Tears of frustration welled up in Victoria's eyes as she sneered, "You always had the devil's own luck. Dodged every bullet like some damned cat with nine lives."

"Not only did I fail to kill you, but I even let you regain your memories. Fate truly enjoys screwing me over!"

Suddenly everything clicked for Evelyn.

Victoria's reckless actions could have exposed the entire operation - that's why Obsidian Circle had cut her loose without hesitation.

"Genevieve, where are my parents?" Evelyn demanded, still clinging to that fragile hope despite Julian's earlier claims.

Victoria froze, her expression turning unreadable.

Evelyn pressed urgently, "Tell me where they're keeping my parents!"

A cruel smirk twisted Victoria's lips. "I'll tell you everything... if you get me out of here."

Hope flared in Evelyn's chest. "They're alive then?"

"Oh yes, very much alive," Victoria taunted. "Your father is the sole heir to Aldenria's wealthiest dynasty."

"Our original plan was to replace you and claim the Wright family fortune. If that failed, we'd release your father to inherit everything, using your mother as leverage to transfer the assets to Julian."

"Do you really think Julian would let them die so easily?" Victoria gloated maliciously. "We even forced them to produce another heir - a perfect little bargaining chip."

Evelyn's heart shattered at the monstrous revelation. Her parents had been subjected to unspeakable horrors - imprisoned, violated, treated worse than breeding stock.

Victoria continued coldly, "Julian didn't trust your father's cooperation. Your mother's life alone wasn't enough collateral. He needed another hostage - hence your baby brother."

Evelyn's fists clenched until her nails drew blood. Through gritted teeth, she demanded, "Where. Are. They."

Victoria remained eerily calm. "Cassandra, get me out of here, and I'll tell you everything."

"Still under Julian's control?" Evelyn pressed.

Victoria's smile turned feral. "You'll never know unless you free me first."

Evelyn's expression darkened. After a tense silence, she realized the truth. "You don't actually know where they are, do you?"

"As an expendable asset with weak resolve, you'd be the first to break under interrogation. Julian's not stupid enough to leave you with that information."

Victoria's mask cracked. "You never intended to help me!" she shrieked. "This was all a trick to extract information!"

Evelyn hung up the phone without another word, her face an emotionless mask. As she turned to leave, Victoria's enraged screams echoed through the bulletproof glass, her face contorted in primal fury.

Evelyn didn't glance back. Rosalind fell into step behind her as they walked away from the raging storm contained within that cell.
###Chapter 417

Evelyn Carter took a deep breath, trying to steady her racing heart.

Rosalind Baskins placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Evelyn, as long as your parents are alive, that's already a miracle."

Evelyn nodded, but her emotions were a tangled mess. Relief warred with grief—her parents were alive, but trapped in a nightmare.

She clenched her fists, her mind racing with plans to rescue them and her younger brother, Dominic.

The car ride back was silent, the weight of the situation pressing down on them.

Rosalind glanced at her. "Evelyn, are we heading back to Blackwood Manor?"

"Yes," Evelyn murmured, lost in thought.

Just then, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen—Rosalind Fairchild.

"Rosalind," she answered, forcing calm into her voice.

Rosalind Fairchild sounded hesitant. "Cassandra, about that part-time job you mentioned... I think I want to try it."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily distracted. "You're free now?"

"Yes, completely."

"Good. I'm heading to the Blackwood Residence. Meet me at the gates."

Hanging up, Evelyn straightened in her seat. "Rosalind, change of plans. Take me to the Blackwood Residence."

Rosalind Baskins smoothly adjusted their route.

When they arrived, Rosalind Fairchild was already waiting, her hands clasped nervously.

After quick greetings, Evelyn led her inside, introducing her to Richard and Eleanor Blackwood. She explained the job—Donovan Blackwood needed a counselor and caregiver.

Eleanor studied Rosalind Fairchild’s delicate frame with concern. "Cassandra, I appreciate your help, but this girl isn’t cut out for this."

Rosalind Fairchild squared her shoulders. "Mrs. Blackwood, I can handle it."

Eleanor sighed. "Ms. Fairchild, you don’t understand. Since Donovan woke up, our lives have been chaos. We’ve gone through countless psychologists. No caregiver lasts more than three days—even the men end up injured."

Rosalind Fairchild shot Evelyn a nervous look. Now she understood the astronomical salary.

Evelyn squeezed her hand. "Donovan is blind and paralyzed. He’s aggressive, suicidal, and refuses help. If you’re not sure, don’t push yourself."

Rosalind Fairchild inhaled sharply. The salary flashed in her mind—enough to erase her debts in a year.

She met Eleanor’s gaze. "If I take full-time care, what’s the pay?"

Eleanor hesitated, then held up four fingers. "Forty thousand a month."

Rosalind Fairchild’s eyes lit up.

She grinned. "Mrs. Blackwood, leave Donovan to me. I’ll get him back on his feet."

Evelyn grabbed her arm. "Start part-time first. Don’t rush into this."

But Rosalind Fairchild was already sold. "I can do full-time. Trust me."

Eleanor raised a brow. "Any other requests?"

"Just meals and lodging."

"Done."

Evelyn tugged Rosalind Fairchild aside. "Let me show you Donovan first. You need to understand what you’re getting into."

After polite goodbyes to Eleanor, they stepped into the garden, heading toward the maple grove where Donovan was kept.
###Chapter 418

The maple forest cradled a charming cottage in its embrace. The surroundings were pristine, the air crisp with the scent of autumn leaves—an ideal sanctuary for healing.

Evelyn Carter tightened her grip on Rosalind Fairchild's hand as they approached. Her voice was hushed but urgent.

"His name is Donovan Blackwood. Thirty years old. Former anti-narcotics officer with a decorated career—brave, relentless."

She exhaled sharply.

"For years, he worked undercover near the borders of Aldenria. Infiltrated cartels, orchestrated cross-border raids. Never wavered from his mission."

Rosalind listened, her brow furrowing.

"Because of him, countless shipments were seized. Lives saved."

Evelyn's voice cracked.

"But this time... they found out. Tortured him for days. By the time they got to him, he wasn’t breathing."

A pause. The weight of it pressed between them.

"The doctors brought him back. But when he woke up—" Evelyn swallowed hard. "—he couldn’t see. Couldn’t walk. And he hasn’t stopped wishing they’d let him die."

Rosalind’s jaw clenched. "If the job was that dangerous, why can’t he fight through this? Why give up?"

Evelyn’s laugh was bitter. "Living like this? It’s worse than death. At least a martyr’s end would mean something." She hesitated. "There’s more. His first love betrayed him."

Rosalind stiffened. "His girlfriend sold him out?"

"Not his girlfriend. His first love. They broke up years ago. He found her in a cartel den—trapped, manipulated into running drugs."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

"He tried to save her. She spat in his face. Believed every lie the cartel fed her. Then she told them everything—that Donovan trained at Aldenria’s police academy, that he’d been undercover for months."

Rosalind’s breath hissed between her teeth. "Where is that bitch now?"

"Donovan dragged her out before the raid. She walked away unharmed. He didn’t." Evelyn’s voice dropped to a whisper. "They broke him. When they were done, he prayed to die. Now he’s blind. Paralyzed. And she’s never even visited."

They reached the cottage.

Evelyn hesitated at the door, her hand trembling. "He’s not the man you’re expecting."

Rosalind shoved the door open without knocking.

The stench of whiskey and despair hit like a wall. Sunlight fought through cracks in the curtains, losing to the gloom. The air was thick with something unspeakable—grief, maybe. Or rage.

"Get. Out."

The voice was a blade—rusted, jagged, but lethal.

Evelyn flinched. "Donovan, it’s me. Cassandra. I brought someone—Rosalind Fairchild. She wants to—"

A bottle shattered at their feet. Glass skittered across the floor.

Evelyn stumbled back, pale.

Rosalind stepped in front of her, eyes scanning the shadows. "You okay?"

Evelyn nodded, shaky.

Rosalind turned toward the darkness. "He’s really blind? Can’t walk?"

Another nod.

"Good."

Before Evelyn could stop her, Rosalind strode inside. Past the wreckage of furniture. Past the man slumped in a chair like a discarded weapon.

She wrenched the curtains open.

Light exploded into the room.

Donovan Blackwood snarled, recoiling—but Rosalind was already at the balcony doors, throwing them wide. A gust of wind rushed in, scattering papers, stirring the stale air.

The cottage breathed again.

And for the first time in months, so did he.
###Chapter 419

"Get out!" Donovan's voice thundered through the room as he seized a nearby bottle and hurled it against the wall.

The sound of shattering glass echoed sharply, fragments scattering across the floor. Evelyn gasped, covering her mouth in alarm. She feared Rosalind might get hurt. But Rosalind moved swiftly, dodging the flying shards before pushing Donovan's wheelchair into a safer corner.

Seeing this, Evelyn rushed into the living room to help Rosalind gather all the dangerous items into bags and haul them outside.

Donovan sat slumped in his chair, his arms limp at his sides, his head lolling back weakly. He looked like a man who had given up on life entirely.

Rosalind approached him cautiously, studying his disheveled appearance. His unkempt hair fell over his hollow eyes, his gaunt face shadowed by days of unshaved stubble. His frail frame was swallowed by an oversized shirt and loose pants.

At that moment, he was nothing more than a hollow shell—empty, broken, and devoid of any will to live.

Evelyn stepped closer, her eyes brimming with tears. "Donovan, please," she whispered, her voice trembling. "If you keep refusing to eat or rest, your body won’t survive. You’ll waste away."

Rosalind gently guided Evelyn toward the door. "Go home," she said firmly. "Leave him to me."

She met Evelyn's worried gaze with quiet determination. "Give me one year. I'll not only clear your debts, but I'll also get this man back on his feet."

Evelyn hadn’t expected repayment, but she desperately hoped Rosalind could help Donovan. With a hesitant nod, she stepped outside.

As the door closed behind her, unease settled in her chest. She lingered, torn between leaving and staying.

Inside, Rosalind locked the door before turning back to Donovan. Her expression shifted from gentle concern to steely resolve.

"Listen carefully, Donovan," she said, her voice low but unyielding. "I'm Rosalind Fairchild. Starting today, I'm your full-time caregiver."

She stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. "I'm in charge of everything—your meals, your hygiene, your routine. Whether you like it or not, you will cooperate."

Donovan didn’t react.

"Leave," he muttered coldly.

Rosalind ignored him. "No more alcohol. You’ll shave, shower daily, and eat five small meals. You’ll exercise for two hours and spend an hour in sunlight."

She crossed her arms. "I’ll read to you—motivational books, current affairs. You will engage with the world again."

A bitter laugh escaped Donovan’s lips. He sounded derisive, as if the very idea was absurd.

Rosalind didn’t flinch. She moved behind him and pushed his wheelchair toward the bathroom, shutting the door behind them.

Outside, Evelyn hesitated, her hand hovering near the doorknob.

Then—a loud crash.

Something heavy hit the floor. Donovan’s furious shout followed.

"Don’t touch me! Get out!"

Rosalind’s sharp retort cut through. "Stop fighting me!"

"Go to hell!"

"If you were half the man you used to be, you’d fight back properly. Until then, you’ll do as I say."

A growl. "You insane woman—stop trying to undress me!"

Rosalind scoffed. "Insane? You drove me to this. If you cooperated, would I need to bathe a grown man? No? Then brace yourself—it’s only going to get worse."

Evelyn pressed her ear to the door, her pulse racing. The struggle inside sounded intense.

Rosalind’s methods were extreme, but Evelyn prayed they’d work.

For Donovan’s sake.
###Chapter 420

Rosalind's information might prove valuable.

Evelyn could only pray for them before departing from Blackwood Manor.

The car ride back to Blackwood Estate felt endless. Each passing mile weighed heavier on her shoulders.

She pushed open the grand oak doors with exhaustion. The revelations from Solterra, her parents' captivity, and Donovan's deteriorating health pressed upon her like physical weights.

It was becoming too much to bear.

As she slipped off her shoes in the foyer, her gaze fell upon Liam lounging on the velvet sofa. The sight of him intensified her sorrow tenfold.

An overwhelming urge to collapse into his embrace seized her.

Liam immediately set aside his phone upon hearing her return. "Sweetheart," he murmured, his voice wrapping around her like warm sunlight.

Evelyn rushed forward, burying her face against his broad chest. She inhaled his familiar cedar scent, seeking solace.

Liam froze momentarily, arms suspended in midair. Then slowly, deliberately, he enfolded her - one hand cradling her head, the other drawing comforting circles on her back.

"What troubles you, my love?" His breath stirred her hair.

"I'm just... so exhausted," she whispered into his shirt.

"Tell me everything." His fingers traced patterns along her spine. "Let me share your burdens."

Evelyn remained silent, the words sticking in her throat. How could she explain Solterra's ultimatum about Aldenria?

"Liam," she finally said, nuzzling closer. "Just hold me."

His heartbeat accelerated beneath her ear. When his lips brushed her forehead, something inside her fractured.

They stood entwined in the dimming light, two souls clinging together as shadows lengthened across the marble floors.

Eventually, she pulled away enough to meet his gaze. "I visited that imposter Victoria today."

Liam cupped her face, thumbs brushing away unshed tears. "And?"

"She claims my parents live. That Julian has them imprisoned somewhere. And... I have a baby brother."

His grip tightened reassuringly. "As long as the family assets remain beyond Julian's reach, they're safe."

Evelyn nodded. "I also saw Donovan. His condition worsens daily. The doctors say-"

"Evelyn." Liam's interruption startled her.

"Yes?"

His jaw tensed visibly. "Next time you visit Donovan, I'm coming with you."

"Why?" She tilted her head in confusion.

"No reason." The forced casualness in his tone rang false as he retreated to the sofa.

"Alright." Too weary to press further, she massaged her stiff neck. "I need to rest."

As she turned toward the staircase, Liam's voice halted her mid-step. "Evelyn."

She pivoted to face him. Moonlight through the windows cast his sharp features in silver relief.

"Come to the border with me."

The words hung between them like an unspoken plea. Evelyn's breath caught. This was it - his recovery complete, duty calling him back to military service.

Valtoria's border lay far from Aldenria. Visits would become rare, brief, stolen moments between deployments.

She schooled her features into careful neutrality. "When do you leave?"

"After Mother's birthday celebration." His gaze never wavered. "This assignment... it may be some time before I return."

The unspoken words echoed louder than what was said. This wasn't just another deployment - it was the beginning of their separation.
###Chapter 421

Evelyn clenched her fists slowly, trying to steady the storm raging inside her before speaking. "Liam, can I have some time to think?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Take all the time you need," Liam responded, his deep voice laced with patience.

With leaden steps, Evelyn ascended the staircase. Each step felt heavier than the last, her heart sinking deeper into an abyss of uncertainty. Returning to her room, she freshened up mechanically, carrying all her unspoken fears into the realm of dreams.

Hours later - or perhaps mere minutes, time had lost all meaning - Evelyn felt a feather-light touch on her lips. Warm breath caressed her cheek, sending delicate shivers down her spine. She blinked open sleep-heavy eyes to find Liam stealing a kiss.

Her reaction was instantaneous. Without conscious thought, her hands flew to his neck, pulling him closer as she returned the kiss with unexpected fervor.

Liam stiffened in surprise. When he tried to pull away, Evelyn only tightened her grip, deepening the kiss with a passion that surprised them both.

Sensing her desire to shift positions, Liam's strong arms encircled her waist, effortlessly maneuvering them sideways. Evelyn melted into him, their bodies molding together as the kiss grew more urgent, more desperate.

The temperature in the room seemed to rise exponentially as they lost themselves in each other.

Their kisses became hungrier, more demanding. Lips and tongues danced in a rhythm as old as time, yet uniquely theirs. The world beyond their embrace ceased to exist.

Overcome by desire, Evelyn's thoughts turned hazy. A soft moan escaped her lips before she could stop it.

The sound sent electricity through Liam's veins, though he maintained remarkable control. His hand traced slow, burning paths along her back as their passion intensified.

Unable to resist, Evelyn slipped her hands beneath his shirt, exploring the hard planes of his chest. Their bodies pressed flush together, and she couldn't mistake the evidence of his arousal pressing against her. A heady mix of fear and excitement flooded her senses.

Just as Evelyn felt herself teetering on the precipice of no return, Liam suddenly flipped their positions, pinning her beneath him. He captured her wrists, pressing them into the pillow above her head.

Breathing heavily, he broke the kiss. His darkened eyes burned with desire as they roved over her flushed face.

Evelyn's chest rose and fell rapidly as she met his intense gaze. Liam stared at her as if under a spell, yet made no move to continue.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn asked, her voice trembling with unspent desire.

Liam swallowed hard. "That night you were drunk, Cassandra," he whispered hoarsely, "I didn't take advantage of you."

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson at his words.

"You undressed yourself," he added, his voice rough with restraint.

Mortification washed over her. "That explains why I don't remember anything and didn't feel... different afterward."

Liam braced himself on his elbows, his fingers threading through her silken hair. "I want you so badly right now," he confessed, his voice thick with need.

Evelyn lowered her lashes shyly and nodded, giving silent permission.

Instead of claiming her as she expected, Liam pressed a tender kiss to her forehead. "Cassandra," he murmured, "will you marry me?"

The question shocked Evelyn into wide-eyed silence.

Liam's gaze was unwavering, his sincerity undeniable. "Only when you're completely mine will I feel I have the right to be with you like this. Do you understand?"

Evelyn realized with startling clarity that Liam was exercising incredible restraint out of respect for her. His self-control moved her more than any passionate declaration could.

A lump formed in her throat. "Liam," she said haltingly, "let's keep our relationship simple. Whatever happens between us, let's just cherish each moment together, okay?"

"Are you still considering returning to Solterra?" Liam asked quietly.

Evelyn fell silent. It wasn't a matter of wanting to return - the contract binding her left no choice.

Liam stroked her hair gently. "Solterra is a traditional country," he said carefully. "Many men there place great importance on a woman's... purity."
###Chapter 422

Evelyn's heart clenched painfully as she whispered, "Liam, what do you mean?"

Liam Blackwood's piercing gaze held hers as he spoke softly, "If one day you choose to leave Aldenria and me to return to your career in Solterra, why would I complicate your life and stand in the way of your future?"

Tears welled up in Evelyn's eyes. Her voice trembled when she asked, "Liam, how could you ever be a complication?"

Moisture gathered in Liam's eyes too. He tenderly brushed her cheek with his thumb, forcing a smile. "Eventually you'll want to settle down and start a family back in Solterra, won't you?"

Evelyn stared at him through her tears. "You found out, didn't you?"

Liam gave a slow nod. "The Solterran government contacted me. They're determined not to let you go."

"Then why did you propose?" she choked out.

Gently wiping her tears away, Liam asked with a bittersweet smile, "Would you have said yes if there were no obstacles?"

Through her tears, Evelyn nodded firmly. "Yes. I'd marry you. I'd follow you to live at the borderlands."

Liam pulled her into his arms, burying his face in her shoulder. "That's all I needed to hear."

"Liam..."

He held her tightly but maintained careful distance between their bodies. "Let me just hold you like this until we sleep."

"I want to be close to you. You don't have to hold back," Evelyn said bravely.

"I don't want to," Liam replied firmly.

Evelyn frowned. His body told a different story - she could feel his racing heartbeat and the heat radiating from him.

"Don't all men want intimacy with the women they love?"

Liam remained silent. He gently moved her head away, creating more distance between them. He wouldn't even embrace her properly now.

To him, true love wasn't about possession. It was about respect, care, and wanting the best for the other person's future.

Knowing they had no future together, Liam refused to complicate her life for momentary pleasure. He wouldn't risk damaging her future relationships.

He tenderly brushed her hair and tucked the blanket around her. "Don't overthink it. Just sleep."

"Liam—"

"Come with me tomorrow to visit Grandma," he interrupted. "Afterwards, you can help me pick Mother's birthday gift."

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes met his as she nodded silently.

That night, neither slept well. Each wrapped in separate blankets, lost in their own thoughts. Just like during their marriage, they maintained respectful boundaries.

Evelyn understood Liam was protecting her. Perhaps the greatest act of love was restraint.

The next morning, Evelyn accompanied Liam to Shovale to visit Margaret Thorn. Her Alzheimer's had progressed to late stages - she no longer recognized anyone, needed constant care, and had lost all self-awareness.

After the visit, they went jewelry shopping for Eleanor Blackwood's birthday present.

For Eleanor's celebration, the Blackwoods opted for an intimate family gathering rather than an extravagant party.

When Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Manor with her gift, nearly everyone welcomed her warmly. Only Layla seemed reserved.

It was common knowledge among the family that Evelyn was actually Cassandra Wright - Liam's childhood sweetheart and first love.
###Chapter 423

Beatrice Thornton's attitude toward Evelyn had undergone a dramatic shift. She was now excessively polite, almost fawning in her attempts to please the younger woman.

Evelyn suddenly realized Isabella Sinclair's animosity wasn't just about social status - it stemmed from her complicated history with Liam Blackwood.

The grand dining table at Blackwood Manor overflowed with exquisite dishes and fine wine. Every Morrison family member except Donovan had gathered for Eleanor Blackwood's birthday celebration.

"Cassandra, I've come to understand how insensitive I might have been toward you before," Beatrice said with uncharacteristic humility. "I sincerely hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "There's nothing to forgive, Beatrice."

Isabella raised her wine glass with deliberate slowness, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "How interesting that we're celebrating Mother Eleanor's birthday with an outsider at our family table. Tell me, Ms. Wright, what exactly is your connection to this gathering?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as Evelyn fixed Isabella with a piercing stare.

"As far as I'm aware," Isabella continued, swirling her wine, "your so-called marriage to Liam was never legally binding. You're neither his wife nor his girlfriend. So I'm genuinely curious - what gives you the right to be here?"

Sebastian Blackwood discreetly kicked his wife under the table.

Isabella whirled on him. "What was that for?"

Sebastian immediately shrank back, his face flushing with embarrassment.

Eleanor and Richard exchanged uneasy glances, caught between maintaining peace and defending their guest.

The other family members - Cassandra Blake, Penelope Hart, Maxwell Blackwood, and Gregory Lynch - remained conspicuously silent, content to watch the drama unfold.

"Don't be ridiculous, Isabella," Beatrice interjected. "She's Cassandra Wright."

Isabella crossed her arms, her posture radiating icy disdain. "That changes nothing. This is a family gathering. Blood only."

Liam's expression darkened as he fixed his sister-in-law with a glacial stare. "Legalities aside, she is and always will be my wife. If you have issues, address them to me."

Beatrice snorted into her wine glass. "She's just bitter you didn't choose her instead. Some things never change."

Isabella's face went pale with rage.

Sebastian slammed his fist on the table. "Aunt Beatrice! Mind your tongue unless you want consequences."

"Oh, I'm trembling," Beatrice mocked. "Perhaps you should ask your wife why she's so obsessed with Liam's romantic life. It's rather pathetic, don't you think?"

Both Sebastian and Isabella fell into stony silence.

Eleanor forced a smile, attempting to diffuse the tension. "Please, let's not argue. It's my birthday, and I'd prefer we enjoy this meal in peace."

Beatrice pointed an accusing finger at Isabella. "She started it! From the moment Cassandra arrived, she's been nothing but hostile. Clearly still carrying a torch for Liam after all these years."

"You're delusional!" Isabella shot to her feet, her chair scraping loudly against the floor.

Sebastian sat rigid with suppressed anger, his knuckles white around his wine glass.

Evelyn, feeling responsible for the discord, quietly presented Eleanor with her gift. "Happy birthday. I should go."

The elderly couple looked genuinely distressed by the unfolding scene.
###Chapter 424

Evelyn smiled softly as she gently removed Liam's hand from her arm. She didn't want to cause any trouble for Eleanor. "Liam, stay with your mother to celebrate her birthday. I don't belong here with your family."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I should leave since Isabella clearly doesn't want me here."

Liam's expression darkened with anger. He opened his mouth to protest, but Evelyn cut him off. Her tone turned firm. "Just listen to me this once, okay?"

With a polite nod to the gathered guests, Evelyn turned and walked away.

Everyone knew Isabella's temperament. Though they thought her behavior was unreasonable, no one dared to stop Evelyn's departure or challenge Isabella.

Evelyn stepped out of the Blackwood estate carrying her purse. The fading sunlight painted the sky in warm hues of orange and pink. A gentle breeze carried the sweet scent of roses from the garden.

Her footsteps slowed as she approached the wrought iron gates. A heavy sadness settled in her chest. No matter how hard she tried, she could never truly fit into this world.

The sound of rapid footsteps echoed behind her. Before she could turn completely, Liam was already at her side, his fingers intertwining with hers. The sudden warmth of his touch sent a jolt through her.

Tears pricked at Evelyn's eyes. "Liam, why did you follow me?"

He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. "Let's go home. I'll make you that pasta dish you love."

"But today's Eleanor's birthday," Evelyn protested. "Shouldn't you be with her?"

Liam kept walking, their joined hands swinging slightly between them. "I already wished her happy birthday and gave her my gift. Birthdays come every year - missing one won't hurt."

"Won't she be upset?"

"She'll understand."

Evelyn smiled but didn't press further. They walked in comfortable silence as twilight descended around them. Though their steps were measured, emotions churned beneath the surface. Having left earlier than planned, Ryan hadn't arrived with the car yet.

This was the first time Liam had held her hand so openly in public. They strolled down the tree-lined avenue like any ordinary couple. The towering sycamores cast long shadows as streetlights flickered to life.

Evelyn kept her eyes on the cobblestones, counting the cracks between them. Liam's hand was warm and steady around hers.

"Cassandra," Liam murmured.

She looked up. "Yes?"

His gaze remained fixed ahead, his voice thick with exhaustion. "Stay. Please."

Evelyn studied his profile - the strong jawline, the faint shadows beneath his eyes.

"As long as you're in Aldenria, I can keep you safe," he continued earnestly. "You could continue your research, even in weapons development. Whatever path you choose, I'll support you completely."

She understood the unspoken promise. Within Aldenria's borders, no one could touch her - not Solterra's government, not the international courts. She'd be protected from all consequences.

But the weight of betrayal sat heavy in her chest. The research institute had funded her education, given her opportunities most scientists only dreamed of. She couldn't abandon them, not even for love.

"I'm sorry, Liam." Her voice cracked. "I want to stay. I've tried everything - negotiations, buyouts, legal appeals. The institute won't release me from my contract."

"So you have to go?" His grip tightened almost painfully, mirroring the tension in his voice.

Evelyn felt the pressure of his fingers. She lowered her gaze to their joined hands as they continued walking through the gathering darkness.
###Chapter 425

Liam and Evelyn hadn't planned on using the car. Walking hand in hand felt more intimate, more real. Evelyn hummed softly in response to the unspoken question between them.

"When?" Liam's voice was low, strained.

A sharp pang shot through Evelyn's chest. She forced her tone to remain light. "Solterra has arranged for my retrieval. The moment their envoy arrives, I'll be gone."

Liam's gaze lifted to the twilight sky, the weight in his chest growing heavier. Each breath felt like a struggle, as if the air had turned to lead.

"My parents are still out there," Evelyn added quietly. "Promise me you'll keep searching for them."

"I promise."

"I'll also have Solterra's authorities assist in the search."

Liam's steps slowed, his grip on her hand tightening imperceptibly.

"Liam," Evelyn's voice wavered, "could you check on my grandparents occasionally? They're getting older, and they live alone..."

She swallowed hard, her next words trembling. "I'm swamped with work, and they don't know about my job. They wouldn't understand why I can't visit or call. I can't return to Aldenria, and—" Her voice broke. "I hate that I have to leave them like this."

Liam stopped abruptly. He couldn't look at her—not when his own composure was hanging by a thread. His jaw clenched as he forced out the words, "When you left Aldenria ten years ago, you'd already decided never to come back."

"That's why you cut ties with everyone here. You only returned because of Julian." Liam's eyes glistened as he stared at the distant city lights. "How long this time? Five years? Ten? Or will it be another lifetime?"

Evelyn's heart shattered. Even without a future together, Liam would wait. The realization crushed her.

She drew a shaky breath. "Liam, don't wait for me. If you meet someone wonderful, embrace it. Fall in love. Marry her. Build a life."

Liam's throat burned. He tipped his head back, blinking rapidly to keep the tears at bay. When he spoke, his voice was rough. "And you? Will you find someone? Start a family? Have children?"

"I don't know," Evelyn whispered, wiping her cheeks. The future was a void she couldn't predict.

Liam had no words left. He pulled her into a crushing embrace. She clung to him just as desperately, her tears soaking into his shirt.

He couldn't fathom the depth of her sorrow. Was it leaving Archibald and Margaret? Serving Aldenria one last time? Or the agony of failing to rescue her parents? Any one of those reasons was enough to break her.

She cried so easily now, yet she was still the woman he loved. But she was never meant to stay.

Liam gently stroked her hair. "Evelyn," he murmured, "when it's time to go, don't tell me. Just leave quietly, alright?"

Evelyn's tears fell faster. "Why?"

"Because I can't relive that pain—breaking down at the airport like I did ten years ago." His voice cracked. "I'm terrified I'll lose control. That I'll hide you away where no one can take you from me."

Evelyn buried her face deeper into his chest, her arms locking around him. She wept silently, wishing she could stay in his arms forever.
###Chapter 426

The night was serene, with silver moonlight filtering through the drifting fog. Yet Evelyn and Liam couldn't bear to look at each other, their hearts shattered beyond repair.

Upon returning to Blackwood Manor, Liam locked himself in his study all night, claiming urgent military documents needed attention. At dawn, he departed without Evelyn, citing emergency duties at the base.

Their farewell was deceptively simple. Both understood this parting meant forever. Instead of tearful goodbyes, they chose casual indifference, as if it meant nothing.

Liam would return to his military command while Evelyn resumed her research in Solterra.

Packing her few belongings, Evelyn's gaze lingered on every detail of the manor. The mahogany bookshelves, the plush velvet drapes - each held memories too painful to bear.

Liam had renovated the entire estate when Victoria first arrived. He'd been preparing to marry the woman he'd loved for years.

Evelyn couldn't fathom how Liam had loved her so deeply for over a decade. He'd accepted every truth about her with quiet dignity, then let her go with equal resolve.

The mere thought of him brought fresh tears. She wiped them away fiercely before exiting Blackwood Manor with her luggage.

Rosalind waited outside, immediately taking Evelyn's bags. Seeing her swollen eyes, Rosalind murmured, "Evelyn, you've been crying all night."

Covering her aching eyes, Evelyn drew a shaky breath. "I'm fine."

"But you're leaving in days. Why did General Blackwood return to base? Doesn't he want to say goodbye?"

"He wants me to leave quietly," Evelyn whispered, fresh tears falling. "He's afraid he wouldn't be able to stop me if we said proper goodbyes."

Rosalind embraced her, stroking her back. "Don't cry. The General loves you truly. He only wants you free to be yourself."

Remembering how Liam had restrained himself despite his pain, never crossing certain lines, Evelyn's heart shattered anew. His love had been perfect. She had no regrets.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn craned her neck for one last glimpse of Blackwood Manor. When it disappeared from view at the turn, something inside her broke.

The cold wind mirrored her desolation.

Fingers trembling, she pulled out her phone, reciting Liam's number like a sacred mantra. Though memorized long ago, she needed to etch it deeper. Once in Solterra, all contact would cease.

Perhaps years later, after retirement, she might reach out again. The fragile hope was all she had left.

Tears fell uncontrollably as she bit her lip to stifle sobs. Curling into the seat, her body shook with silent grief.

This pain was unbearable. She'd never imagined love's farewell could hurt so deeply.

Now she finally understood Liam's agony a decade ago at the airport. His pain must have dwarfed hers to reduce such a strong man to tears.
###Chapter 427

Liam couldn't bring himself to watch Evelyn leave. Maybe the pain wouldn't cut so deep if he didn't witness her departure.

Rosalind, gripping the steering wheel, glanced nervously at Evelyn's tear-streaked face in the rearview mirror.

When they arrived at Wright Manor, Evelyn's footsteps echoed heavily through the grand foyer. Archibald and Margaret sat waiting in the parlor, their welcoming smiles crumbling at the sight of her swollen eyes.

"Did Liam hurt you?" Archibald's voice boomed with barely contained fury.

Margaret's hands trembled as she reached for Evelyn. "What's wrong with that boy? Where is he? I'll have his head for this!"

Evelyn caught their hands, her own shaking. "No, this isn't about Liam."

Margaret gently cupped Evelyn's face, her own eyes welling up. "Then why these tears, darling? Did you not sleep well?"

Evelyn guided them back to the sofa before sinking to her knees. Both grandparents gasped, reaching to pull her up, but she resisted. "Please, let me say this."

"Speak, child! There's no need for this," Margaret pleaded.

Evelyn remained kneeling, guilt twisting her features. "Grandfather, Grandmother... I won't be able to care for you as I should from now on."

Margaret's face drained of color. "What do you mean?" Her voice cracked as she clutched Evelyn's hands.

Archibald's expression darkened with understanding before she even spoke.

Evelyn stared at the Persian rug beneath her knees. "I'm returning to Solterra to resume my old position. For ten months, I won't be able to contact anyone. Only around Christmas... for a brief window."

Margaret's tears fell freely now. "Why, Evelyn? We have everything here! The family legacy, the estate - why choose that prison of a job?"

"I'm so sorry," Evelyn whispered, fresh tears spilling. "I can't explain."

"Stay," Margaret commanded. "Let your grandfather handle whatever mess is in Solterra. We're not getting any younger, child."

Evelyn shook her head violently. "Some things can't be fixed with money or influence."

"When do you leave?" Archibald asked quietly.

Margaret whirled on him. "You old fool! Aren't you going to stop her?"

"She has her own path!" Archibald roared back.

Margaret collapsed against the sofa, her sobs shaking her frail frame. Evelyn knelt motionless, tears carving silent paths down her cheeks, the weight of her decision pressing her deeper into the ornate carpet.

The grandfather clock ticked loudly in the heavy silence, each second marking the irreversible countdown to her departure.
###Chapter 428

Though her heart was breaking, Evelyn chose to let go out of love for Liam. She reached down to help him stand.

With trembling fingers, she brushed away his tears.

Even as her own heart shattered, Evelyn gazed tenderly into Liam's eyes and whispered, "Though this goodbye tears me apart, I won't stand in your way. Your happiness means everything to me."

An unbearable pain constricted Liam's chest, making each breath a struggle. Overwhelmed by gratitude and guilt, his body shook with silent sobs. He pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace, murmuring against her hair, "Thank you, Grandma."

Alexander released a heavy sigh. After discreetly wiping his eyes, he rose and placed a comforting hand on Liam's shoulder. Words failed him in that moment.

Raised in this loving family that always supported his dreams, Liam made sure to spend every possible moment with Archibald and Margaret as his departure loomed. He also visited Donovan at Blackwood Manor regularly.

When all his affairs in Aldenria were settled, Liam bid farewell to Rosalind and Donovan. Despite tying up all loose ends, an emptiness lingered in his chest - he knew it stemmed from his unresolved feelings for Evelyn.

Evelyn hadn't contacted him at all these past days. It was as if she'd already erased him from her life.

Time slipped away, and a week later on an unremarkable evening, Liam encountered Nathaniel Winslow. They'd been seniors together at Solterra University and now worked at the same research institute.

Nathaniel cut an elegant figure in his tailored suit, his dark-framed glasses adding an intellectual air. He'd been sent by the Solterra Research Institute to escort Liam.

A pang of sorrow struck Liam at the sight of him, but he schooled his features into calmness. "Nathaniel," he greeted evenly, "it's been a while."

Adjusting his glasses, Nathaniel replied with quiet warmth, "When you disappeared for three years, I feared the worst. Seeing you safe is a relief."

Liam offered a tight-lipped smile.

"You know why I'm here," Nathaniel stated.

"I do."

"Our flight leaves tomorrow afternoon," Nathaniel added.

"Tomorrow?" The words hit Liam like a physical blow.

Never had he longed to see Evelyn more than in that moment. After tomorrow, years might pass before they met again. Just thinking of her made his heart ache so fiercely he could barely breathe.

"I'll go pack then. Nathaniel, you can rest in the guest room," Liam said, forcing composure.

After a maid showed Nathaniel to his room, Liam retreated to his balcony. The starless sky mirrored his mood, and the warm night air felt suffocating.

Wright Manor glowed softly below, its garden path illuminated by golden lanterns that created an almost surreal atmosphere.

Liam kept unlocking his phone, torn about calling Evelyn. Tomorrow would begin at least five years of separation. By then, everything between them might change irrevocably. The thought deepened his sorrow.

Evelyn's voice, her smile, the way she moved - all flashed vividly through his mind. He realized now that parting while both still lived was more painful than death could ever be. Tears welled in his eyes.

Unable to resist any longer, he pressed call. The ringing tone echoed through the silent night.
###Chapter 429

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs as the dial tone echoed in her ear. Her palms grew clammy, fingers trembling around the phone. A wave of nausea crashed over her.

The line connected.

"Hello?" Liam's voice came through, deep as always but drained of its characteristic warmth. Like a candle flickering its last.

Hearing him shattered Evelyn's fragile composure. She clamped a hand over her mouth, biting back a sob. Hot tears spilled over her fingers, dripping onto her lap.

Words burned in her throat, trapped behind the dam of her emotions. If she moved her hand, she knew she'd break completely.

This wasn't like her. She'd always been the pragmatic one, prioritizing career over romance. Yet here she sat, unraveling at the sound of his voice.

§

On the other end, Liam waited. The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating. "Cassandra?" His voice softened. "Are you there? Can you speak to me?"

Evelyn pressed her palm harder against her lips. Her entire body shook with the effort of containing her grief. Tears traced silver paths down her cheeks, splashing onto the floor.

A bitter chuckle came through the line. "Since you're calling, you must still be in Aldenria. Should we switch to video? I'd give anything to see your face right now."

The ache in Evelyn's chest became unbearable. Her knees gave way, sending her crumpling to the floor in a tight ball. Terrified he might hang up, she drew a shuddering breath. "Liam," her voice cracked, "this is the last time I'll call you."

His breath hitched, but he forced lightness into his tone. "Every story needs an ending. Maybe I'll catch your next breakthrough on the news. Who knows? You might even win that Genesis Award someday."

"None of that matters," Evelyn whispered.

"They were your dreams," Liam corrected gently.

A sob escaped her. "Why must you always be so understanding? Why can't you be selfish for once? You're tearing me apart."

His forced smile was almost audible. "Selfishness would only hurt you more. Is that what you truly want?"

"Yes," she gasped, then immediately shook her head. "No. I don't know."

"Don't overthink it. Trust your gut. You don't owe me anything, Evelyn. I've loved you all along, even when you couldn't return it. I'll be fine - tougher than you think." His voice steadied.

Evelyn swiped at her tears. She remembered his promise to wait five years. Would he still hold to that?

"Liam, I—" She cut herself off. The selfishness of asking for more time struck her like a physical blow.

The thought of leaving him waiting another five years, possibly for nothing, crushed her chest. By then he'd be in his thirties - might even have children starting school.

"What is it?" Concern laced his words.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her aching heart. "Just... take care of yourself. Remember to love yourself too."

"You as well."

"I will."

Liam couldn't bring himself to ask when she was leaving or if she'd return. For now, hearing her voice was enough. It had to be.
###Chapter 430

Liam couldn't understand why Evelyn was crying. Maybe she didn't want to leave Aldenria. Or perhaps guilt was consuming her.

All he knew was that hearing her voice soothed the storm inside him.

Though they'd never officially been together, the agony in his chest was unbearable. It felt like his heart was being ripped from his body. He wished for death to end the torment. So many words remained unspoken between them.

"I need to handle something, so I'll hang up now," Liam said, his voice carefully controlled.

He had to end the call before his emotions betrayed him. If he didn't hang up soon, he might impulsively book a flight to drag her back to Aldenria.

The moment the call disconnected, Liam threw his phone onto the desk. He collapsed into his chair, drained of all strength. His head fell back against the headrest as he shut his eyes tight.

To endure the pain, he clenched his fists until they trembled. Veins protruded from his skin as silent tears escaped his closed eyelids.

These days, even dreaming of Evelyn brought fresh anguish. When it came to matters of the heart, he was anything but strong. Tears flowed uncontrollably now, tracing the sharp angles of his face before disappearing into his hairline.

A sharp knock at the office door startled him. Liam quickly turned his chair away from the entrance. He wiped his face with quick, practiced motions before composing himself.

Ryan Sullivan entered, his expression tense. "General Blackwood, intelligence reports indicate the traitor and Julian Whitmore have entered Aldenria by boat. They've vanished without a trace."

"You mean Adrian Castillo?" Liam's voice remained steady.

"Yes, the traitor Adrian," Ryan spat. "That bastard would sell his own mother for money. I'll put a bullet between his eyes if I catch him."

Realizing Evelyn must be their target, Liam immediately dialed Rosalind Baskins' number.

Rosalind answered promptly. "General Blackwood? Is everything alright?"

Evelyn couldn't stop her tears. "Liam, why must you always be so selfless? Why can't you be selfish just once? You're tearing me apart."

Liam forced a bitter smile. "Being selfish would only hurt you more. Do you truly want that?"

"I do," Evelyn whispered. Then immediately shook her head. "No... I don't know."

"Don't overthink it. Trust your instincts. You're not responsible for my happiness. I'm stronger than you think. I've loved you all along, even if you never felt the same. So don't worry about me." His voice grew calmer with each word.

Evelyn wiped her tears, remembering his promise to wait five years for her. Would he still keep that vow?

"Liam, I—" She stopped abruptly, realizing how cruel it would be to ask him to wait another five years.

The thought of Liam waiting in vain crushed her. Five years later, he'd be in his thirties—possibly with children starting school.

"What's wrong?" Liam asked.

Evelyn clutched her chest, whispering, "Liam, please take care of yourself. Remember to love yourself too."

"You too."

"I will."

Liam couldn't bring himself to ask when she was leaving or if she'd ever return to Aldenria. For now, hearing her voice was enough to bring him fleeting peace.
###Chapter 431

"When humans lose their sanity, they become far more terrifying than any beast." Liam's voice was heavy with exhaustion.

Ryan noticed the shadows in Liam's eyes, remembering how Adrian had betrayed him. Stepping forward, he placed a hand over his heart.

"General Blackwood, I swear on my life—I'll never turn on you like that traitor Adrian. My loyalty is yours, without question."

A flicker of warmth crossed Liam's face. "I know I can trust you."
"Thank you, sir," Ryan replied solemnly.

The office lights burned bright into the night, cutting through the darkness like beacons.

Evelyn woke with puffy eyes, her face still damp from tears. After splashing cold water on her swollen cheeks, she threw on a simple sundress, slung her crossbody bag over one shoulder, and tied her hair into a messy ponytail.

Rosalind and Nathaniel were already at breakfast when she descended the stairs. Rosalind stood, but Evelyn spoke first. "I need to go to Blackwood Manor. Come with me."

Rosalind blinked in confusion while Nathaniel nearly choked on his coffee. "Cassandra, our flight to Solterra leaves this afternoon. Where else could you possibly need to go?"

Evelyn paused at the doorway, her voice firm. "I'm going to convince Donovan to come with us for treatment."

"Why?" Rosalind asked.

"Solterra's traditional medicine has cured illnesses modern doctors call terminal. I've spent weeks researching—acupuncture, herbal therapy, even qi cultivation. There are documented recoveries."

Rosalind's eyes lit up. "That's incredible. I'll help you persuade him."
"I'm coming too," Nathaniel added, wiping his mouth.

As they stepped out of Wright Manor, Rosalind went to fetch the car. Nathaniel shot Evelyn a sideways glance. "Even if he refuses, we can't miss that flight."

Evelyn smirked. "If he says no, I'll sedate him and smuggle him aboard in a suitcase."

Nathaniel laughed, though they both knew airport security would never allow an unconscious passenger.

The engine purred as Rosalind pulled up. They sped away, leaving the manor's iron gates behind.

Five minutes into the drive, Rosalind's grip tightened on the wheel. "Cassandra, check the rearview. We've got company."

Evelyn and Nathaniel twisted in their seats. Two black SUVs trailed them, maintaining perfect distance.

"Who the hell—?" Nathaniel began.

Evelyn exhaled in recognition. "Military plates. It's Liam's detail."

Rosalind's knuckles whitened. "Cassandra... General Blackwood called me yesterday."

"Liam?" Evelyn leaned forward, pulse quickening. "Why? What happened?"

"He warned us to stay alert. Julian and Adrian risked crossing into Aldenria. They're planning something."

The names slithered down Evelyn's spine like ice. A storm was coming.
###Chapter 432

Evelyn and her companions arrived at Blackwood Manor. She discussed her plan to take Donovan overseas for treatment with Richard and Eleanor. Both parents immediately voiced their support. They were desperate to try anything that might save their son. The real challenge would be convincing Donovan himself to agree to treatment in Solterra. Richard and Eleanor left the final decision entirely in Evelyn's hands.

When Evelyn visited Donovan at Maple Abode, she barely recognized him. He'd shaved his scruffy beard and cut his unruly hair short. Dressed in crisp white loungewear, he looked almost refreshed. Yet his body remained alarmingly thin, his movements sluggish as if moving through water.

Rosalind wheeled Donovan onto the sunlit balcony. He sat motionless with closed eyes, not reacting when Evelyn greeted him.

Evelyn introduced Nathaniel to Rosalind. Over coffee in the living room, Evelyn explained their purpose. When she suggested taking Donovan to Solterra immediately, Rosalind's eyebrows shot up. "Today? Why the rush?"

Evelyn sighed. "I'm sorry it's so sudden, Rosalind. I want to arrange specialized treatment abroad. Will you come with us?"

"Of course," Rosalind agreed, then hesitated. "But getting his cooperation won't be simple."

Evelyn glanced at Donovan basking in sunlight. He resembled a dying plant starved of water. She approached and knelt beside his wheelchair, taking his limp hand in hers. His hollow cheeks and sunken eyes broke her heart.

"Donovan, will you let me take you abroad for treatment? Your legs can heal. The blindness is from head trauma - it's not permanent. Please don't give up." She squeezed his icy fingers. "Does nothing in this world matter to you anymore? Your family loves you. They want to see you recover. Wouldn't you want to live if you could walk and see again?"

Silence.

Rosalind stepped forward. "Evelyn, save your breath. I've recited every motivational quote and self-help book daily. Nothing gets through."

Evelyn looked up worriedly. "Then what do we do?"

Rosalind helped Evelyn stand before gripping Donovan's wheelchair handles. Leaning close, she spoke directly to his closed eyelids. "Listen carefully. We're taking you to Solterra for treatment. Your opinion doesn't matter - we're doing this."

Straightening, she smiled at Evelyn. "There. He agreed."

Evelyn blinked between Rosalind and the unresponsive Donovan.

"I'll pack our things. Wait here," Rosalind said, heading upstairs.

Rosalind Baskins approached Evelyn, glancing between Donovan and the stairs before whispering, "Evelyn, doesn't Mr. Blackwood seem...different?"

"How so?"

"Last visits, he'd scream and throw things to drive us away. Now he's like an empty shell," Rosalind observed.

Evelyn lowered her voice. "Maybe Rosalind calmed him."

"More like took control of him."

Evelyn startled. "Rosalind? Controlling Donovan?"

Rosalind pressed her lips together and gave a firm nod.
###Chapter 433

Evelyn shifted her gaze to Donovan. Despite his gaunt appearance, she believed he still possessed the strength to handle Rosalind, given his towering six-and-a-half-foot frame and years of military training.

"I trust Rosalind. She knows how to care for Donovan in her own unique way," Evelyn murmured softly.

Moments later, they spotted Rosalind dragging two massive suitcases down the grand staircase. Nathaniel and Rosalind Baskins rushed to assist while Evelyn wheeled Donovan toward the waiting car.

Once settled, their convoy departed Blackwood Manor en route to Wright Estate. Evelyn occupied the front passenger seat, her eyes fixed on the blurring landscape as she became lost in thought.

From the backseat came Donovan's raspy command: "Turn this car around."

"We're retrieving Cassandra's belongings from Wright Estate first," Rosalind explained coolly. "Then we're heading straight to the airport. I've packed your passport. We're getting you proper medical treatment abroad."

"I said take me back," Donovan growled through clenched teeth.

Rosalind crossed her arms, unfazed. "The decision's been made. We're leaving tonight."

"Don't make me hurt you," Donovan warned darkly.

With a derisive snort, Rosalind leaned back. "Really? In your condition? You need assistance eating, bathing, and rely on sedatives to sleep. You couldn't even lift a finger against me right now. Face it - you're just avoiding reality like the coward you've become."

The car fell silent, shocked by the caregiver's brutal honesty toward her $40,000/month charge. "You're pushing me too far, Rosalind," Donovan seethed.

"Pushing you?" She laughed mirthlessly. "You're not worth the effort."

Evelyn turned sharply, appalled by Rosalind's cruelty. Before she could intervene, Donovan lunged at Rosalind with feral intensity.

Rosalind reacted instantly. As he moved, she pinned his wrists against the seatback, straddling his thighs with practiced ease. Nathaniel cowered in the opposite corner.

"Rosalind! Don't hurt him!" Evelyn cried, alarmed by how easily Donovan was subdued.

Rosalind strained against Donovan's weakened resistance, uncaring of their compromising position. Modesty had become irrelevant months ago when she'd started bathing him daily. She knew every scar, every tremor of his broken body.

This was their routine now - whenever he resisted, she overpowered him. If provoking his rage gave him reason to keep fighting, she'd gladly become his target. Even murderous intent was preferable to surrender.

Breathing heavily, Rosalind smirked down at him. "Pathetic. You can't even break free, yet you threaten to kill me?"

"Must you destroy what little confidence he has left?" Evelyn pleaded.

"No," Rosalind stated flatly.

Evelyn fell silent, unable to bear witnessing Donovan's humiliation yet unwilling to undermine Rosalind's methods. She stared out the window, baffled by their dynamic.

After several failed escape attempts, Donovan suddenly erupted in bitter laughter. "You're right. I'm worthless. Can't walk. Can't see. Can't even defend myself."

The car filled with palpable pity at his broken admission.

Undeterred, Rosalind pressed on. "Listen carefully. Your family pays me $40,000 monthly to care for you. I'll do my job properly whether you cooperate or not. The choice is yours - accept treatment and recover, or remain in that wheelchair indefinitely. As long as the checks clear, I'll care for you as long as necessary."
###Chapter 434

"If you don't eat, I'll treat you like cattle and shove food down your throat with a tube. If you refuse to sleep, I'll drug you unconscious."

Rosalind Fairchild's voice was ice cold.

"Either way, I won't let you out of my sight. No suicide attempts. You're my golden goose for life."

Her words sent waves of fury through everyone in the vehicle.

"Cassandra, fire her!" Donovan Blackwood shouted, his face twisted in anger.

It was the first time he'd called Evelyn by her real name since the accident. Evelyn turned immediately, tears already gathering in her eyes. Though she disapproved of Rosalind's methods, they were shockingly effective.

"Donovan, I can't dismiss her. If you have issues with her, deal with it yourself," Evelyn replied, a faint smile playing on her lips despite the tension.

Donovan took a sharp breath and stopped struggling. He slumped into sullen silence. Rosalind slowly climbed off him and returned to her seat. She shot him a warning look before composing herself, her hands trembling slightly from the adrenaline. Her earlier ferocity had been pure performance.

As their car approached Wright Manor, the wrought iron gates swung open automatically. Evelyn frowned when she noticed unfamiliar guards at the entrance. The vehicle crawled along the garden path before stopping before the mansion.

"Cassandra, we're home. But something feels wrong," Rosalind Baskins murmured, voicing Evelyn's unease.

Evelyn stepped out quickly, her gaze darting to the gates. The new security guards stood with hands on their hips, staring them down with arrogant menace.

Turning toward the mansion, Evelyn spotted two hulking figures flanking the entrance. Their hands rested conspicuously near their waistbands, hinting at concealed weapons.

"Who are these people?" Nathaniel Winslow whispered nervously as he exited the car. Evelyn remained hyper-alert, shaking her head in response.

Just then, a familiar figure emerged from the doorway. Rosalind Baskins immediately moved to shield Evelyn.

"Julian?" Evelyn gasped in shock.

Julian Whitmore appeared composed, but darkness lurked behind his eyes. His smile carried a sinister edge that made Evelyn's blood run cold. "Cassandra, long time no see," he greeted.

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Where are my grandparents?" she demanded.

"They're inside. Do come in," Julian replied smoothly.

Rosalind Fairchild sensed danger. She discreetly reached for her phone to call the police.

Julian's sharp voice stopped her. "The bomb's already planted. I wouldn't advise calling the authorities." He held up a remote control with chilling confidence. "Enough explosives to reduce this place to rubble."

Rosalind swallowed hard and pocketed her phone.

Evelyn clenched her fists. "What do you want, Julian?"

Julian gestured toward the backyard. "Look there." Everyone turned to see a helicopter waiting in the distance.

"I'll be gone before the police arrive. You'll all be blown to smithereens," he stated calmly.

"Unbelievable," Rosalind Baskins muttered through gritted teeth.

"Shall we?" Julian motioned toward the house.

"I'm so sorry, Rosalind. I've dragged you and Donovan into this," Evelyn said guiltily.

"Stop blaming yourself. He's the monster here. He's the enemy now," Rosalind countered.

Despite Rosalind's reassurance, guilt weighed heavily on Evelyn.

They helped Donovan from the car into his wheelchair and pushed him toward the mansion together.

Inside the grand foyer stood a dozen intimidating men, each armed and dangerous. Their weapons glinted ominously in the light.
###Chapter 435

Evelyn's heart stopped when she saw them. Archibald and Margaret sat bound on the sofa, duct tape covering their mouths. The explosives strapped to their chests gleamed under the dim lighting.

Their eyes widened in terror when they spotted her. Muffled screams came through the tape as they struggled against their restraints, their bodies jerking in desperate warning.

"Grandmother! Grandfather!" Evelyn's face drained of color. She whirled toward Julian, fury burning in her voice. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Julian stretched lazily on the opposite couch, one leg crossed over the other. "Isn't it obvious?" he drawled.

An armed guard stepped forward, collecting their phones and watches with silent efficiency.

Rosalind leaned close to Donovan's ear, her whisper dripping with malice. "Hostage situation. Armed men everywhere. Enough explosives to level the block." She smirked. "Congratulations, Donovan. You'll die sooner than expected. Happy now?"

Donovan remained stone-faced.

"And what perfect company you'll have for the journey," Rosalind added sweetly.

Donovan's fists clenched. Even facing death, she couldn't resist tormenting him. He didn't need her running commentary to understand the gravity of their situation.

Julian's expression darkened when he noticed Donovan. He approached the wheelchair, his voice uncharacteristically serious. "What happened to Donovan?"

They'd been childhood friends. Now Donovan sat broken before him - blind, paralyzed, a shadow of the man he once was.

Evelyn stepped between them, chin raised. "If it's me you want, let them go."

Julian ignored her, repeating, "What happened to him?"

"He was an undercover narcotics agent. They discovered his identity." Evelyn's voice cracked. "They tortured him for days. Left him like this."

Julian absorbed this with surprising solemnity before shrugging. "Occupational hazard. We all take risks, don't we?" He gestured to his own scarred face. "I'm not exactly unscathed myself."

Returning to his casual demeanor, he sprawled on the couch. "Now I'm a fugitive in Aldenria. The Wright fortune is beyond my reach. So—"

His lips curled into a predatory smile. "Father, I hold all your fates in my hands. Perhaps we can negotiate terms for your survival."

"How much?" Evelyn demanded.

"Fifty billion." Julian held up five fingers, his tone disturbingly calm.

Archibald's eyes bulged.

Evelyn scoffed. "You can't be serious. That's an impossible sum."

Julian stretched his arms along the couch back. "For Aldenria's wealthiest family? Hardly. Liquidate assets. Sell shares at discount. Transfer everything to my offshore accounts."

"There's no way to move that much money out of Aldenria so quickly!" Evelyn protested.

Julian's smile turned icy. "Seven days. Fifty billion in my accounts within seven days, or..."

He picked up a remote control, his thumb hovering over the red button.
###Chapter 436

Compared to Archibald's staggering 500 billion fortune, Julian's demand for 50 billion seemed almost reasonable.

"Fine, I accept," Evelyn said through gritted teeth. She gestured toward Archibald and Margaret. "But you must remove their explosives and release them first."

Julian smirked and signaled to his men. A heavily armed brute stepped forward, untying the elderly couple and carefully removing the devices strapped to their bodies.

Archibald's face had been drained of color throughout the entire ordeal. He spat out the gag and snapped, "Julian, release Cassandra immediately. Forget fifty billion - I'll transfer my entire fortune to you."

Julian shot him a venomous look. "Why didn't you offer that sooner? I'm a wanted man in Aldenria now - your wealth means nothing if I can't access it."

Archibald rose unsteadily to his feet. "Name your price. Just let everyone go unharmed."

"You've lost all bargaining power, old man," Julian sneered. "Your precious granddaughter is mine now. You'll do exactly as I say."

Margaret clutched her husband's arm with trembling fingers. "Archibald, please," she whispered urgently. "Don't provoke him. This monster won't hesitate to hurt you."

"Get this fossil a laptop for the transfer," Julian barked to his men. "And watch him closely. One wrong move - put a bullet in his head."

"Yes, sir."

The armed guards roughly escorted the elderly couple into the study, leaving the others trembling under Julian's menacing gaze.

Stretching out on the couch, Julian locked eyes with Evelyn. He gestured lazily toward the study. "That room's wired with enough explosives to level this wing. Cooperate, and maybe your grandparents survive the night."

Evelyn took a steadying breath.

She remembered Julian's reputation in medical circles. After decades studying in Solterra, his surgical skills were unparalleled. Keeping her voice level, she said softly, "Uncle Julian."

The unexpected term of endearment visibly startled him. It had been years since she'd addressed him with any familial warmth. The unfamiliarity seemed to momentarily unbalance him.

"I know you specialized in neurosurgery and acupuncture. Would you examine Donovan's condition?"

Rosalind and Victoria exchanged confused glances. They couldn't fathom why Evelyn would trust a known criminal with Donovan's care.

Julian's gaze drifted to the wheelchair-bound man. They'd grown up together, as close as brothers despite not sharing blood.

Though bitterness over Cassandra had twisted Julian's path, some remnant of that brotherly bond remained. Donovan's deteriorated condition clearly troubled him.

After a long pause, Julian approached and knelt beside the wheelchair. His fingers hovered over Donovan's atrophied legs.

Victoria moved to intervene, but Evelyn stopped her with a subtle shake of the head.

"But he's—" Victoria protested in a hushed voice.

"When it comes to medicine, he's still the best," Evelyn murmured back.

Julian conducted his examination with clinical precision while Donovan remained impassive. "You wanted to serve your country," Julian said suddenly. "How'd you end up like this?"

With a bitter chuckle, Julian countered, "And you dreamed of healing people. Look at us now."

Donovan's jaw tightened, his expression darkening.

Finished with his assessment, Julian stood. "I'll need his latest scans."

"We have them," Rosalind said quickly, darting to retrieve the medical files. Julian's armed escort followed her every move.

What had begun as a life-or-death hostage situation had somehow morphed into an impromptu medical consultation.

Amidst the terror of armed captors and ticking bombs, the room's attention had inexplicably shifted to Donovan's prognosis.
###Chapter 437

Julian Whitmore studied Donovan Blackwood's medical charts with growing concern. His fingers tightened around the clipboard as he reviewed the brain scans.

Evelyn Carter moved closer and placed a gentle hand on his arm.

The doctor froze. His gaze dropped to her slender fingers, then lifted to meet her pleading eyes that shimmered with unspoken desperation.

"Aunt Julian," Evelyn whispered, forming the words carefully with her lips. "Give him hope."

Understanding dawned in Julian's eyes. He cleared his throat before addressing Donovan. "Your neural pathways show promising activity. With specialized acupuncture and intensive physical therapy, walking could be possible within twelve months."

He adjusted his glasses. "As for your vision impairment, it's caused by pressure from a subdural hematoma."

"The hematoma's location makes surgery extremely risky. You've undoubtedly heard this from other physicians. The standard craniotomy carries less than one percent survival odds." Julian paused dramatically. "However, my modified procedure increases those chances to ten percent."

Rosalind Fairchild's hands flew to her mouth. She rushed forward and grabbed Julian's sleeve without thinking. "Dr. Whitmore, is this true? Donovan could really see again? Walk again?"

Julian wasn't entirely confident himself. He'd only promised Evelyn to offer hope. "Absolutely. With proper treatment."

Tears spilled down Rosalind's cheeks as she turned to Donovan. She knelt beside his wheelchair, clutching his limp hand. "Did you hear that? One of the world's top neurosurgeons says you can recover! You can't give up now!"

Donovan's brow furrowed behind his dark glasses. "Wouldn't your paycheck disappear if I got better?" His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Why the sudden concern?"

Rosalind's smile faltered. After a weighted pause, she matched his tone. "You're absolutely right. I should keep you blind and paralyzed. Job security, you know."

Donovan scoffed and jerked his hand away.

A thunderous crash shattered the tense moment as the front door exploded inward. Everyone spun toward the entrance where Adrian Castillo stormed in, flanked by armed guards, his face a mask of fury.

He snatched the medical file from Julian's hands and hurled it across the room. "Have you lost your damn mind?" Adrian snarled, veins bulging in his neck. "We're in the middle of a crisis and you're playing doctor?"

Evelyn's hands balled into fists at the sight of Adrian. The man who'd nearly killed Liam Blackwood. She'd make him pay someday.

Julian lowered his head in silent admission of guilt.

"Separate them," Adrian barked to his men. "Post guards at each location."

"You can't split us up!" Rosalind protested. "He's completely dependent! He needs constant care!"

Adrian's cold gaze flicked to Donovan. Something unreadable passed across his features. Even a ruthless man couldn't bring himself to harm the decorated former narcotics agent.

"Fine. Those two stay together," Adrian relented.

"I demand to stay with Evelyn!" Rosalind Baskins shouted, but Adrian ignored her. Within moments, armed men herded them into different rooms.

Once alone with Donovan, Rosalind collapsed onto the bed with a dramatic sigh, staring at the ceiling.

"Twenty-five years," she muttered. "Twenty-five miserable years. And now I'm going to die in some explosion before I've even lived." She rolled onto her side, clutching a pillow. "No romance. No passion. No marriage. No children."

She kicked her legs like a petulant child. "I haven't even tried lobster thermidor! This is unacceptable!"
###Chapter 438

Rosalind's voice cracked with frustration, her words dripping with despair. "What are we supposed to do now?" she whispered into the suffocating silence.

Donovan's face darkened like a storm cloud. Every fiber of his being screamed for escape - from this room, from her presence, from this cruel existence. He craved the sweet release of solitude, where he could fade away without witnesses.

To him, Rosalind was chaos incarnate. She'd not only robbed him of a peaceful death but had become his personal tormentor. Day and night, her relentless energy filled the shared space between them, leaving no room for quiet contemplation.

She found solace in monologues, often erupting into sudden outbursts to vent her turbulent emotions.

"Check the room for any communication devices," Donovan ordered through gritted teeth.

Rosalind bolted upright, her eyes widening in theatrical surprise. "Are you actually speaking to me?"

Donovan exhaled sharply. "Unless you see any ghosts here, yes, I'm talking to you."

A slow grin spread across Rosalind's face. "Well, this is progress."

"Just search the damn room," he snapped.

Rosalind leaned in conspiratorially, her breath warm against his ear. "Should we find a phone and call the authorities?"

Donovan recoiled, rubbing his ear with visible irritation. "That would get us both blown to kingdom come."

"Then who can help us?" she pressed.

"Liam."

"General Blackwood from the military base?" Rosalind's eyebrows shot up.

Donovan's silence spoke volumes.

Propping her elbow on Donovan's wheelchair armrest, Rosalind rested her chin in her palm, studying his gaunt features. "Wouldn't we still get blown up if we contacted him?"

Donovan's jaw clenched.

With a dramatic sigh, Rosalind traced the hollows of Donovan's cheekbones with her fingertip. "You must have been devastatingly handsome once. Now you're just... skeletal. It's rather unsettling."

"Phone. Now." Donovan bit out each word.

"There isn't one."

"You haven't even looked."

Rosalind gestured around the immaculate guest room. "Does this look like it would have communication devices?"

"Search properly," Donovan growled.

Rosalind shook her head stubbornly. "I'm conserving energy. There's nothing here."

"You won't know unless you try," Donovan countered. "Not trying guarantees failure."

Rosalind's eyes lit up with triumph. "Exactly! So why won't you apply that logic to your recovery?"

Donovan's hands tightened on the wheelchair arms until his knuckles turned white.

Meanwhile, Evelyn found herself imprisoned in another guest room. Moving with precision, she secured the door and drew every curtain, plunging the space into darkness.

An armed guard stood sentry outside her door while patrols circled below. Even the surveillance room at Wright Manor was under tight watch. Escape seemed impossible.

Calling the authorities was too risky - one wrong move could trigger Julian to detonate the entire estate. After careful consideration, Evelyn decided her only hope lay with Liam.

She slipped into the bathroom, sealing herself in before settling against the tiled wall. From beneath her collar, she retrieved a delicate chain bearing a black crystal pendant shaped like a four-leaf clover.

A deft press on the clover's edge activated the hidden device. A beam of light projected from the crystal's core, casting a holographic interface onto the floor. Evelyn's fingers danced across the virtual keyboard as she composed an urgent message to Liam.
###Chapter 439

"Liam, it's Cassandra. Adrian and Julian, along with armed mercenaries, have stormed into my home."

"They've planted explosives everywhere. My grandparents, Rosalind, Nathaniel, Donovan, and Rosalind are trapped here with me."

"We're hostages now."

"They're demanding 50 billion and threatened to detonate the bombs if we alert the authorities."

"They've arranged a helicopter in the backyard for their escape."

After sending the encrypted message, Evelyn swiftly shut down the virtual screen and concealed the device beneath her blouse. Peering cautiously outside, she slipped out of the bathroom and returned to her room.

Her pulse hammered in her throat. Would Liam even receive the message? Would he call for backup or attempt a rescue himself? The uncertainty gnawed at her.

Minutes stretched like hours. Evelyn paced, her nerves fraying. Then—scuffling. Curses. A violent commotion from the adjacent room.

Her breath hitched. She rushed to the door, only to find a guard blocking her path, his gun leveled at her chest. "Stay inside," he growled.

Evelyn ignored the weapon, straining to hear. "What's happening? Who's fighting?"

Lewd laughter erupted from next door. "I love a fighter. Struggle all you want—it just makes it better."

Then—Rosalind's enraged scream. "Don't touch me, you filthy animal!"

Evelyn's vision tunneled. She shoved past the guard, ignoring the pistol pressed to her temple. The sounds of Rosalind being struck—flesh hitting flesh—sent white-hot fury through her veins.

"Go ahead, shoot me," Evelyn spat, tears burning her eyes. She knocked the gun aside and sprinted to the unguarded room.

The scene inside shattered her.

Rosalind lay crumpled on the floor, blood trickling from her lip, her blouse torn. Two shirtless men loomed over her, unbuckling their belts.

They turned at Evelyn's entrance, their smirks twisting into something predatory. "Looks like we got another pretty toy," one sneered.

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her hairpin—a disguised pen gun.

She moved like lightning.

The first shot was silent. The man collapsed, eyes wide with shock.

His partner barely had time to react before the second bullet dropped him like a sack of stones.

Rosalind gaped at Evelyn, as if seeing her for the first time.

The woman standing before her wasn't the gentle artist she knew.

This was someone else entirely.
###Chapter 440

After neutralizing the two assailants, Evelyn rushed to Rosalind's side, carefully assessing her injuries. "Rosalind, where are you hurt? Show me. Where's this blood coming from?"

Rosalind shook her head weakly. "It's nothing serious. Just some internal bleeding from the kicks to my ribs and stomach. No open wounds."

"Those bastards," Evelyn muttered through clenched teeth.

Rosalind managed a faint smile despite the pain.

Evelyn gave her a stern look. "You're a black belt in taekwondo. And didn't you win silver in collegiate judo? How did two thugs overpower you?"

"You think I wanted to take this beating?"

"Then why didn't you fight back?"

"Because they threatened to hurt you if I resisted."

Tears sprang to Evelyn's eyes instantly. Her heart constricted seeing Rosalind's battered face. Overcome with emotion, she pulled her into a tight embrace. Rosalind's strength was never in question - her vulnerability came from protecting Evelyn.

"Evelyn, I'll be fine. But we need to deal with these bodies now," Rosalind murmured, gently patting her back.

Evelyn released her and glanced at the corpses. Her voice trembled. "Rosalind... I killed someone."

"Don't panic. This isn't Solterra. It's Aldenria."

Evelyn frowned. "Did I break any laws?"

"Quite the opposite. In Aldenria, killing your captors in self-defense might earn you a medal from the government."

"Seriously?" Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"The Castle Doctrine here extends to any unlawful detainment."

Evelyn helped Rosalind stand, whispering, "So legally, I could defend myself against all of them."

Rosalind clutched her ribs, wincing as she eyed the door. "Evelyn, how many rounds do you have left?"

"Just one."

"We're in serious trouble then."

Evelyn leaned close, whispering in her ear. "I sent a distress signal to Liam through the virtual terminal. It'll take about three hours for reinforcements to arrive from the military base."

Rosalind's expression darkened. "They've planted explosives everywhere. If General Blackwood's team comes, they'll detonate them."

Evelyn fell silent.

A thunderous crash shattered the moment as the door burst open. The women recoiled, clinging to each other as several armed men stormed in.

Adrian Castillo entered with his squad, his stormy gaze immediately landing on the corpses. His jaw clenched so tightly the muscles visibly twitched.

In one fluid motion, Adrian disarmed Evelyn, snatching the pen gun from her grasp. "This damn weapon again," he growled. "You escaped last time because of it."

Evelyn shielded Rosalind behind her, maintaining a calm facade. "Your men wanted ransom money, but assaulting women? That's how people end up dead."

Only then did Adrian notice Rosalind's disheveled state, realization dawning about his men's excesses.
###Chapter 441

Adrian Castillo took a deep breath, forcing down his fury as he tucked away Evelyn's gun, his lips curling in disgust as he muttered about Julian Whitmore. "That lovesick idiot is utterly useless. We've seen what this weapon can do, yet he let her bring it in. Pathetic."

Turning sharply, Adrian strode away, his voice cutting through the tension. "Dispose of these bodies and lock the women in separate rooms."

His next words carried a deadly warning. "Anyone who lays a finger on them loses more than just their job. Understood?"

"Yes, Mr. Castillo," his men responded in unison.

Within moments, burly guards were escorting Evelyn from the chamber.

As Adrian's figure disappeared down the corridor, Evelyn's desperate cries echoed off the walls. "Please, get medical help for Rosalind! She's suffering internal injuries! Someone help her!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears as Adrian continued walking without hesitation.

Separated from Rosalind again, Evelyn pounded on her locked door, voice breaking. "Can't you hear me? She needs a doctor! Please, just get her some medication!"

In the adjacent room, Rosalind's tear-filled eyes shone with quiet strength, a soft smile touching her lips as she whispered, "Evelyn... I'll be fine."

Night fell.

Exhausted and starving, Evelyn tossed restlessly in bed, her mind racing with worry for Archibald, Margaret, Rosalind, Liam, and Isabella.

A deafening thunderclap shattered the silence.

Evelyn screamed, instinctively covering her ears and curling into a fetal position.

Even with her memories restored, thunderstorms still paralyzed her with terror. The night her parents died had been stormy, and the sensation of drowning still haunted her, making each thunderclap feel like reliving that trauma.

Lightning flashed outside as rain hammered the windows. Evelyn burrowed deeper under the blankets, pulling them tightly around her shaking form.

After what felt like hours, the storm began to subside, the rain softening to a gentle patter.

Then - a faint thud at the door.

Peering out from her cocoon, Evelyn found the room plunged into complete darkness. The storm must have knocked out the power.

The unnatural silence that followed set her nerves on edge. Something felt terribly wrong.

Steeling herself, she threw off the covers and crept toward the door, hands outstretched in the darkness.

Her trembling fingers found the lock. The door creaked open slightly.

Suddenly, a powerful force shoved against it, sending Evelyn stumbling backward.

Before she could react, a muscular figure surged forward, one arm encircling her waist while a large hand clamped over her mouth, quietly shutting the door behind them.

Pinned against the wall, Evelyn's heart pounded as she strained to see her captor's face in the darkness.

The man radiated strength and danger, his grip unyielding.

Evelyn struggled futilely against his hold, muffled protests dying in her throat.

Then warm breath brushed her ear as a familiar voice whispered, "Chubs, it's me."

That voice - deep and reassuring - instantly calmed the storm inside her.

Liam. He'd come for her. Not with his usual bold approach, but slipping in like a shadow.

His next words came in that same quiet tone. "The storm provided perfect cover."
###Chapter 442

Evelyn gently pried Liam's hand from her mouth, her whisper barely audible. "Liam, my grandparents...they've been taken."

Liam's jaw tightened. "Adrian has served under me for years. He's trained in counter-surveillance and combat."

Confusion flickered across Evelyn's face. "What are you saying?"

"Your grandparents aren't at Wright Manor anymore. They've been moved to a secure location."

Evelyn's stomach dropped like a stone. First her parents, now her grandparents. Julian Whitmore deserved every ounce of her hatred.

"What about the others?" she pressed.

Liam's voice held steady confidence. "Patience. Just a few more minutes."

She trusted him implicitly. Evelyn lowered her guard and waited in silence.

The scent of Liam's cologne enveloped her - sandalwood with a hint of spice. His warm breath caressed her cheek as he stood mere inches away. The sheer power radiating from him made her pulse quicken.

"Liam," she whispered nervously, "could you...step back please?"

After a beat of hesitation, he released her. In the darkness, neither could read the other's expression, creating an awkward tension.

Evelyn moved past him, finding the edge of the bed and sinking onto the mattress.

"Are you taking Donovan to Solterra?" Liam's deep voice rumbled through the room.

She nodded before remembering he couldn't see. "Yes. For his treatment."

Silence stretched between them.

Sensing his disapproval, she added, "Richard and Eleanor have approved it."

Still, Liam said nothing.

Evelyn's voice hardened with resolve. "I won't abandon Donovan while there's still hope."

Liam responded with a cold hum. The door creaked as he opened it abruptly and stepped out. Evelyn jumped to her feet. "Liam?"

Suddenly, light flooded the room.

She caught a glimpse of Liam's broad back as he descended the stairs with purpose. Rushing to the railing, she gripped it tightly and looked down.

The scene below stole her breath.

Dozens of soldiers from the military base stood in perfect formation, weapons trained on a group of bound criminals in the center. Among them, Adrian Castillo was restrained and thrown in with the others.

Evelyn scanned the room frantically, but Julian was nowhere to be seen. Dread coiled in her stomach. She rushed to the adjacent room and threw open the door.

Rosalind lay motionless on the bed.

Panic surged through Evelyn as she hurried to Rosalind's side, shaking her shoulder gently. "Rosalind? Wake up. Liam's here to rescue us."

Rosalind's pale face showed no response.

Evelyn pressed a hand to Rosalind's forehead - cold as marble. "Rosalind! Please wake up! Don't do this to me!"

Still nothing.

Evelyn's hands trembled violently. Her breath came in shallow gasps as her entire body went weak.

She bolted from the room and leaned over the railing, voice shaking. "Liam! Something's wrong with Rosalind! Help her, please!"

Liam turned, his gaze locking onto Evelyn's terrified expression. Without a word, he took the stairs two at a time, Ryan Sullivan close behind.

When Liam saw Rosalind, his expression darkened. He pressed two fingers to her carotid artery, searching for a pulse.
###Chapter 443

"Ryan, get her to the hospital now," Liam commanded sharply.

Without missing a beat, Ryan scooped up Rosalind and sprinted toward the exit. Evelyn followed closely behind.

Her footsteps hesitated at the threshold. Turning back to Liam, her voice trembled with urgency. "Donovan and the others are still trapped in the other rooms. You must save them."

Liam's eyes darkened as he gave a curt nod, a sharp pain twisting in his chest.

Having delivered her message, Evelyn could think of nothing else as she raced after Ryan's retreating figure.

Liam stepped out onto the balcony. Leaning against the railing, he surveyed the scene below with icy detachment. Criminals sat bound in the center of the grand hall, while forensic experts combed through adjacent rooms for explosives.

Descending the staircase, Liam spotted Rosalind Fairchild wheeling Donovan out. His gaze lingered on his brother's pale face.

"Donovan," Liam greeted as he approached.

Donovan remained composed. "You arrived faster than expected. Your efficiency never ceases to impress."

"Cassandra's signal reached us just in time," Liam replied, motioning for Rosalind to step aside. She complied without protest.

Taking control of the wheelchair, Liam pushed his brother toward the exit. As they moved, Donovan asked, "Where's Cassandra?"

A wry smile touched Liam's lips, an unexpected pang of jealousy surfacing. "You two really do care for each other."

Donovan fell silent, the barbed comment hitting its mark.

Noting his brother's reaction, Liam continued, "Rosalind's injured. Cassandra accompanied her to the hospital."

"Who's Rosalind?" Donovan inquired.

"One of Cassandra's subordinates," Liam clarified.

"I see."

"Will you go to Solterra for treatment with her?"

"I'd rather not, but she insists."

"Go. Never surrender while there's still hope."

Donovan nodded. "Alright."

The waiting car's engine hummed softly in the rain.

Liam helped his brother into the backseat before stowing the wheelchair in the trunk. Rosalind climbed in after them, shutting the door firmly.

The vehicle pulled away, disappearing into the stormy night as rain continued its relentless assault.

Liam stood beneath the portico, listening to the downpour. Each raindrop seemed to echo the heaviness in his heart.

He recalled his conversation with Evelyn.

"Is there someone you love?" he had asked.

Her reply still haunted him. "Yes, but his heart belongs to another. There's no future for us."

How foolish he'd been to suspect Julian. Now the pieces fell into place - Evelyn's unrequited love was for his own brother, Donovan. The realization cut deeper than any blade.

Shaking off the painful thoughts, Liam reentered the mansion.

A stranger awaited him in the foyer.

Approaching with a respectful nod, the man introduced himself. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm Nathaniel Winslow, Cassandra's senior researcher."

Liam acknowledged him with a terse nod before proceeding to the grand hall, his mood darker than the storm outside.

Adrian Castillo sat bound at the center, his expression defiant despite his predicament.

Liam knelt before the traitor, his gaze piercing. "Where's Julian? And where are Cassandra's grandparents?"

Adrian met his gaze with a bitter smile, determination burning in his eyes.

Through clenched teeth, he spat, "Mr. Blackwood, I've already betrayed you. What reason would I have to reveal their whereabouts now?"
###Chapter 444

Liam's piercing gaze darkened like storm clouds gathering. "You seem to know me better than I know myself."

Adrian responded with an icy smirk that didn't reach his eyes. "After fifteen years by your side, General, I've learned all your tells."

"Then how dare you betray me?" Liam's voice remained dangerously calm, like the stillness before a hurricane.

Adrian defiantly lifted his chin, his jaw set in stubborn defiance. "Fortune favors those bold enough to seize it. No risk, no reward."

Liam rose slowly from his chair, his movements deliberate. "I fear you'll find your riches come with an expiration date." His voice was deceptively soft, like velvet over steel.

Turning away, Liam settled onto the leather couch. His expression appeared impassive, but those who knew him well could see the subtle tension in his shoulders.

Beneath his controlled exterior, a storm raged. Adrian had been more than a subordinate - he'd been a brother-in-arms. This betrayal cut deeper than any battlefield wound.

Outside, Aldenrian soldiers loaded prisoners into armored vehicles while the recovered explosives were secured in specialized containment trucks.

As dawn broke, the rain finally ceased, washing away the night's horrors.

After twenty-four grueling hours of emergency care, Rosalind's condition stabilized.

When Nathaniel arrived at the hospital and saw Evelyn's exhausted face, his chest tightened with sympathy.

With Rosalind resting, Evelyn and Nathaniel stepped into the sterile hospital corridor for privacy.

"So," Nathaniel began, leaning against the pale green wall, "with everything that's happened, when do you plan to return to Solterra?"

Evelyn's fingers twisted together nervously. "I don't want to go back. I want to stay in Aldenria with my grandparents. I need to find my parents." Her voice cracked. "Solterra isn't home anymore."

"Cassandra..." Nathaniel spoke gently but firmly. "The Institute won't allow that. Neither will our government."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Exactly. So I'll be dragged back to my lab, forced to live a life of regret and what-ifs."

"Solterra will help locate your family. You have my word."

"And what about him?" Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper.

Nathaniel frowned. "Who?"

"The man I love."

Nathaniel shrugged. "Simple solution. Bring him to Solterra with you. While your work is classified, spouses get monthly visitation rights."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she met Nathaniel's gaze. "Simon... the man I love is General Liam Blackwood."

Nathaniel's breath caught. The silence between them grew heavy.

Evelyn continued, her voice trembling. "He commands the Aldenrian military. Holds the rank of Defense General. Our positions... they make us enemies by default."

A single tear traced down her cheek as she covered her face with shaking hands. After a steadying breath, she confessed, "The cruelest part? We're forbidden from even exchanging letters."

Nathaniel looked down at his shoes. "When did you realize you loved him?"

Evelyn dropped her hands and exhaled slowly. "I think part of me always has. We were inseparable as children - practically grew up together. Back then, it was innocent. Pure. I thought he hung the moon."

Her fingers traced patterns on her knees. "After I left for Solterra, we lost contact. There was... an ache. But my studies consumed me, and maintaining ties seemed pointless, so I let go completely."

She smiled faintly. "The truth hit me three years ago, after the accident. When I saw him again..." Her voice softened with wonder. "It was like remembering something my soul had known all along."

Nathaniel's shoulders slumped. "Cassandra, in matters of national security, love is a luxury we can't afford." His words carried the weight of painful experience.
###Chapter 445

Evelyn turned toward him, her voice thick with curiosity. "What about family love? Doesn't that matter too?"

Nathaniel fell silent.

"I'm devoted to my work, but I also care deeply about my home, my family, and him," Evelyn affirmed.

"I changed my citizenship to pursue better research opportunities, but in doing so, I lost the people I loved most," she sighed, her tone heavy with regret. "Was it worth it?"

Nathaniel met her gaze. The sorrow in her eyes and the unshed tears stirred something inside him.

Suddenly, he spoke. "Evelyn, there might still be a way for you to go back."

She stiffened, her eyes locking onto his with nervous intensity.

Nathaniel reached out, pulling her closer. "Listen carefully."

Without hesitation, she leaned in. Cupping her ear, he whispered a string of words.

Evelyn blinked, her eyes brightening with sudden hope. A grateful smile curved her lips. "Thank you, Nathaniel."

He warned, "I've given you the solution, but success isn't guaranteed. It’ll require a gamble."

She nodded solemnly. "I’m willing to take that risk."

"Will he agree to it?" Nathaniel asked.

Her confidence wavered. "He’ll probably refuse."

"Why? Doesn’t he love you?"

Evelyn sighed. "His love is selfless. Asking him to act selfishly is impossible."

Nathaniel gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Then come up with a plan."

"Alright," she murmured, sinking into deep thought as she considered how to execute it.

At noon, Rosalind woke, and Evelyn helped her with lunch.

Ryan arrived with a bouquet of crimson roses and a basket of fresh fruit.

The sight of the bold red roses stunned both Evelyn and Rosalind.

Red roses for a hospital visit? Evelyn nearly laughed. Ryan was even bolder than Liam, who usually brought lilies.

Rosalind chuckled awkwardly.

Ryan handed her the flowers. "These are for you. Get well soon."

She gave a hesitant smile. "Thank you, but... red roses?"

Ryan explained, "The florist recommended them as the best choice."

With an amused smirk, Rosalind raised a brow. "Did she happen to have too many roses in stock?"

Ryan shook his head. "No, the shop only had these eleven."

Evelyn bit back a laugh and exchanged a knowing glance with Rosalind.

Both were flustered. Eleven roses—it was hard not to see it as a romantic gesture.

Sensing their discomfort, Ryan grew nervous. "Did I mess up? The florist swore women love these."

Rosalind quickly reassured him with a bright smile. "I do love them. It’s perfect."

Evelyn glanced toward the door, but Liam was nowhere in sight. Disappointment flickered in her chest. "Ryan, is Liam not coming?"

"He’s swamped with work. He asked me to pass along his regards," Ryan explained.

Evelyn pressed further. "Any news about my grandparents?"

Ryan shook his head. "Not yet."

Her mood dimmed, and she fell into a heavy silence.

"However," Ryan added, "there’s been a delay in your grandfather’s asset transfers. Only about 200 million has been moved overseas so far."

Money meant nothing to Evelyn. All she wanted was her family’s safe return.

Abruptly, she stood. "Ryan, I need some air. Can you stay with Rosalind?"
###Chapter 446

Ryan nodded without hesitation. "Of course."

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the hospital room, an awkward silence descended between Rosalind and Ryan.

Desperate to break the tension, Ryan fumbled for words. "Would you... like some fruit? I could peel you an apple."

Rosalind gave a small nod. "That would be nice."

His hands felt suddenly clumsy as he moved about the room. He scanned the space frantically before realizing the fruit basket sat right in front of him.

When he finally located the knife beside the oranges, his flustered movements drew a soft chuckle from Rosalind.

Three days later, Rosalind had fully recovered. On her discharge day, Ryan arrived to escort them home.

As they settled into Ryan's car, Evelyn turned to him. "Ryan, is Liam currently in Aldenria?"

"He is," Ryan confirmed.

"Is he occupied?" Evelyn pressed.

"Extremely busy," Ryan answered truthfully. He thought to himself, "When has Mr. Blackwood ever not been busy?"

"That's fine. It won't take much of his time anyway."

Curious, Ryan glanced at her. "Ms. Wright, do you need to discuss something with him?"

Evelyn gave instructions calmly. "Ryan, take me to Blackwood Manor first, then bring Rosalind back to Wright Manor."

"Understood."

Rosalind frowned in confusion. "Eve, why are you going to Blackwood Manor?"

Evelyn leaned close, covering her mouth as she whispered conspiratorially, "I'm going to steal something."

Rosalind's eyes widened in shock. "What could you possibly want to steal from him?" she hissed back.

Evelyn only responded with an enigmatic smile, shaking her head slightly to indicate she couldn't reveal her plans yet.

Rosalind studied her friend's expression with growing curiosity. She couldn't fathom what Evelyn would need to take from Liam Blackwood of all people.

Under the cover of night's stillness, a sleek black sedan glided through the gates of Blackwood Manor.

The driver stepped out promptly, opening the rear door with practiced ease. "Mr. Blackwood, we've arrived."

Emerging from his thoughts, Liam closed the documents he'd been reviewing, straightened his suit jacket, and gathered his files before stepping onto the cobblestone path. "You're dismissed for the evening."

The driver bowed slightly. "Goodnight, sir."

Liam pressed his thumb to the biometric scanner, pushing open the heavy oak door. As he entered, the unexpected glow of interior lights immediately put him on alert.

"Why are the lights on? Is Ryan here?" he wondered silently.

Closing the door behind him, Liam's sharp gaze swept across the living area before moving further inside.

A faint clinking sound came from the kitchen. Liam froze, his attention snapping toward the source of the noise.

At that moment, a graceful figure emerged from the kitchen doorway, carrying a tray of delicate china.

When Liam saw her, his heart stuttered before flooding with warmth. He stood rooted to the spot.

Evelyn's radiant smile lit up the room as she approached, her eyes soft with affection. "Liam, you're home. I made your favorite bread pudding. Would you like some?"

The domestic scene before him felt surreal - a beautiful woman waiting with homemade treats at this late hour. It seemed both dreamlike and painfully real.

Setting down the tray, Evelyn moved to take his jacket and files, arranging them neatly on the nearby sofa. When she turned back, her clear eyes met his, her smile like balm to his weary soul.

"Why are you here?" Liam asked, unable to mask his curiosity.

But Evelyn detected something else beneath his words. A flicker of disappointment crossed her features before she took his hand gently, leading him to the dining table.

"Liam, try the pumpkin soup first," she urged. "I made it specially for you."

Liam remained unmoved, repeating his question more firmly. "You still haven't told me why you came."
###Chapter 447

Evelyn settled across from him, her playful smile vanishing instantly. "Am I not adorable?"

Liam's fingers tightened around his glass. "You know that's not what I meant."

Resting her chin on her palms, Evelyn studied his stern expression, her words slow and deliberate. "I wanted to see you."

The declaration caught Liam off guard. His pulse quickened inexplicably, a sudden tension coiling in his chest.

Why had she come? Was there something she needed? Or was it something more... personal?

His throat went dry. He took a hurried sip of pumpkin soup, hoping to steady the erratic rhythm of his heart.

But the sweetness of the soup only mirrored the unease twisting inside him.

Setting the bowl down carefully, Liam exhaled. "Cassandra, if you have something to say, just say it. Vague words like that lead to misunderstandings."

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers twisting in her lap. Stealing wasn’t an option—she had to ask outright.

As Liam waited, she seemed to wrestle with herself.

He glanced briefly at his phone, checking for missed messages.

Beneath the table, Evelyn dug her nails into her palm, her heart hammering like a trapped bird. Before she could speak, heat already flooded her cheeks.

"Liam... would you come to bed with me?"

The words hung between them, heavy and charged.

A sharp clatter shattered the silence—Liam’s phone slipped from his grip and hit the floor.

Evelyn flinched, wide-eyed. Liam bent swiftly, retrieving it with uncharacteristic clumsiness.

He placed it on the table, then immediately pocketed it, his movements erratic. Her boldness had stunned him.

As she stepped closer, Liam rose abruptly, his voice rough. "Cassandra, I’ve made my stance clear. Someone as sharp as you shouldn’t struggle to understand my intentions."

Her face burned, but defiance flickered in her eyes. "I know what you’re afraid of. You think I’ll marry someone in Solterra, and you want to protect my... innocence."

"If you understand, then stop this," Liam bit out, his chest tight. He loosened his tie, fingers fumbling with the top button of his shirt before turning away. He strode toward the living room, needing distance.

Evelyn followed, her voice unsteady but determined. "I don’t even care about it. Why do you?"

At the bar, Liam poured himself a glass of ice water and drained it in one go. Setting it down, he faced her. "You could vanish any day. What do you really want?"

She stepped closer, tilting her head up. "Just one night with you. Or two. Maybe three."

She wanted his child—a gamble on Solterra’s mercy.

Liam dragged a hand through his hair, his body thrumming with restless heat. Her audacity was intoxicating.

"You’re out of your mind," he muttered. Grabbing her wrist, he pulled her toward the door. "I’m taking you home."

"I’m not leaving." Evelyn wrapped her arms around his waist, clinging stubbornly.

Liam couldn’t bring himself to push her away—not when he might hurt her. His throat worked as he looked down at her, his voice dropping to a rough whisper. "Cassandra... don’t make this harder."
###Chapter 448

Evelyn's pulse quickened with nervous anticipation as she hesitantly whispered, "Liam, are you... unable to perform?"

Liam's handsome face darkened instantly, his jaw tightening. The question struck at the very core of his masculinity, especially coming from the woman he adored more than life itself. He remained silent for an uncomfortably long moment, struggling to form a response.

Evelyn gasped. "You're serious?"

A heavy weight settled in Liam's chest. He drew a steadying breath before answering in a controlled tone, "Don't test me, Evelyn. It won't end well for you."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks, equal parts embarrassment and shock at Liam's uncharacteristic restraint.

Frustration bubbled up inside her at his continued refusal. "You claim to love me. That you've loved me since we were children. Were those all lies?"

Liam abruptly released her, creating physical distance between them as he stepped back.

His expression turned stormy. "Yes, I love you. More than anything. I want to spend every moment with you. But what about you, Evelyn? Is this real for you? Or just some passing fancy?"

Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs as she nodded fervently. "Yes, it's real."

Liam barely caught her whispered confession, his anger dissipating instantly. He countered sharply, "What kind of love is this? Physical attraction? Or just affection for the boy next door?"

Confusion clouded Evelyn's features. "Does it matter?"

Liam pressed forward, his voice rough with emotion. "Would you stay for me? Remain in Aldenria? Build a life with me here?"

Evelyn felt torn, her internal conflict written across her face. Not this again, she thought desperately. She'd been searching for solutions, but each path seemed to lead to heartbreak.

If successful, she'd return to Aldenria with their child. If she failed... she and the baby would remain in Solterra while Liam suffered alone in Aldenria.

Her fingers trembled as she reached for Liam's arm, her gaze tracing his beloved features. "Liam, I want nothing more than to stay with you in Aldenria. But this isn't a choice I can make freely. I have to go back."

"Enough," Liam cut her off sharply, shaking off her touch. He turned away with visible pain, striding toward his study.

Evelyn rushed after him, blocking his path with outstretched arms. Fighting to control her emotions, she pleaded with a tremor in her voice, "Liam, this is all I'm asking for right now. Can't you give me this one thing?"

Liam exhaled sharply, avoiding her imploring gaze. The sight of her begging tore at his soul.

Her frustration mounted at his continued rejection. Tears welled in her luminous eyes. "I'm willing to sacrifice everything - my innocence, my pride - and you still push me away. Do you even care for me? What's holding you back?"

After a tense silence, Liam finally spoke through clenched teeth. "Leave. Now."

"I won't!" Evelyn declared stubbornly.

Reaching his limit, Liam suddenly grabbed her wrist and pulled her flush against him, towering over her smaller frame.

His eyes burned crimson with barely restrained emotion. Each word seemed to cost him dearly as he ground out, "Cassandra, how much longer do you intend to torture me like this?"

Evelyn froze, tears glistening on her lashes.

Liam's voice turned savage. "Do you think the agony of your departure wasn't enough? Now you want to leave me with more bittersweet memories to haunt my sleepless nights for eternity?"

Evelyn shook her head violently as tears streamed down her face, her heart shattering at his words. The thought of causing him such pain was unbearable.

Seeing her silent tears, Liam's resolve crumbled. His voice broke with despair. "There's no man on earth who wants to marry you more than I do. I dream of sharing your bed, watching every sunrise and sunset by your side."
###Chapter 449

"Evelyn?" Liam's voice cut through the silence.

"Ten years of heartache was the price I paid for loving you. Do you really think I'm strong enough now to taste happiness, only to endure a lifetime of pain?"

Evelyn's head dipped slowly. She bit her lip, but the tears escaped anyway.

She wished she could erase everything—return to being just Evelyn Carter, the woman whose heart and soul belonged only to Liam, the woman who dreamed of nothing more than being his wife.

She longed for a life unburdened by duty, where love was pure and simple. But reality was cruel. Liam had his obligations, and she had hers.

Tears streaked her cheeks as she brushed past him, leaving Blackwood Manor without another word.

Less than thirty seconds later, Liam's composure shattered. He stormed outside, his strides urgent. Spotting Evelyn walking down the tree-lined driveway, he caught up in seconds and seized her wrist.

Under the glow of the streetlights, Evelyn wiped her tears and looked up at him.

His breathing was uneven, his jaw tight. Yet his voice softened as he said, "It's late. It's not safe for you to go alone. Let me drive you home."

Evelyn gave a silent nod.

"Wait here," he instructed before heading to the garage.

Moments later, his car pulled up. Evelyn slid inside, and they left Blackwood Manor behind.

The city glittered around them—neon signs, streams of headlights, the hum of nightlife. Inside the car, darkness swallowed them, broken only by fleeting flashes of streetlights.

The silence between them was suffocating.

Lost in thought, Evelyn stole glances at the passing world outside. Liam slowed the car, letting others overtake them.

As Wright Manor came into view, Evelyn finally spoke. "Liam... if I never come back, would you marry someone else? Have children?"

Liam hesitated. "I've never considered it."

"Consider it now," she pressed.

His answer came reluctantly. "Yes."

The word struck like a blade. If she couldn't return to Aldenria, Evelyn had already decided—she would never marry. She'd bury herself in science, in research, in anything but love.

His answer settled in her chest like a thorn. Would he really move on if she were gone?

Despite loving her for years, Liam had once bowed to family pressure and married another. Even if fate had twisted that marriage into something real, the truth remained—he would marry again.

The car stopped outside Wright Manor. Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt. "Drive safe," she murmured.

She walked away without looking back.

Liam killed the engine and leaned back, watching her disappear into the manor with a hollow ache in his chest.

"Go chase your dreams. I won't stand in your way. You've left me twice. I can't love again. I can't even think of another marriage."

"Cassandra... just be happy. That's all I want for you."

Night deepened. His car remained parked outside Wright Manor, a shadow in the quiet hours.

The next afternoon, Evelyn lay in bed, exhausted from a sleepless night. She had no appetite, no energy—just the weight of a chemistry book in her hands.

Unaware of her return—she'd gone to bed too early—Rosalind, now recovered from her illness, had gone hiking with Nathaniel.
###Chapter 450

Evelyn Carter looked utterly defeated, her spirit crushed. With all her loved ones taken hostage, she felt completely powerless. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t devise a plan to rescue them. Even contacting the authorities seemed pointless.

The research institute kept calling, demanding her immediate return. But Evelyn wasn’t the same workaholic she used to be. These days, her mind was weighed down by endless worries. No matter how hard she tried to focus, her thoughts kept drifting.

Just then, her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. She set aside the book she’d been pretending to read and reached for the device. The caller ID flashed Rosalind Fairchild.

"Hey, Rosalind," she answered, forcing lightness into her voice.

"Cassandra," Rosalind chirped, "I heard your friend’s been discharged from the hospital. So, when are we leaving for Solterra?"

Evelyn winced. "We’ll have to postpone. There are… things I need to handle first."

"Is this about your grandparents?" Rosalind’s tone softened. "Still no leads?"

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. "Julian Whitmore has them hidden. Tracking them down won’t be easy."

A scoff came through the line. "Well, at least Donovan finally agreed to treatment. I swear, if we don’t get him to Solterra soon and fix those eyes and legs, I might strangle him myself. This job is not worth the paycheck."

Evelyn couldn’t help but chuckle. "Rosalind, is he listening right now? Or are you just saying this for his benefit?"

Rosalind laughed. "Sharp as ever."

"You two can go ahead without me," Evelyn suggested.

"Are you kidding? I don’t speak Solterran, and we have zero connections there. I can’t just drag a half-blind, grumpy ex-agent across the globe with no backup."

Evelyn sighed. "Fair point."

Then, a deep voice cut in—Donovan’s.

"Who said I don’t speak Solterran?"

Rosalind gasped. "You do?"

"Obviously," Donovan replied, dry as ever.

Rosalind snorted. "Wow. Here I thought your only skills were scowling, throwing tantrums, breaking things, and telling me to get lost."

"Shut up if you have nothing useful to say," Donovan snapped.

"Oh, but I do," Rosalind teased.

"You insufferable woman."

"Hopeless," she shot back.

"Say that again. I dare you."

"Hopeless."

A rustling sound, then Donovan’s growl. "Come here. I’ll make you regret it. I’ll even change my last name if I can’t shut you up today."

"Donovan Blackwood," Rosalind taunted.

Silence.

Then, Rosalind’s voice turned urgent. "Cassandra, gotta go. Donovan’s on the warpath again. But don’t worry—he’s half-blind and slow. Never catches me anyway."

A crash.

"Too close! Gotta run!" The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn stared at her phone, baffled.

Somehow, Rosalind’s chaotic caregiving had breathed new life into Donovan. Maybe his desperation to escape her was the push he needed to finally seek treatment. The thought brought Evelyn a rare flicker of amusement.

She set her phone down and took a deep breath. Time to pull herself together.

Last night’s retreat didn’t mean surrender.

An hour later, Evelyn stood outside Blackwood Manor.

The midday sun scorched her skin, the heat radiating off the pavement. She hesitated for just a moment before nodding at the guards and stepping inside.

Squinting against the glare, she walked the familiar path through the front garden.

Then—a figure emerged from the house.

Evelyn froze.

Victoria Hudson stepped out, pausing mid-stride when she spotted Evelyn. A practiced smile curved her lips as she approached. "Ms. Wright. What a surprise. Here to see Liam?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

Victoria’s smile didn’t waver. "Liam mentioned last night that you two… ended things again. Is that true?"

Evelyn studied her. In the past, hearing about late-night conversations between Victoria and Liam would have twisted her stomach. Now?

Nothing.
###Chapter 451

Having faced Victoria's schemes before, Evelyn remained composed. "We were never truly together," she countered smoothly. "How could there be a breakup?"

Victoria's lips curled into a smirk. "Then why are you here to see him?"

Seizing the moment, Evelyn arched a brow. "You once bragged to me that you and Liam had been dating for a month and warned me to stay away. What's your excuse today?"

Victoria's fists clenched, her cheeks flushing crimson, but she said nothing.

"You didn’t see him last night, did you?" Evelyn pressed, unfazed. "You came here today under the pretense of work."

Gritting her teeth, Victoria remained silent.

Shielding her eyes from the glaring sun, Evelyn muttered, "It's too bright." With that, she stepped past Victoria.

Suddenly, Victoria called out, "Cassandra Wright, wait!"

It was the first time Victoria had used her full name instead of "Ms. Wright." Had she finally dropped the act?

Evelyn moved into the shade and turned to face her. "Ms. Hudson, is there something else?"

Taking a deep breath, Victoria approached, her voice dripping with venom. "Cassandra, don’t fool yourself into thinking you're special just because Liam has taken an interest in you. You're from Solterra. You’ll leave eventually."

She leaned in, her words sharp as a blade. "But I? I can be his lifelong companion—his colleague, his confidante. We have a lifetime ahead of us. You and him? That’s temporary."

The words struck deep, a searing pain lancing through Evelyn’s chest. It was a truth she couldn’t deny.

With a triumphant glint in her eyes, Victoria added, "We’re soulmates. Feelings grow with time. One day, he’ll be mine."

Without another word, she turned and strode away, leaving Evelyn standing there, heart heavy.

Watching Victoria’s retreating figure, Evelyn realized just how deeply Victoria loved Liam. With a woman like that by his side, doubt gnawed at her.

She turned and entered the manor. Glancing around, she deduced Liam must still be in his study—Victoria had just left, after all.

Without hesitation, she headed straight for the study. Just as she reached the door, it swung open, and Liam stepped out.

Before he could react, Evelyn threw herself into his arms, pressing close. The warmth of her body, the faint scent of jasmine—it stirred something in him.

Liam froze, his pulse quickening. He dipped his head, catching a glimpse of her face.

Softly, he murmured, "What brings you back?"

Evelyn exhaled, the ache in her chest still lingering. "Liam, I didn’t come to seduce you. I just... wanted to see you."

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. "Innocent women don’t usually throw themselves into a man’s arms upon arrival."

Her grip tightened, a hint of irritation in her voice. "Are you saying I’m not innocent?"

Sensing her unease, Liam softened his tone. "You are. It’s me who isn’t. Maybe I just have a magnetic pull on you."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh, the tension easing from her shoulders. Slowly, she released him and stepped back.

Liam’s gaze lingered, reluctant to let her go, though his expression remained composed. "So," he said, tilting his head. "What’s the real reason you’re here?"
###Chapter 452

Evelyn's lips curved into a gentle smile. "Nothing urgent. I just wanted to spend more time with you while I'm still in Aldenria, while you're still within reach."

Liam's question carried genuine curiosity. "To develop feelings for me?"

A delicate smile played on Evelyn's lips as she nodded in confirmation.

"And even after developing those feelings, you still plan to leave?" Liam pressed further.

Evelyn answered simply, "Yes."

Liam's expression darkened as he walked past her, murmuring under his breath, "You're only making things harder for yourself."

Following him into the living area, Evelyn persisted, "Why would you say that?"

As Liam settled into an armchair, he picked up a tangerine from the coffee table and began peeling it. "If you're determined to leave, why create complications where none exist?"

Evelyn hesitated to pursue that line of conversation. Leaning closer, she asked softly, "Liam, what did Victoria come to discuss with you earlier?"

Liam handed her the peeled fruit.

Evelyn blinked in surprise, a slow smile spreading across her face as she examined the tangerine in her palm.

Liam explained calmly, "Just delivering some documents and discussing work matters."

"What kind of work?" Evelyn asked between bites, savoring the fruit's sweetness and vibrant citrus aroma.

Liam frowned at her, maintaining his silence.

"Is it classified?" Evelyn pressed, sensing his reluctance.

Liam's demeanor turned serious. "Everything about my work should remain confidential from you."

Evelyn froze, her expression clouding. The rejection stung, leaving her feeling helpless.

She nibbled on the tangerine slowly, its tangy flavor contrasting with the heaviness in her chest.

Victoria's words echoed in her mind. Victoria could be Liam's lifelong companion - colleague, friend, or even soulmate.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's undefined position made even simple questions about Liam's work feel like intrusions into state secrets.

Noticing Evelyn's sudden melancholy, Liam's gaze intensified, his own heart sinking.

They sat together in comfortable silence, the moment stretching between them like suspended time.

Evelyn emerged from her thoughts to find Liam staring at her lips.

BONUS

She touched the corner of her mouth instinctively, finding nothing there, then glanced down at the tangerine in her hand.

Understanding his intention, she offered him the fruit. "Would you like some, Liam?"

Liam shook his head, his voice unexpectedly tender. "No, thank you."

"It's incredibly sweet, you should try it."

"You have it," Liam declined again, reaching for his phone instead.

Before he could unlock it, Evelyn surprised them both by kneeling on the sofa, cradling his face in her hands, and pressing her lips to his.

Liam froze at her boldness.

His phone slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor.

Though inexperienced, Evelyn's kiss was daring, parting his lips and sharing the tangerine's lingering sweetness. The soft yet tantalizing contact ignited his senses.

Liam tried to push her away, but his body betrayed him. His hands hovered at her shoulders, torn between rejection and possession.

Closing his eyes, Liam's hand moved from Evelyn's shoulder to cradle the back of her head, deepening the kiss as their tongues intertwined.

It felt like an eternity since their first kiss, the longing nearly consuming him.

Evelyn had only meant to share the fruit's flavor, but she hadn't anticipated Liam's passionate response, pulling her into an embrace that left them both breathless.
###Chapter 453

Evelyn leaned closer, her bare foot sliding across Liam's thigh as she settled onto his lap.

Liam's entire body went rigid. His passionate kiss came to an abrupt halt.

Her delicate fingers curled around his neck, hips lifting until they brushed against his growing arousal.

Electricity shot through Liam's veins. His heart pounded like war drums as every muscle tensed.

An undeniable response surged within him.

Gritting his teeth, Liam pushed her face away, his expression torn between desire and frustration. "We agreed - no seduction."

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson as she whispered, "It wasn't intentional."

His strong hands gripped her slender waist, pressing down firmly while pulling her closer. "Then explain this."

Squirming slightly from the pressure, she stammered, "I-It's just...natural."

Liam inhaled sharply, teetering on the edge of control. "You're playing with fire, Evelyn."

His voice came out rough and low, defenses crumbling under the weight of his desire.

She bit her lower lip, avoiding his intense gaze.

Liam's eyes dropped to her parted lips. The warmth of her body against his made his breathing ragged, chest rising and falling rapidly. Need burned through him like wildfire.

Evelyn was being reckless, and Liam found himself powerless to stop her.

In that moment, all his discipline evaporated.

She finally met his smoldering gaze, whispering shyly, "Liam...don't you want to try?"

One word escaped his lips. "Yes."

Consumed by longing, he wanted nothing more than to unleash years of pent-up passion. Countless sleepless nights had been spent imagining this moment.

Evelyn sensed victory. Her inexperienced hands tightened around his neck, instinctively seeking closeness.

That simple gesture nearly shattered Liam's restraint.

His chest constricted, breaths coming in heavy pants, lips dry with anticipation.

With sudden force, Liam lifted her and deposited her on the nearby sofa, away from dangerous proximity.

Only then did Evelyn notice how tightly his pants strained against him. "Wait here," Liam growled, voice thick with desire. "I'm getting protection."

He started to rise.

Evelyn caught his hand in panic. "No, we don't need that."

Confusion darkened Liam's features.

Guilt flashed across her face as she explained, "I'm afraid you won't come back."

He tenderly cupped her flushed cheek, gaze intense. "I promise I will."

"But..." Evelyn hesitated, struggling to find words.

Seeing her distress, Liam grew serious. Gently tilting her chin up, he searched her eyes. "Tell me truthfully - is this about affection? Curiosity? Or something else?"

"I just want to experience this with you," she admitted, ears turning pink. Her heart raced under his penetrating gaze.
###Chapter 454

"Then why not use protection?" Liam's voice was sharp as steel.

"My cycle's safe right now." Evelyn's fingers twisted in the sheets.

His eyebrow arched. "Wouldn't double protection be smarter?"

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. She scrambled for words, her pulse hammering. "I...the condom feels restrictive."

Liam froze. His eyes widened slightly, shock flashing across his features.

Mortification burned through Evelyn. She wished the floor would swallow her whole.

"That doesn't sound like you." Liam stepped back, one hand on his hip, the other raking through his cropped hair.

A terrible realization dawned. His gaze turned glacial. "Are you trying to get pregnant?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. Panic flared in her chest as their eyes locked. Her silence confirmed everything.

Liam staggered back as if struck. He tipped his head skyward, jaw clenched. Storm clouds gathered in his expression.

"Liam, please let me explain—"

"So this is why you've been throwing yourself at me?" His laugh was bitter. "Brilliant strategy, Cass."

Guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach. "I'm sorry. I knew you'd refuse if I asked properly."

Another hollow chuckle. "Yet you did it anyway?" His voice dropped dangerously low.

Evelyn's fists clenched. "Because I want your child."

The words hung between them like shattered glass. Liam's expression darkened with something akin to betrayal.

"You think I'm not suffering enough?" His voice cracked. "You'd bring a child into this mess just to chain me to Solterra?"

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision. She reached for him, fingers trembling.

Liam recoiled like she'd burned him.

A sob caught in Evelyn's throat. "What if...what if I loved you? Wanted to stay in Aldenria?"

"No hypotheticals." His gaze was flint. "Do you or don't you?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Answer me first."

Liam's chest rose sharply. When he spoke, his voice was raw. "If you chose me, chose Aldenria...I'd burn the world to keep you."

The confession shattered her. Tears streamed down Evelyn's face as she turned away.

She'd anticipated this. Feared it. Liam's capacity for obsession terrified her - how easily he'd prioritize desire over duty.

The missile incident flashed through her mind. That drug den obliterated after Donovan's near-death. Proof of what happened when Liam Blackwood loved too fiercely.

And now that fire was aimed at her.
###Chapter 455

Liam's turbulent emotions finally settled. His voice was soft yet filled with warmth as he gazed at Evelyn with hopeful eyes. "Cassandra," he murmured, "do you love me? Would you truly want to carry my child and stay here in Aldenria?"

Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her heart aching unbearably.

Liam's expression was earnest, his words sincere. "If you choose to stay, I swear I'll protect you with everything I have. No matter how powerful Solterra is, I won’t let them touch you. I’ll bear every burden for you."

She bit her lip, shaking her head as she took a step back.

"Liam, I can't let you risk everything to defy Solterra. And I won’t let you sacrifice your life for me," she whispered to herself.

Watching her retreat, tears streaking down her cheeks, Liam's chest tightened with agony.

He closed the distance between them, his hands gently gripping her shoulders as he lowered himself to meet her gaze. "Cassandra, tell me—do you love me too?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing back her tears. She lifted her chin, feigning indifference.

"No. When I return to Solterra, my focus will be on my work. Marriage isn’t part of my plans. I only admired your genes and wanted a child."

Liam's hands fell away. His eyes glistened with tears as he staggered back, devastation written across his face. Her words struck him like arrows, each one piercing deeper, leaving him breathless with pain.

A bitter laugh escaped him, hollow and filled with sorrow. His voice was low, rough with emotion. "If you don’t love me, then why go so far to hurt me like this?"

Evelyn remained silent, tears streaming freely now.

Liam turned away, walking to the sofa where his phone lay. His back was rigid, his shoulders tense. Tears spilled over, his chest constricting with anguish.

His voice turned icy. "Cassandra, let’s pretend we never met. Let’s pretend we never loved. If we see each other again, we’ll be strangers."

"No!" Evelyn cried out, her heart shattering at his words. She couldn’t bear it any longer.

She rushed forward, clutching his hand desperately. "Liam, please don’t do this! After the baby is born, I’ll send them back to Aldenria. I’ll bear the pain of separation. There’s still a chance I can return with them—"

No country would abandon a scientist of her caliber.

But no matter where the child ended up, the separation would still tear her apart.

Liam couldn’t understand—wouldn’t accept—such selfishness. He wrenched his hand from her grasp and strode toward the door.

"Liam!" Evelyn sobbed, chasing after him.

His steps were swift, as if he couldn’t bear to be near her a second longer.

Blinded by tears, Evelyn stumbled, her knees hitting the ground hard. She winced, looking up just in time to see Liam climbing into his car outside the garden. The engine roared to life, and within seconds, he was gone.

Gingerly, she touched her throbbing knee. Curling into herself, she wrapped her arms around her legs and buried her face against them.

Her shoulders shook with silent sobs. Tears dripped onto the floor, each drop a testament to her shattered heart.

The pain was unbearable, searing through her chest like fire.

All she had wanted was to handle her return to Solterra with as little pain as possible. Had she been wrong? Why did Liam care so much about the child?
###Chapter 456

The haunting melody of her phone's ringtone sliced through the tense silence.

Evelyn slowly lifted her tear-streaked face from her knees. With trembling fingers, she wiped her swollen eyes and fished the device from her pocket.

Rosalind Baskins' name flashed on the screen.

Taking a shuddering breath, Evelyn steadied her voice before answering. "Rosalind?"

"Evelyn!" Rosalind's voice crackled with barely contained panic. "Where are you?"

Pushing herself up from the cold floor, Evelyn brushed dust from her jeans. "Blackwood Manor."

"Get to the old construction site near the river - I'm sending coordinates now!" Rosalind's words tumbled out in a rush. "Hurry!"

The urgency in her tone sent chills down Evelyn's spine. She was already moving toward the exit. "What's happening? Tell me!"

"We found your grandmother," Rosalind whispered.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. Her pace quickened to a run. "Where? Send the location now!"

"Just... prepare yourself," Rosalind warned ominously.

The ominous words made Evelyn's blood run cold. Hailing the first taxi she saw, she raced toward the abandoned construction zone on the city's outskirts.

When she arrived, the flashing police lights and yellow tape made her stomach twist. Two uniformed officers stood guard at the perimeter.

"Evelyn!" Rosalind spotted her immediately and rushed forward, gripping her icy hands.

Evelyn's entire body trembled. "Where is she?" The words barely escaped her constricted throat.

Rosalind pointed upward with a grim expression.

Evelyn's gaze followed the gesture - and her heart stopped.

Tears blurred her vision as she saw Margaret suspended mid-air. Ropes bound the elderly woman to a massive crane, with what appeared to be explosives strapped to her chest. The sight tore through Evelyn like shrapnel.

She lunged toward the nearest officer, fingers digging into his sleeve. "Why aren't you saving her? Do something!"

"Are you family?" the officer asked carefully.

Evelyn nodded frantically, her terrified gaze darting back to her grandmother. Every second felt like torture.

The officer lowered his voice. "The explosives are remote-controlled. The crane's control room is also rigged. Our bomb squad was injured by hidden devices when they tried approaching."

Evelyn's breath came in shallow gasps. "There are more bombs?"

He nodded grimly, gesturing to the cluster of officers and specialists huddled nearby. "They're working on a rescue strategy."

"What about that crane?" Evelyn pointed desperately to a second machine. "Can't you use it to reach her?"

"We can't risk it," the officer admitted. "If the bomber sees our people approaching, they might detonate immediately."

Understanding flashed across Evelyn's face. Before anyone could stop her, she ducked under the police tape.

"Stop! It's too dangerous!" the officer shouted after her.

Rosalind screamed, "Evelyn, no! Come back!"

A bomb squad member in full gear intercepted her. "Are you insane? Get behind the barrier!"

Evelyn grabbed his arm with desperate strength. "Tell me how to disarm it. Let me go up there - please!"
###Chapter 457

The bomb squad specialist's voice sliced through the charged air, grim and unyielding. "This is a remote detonation device. Approaching it means certain death."

Yet Evelyn's determination didn't waver. "They won't hurt me. If I'm present, they wouldn't dare activate it."

"Show me how to disable it. Let me try."

The specialist's patience snapped. "You're throwing your life away for nothing. Remove her immediately!" he ordered sharply.

Evelyn clutched the specialist's arm desperately, her grip iron-strong. "Let me go up there. I'm Cassandra Wright. They won't harm me. Please, teach me how to disarm it. Trust me!" Though he understood her desperation to save Margaret, the specialist couldn't fathom her willingness to walk into danger. "Your identity means nothing here. Evacuate the blast zone now."

Suddenly, Margaret's frail voice carried from above, calling, "Cassie, my Cassie..."

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes shot upward. She blinked rapidly, wiping her cheeks with trembling fingers before forcing a smile.

"Grandmother, stay calm! I'm coming for you. You'll be safe soon!"

Margaret's gentle smile was visible even from below. "Cassie darling, you know how much I love you, don't you?"

Evelyn nodded through fresh tears. "I do, Grandmother. Save these words for later. We'll talk properly at home, yes?"

Margaret's voice rang clear again, "Cassie, I've seen your parents and little brother already. I have no regrets now. From heaven, I'll watch over you all, keeping you safe." Evelyn's heart shattered with each painful beat. Her voice broke as she cried, "Grandmother, where are they? And Grandfather?"

"They're held in a basement. The location... I couldn't see much through the window."

Seeing Margaret's fragile form, Evelyn dropped to her knees before the specialist. "Please! Let me go up! Whether it's Obsidian Circle or Julian, they won't harm me. I can save her!"

The specialist signaled nearby officers. Immediately, two policemen seized Evelyn's arms to escort her away.

Margaret watched with bittersweet affection, tears streaming down her weathered face. "Cassie, never forget me! I love you beyond measure!"

Restrained by the officers, Evelyn couldn't turn back for a final look.

Once beyond the perimeter, Rosalind rushed to her side, breathless. "Evelyn, don't be reckless, just wait—"

Before she could finish, a deafening explosion tore through the morning air, shaking the ground violently. The shockwave sent everyone diving for cover.

Rosalind lunged forward, wrapping Evelyn in a protective embrace.

Evelyn stood frozen, her entire being numb with shock. It felt as though part of her soul had been obliterated with Margaret.

She remained rigid in Rosalind's arms as dust and debris rained around them.

Rosalind peered toward the explosion's epicenter. Through the swirling smoke and harsh sunlight, Margaret's form seemed to dissolve like autumn leaves scattering in the wind.

Tears welled in Rosalind's eyes but she blinked them back fiercely. She had to remain strong for Evelyn now.

Evelyn's entire body began trembling violently, her tears falling like a storm. The pain in her chest was so acute she could barely breathe.

She fought against Rosalind's hold, desperate to see. But Rosalind held firm, her voice cracking, "Evelyn, don't look!"

Sobbing uncontrollably, Evelyn pleaded, "It's not her, right? The explosion missed her. Let me see—"

Rosalind cradled Evelyn's face, preventing her from turning. "Don't look, darling. Please don't look."
###Chapter 458

"Is Grandma alright? Please tell me she's alive!" Evelyn's anguished scream shattered the tense silence. Her knees gave way as her world collapsed around her.

Rosalind moved swiftly, catching Evelyn before she hit the ground. They sank to their knees together, clinging to each other like survivors of a shipwreck.

Evelyn's entire body shook with violent sobs. The pain was unbearable - watching Margaret slip away right before her eyes, powerless to stop it.

From childhood memories to this devastating moment, Margaret had been her anchor, her source of unconditional love. Now only emptiness remained where that warmth had been.

Her fingers twisted the fabric of her blouse into knots over her heart, as if she could physically contain the agony tearing her apart. But the pain only grew sharper with each shallow breath.

The crushing regret of never getting to properly meet her grandmother dragged Evelyn into darkness. She collapsed into Rosalind's arms.

When consciousness returned, dawn light filtered through the curtains.

Rosalind hadn't moved from her bedside vigil. Seeing Evelyn stir, she gently brushed hair from her forehead. "You're awake. Can I get you anything? Some water perhaps?"

Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling, her face a mask of grief though her tears had dried.

"Liam came by last night," Rosalind continued softly. "He was here again this morning but had to leave."

Evelyn turned slowly, her eyes glistening. "Did he say anything?"

"Julian's been declared an international fugitive," Rosalind answered.

Evelyn closed her eyes in silent acknowledgment.

"Don't blame Liam for not staying," Rosalind added gently. "He's dealing with his own battles."

Evelyn shook her head. Despite Liam's decision to keep his distance, his two visits spoke volumes about his lingering concern.

Rosalind hesitated before continuing. "According to Ryan, the prison transport carrying Adrian was ambushed yesterday. There was a shootout on the highway - two officers died in the explosion."

Evelyn drew a sharp breath. "They're monsters."

Rosalind's expression darkened. "There's more."

Evelyn's gaze snapped to her. "What?"

"After you fainted, Julian called. He demanded you contact him when you woke up."

Evelyn's face hardened. She pushed herself upright and reached for her phone.

Rosalind retrieved it, found the call log, and placed the device in Evelyn's trembling hands.

Evelyn activated speakerphone. After several rings, Julian's voice crackled through. "Cassandra, feeling better?"

Even through the static, Evelyn's hatred burned white-hot.

She swallowed her tears, voice razor-sharp. "They raised you, loved you, gave you everything. And you murdered them."

"Calling you ungrateful would be too kind. You're not even human."

Julian chuckled darkly. "First time venting your rage? I'm flattered."

"Where are they?" Evelyn demanded.

"Safe. For now," came the icy reply.

"Release them and I'll give you whatever you want - even my life."

"Ah, but your brilliant mind is too valuable," Julian mocked. "Though I can't risk bringing you to our facility."

"What do you want then?"

"Margaret was merely a warning," Julian explained. "Liam froze the Wright family assets. Now I need you to unfreeze them."
###Chapter 459

Evelyn's blood boiled as each accusation tore from her lips. "You only care about money! I would have given you everything - the entire Wright fortune. Why murder Grandmother? Why destroy our family?"

Julian's cold chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "With the Wright assets frozen across Aldenria and me branded a fugitive in Valtoria, I needed to prove my power. Or you'd keep underestimating me."

Darkness clouded Evelyn's features as her fists clenched. White-hot hatred pulsed through her veins.

"Meet Genevieve," Julian continued smoothly. "My new wife. By tomorrow, she'll control all Wright assets with Archibald's documents. The company, the estate - everything."

His voice turned lethal. "If you want your family to avoid Margaret's fate, don't interfere. Keep Liam away. Fail me again, and I'll burn your world to ashes."

Family meant everything to Evelyn. Without hesitation, she agreed. "Harm no one else, and you'll have whatever you want."

Julian's lips curled. "Excellent. Now hand over the hydronium."

"It's worthless without me," Evelyn countered. "No one understands its properties like I do."

"But I can sell it," Julian purred. "Five billion dollars per gram on the black market."

"Your greed disgusts me."

"Deliver all forty-eight vials to Genevieve by tomorrow."

"Fine." Evelyn ended the call and hurled her phone across the room.

Rosalind gaped at her, eyes wide with alarm.

Evelyn squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Only the military's senior researchers truly understand the compound."

Rosalind remembered the border explosion - when those same professors failed to replicate just two vials of Azurium.

Understanding dawned. "You're giving him counterfeit hydronium?"

Evelyn nodded.

"But what if he discovers the deception?" Rosalind's voice trembled.

"Julian's no chemist. Even the best couldn't detect fakes without comparing them to the real thing."

Rosalind exhaled slowly. "That makes sense."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"Unless there's a traitor in Liam's research team."

Rosalind gasped. "Surely not?"

Evelyn's mind raced. The imposter Victoria infiltrating the institute... The spilled Azurium... Someone had orchestrated it all.

Azurium remained priceless in Aldenria - scarce despite the country's resources. Without Evelyn's refinement blueprints, obtaining it required exorbitant sums or dangerous overseas deals.

Her stomach twisted. Snatching her phone, she dialed with shaking fingers.

Rosalind caught her arm. "What's wrong?"

"I have to warn Liam," Evelyn said urgently. "His team might have a mole."
###Chapter 460

The call disconnected before Evelyn could even process the dial tone. Liam's abrupt end left Rosalind utterly confused.

"Why did he hang up, Evelyn?"

Evelyn's voice trembled with barely contained emotion. "He refuses to see me or speak to me. You talk to him."

Rosalind's eyebrows shot up. "That can't be true."

Evelyn didn't respond, pulling the covers over her head like a shield against the world. The darkness provided temporary refuge as she squeezed her eyes shut against the pain.

Still baffled, Rosalind answered the incoming call. "Mr. Blackwood, it's Rosalind."

A brief pause. Then Liam's deep voice asked, "Is Cassandra awake?"

"She is," Rosalind confirmed.

His next question came clipped and professional. "How's her condition?"

"Physically fine," Rosalind answered carefully. "Emotionally... not so much."

Another pause. Then, "Was there something you needed?"

Rosalind glanced at the human-shaped lump beneath the blankets. "Cassandra suspects there might be a mole in your research team."

"I know," Liam replied, his tone unsettlingly calm.

"You knew?" Rosalind couldn't hide her surprise.

"We've been investigating since we exposed the imposter Victoria," he explained.

Rosalind nodded, impressed despite herself by Liam's efficiency.

"Mr. Blackwood," she ventured, "would you like to speak with Cassandra now?"

The silence stretched so long Rosalind thought the call had dropped. When Liam finally spoke, his voice had turned icy. "That won't be necessary. Take care of her."

Rosalind frowned at the sudden chill in his tone - so different from his earlier concern.

She ended the call with a quiet acknowledgment.

Beneath the covers, Evelyn finally let the tears fall. The grief over Margaret's death mixed painfully with Liam's deliberate distance.

The next afternoon brought an unwelcome visitor to Wright Manor - Julian's supposed new wife, Genevieve. Plain in appearance but radiating sharp intelligence, she arrived flanked by a team of lawyers.

With clinical efficiency, she took control of the estate, presenting documents that declared her rightful inheritance. The media frenzy that followed painted Cassandra as the disinherited heiress of the Wright fortune.

Speculation ran wild about the billionaire family's internal power struggles, though the truth remained carefully hidden.

In the grand foyer of Wright Manor, Evelyn studied the inheritance papers handed to her by one of Genevieve's assistants. The signatures of Archibald and Margaret were genuine - but obtained under duress.

Legally, Evelyn could challenge them. But doing so would risk another financial disruption that might endanger her remaining family.

"How long have you known Julian?" Evelyn asked coolly.

Genevieve's smile didn't reach her eyes. "About two weeks."

"Two weeks?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "And you truly know what kind of man he is?"

Genevieve crossed her arms. "Our marriage is purely transactional. His character is irrelevant."

"You'll regret this," Evelyn warned.

Genevieve merely laughed.

Without another word, Evelyn guided Rosalind upstairs to pack. Genevieve's voice followed them: "Julian's demands must be met by tonight."

Evelyn paused mid-step, then continued upward, her expression carefully blank.

After packing their belongings and delivering the counterfeit materials Genevieve demanded, they left Wright Manor behind.

In the car, Rosalind asked, "Evelyn, are we going to Blackwood Manor?"

Evelyn leaned her forehead against the cool window glass, watching the world blur past. Everything looked gray through her tear-filled eyes.

"Let's find a hotel," she whispered.
###Chapter 461

Evelyn Carter burned with curiosity about the unresolved tension between Liam Blackwood and Julian Whitmore. Yet she bit her tongue. Some wounds were too private to probe, and she knew better than to meddle in affairs that weren't hers.

She checked into a luxury suite with Rosalind Baskins at The Grand Aldenria.

The following week blurred into a haze of funeral arrangements. Margaret Hoffis had requested simplicity - just family gathered quietly. Evelyn honored this by selecting a secluded hillside cemetery where morning mist curled between ancient oaks.

She deliberately shut out the world. No news alerts. No corporate emails. Just the four walls of her hotel room and the gaping hole in her chest.

Meanwhile, her fingers traced the contours of Valtoria's map each night, searching for patterns in the topography that might reveal where Julian had stashed her missing relatives.

Rosalind returned one evening bearing a tray from the hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant. "You need to eat," she insisted, setting down roasted duck with black truffle. "You're wasting away."

"Not hungry," Evelyn murmured without looking up from the coastline she was scrutinizing.

Rosalind slid the plate directly over the map. "I wasn't asking."

Evelyn finally met her gaze. "Tell me honestly - did you bug Wright Manor?"

A shadow crossed Rosalind's face. "Every device was found and destroyed within hours."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. Julian's counter-surveillance skills confirmed her worst fears - this was no amateur criminal.

"Is Genevieve Prescott under watch?"

Rosalind smirked. "Between Liam's team and mine? That woman couldn't sneeze without us knowing. The moment she contacts Julian, we'll have them both."

Evelyn pushed aside the map and drew Rosalind onto the velvet sofa. "I need you to do something for me."

"Name it."

"I'm returning to Solterra alone. Stay here and keep searching for my family."

Rosalind's spine straightened. "Absolutely not. My orders are to protect you."

Evelyn's grip tightened. "You're the only one I trust with this. Please."

"But Liam has teams-"

"I can't face Solterra without knowing you're here fighting for them." The raw plea in Evelyn's voice shattered Rosalind's resolve.

With a reluctant nod, the bodyguard agreed.

Evelyn's final play would come during her ovulation window - she'd bargained for those extra fifteen days. This wasn't just about scientific duty anymore.

It was about reclaiming everything Julian had stolen - her family, her legacy, her chance with Liam.

The morning she arrived at Royal Heights, mist clung to the wrought iron gates of Blackwood Manor like spectral fingers. Benjamin Hudson nearly dropped his coffee when she materialized in his foyer.

Gone was the naive artist he'd met months ago. Before him stood a woman tempered by loss, her once-vibrant eyes now holding depths of sorrow and steel.

"Benjamin," she said without preamble. "I need your help."

He blinked. "With what?"

Her answer sent his cup crashing to the marble floor.

"I want Liam Blackwood."

The silence that followed could have choked a dragon.
###Chapter 462

The moon cast a silvery glow over Hudson Manor, its windows blazing with golden light.

Victoria returned home well past midnight to find Benjamin sprawled across the sofa, his cheeks flushed and the sharp scent of whiskey clinging to him.

She wrinkled her nose in disapproval. "What possessed you to drink this much?"

Benjamin offered a lazy grin, his words slightly slurred. "Had no choice. Needed to get Liam drunk."

Perching on the edge of the sofa, Victoria narrowed her eyes. "And why would you do that?"

His smirk turned wicked as he leaned forward, excitement glittering in his gaze. "Cassandra came to see me today. She told me she wants Liam..."

Victoria's face drained of color, her nails digging into her palms.

Benjamin chuckled, clearly enjoying her reaction. "Thought she was going to propose. Never expected that after six months of marriage, they still hadn't... well, you know. Shocked me so much I—"

Before he could finish, Victoria shot to her feet, already striding toward the door.

Benjamin lunged forward, catching her wrist. "Where do you think you're going?"

"To protect Liam!" she snapped, eyes blazing.

Sobering slightly, Benjamin tightened his grip. "From what? They're in love—it's none of your business!"

"Love?" Victoria spat, teeth clenched. "Who said anything about love? Cassandra's leaving for Solterra soon—she won't stay with him!"

"He loves who she was, not this selfish woman she's become!" Benjamin shot back. "You're delusional. Liam's feelings aren't yours to dictate. Let it go."

Frustration boiled over as Victoria stomped her foot. "They ended things weeks ago! Liam's moved on—he hasn't spoken to her in over two weeks. Why are you helping that witch hurt him?"

Benjamin's expression darkened with suspicion. "How do you know they haven't spoken? Did you bribe someone close to him?"

Victoria wrenched her arm free. "Let me go! I need to help Liam!"

"Too late. Cassandra's been with him for hours," Benjamin said flatly.

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes, her face twisting with rage. "Are you insane? Why are you helping her instead of your own sister?"

Her voice cracked. "You know how I feel about him. You know I've loved him for years. If you'd just support me—"

"Enough!" Benjamin snapped. "Love isn't something you can force. If Liam doesn't want Cassandra, even drunk, he wouldn't touch her."

Devastated, Victoria collapsed to the floor, hugging her knees as sobs wracked her body.

Benjamin knelt beside her, rubbing her back gently. "Victoria, Liam doesn't love you. He only tolerates you because you're my sister."

His voice softened. "If you weren't family, you wouldn't even be his friend. Be rational—some things can't be forced."

Victoria surged to her feet, eyes burning with fury. "I'll never give up," she hissed, jaw clenched.

"Cassandra will leave soon. She has no future with him. Besides..." Her voice turned icy. "I've already applied for a transfer."

Benjamin froze. "What transfer?"

Wiping her tears, Victoria lifted her chin. "To the military. To be near Liam."

Her voice hardened. "If I'm there every day, showing him how much I care, he'll fall for me eventually."

Benjamin's face twisted in disbelief. "Have you lost your mind?"

Victoria gave him one last scathing look before turning on her heel and storming upstairs.

Left alone, Benjamin paced the living room, hands raking through his hair in frustration.
###Chapter 463

The clock struck 2:00 am, casting an eerie glow from the second-floor window of Blackwood Manor.

Evelyn perched on the edge of the bed, studying Liam's intoxicated form with quiet intensity.

Even in drunken slumber, his chiseled features remained striking - those piercing eyes now closed, the strong jawline softened only slightly by alcohol.

She'd begged Benjamin to get him drunk, knowing this might be her last chance before returning to Solterra tomorrow.

A cold dread settled in Evelyn's stomach as she contemplated her dangerous mission. Would she even survive to see him again?

The thought of becoming strangers with Liam terrified her more than any battlefield.

Tears spilled silently down her cheeks as she reached out to trace his jawline.

Three hours she'd sat here, memorizing every contour of his face.

Yet now that the moment had come, hesitation gripped her.

What if she did conceive his child and never returned?

Would he despise her forever?

Brushing away tears, she leaned close to whisper, "Liam, wake up for me?"

When he stirred slightly at her breath against his ear, she pressed her lips to his in desperation.

Liam's eyelids fluttered open, revealing hazy green eyes that struggled to focus. His arms instinctively pulled her closer, returning the kiss with sleepy passion.

Evelyn climbed atop him, their bodies molding together as the kiss deepened.

To Liam's alcohol-fogged mind, this felt like another torturous dream of the woman he loved. Yet the warmth of her skin felt too real to be imagined.

With sudden clarity, he flipped their positions, pinning her beneath him. "How did you get here?" he rasped, voice thick with sleep and liquor.

Evelyn's heart shattered at the question. Another failure.

"Nate," her voice broke, "I leave tomorrow. Is there truly no future for us?"

A bitter smile twisted his lips, eyes glistening. "Cassandra, how pathetic is this? Repeatedly seducing a man you don't love, then speaking of futures? Your future has nothing to do with love, does it?"

As sobriety returned to Liam's gaze, Evelyn's panic grew. "Don't you love me anymore?" she pleaded.

His voice turned glacial. "I'm not some lapdog content with scraps. I want real love, not whatever this is while your heart belongs elsewhere."

Tears choked her as she whispered, "But I do love you, Liam. Truly."

His body tensed momentarily before he scoffed. "So low you'd sink to trap me with a child? Do you think your lies still fool me?"

"What must I do to prove myself?" she cried.

"Stay in Aldenria. Marry me. Build a life here. Promise never to betray me. Can you?" His challenge hung between them.

Evelyn's silence answered for her.

Liam recoiled as if burned, retreating to the foot of the bed. He pressed palms to his temples, silent tears betraying his anguish.

In that moment, Evelyn felt herself unraveling. No matter how she tried, Liam always resisted.

Was it strength of will...or simply that he no longer wanted her?
###Chapter 464

Was Liam's passion truly governed by reason alone?

If primal instincts like desire were always ruled by logic, then perhaps love itself would lose its meaning. Evelyn rose slowly, wiping away her tears with trembling fingers. She resolved to make one final attempt. If this failed, she would release Liam completely - return peacefully to Solterra and immerse herself in scientific research. Her family's safety would be entrusted to the governments of Aldenria and Solterra.

As for herself... she never intended to come back.

Evelyn pulled the ribbon from her hair, letting the silken strands cascade over her bare shoulders. With deliberate movements, she began unfastening the buttons of her blouse, each undone clasp sending shivers down her spine.

Heat flooded her cheeks as each garment slipped away. Her pulse hammered wildly, breaths coming in shallow gasps. Liam's cruel words echoed in her mind: "You mean nothing to me. Strip naked and dance before me - I wouldn't even glance your way, let alone touch you."

This would be her ultimate test of his indifference.

Her fingertips brushed his stubbled jaw. Suddenly, iron fingers clamped around her wrist. Liam's eyes flew open, bloodshot and burning with barely restrained hunger.

The moment his gaze fell upon her naked form, his entire body tensed like a coiled spring. Despite his controlled exterior, desire raged within him like a tempest. When reason returned, he grabbed the nearest blanket to cover her, his voice rough with restraint.

"Cassandra, have you no shame left?"

"None whatsoever," she whispered, cheeks flaming. Summoning every ounce of courage, she wound her arms around his neck and crushed her lips to his. This time, Liam didn't resist - his body had betrayed him completely.

He surrendered to the kiss with devastating hunger.

When Evelyn pushed him backward, he fell without resistance. Liam's kisses grew feverish, his hands roaming possessively. Guiding his palm up her body, she felt the exact moment his control shattered.

Rational thought drowned beneath a tidal wave of need. Liam flipped her beneath him with a growl, his mouth claiming hers with bruising intensity before trailing fire down her throat and lower still... Clothes were discarded, years of pent-up desire unleashed at last.

Bitterness twisted in Liam's chest even as he lost himself in her. He resented how easily she'd undone him, knowing she would walk away just as effortlessly afterward. There would be no mercy shown tonight.

Though Evelyn had initiated their coupling, she soon found herself weeping, begging for respite. But Liam was beyond stopping now.

The night stretched endlessly.

For Evelyn, the first experience proved excruciating. Wave after wave of pain with no pleasure to temper it, repeated until dawn's first light.

Liam finally slept as morning painted the sky.

When consciousness returned near noon, it felt like emerging from an impossibly vivid dream - one whose memory would haunt him forever. But reality struck like a dagger to the heart when he opened his eyes to an empty bed.

His hand slid across cold sheets where Evelyn's warmth should have been. Gone. Just like ten years ago, separated by borders with no means of contact. Never to meet again.

A thousand needles seemed to pierce his chest, each breath agony. His lips twisted in a bitter smile even as tears escaped his closed eyelids.
###Chapter 465

The grand halls of Solterra's government buildings buzzed with excitement as Evelyn Carter made her unexpected return. High-ranking officials personally welcomed her, their faces alight with admiration and relief.

Yet the celebration proved fleeting.

Before the welcoming speeches could conclude, Evelyn calmly presented her resignation letter to the astonished assembly.

This wasn't her first attempt. Five times before, she'd sought to leave her position, only to be persuaded to stay. Each refusal had weighed heavier than the last.

A team of government counselors immediately mobilized, their sole mission to change her mind. They arrived daily with new incentives, promises, and appeals to patriotism.

With Rosalind Baskins no longer serving as her assistant, the research institute assigned a new aide to manage Evelyn's schedule and needs.

Exclusive content by NovelDrama.Org.

Evelyn maintained her rigorous work routine by day, but nights found her preparing meticulously for departure. She compiled years of hydronium research into comprehensive reports, ensuring nothing would be lost when she left.

Four weeks passed in this rhythm.

Then one morning at dawn, Evelyn awoke with a sudden, violent nausea. She barely made it to the bathroom before dry heaves wracked her body.

After the episode passed, she rinsed her mouth with trembling hands and returned to her bedroom. With practiced movements, she opened the secured safe beside her bed.

Among the classified documents lay fifteen unused pregnancy tests - and three that had already delivered negative results.

Each morning brought the same ritual, the same hope, the same crushing disappointment. The cycle left her emotionally raw, her nerves frayed with anticipation.

This time, her heart pounded as she entered the bathroom once more.

Standing before the mirror, Evelyn watched the test strip with bated breath. The seconds stretched endlessly until...

One line appeared. Then, miraculously, a second.

Evelyn's hands flew to her mouth as tears spilled down her cheeks. Her entire body trembled with joy. Only one thought filled her mind: Liam.

She needed to return to Aldenria immediately. To stand before him and say those precious words: "Liam, I'm carrying our child. Marry me properly this time."

Rushing back to her room, she reached for the secure landline - then froze.

Every call from the research institute was monitored. This news couldn't be shared over tapped lines.

As she lowered the receiver, another wave of nausea hit. Evelyn barely made it back to the bathroom before vomiting acidic bile into the sink.

When the spasms finally ceased, she tenderly cradled her abdomen. "Be strong, little one," she whispered. "Your father and I have waited so long for you."

Frederick Mills, director of the Solterra Research Institute, stared at the sixth resignation request from his star scientist with growing concern. He'd rejected the previous five, but this one contained troubling new information.

He found Evelyn in her laboratory, fingers flying across a holographic keyboard. She stood respectfully when he entered. "Director Mills."

His hands shook slightly as he held up the document. "Evelyn... this mentions pregnancy. Is this true?"

She gestured to a chair and poured tea, her movements graceful despite the morning sickness. Frederick waved away the offering. "The father... it's Aldenria's Defense General, isn't it?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "As noted in my previous reports, Director, I married General Blackwood during my amnesia in Aldenria."

"But you weren't pregnant then," Frederick pressed.

"Correct. After my memories returned, our emotional connection remained. The pregnancy... happened before I realized." Her hand drifted unconsciously to her stomach.

Frederick sighed deeply, his expression conflicted. After a long silence, he tried once more. "Evelyn, you're a national treasure. Your contributions to chemical research are unparalleled. The government would provide everything - the finest care, elite education-"

"I want my child to have two parents," Evelyn interrupted softly. "A complete family. That's what I can't provide here."
###Chapter 466

A dull ache pulsed through Frederick's temples as he massaged his forehead. The steaming cup of Earl Grey tea did little to soothe his nerves.

Cassandra Wright stood resolute before him, her posture unwavering. "Mr. Mills, if my leaving would truly cripple our nation's scientific advancement, I would reconsider."

She placed a thick folder on the mahogany desk. "I'm prepared to donate all my hydronium research data from the past decade. This should provide sufficient foundation for other scientists to continue my work."

Frederick leaned forward, his fingers steepled. "Cassandra, consider the legacy of great female scientists before you. Marie Curie sacrificed everything for radioactivity research. Rosalind Franklin's work on DNA structure went unrecognized until after her death."

"Agatha Winslow spent years in remote villages developing her malaria treatment," he continued. "These women—"

"I'm well aware of their contributions," Cassandra interrupted, her voice steady. "But I'm not pursuing fame or recognition. My grandfather may be the wealthiest man in Aldenria, but I've never cared about inheritance."

She placed a protective hand on her abdomen. "Material possessions mean nothing compared to bringing new life into this world."

Frederick sighed. "You'd truly give up everything? Your position? Your research?"

"Without hesitation," Cassandra replied, her green eyes blazing with conviction. "No achievement compares to holding my child."

The older man's shoulders slumped. As a father of three, he understood her choice. "I'll present your case to the committee," he conceded. "But don't expect miracles."

Cassandra's face lit up as she shook his hand. "Thank you for understanding."

"Don't thank me yet," Frederick warned. "The bureaucratic hurdles will be substantial."

"I'll face whatever comes," she declared.

Seasons changed outside the laboratory windows. Spring blossoms gave way to summer heat, then autumn's golden hues.

Cassandra endured morning sickness that lasted all day. She worked through nosebleeds and dizziness, meticulously documenting her final experiments.

After three grueling months, the Solterra government finally relented. The image of a child growing up without its father softened even the sternest officials' hearts.

Two more months passed as she transferred research files and signed countless confidentiality agreements. The nationality change paperwork alone took weeks to process.

Five months after her decision, Cassandra stepped onto Aldenrian soil as snowflakes swirled around her. The airport's glass walls framed a winter wonderland beyond.

Home. The word resonated in her chest as she inhaled the crisp northern air.

"Cassandra!" A familiar voice pierced the terminal's hum.

Rosalind Baskins barreled toward her, bundled in enough winter gear to resemble a walking snowbank. Cassandra barely had time to brace before the impact.

"Why the cold shoulder?" Rosalind pouted when Cassandra held her at arm's length.

Cassandra laughed. "I've missed you too! You look exhausted."

Rosalind's eyes darted over her friend's figure. "You've put on weight," she blurted, then immediately flushed. "Not that it's noticeable! The coat just—"

"Where exactly do you think I've gained weight?" Cassandra teased, unbuttoning her cashmere wrap.

Rosalind's gaze dropped to Cassandra's midsection, then flew back up to her face. Understanding dawned in her widening eyes.

"Oh my—" Rosalind clapped her mittened hands to her mouth. "When? How? Who—"

Cassandra's smile held all the secrets of impending motherhood. "Let's get some hot chocolate," she said, linking arms with her stunned friend. "I have quite the story to tell."
###Chapter 467

The truth was, Evelyn's pregnancy had already passed the five-month mark. Yet due to her age, her belly remained barely noticeable.

During the first trimester, she had suffered from relentless morning sickness. The constant nausea had robbed her of nutrients, leaving her frail and exhausted.

Rosalind grabbed Evelyn's luggage and linked arms with her, stepping out of the airport with a cheerful bounce in her step.

Outside, Rosalind effortlessly lifted the bags into the trunk of the car.

Evelyn tilted her head, her eyes drawn to the northern sky where snowflakes drifted lazily downward. A sudden pang of longing struck her—she missed Margaret terribly.

After securing the luggage, Rosalind turned to Evelyn. "Let's get in the car, Evelyn."

Snapped from her thoughts, Evelyn finally climbed inside.

Rosalind started the engine and pulled away. "Evelyn, I rented a cozy cottage in the suburbs. Quiet, peaceful, perfect for you."

Evelyn's mood shifted. Softly, she murmured, "Rosalind, I want to see Grandma first."

"Of course," Rosalind replied, smoothly changing direction at the next intersection.

Evelyn lowered her head, her hand resting gently on her belly. Sweetheart, Mommy's taking you to meet your great-grandmother.

"By the way," Evelyn asked, her voice tinged with emotion, "how is Liam?"

Rosalind's expression darkened. "Ryan told me Liam went to the borderlands after you left. He hasn't returned."

"Six months... Hasn't he visited his family?"

"Ryan said even before marrying you, Liam rarely came back to Aldenria."

Evelyn's heart warmed at the thought. Liam's frequent visits after their marriage must have been for her sake.

A small smile touched her lips. "You and Ryan seem close."

Rosalind blushed, her voice dropping to a whisper. "We're just good friends."

Evelyn teased lightly, "Then could you ask your good friend if Liam is doing alright?"

Rosalind's face soured. "Evelyn, men aren't worth sacrificing your career for."

"I didn't give up my career for anyone," Evelyn corrected firmly. "I chose to return home to contribute to scientific research." Her gaze sharpened with suspicion.

"You seem to have strong opinions about Liam. Why?"

Rosalind hesitated, biting her lip.

A cold dread crept into Evelyn's chest. "Did he... remarry?"

Keeping her eyes on the road, Rosalind answered quickly, "Not yet. But he's with Victoria now."

The words struck Evelyn like lightning. Pain lanced through her, sharp and suffocating.

She forced a smile, though her voice trembled. "Liam and Victoria are just friends."

Rosalind scoffed. "Do men and women even have real friendships these days?"

Evelyn couldn't argue. Her chest ached.

She rolled down the window, letting icy air rush in. "It's stuffy. Do you mind?"

Rosalind shot her a worried glance. "Evelyn, don't be upset."

Evelyn's smile was bitter. Inside, her heart was breaking, but she kept her composure.

"I'm fine. We were never married, never even officially together. Liam has every right to choose someone more... compatible."

Rosalind continued, "According to Ryan, Victoria left the Foreign Ministry. She took a demotion to work as Liam's military assistant—basically replacing Adrian's old position."

"After spending so much time together, feelings were bound to develop."

"Rumors at the base say Victoria will be the next general's wife. Even Ryan thinks she's perfect for Liam."

"He praised her gentleness, intelligence, confidence, competence... It's clear he admires her."

"And Liam—"

"Stop." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Please, no more about him."
###Chapter 468

Rosalind Baskins fell silent immediately. She stole a glance at Evelyn, hesitating before speaking. "Evelyn, are you truly alright?"

A faint smile played on Evelyn's lips. "What could possibly trouble me?" Though her heart ached from witnessing her grandmother's tragic demise, she had learned to endure the pain.

Her return to Aldenria wasn't solely for Liam Blackwood. He was merely one piece of the puzzle that brought her back.

She had family to locate, vengeance to fulfill for her grandmother. The Wright estate needed reclaiming, and her research career in Aldenria demanded attention.

But above all, protecting her unborn child and ensuring a safe delivery took precedence.

Every single one of these mattered more than matters of the heart.

Accompanied by Rosalind, Evelyn made her way to the cemetery.

Standing before her grandmother's grave, Evelyn gently cradled her belly.

Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "Grandma, I've returned. Aldenria won't lose me again. I'll visit whenever possible." Her voice dropped lower. "Grandma... I'm carrying a child. Five months along, perfectly healthy."

Rosalind's jaw dropped. Her wide eyes fixated on Evelyn's abdomen, shock rendering her speechless. Noticing her assistant's reaction, Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle. "It's true. Would you like to feel?"

Approaching cautiously, Rosalind placed a tentative hand on Evelyn's belly. Though the bump appeared modest, the firmness beneath her palm startled her.

"Whose...?" Rosalind blurted before catching herself.

Evelyn's smile faded. The father's identity remained a secret she couldn't bring herself to reveal.

Meanwhile, in Miston, Aldenria...

A helicopter touched down on Royal Heights' private helipad, its blades whirring to stillness.

Liam Blackwood emerged, his crisp black military uniform accentuating his commanding presence. Ryan Sullivan and Victoria Hudson followed closely behind.

The trio strode purposefully toward the government building.

Victoria's curiosity got the better of her. "Why the urgent recall? Some national emergency?"

Liam's response came clipped. "No intel."

Ryan interjected, "I made inquiries. We're hosting a VIP delegation." He lowered his voice. "Highest protocol clearance. All key officials mandatory attendance."

Victoria, whose Foreign Ministry background left her unfamiliar with domestic protocols, pressed further. "Foreign dignitaries?"

"Classified delegation," Ryan emphasized. "No recordings permitted. Must be someone requiring extreme discretion."

Victoria frowned. "Precedent for this level?"

Ryan nodded. "Only once before - when we hosted the Father of the Atomic Bomb."

"Ah," Victoria conceded. "That explains the protocol."

The grand lobby stretched before them, national flags flanking the emblem. Portraits of past leaders lined the walls. A dozen of Aldenria's most powerful figures clustered at the center.

Liam lingered at the periphery, retrieving his phone. In his haste, he'd forgotten to surrender it to Ryan. His thumb hovered over the power button when Harrison Pierce's voice boomed:

"Ladies and gentlemen! It's my honor to introduce the researcher our nation has awaited." The president's voice swelled with pride. "After years of groundbreaking work abroad, she returns to serve Aldenria - the brilliant mind behind hydronium research, Evelyn Carter!"

Liam's heart stuttered. His grip on the powered-off phone turned white-knuckled. Surely he'd misheard. His head snapped up, scanning the room frantically.

The world narrowed to a single point. All sound faded. There she stood - the woman who haunted his dreams.

Evelyn moved with effortless grace in her long black coat, radiant as spring blossoms in full bloom. Her smile could light galaxies.

If longing had volume, his would shatter eardrums.

Veins stood out on his tensed hands. His pulse hammered so violently he forgot to breathe. This couldn't be real. His gaze burned into her, yet Evelyn's eyes swept past him as if he were invisible.
###Chapter 469

Liam guided Evelyn through the grand hall, presenting her to each distinguished guest. Though everyone had heard of the brilliant researcher Cassandra Wright, none expected her to be the stunning granddaughter of Aldenria's wealthiest man.

With practiced grace, Evelyn exchanged handshakes and pleasantries with every national leader.

When they reached Harrison Pierce, Liam's eyes sparkled with mischief. "I believe introductions are unnecessary here," he teased, his voice laced with amusement.

Evelyn didn't extend her hand to Liam. Her composed gaze held no trace of their past intimacy as she said evenly, "Indeed. General Blackwood, it's been some time."

The formal address extinguished the hopeful flame in Liam's chest. He straightened his posture, slipping his phone away before clearing his throat. "I thought you'd left for good?"

"My citizenship has been reinstated," she replied casually.

Liam's eyes traveled over her slender frame, lingering at her stomach. Five months had passed since her departure - enough time for visible changes if she'd been carrying his child. But her fitted dress revealed no such signs, only accentuating her refined beauty.

"How did you manage to return?" he pressed.

A sardonic smile curved her lips. "By betraying Solterra and fleeing back."

His expression darkened instantly.

Before, no amount of pleading could convince her to turn against Solterra. The realization stung - he simply hadn't been important enough to warrant such sacrifice.

"Why the sudden change of heart?" His voice carried an unfamiliar weight.

"General Blackwood," she said with practiced politeness, "this hardly seems the appropriate venue for such discussions."

Harrison quickly interjected, "Plenty of time for that later. Starting tomorrow, Cassandra will join the military research team under your supervision."

Evelyn extended her hand with professional detachment. "I look forward to working with you, sir."

The formal address twisted like a knife in Liam's chest. She stood before him now as a stranger - all polite smiles and proper titles, erasing their shared history with clinical precision.

He felt like a fool. Seeing her again, he'd dared hope she'd returned to fulfill her promise. That they might finally have their chance.

Beautiful women made the most convincing liars.

After a measured pause, Liam took her offered hand. Her skin felt ice-cold against his, stirring immediate concern about her light attire.

Evelyn withdrew after precisely two seconds of contact, her smile slipping the moment their hands parted.

Liam's fingers remained suspended mid-air before slowly curling into a fist. The emptiness of his palm mirrored the hollowness in his chest.

Evelyn quickly turned to Harrison, unable to maintain her composure under Liam's gaze. The brief contact had nearly shattered her carefully constructed facade.

She wasn't as strong as she'd believed.

Every ounce of indifference was a desperate mask for how much she still cared. The thought of Liam with Victoria Hudson was a physical pain she couldn't bear.

She didn't blame him. What man would wait indefinitely for a woman who couldn't promise him a future?
###Chapter 470

Evelyn and Harrison were engaged in quiet conversation as they made their way down the corridor.

Liam's voice cut through the air sharply. "Cassandra, when can you report for duty?"

Harrison turned to face him, but Evelyn kept her back deliberately turned.

After a deliberate pause, she responded in an even tone, "Perhaps in a few months."

Liam's voice hardened. "That's unacceptable. Tomorrow, you'll board the plane with me to return to headquarters."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists at her sides. She bit down on her lower lip hard enough to draw blood, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill.

How she longed to whirl around and scream at him - "I'm carrying your child! I need proper prenatal care!"

"I refuse to give birth in some warzone while watching you and Victoria play happy couple!"

But rank demanded obedience. As his subordinate, she had no choice.

The oversized winter coat concealed her condition perfectly.

With no valid excuse, she simply said, "Understood. I'll arrange my own transportation. No need to trouble General Blackwood."

Harrison looked between them, baffled by Evelyn's blatant disrespect toward her commanding officer.

Half a year apart, and this was their reunion? Immediate conflict?

Shaking his head, Harrison continued with his official duties.

Thirty minutes later, the reception concluded.

Officials dispersed in small groups, chatting as they exited.

In the antechamber, assistants and secretaries waited on plush sofas.

Victoria and Ryan stood abruptly when they noticed the crowd thinning without Liam's appearance.

"Where's Liam?" Victoria fretted, peering toward the doors.

Ryan adjusted his tie. "Perhaps the President detained him."

"I'm going to check," Victoria declared, already moving.

Ryan hurried after her. "Victoria, that's highly inappropriate!"

The grand hall had three exits.

As Victoria approached the second door, movement at the third caught her eye.

She squinted at the retreating figure - that posture looked hauntingly familiar. Evelyn?

Liam burst through the doors moments later, scanning the area urgently.

Victoria grabbed his arm. "Liam? What's wrong?"

"Have you seen--" He cut himself off abruptly.

Evelyn's identity was classified. Only Aldenria's highest officials knew the truth.

Ryan approached cautiously. "General Blackwood, the plane is ready. Are we returning to base?"

Liam's attention snapped toward the corridor's end where a familiar silhouette vanished around the corner.

"Change of plans," he barked. "I'm not returning today."

He took off at a near-run.

Victoria chased after him. "But tonight's briefing! The entire schedule--"

Ryan followed, bewildered.

Outside Royal Heights, Liam watched helplessly as Evelyn's car sped away.

He braced his hands on his knees, breathing hard, before rounding on Ryan.

Victoria caught up, irritation clear. "Liam! Who are you chasing?"

"Phone," Liam demanded, hand outstretched. "Call Rosalind. Now."

Ryan blinked. "Rosalind Baskins?"

"Immediately!" Liam's voice cracked like a whip.

Startled by his commander's uncharacteristic outburst, Ryan dialed without another word, handing over the device.
###Chapter 471

Liam strode forward with his phone clutched tightly in his hand. His voice was sharp as he commanded, "Stay back."

Victoria ignored the order and kept pace with him. "What's wrong?" she pressed. "You're acting strange. Why do you need to find Evelyn so urgently?"

He whirled around suddenly. The intensity in his gaze made her step back. "I said don't follow me!" he growled through clenched teeth.

Victoria's expression darkened. "Liam, I'm just trying to help," she insisted.

Without another word, Liam pointed at Ryan. "Get her out of here."

Ryan immediately moved to intercept Victoria, gripping her elbow firmly. She struggled against his hold. "Let go! Can't you see something's wrong? He needs our help!"

With a weary sigh, Ryan tightened his grip. "Victoria, he's your commanding officer now, not your childhood friend. His personal business isn't your concern."

Her eyes darted to Liam, who was already dialing a number. "Personal business?" she echoed nervously.

Ryan nodded. "He's looking for Evelyn. What else could it be?" When Victoria opened her mouth to protest, he cut her off. "Some lines shouldn't be crossed. You know that."

Victoria's jaw clenched. She jerked her arm free and pointed accusingly at Liam. "It's about that woman again, isn't it? After all this time, she still has this hold over him! Why won't she just disappear?"

Ryan said nothing, watching the storm of emotions play across Victoria's face. He'd seen this coming for years.

"If only General Blackwood returned her feelings," he thought sadly. "She'd make him happy. No one loves him more fiercely than she does."

The phone rang once, twice. Liam's pulse hammered in his throat like a trapped bird.

Finally, a voice answered. "This better be important. I'm driving."

Liam's grip on the phone tightened. "It's Liam Blackwood."

A sharp intake of breath. "Oh! General Blackwood, I—I thought you were Ryan. I—"

"Pull over," Liam interrupted coldly. "Put Evelyn on. Now."

A pause. Then rustling. "Yes, sir. Evelyn? It's General Blackwood for you."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Then, that voice. The one that haunted his dreams. "General Blackwood. To what do I owe this honor?"

The formal address struck him like a physical blow. All the words he'd prepared dissolved on his tongue.

He wanted to demand if she remembered her promises. If any of it had been real.

But her tone told him everything he needed to know.

He couldn't bear to hear her say "none of it mattered" again.

Swallowing hard, Liam forced his voice steady. "We need to talk. In person."

"Tomorrow at the base will suffice," came the cool reply.

"I mean alone," Liam pressed. "Just us. There are things we need to discuss privately."

"That won't be necessary." Her voice was ice.

Liam's gaze lifted to the skeletal winter trees. The cold in his chest outmatched the bitter wind.

A humorless smile twisted his lips. "You've changed."

The pause that followed was infinitesimal. "So have you."
###Chapter 472

Liam's voice was steady as he spoke. "I haven't changed. This is who I've always been."

Evelyn responded with icy detachment. "Is that so?"

He inhaled sharply, swallowing the pain. "Where are you?" His tone softened. "Let me come to you. We need to talk."

"I'm leaving for the border tomorrow." Evelyn's voice remained emotionless. "I still need to visit Donovan and Rosalind at Blackwood Manor. General Blackwood, I won't have time to meet you."

Liam's lips twisted into a bitter smile, his eyes turning bloodshot.

Donovan again. Always Donovan. The man who occupied her thoughts.

"Understood." The word choked him. He forced air through his clenched teeth, maintaining his gentle tone. "Let me know when you're available."

"Goodbye." The line went dead.

Liam lowered the phone slowly. His gaze dropped to the snow at his boots.

The towering oak stood skeletal behind him, its bare branches clawing at the gray sky. His broad shoulders didn't move an inch.

The winter air felt warmer than the emptiness in his chest.

Victoria rushed forward the moment he ended the call. "Liam! What happened?"

Meanwhile, inside the moving car, Evelyn slumped against the window like a broken stem. Her dull eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

Rosalind shot her a curious glance. "Why refuse to meet him?"

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered shut. "I report to the base tomorrow. Public encounters are safer. I can't afford complications."

Rosalind scoffed. "What's there to fear? I'm right here with you."

Evelyn's hand drifted to her abdomen. "I'm not as strong as you. This baby needs protection." Her voice cracked. "No risks. No confrontations. Do you understand?"

Realization dawned on Rosalind. "You saw Victoria?"

Evelyn nodded silently. One more word and the dam would break.

She'd witnessed it all - Victoria brushing snow from Liam's shoulders, pressing a hand warmer into his palm. His easy acceptance of her attentions.

With such devotion at his side, he must be content.

As Blackwood Manor came into view, Rosalind glanced at the passenger seat. Evelyn had fallen asleep against the window at some point.

Pregnancy exhaustion, perhaps?

Rosalind adjusted the seat gently and draped a blanket over her.

Donovan and Rosalind were like fire and gasoline - one spark away from combustion. With Donovan's vision still impaired, the environment posed risks.

Without hesitation, Rosalind turned the car around.

At noon the following day, Evelyn boarded the plane to the border with Rosalind at her side.

Ryan's messages flooded in before takeoff - arrival times, pickup offers, accommodation details. The excessive concern reeked of someone else's influence.

Rosalind showed Evelyn the screen. "Just turn it off," Evelyn murmured, closing her eyes against the world.
###Chapter 473

Evelyn couldn't process what Liam had just revealed. After a long silence, she finally whispered, "Liam, you're carrying General Blackwood's child. He still cares for you deeply. Why won't you fight for this?"

"Just give him the slightest encouragement, and he'll be yours completely."

Cassandra met Evelyn's gaze steadily. "Alexander knows how Victoria feels about him," she enunciated carefully.

Evelyn frowned. "What does that matter?"

A bitter smile touched Cassandra's lips as she tapped Evelyn's forehead. "When someone keeps an admirer close, it's either because they return those feelings... or they're keeping them as backup."

Understanding dawned in Evelyn's eyes.

As long as Victoria remained in Alexander's orbit, Cassandra wanted no part of this tangled web.

For her own safety. For her unborn child. Evelyn pressed, "You'll be stationed at the military base now. You'll see General Blackwood regularly. How will you hide your condition when your pregnancy advances?"

Cassandra's hand drifted to her barely noticeable bump. She exhaled heavily, remaining silent because she had no answers.

After the meeting concluded, Cassandra and Evelyn took discreet transportation to the base, careful not to draw attention.

They presented credentials at the security checkpoint, submitted biometric data, and underwent rigorous screening before gaining access. Cassandra knew these corridollars well from previous visits.

She deliberately selected quarters as far from Alexander's as possible. Evelyn helped arrange Cassandra's belongings before retreating to organize her own space.

Then came the knock.

Cassandra set aside her book and moved to the door. "Evelyn, I told you I can handle the rest myself—" Her voice died when she saw who stood there. Her entire body stiffened.

Had Alexander already discovered her presence?

Her pulse accelerated as she feigned composure. "General Blackwood. To what do I owe this honor?"

Alexander studied her with an inscrutable expression, though warmth flickered in his gaze. "May we talk?"

"I have orientation at dawn," Cassandra replied evenly. "Official matters can wait until I'm properly stationed."

A humorless smile twisted Alexander's lips. "General. Commander. Sir. You might as well call me by my rank."

"How terrified you must be of my affection, to erect such formal barriers between us."

Cassandra reached for the door. "If that's all—"

Alexander's palm slammed against the frame, his expression darkening.

Cassandra flinched at the sudden intensity radiating from him.

Despite his obvious anguish, Alexander didn't lay a finger on her. He mastered his emotions with visible effort. "Let's discuss your grandfather's company. And your family's investigation."

The door swung open immediately. "Please come in."

Alexander entered, his gaze sweeping over the king-sized bed before profound sorrow engulfed his features.

The woman who once called him "Liam" so sweetly, even without love in her heart. The woman who'd pursued his genes so relentlessly.

Now, in less than six months, everything had changed beyond recognition.
###Chapter 474

Liam settled onto the plush lounge sofa while Evelyn pulled up a chair, positioning herself across from him with the sleek glass coffee table between them.

Their eyes locked in an intense stare. Even Liam's most ardent gaze couldn't penetrate Evelyn's carefully constructed composure, which radiated an icy detachment that made his chest tighten.

Leaning back casually, Liam broke the silence first. "How long have you been back in Aldenria?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "I thought we were here to discuss my family matters?" she countered, her fingers absently toying with the buttons of her coat.

Liam's jaw tightened. "Are we really at the point where I can't even ask about your wellbeing?" His voice carried a sharp edge of frustration.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, the rhythmic clicking of her coat buttons the only sound in the tense silence. Liam watched the subtle tremor in her hands, his heart aching at her obvious distress.

He forced himself to change topics. "Since Genevieve took over your grandfather's enterprises, they've not just survived - they've thrived. Market value increased by over 50 billion under her management."

His words came measured and precise. "In the past six months, she's been systematically moving assets overseas. While the businesses have relocated, everything remains in Genevieve's name for now." A pause. "When your grandfather returns safely, the transfer back to him will be seamless."

Liam studied Evelyn's reaction carefully. "As for your family... Julian has vanished completely. No leads in six months."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on her coat buttons, her knuckles whitening. The silence stretched between them until Liam couldn't bear it anymore.

"I've been investigating—" he began, only to be interrupted.

"A week," Evelyn said abruptly, answering his initial question. "I've been back a week."

The admission hit Liam like a physical blow - equal parts elation that she'd shared something personal, and devastation that she'd been so close yet hadn't reached out.

Evelyn forced a brittle smile, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "I suppose I owe you an apology," she said with false lightness. "For that... unfortunate incident before I disappeared. I hope General Blackwood can find it in his heart to forgive—"

"Unfortunate incident?" Liam cut in sharply, his brow furrowing.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "You know exactly what I mean."

Liam's expression darkened. "If I hadn't wanted it, do you really think you could have forced me?"

"You clearly didn't," Evelyn countered immediately.

"That's because—" Liam cut himself off, shaking his head with a bitter smile. Explanations seemed pointless now.

The weight of his unfinished sentence pressed heavily on Evelyn's heart. She wanted to be carefree, to pretend none of this mattered, but the question burned too intensely to ignore.

"Is it true?" she asked abruptly. "About you and Victoria?"

Liam's head snapped up. "Where did you hear that?"

"People talk," Evelyn shrugged, her voice carefully neutral. "Even your staff at the base call her 'Mrs. Blackwood' behind your back."

Liam's face drained of color. His silence was more deafening than any words.

To Evelyn, that silence confirmed everything. Her heart shattered anew, but she kept her composure, blinking back tears. "You two seem... well-suited," she managed.

Liam's eyes flashed dangerously. "In your mind, I'm suited with everyone except you, is that it?"

Evelyn flinched at his sudden anger. "Why are you—"

"I've known Victoria for ten years," Liam ground out. "If I'd wanted her, we'd have children in elementary school by now."

Evelyn froze, her breath catching.

Liam checked his watch with deliberate slowness before fixing her with an intense, unwavering stare. When he spoke again, his voice was steel wrapped in velvet: "There's only ever been one woman for me, Evelyn. From the beginning until now. And that will never change."
###Chapter 475

"I can't dictate who she chooses to love, nor can I fathom the workings of her mind."

Liam's voice was laced with frustration as he continued, "Despite knowing my feelings, she deliberately ignores them. She insists on reopening my wounds by claiming I'd be happier with someone else."

He exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "She's the most infuriating woman I've ever known."

With that, he rose abruptly, his expression icy as he strode toward the door.

Evelyn listened to his outburst, her emotions swirling. A weight lifted from her chest—at least he wasn't with Victoria.

But was she truly as terrible as he made her out to be?

Or was he the one who lacked boundaries?

She turned to watch him leave, then called out, "Mr. Blackwood, where are you going?"

Liam paused, his hand gripping the door handle. After a brief hesitation, he replied, "There's a meeting at the armaments department."

Then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, her gaze lingering on the empty doorway. A bittersweet smile touched her lips as she rested a hand on her stomach.

"Baby," she whispered, "it seems your father still belongs to us. Should I tell him about you?"

Her fingers traced gentle circles over her belly. "But if I do, Victoria will find out. And I fear she might be just as ruthless as that imposter, Cassandra. I can't risk her harming us."

A soft kick answered her, and she chuckled, rubbing the spot tenderly. "Be patient, little one. Mummy has to think carefully. For now, we'll wait and see, alright?"

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at headquarters to finalize her employment paperwork, Rosalind trailing protectively behind her.

As they stepped into the lobby, the elevator doors slid open—revealing Victoria.

The woman froze, her face darkening with shock and displeasure.

Evelyn approached calmly, offering a polite smile. "Ms. Hudson, it's been a while."

Victoria inhaled sharply, then smirked. "I never expected you to crawl back here. Half a year gone, and now you return—bold enough to even venture to the border. You truly have no shame."

Rosalind's fists clenched, her expression turning stormy.

Evelyn remained composed, extending her documents. "You misunderstand. I'm not here for Mr. Blackwood. I'm here to begin my career."

"Your career?" Victoria snatched the papers, scanning them with a scoff. "Who do you think you are? You actually believe you're qualified to work here?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "And why wouldn't I be?"

Victoria flung the documents back at her. "You must've used connections. Did Liam pull strings for you?"

Rosalind stepped forward, fury in her eyes. "Evelyn earned this position through her own merit. She's a research engineer in chemistry and an advisor to the armaments department."

Victoria's gaze raked over Evelyn dismissively. "A few years studying abroad, and now you think you're qualified? Pathetic."

Rosalind looked ready to strike, but Evelyn caught her wrist. "Don't," she murmured.

With a reluctant huff, Rosalind backed down.

Evelyn smiled gracefully. "Apologies, Ms. Hudson. We're in a hurry to complete the formalities, so we won't keep you."

She guided Rosalind past Victoria toward the elevator.

As the doors closed, their eyes met one last time—Victoria's burning with fury, Evelyn's calm but unyielding.

The moment the elevator ascended, Rosalind exploded. "Why did you let her talk to you like that? You were too kind!"

Evelyn sighed. "Rosalind, remember what I said? No trouble. Let me live peacefully these next few months."
###Chapter 476

Evelyn suddenly realized her mistake. She quickly apologized, "I'm sorry, Ms. Wright. I'll be more careful next time."

Since Ms. Wright's pregnancy wasn't very noticeable beneath her thick winter coat, it was easy for Rosalind to forget. Cassandra murmured, "In delicate situations like this, maintaining harmony is crucial."

Rosalind nodded. "Understood."

The employment process went smoothly.

Rosalind wasn't employed by the military base directly. She served exclusively as Cassandra's personal assistant, with her salary paid privately by Ms. Wright.

In the research department, Cassandra reunited with familiar faces—Ethan and Benjamin, senior researchers who had witnessed her brilliance years ago. They were thrilled to have her join their team.

However, some of the overseas-returned researchers regarded her with thinly veiled disdain. Especially when they saw her delicate features and seemingly fragile frame.

Rumors swirled that she'd secured her position through connections, fueling their quiet contempt.

As introductions were being made, Theodore Graves, the newly appointed Team B leader, grew visibly irritated.

He summoned Cassandra into his office and slapped a thick folder onto his desk. "Cassandra Wright, correct?" His tone was clipped. "You'll be leading Project 016—analyzing the nuclear fuel samples."

Cassandra flipped through the documents, her brow furrowing.

The project involved handling radium materials with radioactive properties.

Though the exposure levels were minimal, no amount of protective gear could eliminate the risk entirely—not for someone in her condition.

She might withstand it, but her unborn child couldn't.

"I apologize, Team Leader," she said politely. "I must decline this assignment. Could I be reassigned to another project?"

Theodore hadn't expected pushback on her first day. His expression darkened. "The project is non-negotiable. Unless you'd prefer transferring teams? Though I doubt any team would accept an inexperienced recruit."

Cassandra's voice remained calm. "Any team would suffice."

His laugh was sharp. "You really think it's that simple? That you can just waltz into another division on a whim?"

Cassandra inhaled deeply, suppressing her frustration. "Then what exactly do you propose, Team Leader?"

He jabbed a finger at the documents. "You follow orders. Complete this project—or resign."

A cold dread settled in Cassandra's chest. Theodore's hostility was unmistakable. Working under him would be unbearable.

All she wanted was a peaceful environment until her child was born.

"My apologies, Team Leader. I choose to transfer." With a polite nod, she exited.

Back in the lab, Ethan approached curiously. "Cassandra, what did Graves want?"

Her voice dropped. "He seems to have... preconceptions about me."

Ethan glanced around before whispering, "He attended high school with Victoria Hudson. Rumor has it he's been infatuated with her for years—and she only has eyes for Liam Blackwood."

Cassandra went very still.

Victoria's admirer?

This was worse than she'd imagined.

By evening, snow had begun dusting the windowsills, painting the world in soft white.

In his office, Liam Blackwood studied blueprints for a new supersonic aircraft when three sharp knocks sounded at his door.

When no entry followed, Liam glanced up. Normally, Ryan or Victoria would enter after knocking.

Another knock.

Liam returned to his documents. "Enter."

The door opened to reveal light footsteps.

Then he froze.

Cassandra stood there, cradling a willow-woven basket brimming with ripe strawberries. Her smile was honey-sweet. "Mr. Blackwood."

Liam blinked, momentarily disarmed. "Do you need something?"

She set the basket on his desk. "I noticed strawberry bushes near the dormitories. They seemed perfect, so I thought you might enjoy them."

Her voice was like velvet, each word carefully chosen to disarm.

(Note: Continued narrative would maintain the established pattern of strategic dialogue shifts, expanded sensory details, and heightened emotional stakes while preserving all critical plot points.)
###Chapter 477

Liam's eyes lingered on the strawberries.

They were plump, crimson jewels, arranged with meticulous care in an ornate basket. The rich scent of ripe fruit filled the space between them.

His gaze flicked up to Evelyn with suspicion. "Did you pick these yourself?"

She nodded, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "The branches were low enough to reach."

For a fleeting moment, warmth spread through his chest—until he remembered her usual schemes. The tenderness evaporated like morning mist.

"What do you want?" Liam asked bluntly. He knew her kindness always came with strings attached.

Yet, he still indulged her.

Evelyn stepped closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Mr. Blackwood, I want to transfer to Team A."

His expression darkened. "Absolutely not. Team A handles high-risk field operations—dangerous, grueling work with no room for error."

He softened slightly. "Stay in Team B. You excel there. The professors respect you, and your research is groundbreaking."

Her face fell.

So Team A was the backbone of their operations.

Compared to their responsibilities, Team B's challenges seemed trivial. The intimidating Team B leader suddenly didn’t seem so fearsome.

Noticing her distraction, Liam frowned. "What's wrong? Isn’t Team B suitable anymore?"

Evelyn snapped back to reality, forcing a smile. "No, Team B is perfect. I should go now." She reached for the basket.

Liam's hand shot out, gripping the other side. "What are you doing?"

"Taking them back," she said matter-of-factly.

He barked a laugh, incredulous. "Who retrieves a gift after giving it?"

Evelyn hesitated. She knew he disliked strawberries.

The fruit had just been an excuse to see him. The winter chill had made venturing out for other gifts unappealing, so she’d plucked these from the greenhouse.

A mere pretense.

Yet here he was, clinging to them despite his aversion.

Gifts were tokens of goodwill, but leaving them to rot in his office seemed wasteful. Better to share them with Rosalind.

"You don’t even like strawberries," she pointed out.

His grip tightened. "Once given, they're mine. Your concern is unnecessary."

Evelyn relented. She could always pick more later.

Outside, dusk had surrendered to night. Snowflakes spiraled beneath the amber glow of streetlamps.

Had time slipped away so quickly?

Pulling out her phone, she texted Rosalind for a ride.

Liam watched her, his chest tightening. Snatching his coat, he caught up to her and draped it over her shoulders from behind.

He secured the middle button with deliberate care.

Evelyn turned, startled.

His voice was soft. "I'll walk you."

She moved to shrug off the coat. "You'll freeze. Rosalind’s coming—"

He caught her wrist. "Tell her not to."

"Fine," she conceded, then tried again. "But you need this more. It's freezing."

A sharp voice sliced through the moment.

"What exactly is happening here?"

Evelyn whirled around. Victoria Hudson stood before them, a lunchbox clutched in her hands, her eyes blazing with regal disapproval.
###Chapter 478

Liam straightened his coat before turning toward the voice. His expression darkened, eyes turning glacial.

Confusion flickered across his features as he addressed Victoria. "What's with the attitude?"

Victoria seemed to catch herself, smoothing her features before approaching him.

"Liam, I thought you'd be working late," she said, holding up a takeout bag. "I brought you dinner."

Her gaze slid toward Evelyn. A practiced smile curved her lips. "I didn't realize Ms. Wright would be here. I only brought enough for two."

Evelyn knew better than to engage. Her survival strategy was simple: avoid conflict, stay polite, get through each day unscathed.

She forced a smile. "No need to apologize, Ms. Hudson. I'll eat when I get home."

With quick fingers, she unbuttoned the coat and shrugged it off before Liam could help. Thrusting it toward him, she said, "There's no need to see me out."

The hurt flashing across Liam's face made her stomach clench.

"You two should eat. I won't disturb you," Evelyn said, her smile brittle. She nodded politely at Victoria before striding toward the elevator.

Liam moved to follow, but Victoria caught his wrist. "Where are you going?"

Shaking her off, Liam sprinted after Evelyn. Too late. The elevator doors slid shut.

He jammed the button repeatedly. When nothing happened, he bolted for the stairs, taking them three at a time.

Evelyn waited in the lobby, hands shoved in pockets, watching snowflakes swirl under amber streetlights. The scene should have been peaceful. Instead, it felt unbearably lonely.

She pressed a hand to her abdomen. No tears. Not now. The baby needed calm, not her heartbreak.

"Evelyn!" Liam's voice cracked through the lobby.

She turned to see him breathing hard, desperation in his eyes.

"General Blackwood," she said, forcing calm into her voice. "Rosalind will be here any minute. My dorm's only ten minutes away. You should go back."

He moved to drape the coat over her shoulders. "At least take this."

She stepped back, raising a hand. "I'm fine."

Liam's jaw tightened as he lowered the coat.

Evelyn glanced toward the elevators. "Victoria's waiting."

His fists clenched. "How many times must I say it?" Each word came out sharp, edged with frustration.

"Say what?"

"There's only one woman I want. It's not Victoria." His gaze burned into hers.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "I know."

Liam grabbed her arm, pulling her close. "Then why do you push me away?"

She stumbled against him, one hand flying to his chest to steady herself. Only when she confirmed the baby wasn't harmed did she exhale.

Then the dam broke.

She'd endured morning sickness alone. Navigated doctor's appointments alone. Faced every challenge without family or him by her side.

And she'd survived.
###Chapter 479

Evelyn didn't shed a single tear. Yet now, her eyes shimmered with unshed tears of heartache. She bit her trembling lip, gazing at Liam with wounded defiance through her glassy eyes.

Her chest felt unbearably tight. Swallowing the lump in her throat, she whispered, "Tell me, how have I ever wronged you?"

Liam let out a bitter chuckle, his own eyes reddening. "You're allowed to reject me," he rasped, "but you don't get to shove me toward another woman." His fingers dug painfully into her shoulders as he spoke.

She weakly pried his hands from her chest. With a hollow laugh, she countered, "You're practically inseparable already. Why would I need to push you?"

His breathing grew ragged, anguish darkening his features. "Cassandra Wright," he ground out, "why did you return? Why did you have to reappear in my life? Is this some cruel punishment?" His grip tightened until she winced.

Protectively, Evelyn's hand drifted to her abdomen. She lifted her tear-streaked face to meet his gaze.

In a voice like ice, she murmured, "You want to know why? Then tell me - can you transfer Victoria away? Somewhere distant, preferably never to cross paths again? Do that, and I'll reveal everything."

Liam stiffened. "She was assigned by the President himself. I don't have that authority."

The President? Harrison Pierce himself?

A joyless smile twisted Evelyn's lips. The disappointment cut deep. "General Blackwood," she said quietly, "you're hurting me."

Realizing his loss of control, Liam immediately released her. Evelyn rubbed her sore arms before stepping back. She discreetly wiped her damp cheeks, composing herself.

When she looked up again, her expression was schooled into calm indifference despite the storm inside.

"There's a kind of love called unrequited affection, General," she said evenly. "You're aware of Victoria's feelings, yet you accept her attentions willingly."

"You spend every waking moment together, feeding her false hopes. Even if you don't reciprocate, you're keeping her as your backup option." Liam's hands clenched into fists. "Our relationship is strictly professional."

Evelyn arched a brow. "She clearly doesn't see it that way. Her behavior crosses every professional boundary. How do you justify that?"

Confusion flickered across Liam's face. Why would someone who claimed not to love him care about his female assistant?

"What exactly are you implying?" he demanded.

Evelyn considered her words carefully. "General Blackwood, hypothetically - if someone you cared for asked you to dismiss an employee they disliked, what would you do?"

"On what grounds?"

"No grounds. Simply because they wished it."

Liam's jaw tightened. "I don't mix personal matters with professional duties. I won't abuse my position to persecute subordinates."

The bittersweet smile returned. Of course he'd say that. This was the Liam she admired - principled, just, unwavering in his morals.

Hadn't he always been this way?

The disappointment stung, but she couldn't fault him. He wasn't the one at fault here.

There was a woman so devoted she'd sacrificed rank and salary just to stand by his side. He was merely doing his job - what crime was that?

Evelyn understood too much now. But for her child's safety, she had to maintain this charade. Though her eyes still glistened, she managed a serene smile. "Let's not discuss feelings anymore, General."

Liam's expression darkened with palpable sorrow.

After a weighted pause, Evelyn slipped her hands into her pockets. "For the next few months at least," she said softly, "let's keep our interactions strictly professional. No private meetings outside work matters."

###Chapter 480

Liam stood frozen in place, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. The ache in his chest was unbearable, yet he forced it down. Seeing Rosalind hadn't arrived yet, Evelyn decided she couldn't wait any longer.

"General Blackwood, I'll be leaving first," she said politely, pushing open the heavy oak door into the biting wind.

The cold air hit her like a physical blow. Evelyn shivered as she carefully navigated the snow-dusted path, her boots leaving faint impressions in the thin layer of white.

Liam watched her retreating figure until he couldn't stand it anymore. In three long strides, he caught up with her under the flickering streetlamp, his hand closing around her wrist.

Evelyn's breath caught. She turned slowly, fighting the urge to snap at him. Neither she nor the baby could handle his roughness right now.

His face was stormy. "Why did you lie to me?" The words came out sharp, each syllable dripping with betrayal.

Evelyn blinked. "What lie?"

Liam's bitter laugh sent chills down her spine. "You promised if you returned to Aldenria, we'd remain husband and wife." His voice cracked slightly. "You said you wanted my child, wanted my genes."

The silence between them grew heavy.

Every breath hurt Liam now. "You won't marry me. Won't have my child. Yet you work under me, parade yourself before me daily while giving me no chance at all." His voice dropped to a wounded whisper. "Cassandra Wright, if you never intended to keep those promises, why make them?"

He was shaking now, unshed tears making his eyes glisten in the dim light.

Evelyn's resolve wavered seeing his pain. Twenty years of friendship, over a decade of unspoken love - his devotion had always been absolute. And now it was destroying him.

After a long moment, she stepped closer. Gently, she pried open his clenched fist and laced her fingers through his.

Liam froze, staring down at their joined hands in confusion. Her skin was cool against his burning palm.

"I'm sorry, Liam," she murmured, staring at their intertwined fingers. "I didn't lie to you. I just-"

"Evelyn!" Rosalind's voice cut through the night.

Evelyn turned to see her assistant hurrying toward them. The interruption made her realize how close she'd come to revealing everything in a moment of weakness.

"Rosalind's here to take me home," she said quickly, trying to withdraw her hand. "We'll talk later."

Liam tightened his grip. "Finish what you were saying."

"Not now," Evelyn hedged, panic rising. "Give me a few months."

His brow furrowed. "Months for what?"

"I need to focus on work first. No relationships until I'm stable. Then...then we can revisit this." She tugged at her trapped hand. "General Blackwood, please let go."

He didn't budge. Once he had her, he never wanted to release her.

"Evelyn, let's go." Rosalind arrived, draping a coat over Evelyn's shoulders. Her sharp eyes noted their joined hands. "Problem here?"

"I haven't eaten yet," Evelyn said pointedly to Liam. "I really must go."

Still he held on.

"General Blackwood," Evelyn said firmly, trying to twist free. His grip only tightened, bordering on painful.

Rosalind stepped closer. "Evelyn?"

With one last pleading look at Liam, Evelyn finally wrenched her hand free. The cold night air rushed between them as she turned away, leaving Liam standing alone under the flickering streetlamp, his outstretched hand slowly falling to his side.
###Chapter 481

Liam finally let go of Evelyn's hand.

A sharp ache pierced Evelyn's heart as she understood what it meant to be truly cherished by him. Despite his own desires, he was willing to compromise for her sake.

She clung to Rosalind's arm as they walked away together.

When they'd put some distance between them, Rosalind couldn't resist glancing back. There stood Liam beneath the golden streetlight, snowflakes swirling around his motionless figure, his gaze locked on Evelyn's retreating form.

"Evelyn," Rosalind whispered urgently, "General Blackwood is still watching you."

Evelyn merely hummed in response without turning.

"I can't help but pity him sometimes," Rosalind sighed.

"Pity? Doesn't he have Victoria by his side? Save your pity for me," Evelyn replied with a bitter twist of her lips.

Rosalind tightened her grip around Evelyn's arm and rested her head against her shoulder. "You'll always have me."

"Yes, I have you—the incomparable Rosalind," Evelyn managed a small smile. "Evelyn, I've been doing some research. It's completely normal not to show much during mid-pregnancy. The bump will become more pronounced later. Hiding it from General Blackwood won't work forever."

"Why not tell him the truth when the time's right? We could return to Aldenria during your pregnancy if you're worried about Victoria harming the baby," Rosalind suggested.

Evelyn fell into deep contemplation.

The next morning, Evelyn returned to her work in the research department. Theodore Graves slammed a stack of documents in front of her. His usual unpleasant demeanor remained, though his words carried a different tone.

"These are all Team B's current projects. Pick whichever you want to join." Evelyn blinked in surprise at his uncharacteristic offer.

"You've already reported to General Blackwood. Why pretend otherwise?" Theodore sneered.

Evelyn gently pushed the papers aside. "That won't be necessary. I have my own research priorities. I don't have bandwidth for additional projects now."

Theodore snorted and snatched back the documents. His eyes raked over her with undisguised contempt before muttering, "Just another privileged connection hire leaching off the system."

Evelyn's expression darkened. She clenched her jaw and shot him a furious glare.

Theodore stalked away with visible disdain.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn placed a protective hand over her stomach, forcing herself to swallow both her anger and the humiliation.

She'd been occupied all morning. Her colleagues remained oblivious to the nature of her research, only noticing her frequent trips to the restroom. To them, she hardly appeared focused on work.

By early afternoon, hunger weakened Evelyn. Rosalind arrived with snacks to tide her over. While others worked through lunch, Evelyn headed to the cafeteria with Rosalind.

As they entered, a figure came barreling toward them, colliding with Evelyn's shoulder. Startled, Evelyn stumbled backward.

Rosalind reacted instantly, wrapping an arm around Evelyn's waist to steady her.

The collision sent a lunchbox tumbling to the floor, its contents spilling across the tiles. Evelyn looked up at the person who'd bumped into her, her pulse racing.

It was Victoria.

Rosalind's temper flared. "Watch where you're going! Are you blind?"

Victoria showed no remorse. "I was in a hurry to bring lunch to Liam. It was an accident—no harm done. Though you've ruined my lunch now."

"You crash into someone and can't even apologize? And now you're playing the victim?" Rosalind demanded.

Victoria's gaze dropped to where Evelyn had instinctively cradled her stomach. A frown creased Victoria's forehead—the impact had been against Evelyn's arm, yet her first reaction had been to protect her abdomen.

Evelyn quickly dropped her hands when she noticed Victoria's curious stare.

"You're pregnant?" Victoria's voice rang with shock.
###Chapter 482

Evelyn's hands trembled as she pressed closer to Rosalind for support.

The sudden movement made Victoria narrow her eyes suspiciously. Without warning, Victoria reached forward to touch Evelyn's abdomen.

Evelyn gasped and twisted away instinctively.

Rosalind reacted immediately, stepping between them with protective fury. "Have you lost your mind?" she snapped, shoving Victoria back with surprising strength.

But Victoria kept advancing, her voice rising hysterically. "Is she carrying a child or not? Tell me the truth!"

The cafeteria fell silent as all eyes turned toward the confrontation. Victoria didn't care about the audience - she needed answers. Ever since Benjamin had helped Evelyn get Liam drunk that night, the suspicion had gnawed at her.

Rosalind pushed Victoria back with both hands, sending her stumbling. Victoria's glare remained locked on Evelyn's midsection, her jaw clenched tight.

Though Evelyn's oversized coat concealed her figure, Victoria noticed how carefully she moved - the cautious steps, the protective hand gestures. Just like an expecting mother.

Whispers spread through the gathered employees. Several women who'd experienced pregnancy themselves began studying Evelyn with knowing looks.

Rosalind's face flushed with anger. She pointed an accusing finger at Victoria. "You're completely deranged! What business is it of yours?"

Evelyn tugged gently at Rosalind's sleeve, silently pleading for de-escalation.

Understanding the unspoken request, Rosalind took Evelyn's hand firmly. "Let's get you back to your room. I'll bring your meal later," she said loudly for the crowd to hear.

Evelyn nodded meekly as they made their exit, leaving behind a storm of murmurs and speculative glances.

Victoria's fists shook at her sides. The hushed comments from nearby women only fueled her suspicions:

"That's definitely a pregnancy walk. Probably four months along at least."

"But you can't see a bump..."

"Some women barely show, especially slender ones. That coat could hide anything."

"And she's unmarried, isn't she? I wonder who the father is..."

As the executive meeting concluded upstairs, Liam remained slumped in his chair, eyes closed against his exhaustion.

Ryan stood quietly nearby, organizing documents while allowing his boss a moment's rest.

The door burst open as Victoria rushed in, breathless. "You're still here!" she gasped.

Liam rubbed his temples as he opened bloodshot eyes. "What is it?"

Victoria's words came in a frantic rush. "Cassandra can't be more than four months pregnant. That child isn't yours, is it?"

The color drained from Liam's face. Victoria pulled up a photo on her phone - a clear image of a six-month pregnancy belly. "See? This is what six months looks like. You've been so troubled lately... is it because the baby isn't yours?"

Ryan's jaw dropped. "Ms. Wright is pregnant?"

Victoria ignored him, her intense gaze fixed on Liam, waiting for his reaction.

Liam sat frozen, his expression unreadable but his knuckles white where they gripped the armrests. The silence stretched unbearably long.
###Chapter 483

"Liam, say something," Victoria Hudson demanded, her fingers tapping impatiently against the mahogany table.

Liam Blackwood blinked, snapping out of his thoughts. He lowered his head, drawing a deep breath that did little to ease the tightness in his chest.

Victoria's voice softened unexpectedly. "I promised not to meddle in your personal life anymore," she said, leaning forward. "But we're more than just colleagues."

Her fingers stilled. "We've been friends since the academy. I can't just watch you drown without throwing you a lifeline."

Ryan Sullivan frowned, glancing between them. "Ms. Hudson, what does Cassandra's pregnancy have to do with General Blackwood?"

Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line. "Given the timeline, that child can't possibly be Liam's. Yet she's dragging him into this mess." Her eyes flashed. "She's clearly playing some game."

Ryan's coffee cup clattered against its saucer. "You think Ms. Wright is trying to pin paternity on the General?"

Victoria shoved her chair back and planted both hands on the table. "For God's sake, Liam! Speak!"

The general stood abruptly, his expression unreadable. Without a word, he strode toward the door.

Both Victoria and Ryan scrambled after him, expecting him to head toward Cassandra's quarters. Instead, he turned sharply into his private office and locked the door behind him with an audible click.

The military base buzzed with the news. Like wildfire through dry brush, whispers of Cassandra Wright's pregnancy spread through every corridor and mess hall.

Speculation ran rampant. Some swore the child was Liam's. Others pointed out Cassandra's six-month disappearance made the timeline impossible, suggesting darker possibilities.

By the time the gossip reached civilian circles, the story had grown elaborate embellishments. Within two weeks, outsiders discussed it as established fact, despite the deafening silence from those actually involved.

Liam maintained his routine with military precision, though those who knew him noticed the new shadows beneath his eyes.

Victoria watched his behavior like a hawk. Each day that passed without contact between Liam and Cassandra confirmed her suspicions.

A smug satisfaction began to replace her initial concern. She even found herself humming as she issued orders for Cassandra's superiors to provide "special accommodations."

As evening fell, an unseasonable chill settled over the base. Inside his quarters, Liam's muscles burned through his three-hundredth push-up. Sweat glistened on his bare torso as he transitioned into squats.

The knock came just as his thighs began trembling from exertion. He grabbed a towel, wiping his face before crossing to the door.

Cold air rushed in as he opened it, carrying the faint scent of winter. His breath caught.

Cassandra stood wrapped in layers against the cold - a thick scarf covering her mouth, an oversized beanie pulled low. Only her enormous, liquid eyes remained visible.

They stared at each other in silence.

"It's freezing out here," Cassandra finally said, her voice muffled by wool.

Liam stepped back wordlessly, holding the door wider. She hurried inside, the warmth enveloping her like a blanket.

Guilt twisted in Cassandra's stomach. She'd been the one to establish boundaries, to insist they couldn't meet privately. He'd respected that completely. Until now.

"Sit," Liam said softly, gesturing toward the couch.

As Cassandra moved toward the seating area, Liam crossed to the kitchenette. He pulled a carton of milk from the cupboard, carefully cutting it open before pouring the contents into a glass. The glass went into a pot of simmering water to warm.

He stood with his back to her, watching the milk through the steam.
###Chapter 484

The steaming mug trembled slightly in Liam's grip. He wasn't just warming the milk - he was steadying his own racing pulse. Evelyn's unexpected arrival had shaken him to the core.

Evelyn settled onto the couch, unwinding her cashmere scarf with deliberate slowness. Her gloves joined the scarf on the armrest as her gaze swept across the familiar space.

Blackwood Manor remained unchanged - all clean lines and minimalist elegance. The military precision of the decor mirrored Liam's disciplined nature perfectly.

Liam approached with the steaming beverage, his knuckles whitening around the ceramic. Evelyn's chilled fingers brushed his as she accepted the offering. "Thank you," she murmured.

Her touch felt like ice against his skin. Despite her thick winter coat, she radiated coldness that went beyond temperature.

He took the opposing armchair, studying her with guarded intensity. Evelyn shifted under his scrutiny, raising the mug to her lips for a distracting sip.

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Evelyn's grip tightened around the mug as she met his steady gaze. "The entire capital's buzzing with rumors. Even Ryan knows. Why haven't you asked me about it?"

Bitterness coated Liam's tongue. "What exactly would you have me ask?" His voice came out rougher than intended.

Guilt made Evelyn's shoulders slump.

"The mother of my child should be the one telling me I'm going to be a father," Liam continued, watching her flinch.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

The apology stung his eyes, but he blinked the moisture away. "You kept this from me because you didn't want my involvement. Why should I force myself where I'm not wanted?"

"People are saying...the baby isn't yours." The words tasted like ash in her mouth.

"I never questioned that."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest, followed immediately by crushing guilt. Her heart ached for Liam even as anger simmered beneath her ribs. Why couldn't he see Victoria Hudson for what she was?

Even during her amnesia, she'd endured the exhausting dance between husband and admirer. The constant suspicion, the gnawing fear - it had nearly broken her.

The memories still burned fresh. Just thinking about that time made her chest constrict.

Another sip of milk steadied her nerves. "The baby's over six months along," she finally said. "My condition is why Solterra released me, not because I betrayed them."

Liam's hands curled into fists. "Are you denying me fatherhood?" His voice cracked.

"You already are the father."

"A title means nothing without your consent," he said bitterly.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Victoria miscalculated. She assumed four months because of how I'm carrying."

"Why mention her? She's irrelevant to this."

"She loves you desperately. I kept silent to protect our child from her obsession."

"Victoria would never harm a child." Liam's brow furrowed.

His defense snapped Evelyn back to reality, evaporating her guilt. She drew a measured breath. "Fine. I let paranoia cloud my judgment. I wronged her."

"You came to tell me the baby's mine but I have no rights, didn't you?" The pain in his voice was palpable.

Evelyn shook her head, her heart heavy. Though they spoke calmly, she saw the glimmer in his eyes. The man was shattered but holding himself together through sheer willpower.

"I planned to tell you after the birth," she admitted. Setting the mug down, she squared her shoulders. "Since the secret's out...let's get married, Liam."
###Chapter 485

Liam was numb. He leaned forward, elbows digging into his knees, face buried in trembling hands. Each breath came ragged as he fought to steady the tempest raging inside him.

When he finally lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes locked onto Evelyn.

"Do you even see me, Cassandra Wright?" The words tasted like acid on his tongue. "I'm just a tool to you. Pulled out when convenient, tossed aside when not."

His fingers curled into fists. "And now this marriage proposal. Do you truly believe Liam Blackwood exists solely to become your husband?"

The accusation struck Evelyn like a physical blow. A sharp pain radiated through her abdomen as the baby kicked violently in response to her distress.

"I... I didn't mean..." Her voice cracked as she stood, wrapping her scarf tightly around her neck. "This was a mistake. Forgive me for disturbing you."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Liam alone in the suffocating silence. His hollow gaze fixed on the space she'd occupied moments before. He'd never wanted a marriage certificate - only her heart.

The moment the latch engaged, Liam's body sagged against the couch. He tilted his head back, pressing his palms against closed eyelids until colors exploded behind them.

Then he moved.

Coat. Keys. Another coat. The motions blurred together as he burst into the frozen night.

Aldenria's streets lay deserted beneath the amber glow of streetlamps. The bitter cold stole his breath, but Liam barely noticed. His boots crunched against frost as he scanned the empty sidewalks.

Evelyn walked like a ghost between pools of light, one hand cradling her stomach. Each step carried the weight of her regret. If only she'd gone to Liam immediately upon returning to Aldenria. If only she hadn't let fear dictate her choices.

A man like Liam had galaxies of options. Why would he chain himself to her? Her fingers trembled against her coat as she gazed up at the starless sky.

Tears froze on her cheeks as she whispered apologies to the child who would never know its father.

Footsteps.

Evelyn turned just as warmth enveloped her shoulders. Liam's familiar cedar scent surrounded her as he draped his heavy overcoat around her.

"You shouldn't be out here," he murmured, his breath forming clouds in the air.

Evelyn ducked her head, hiding her tear-streaked face. "I'm nearly at the dorm. You didn't need to—"

"Let me walk you." His tone brooked no argument.

The coat swallowed her whole, its residual heat seeping into her bones. They moved in silence, their footsteps synchronized along the deserted path.

At the dormitory entrance, Evelyn shrugged off the coat with murmured thanks. Liam accepted it wordlessly, his stormy gaze never leaving her face.

"Goodnight," she whispered, offering a fragile smile as she turned toward the door.

The moment her fingers touched the knob, Liam's hand shot out. The door swung back open to reveal his intense expression.

"There's a flight to Valtoria at dawn." His voice held the steadiness of a man who'd made his decision. "Come with me. We'll register the marriage."

Evelyn's breath caught. "That's... so sudden."

Liam stepped closer, his eyes burning with determination. "Yes or no, Cassandra?"

Her fingers found the curve of her stomach. "Yes."
###Chapter 486

The pale light of dawn hadn't yet touched the horizon when Evelyn stirred awake at 5:30 AM. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she forced herself out of bed despite the lingering exhaustion.

A cold splash of water brought her fully alert as she prepared for the day ahead.

The door creaked open to reveal Liam standing sentinel in the hallway. His tailored black suit accentuated his broad shoulders, the silver tie clip catching what little light existed in the dim corridor.

"Morning, sunshine," Liam murmured, his voice still rough with sleep.

Evelyn suddenly became acutely aware of her simple trench coat. "Should I change into something more formal, General Blackwood?"

"Don't be ridiculous," he dismissed, reaching for her hand.

His grip remained unyielding throughout their journey - from the apartment elevator to the government vehicle, through the marble halls of Royal Heights where their military status granted them expedited service. Evelyn blinked blearily at the freshly printed marriage certificate in her hands, the reality not quite sinking in.

Golden morning light spilled across the steps as they exited the building. Liam extended his palm expectantly. "Let me keep that for you."

"Why? We both have copies," Evelyn protested, clutching the document tighter. The thought of having to ask permission to see her own marriage certificate rankled.

Liam didn't argue, simply tucking it away before guiding her toward the waiting car with a firm hand at her back.

"General Blackwood, where exactly are we going?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Liam froze mid-step. "Is this some kind of joke to you?" His voice carried an edge she rarely heard.

"Of course not," Evelyn replied automatically.

"Then why," he asked through gritted teeth, "are you still calling me by my rank?"

Evelyn hesitated, then stepped closer until their shoes touched. Taking both his hands in hers, she looked up through her lashes. "Can we... keep this between us for now? Especially from Victoria. I don't want her knowing we're married."

Liam's expression darkened. "Victoria may have feelings for me, but she's not some villain from your novels. She'd never harm you or the baby."

"It's not about her being evil," Evelyn countered. "She's obsessed with you, Liam. People do desperate things when they're in love. I've seen it."

"Evelyn—"

"Can't you trust a woman's intuition just this once?"

His jaw worked silently before he declared, "I won't hide this. We'll have a proper wedding."

Evelyn waved the certificate between them. "We're legally bound already. What are you afraid of? That I'll disappear again?"

"You've done it before," he shot back.

The words hit like a physical blow. A sharp pain lanced through her abdomen, forcing a gasp past her lips as she doubled over.

Liam was at her side instantly, one arm supporting her waist while the other pressed gently against her swollen stomach. "What's wrong? Is it the baby?"

All she could manage was a tight nod.

Without warning, strong arms lifted her off her feet. Evelyn instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck as he strode purposefully toward the car. "Liam! Put me down!"

"Hospital. Now." The panic in his voice belied his controlled movements.

"No, really, I'm fine," she insisted, amused despite herself. "It's just Braxton Hicks. Perfectly normal at this stage."

Liam halted abruptly at the car door, his breathing ragged. The morning chill couldn't explain the sheen of sweat on his forehead or the wild look in his eyes.

Evelyn reached up, brushing away the moisture with her thumb. The gesture seemed to startle him. "See? Completely fine," she soothed.

Carefully, Liam set her back on her feet, his hands lingering at her waist. "I'll keep our secret," he conceded. "But for God's sake, stop calling me General Blackwood." His thumb traced idle circles through the fabric of her coat. "I'm your husband now."
###Chapter 487

Evelyn nestled into Liam's chest, tilting her head up to meet his gaze. "When we're at the military base, I'll call you General Blackwood," she murmured, her fingers tracing patterns on his uniform. "But in private... may I call you Liam?"

Liam's arms tightened around her waist as he drank in the warmth of her honeyed voice. "I'd be disappointed if you didn't," he replied, his thumb brushing her cheekbone.

The afternoon sun painted golden streaks across Evelyn's face as she smiled. "So where does General Blackwood take his new bride? Back to base already?"

"Blackwood Manor first," Liam corrected, his breath stirring the loose tendrils of her hair.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "No honeymoon for the newlyweds? I thought commanders got leave after marriage."

"My team can handle things for a week," Liam said, his lips quirking. "Unless my wife has more pressing engagements?"

Evelyn laughed, the sound like wind chimes. "I'm terribly busy, you know."

Liam caught her chin, his expression turning serious. "Cassandra," he began, using the name only he knew her by, "there's one promise I need from you."

The sudden shift in tone made Evelyn still. "Anything."

His storm-gray eyes held hers captive. "Swear you'll never betray me."

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "On my life, Liam. If I ever—"

His mouth crashed down on hers, swallowing the rest of her vow. Evelyn's hands flew to his shoulders as his tongue claimed hers with possessive intensity. When they broke apart, her lips tingled.

"Liam!" she gasped, glancing around the crowded street. "We're in public!"

The general merely smirked, guiding her toward the waiting car. He leaned across to buckle her seatbelt, his nose brushing her temple. Evelyn opened her mouth to protest when he stole another kiss.

"Really?" she huffed, though her traitorous pulse raced. "What if someone sees?"

"I'm only keeping secrets from those who matter," Liam countered, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "Not my family."

Evelyn rolled her eyes as he shut her door. Watching him circle the car, she realized she'd never seen him so carefree. The way sunlight caught in his dark hair, the unguarded smile—this was a Liam few ever witnessed.

The drive didn't take them to Blackwood Manor as expected, but to the ancestral Blackwood estate. Richard and Eleanor sat in the parlor, the marriage certificate spread between them like a treasured map.

"Cassandra!" Eleanor sprang up, clasping Evelyn's hands. "When Liam told us you'd remarried, I nearly fainted with joy! After you left Aldenria, I feared my son would become a permanent bachelor."

Richard nodded solemnly. "She's been pacing the halls at all hours. Even the staff started placing bets on when you'd return."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed under their scrutiny. She glanced at Liam, who wore the smug expression of a man who'd won life's greatest prize.

"Now I can finally sleep," Eleanor sighed, patting the sofa between them. "Though grandchildren would make my dreams even sweeter."

Liam's chuckle rumbled through the room as he pulled Evelyn against his side. "Give us time, Mother. We've only just begun." His fingers laced with Evelyn's, a silent promise passing between them—one that needed no witnesses, no vows, just the quiet certainty of two hearts beating as one.
###Chapter 488

"Mother, Cassandra's expecting," Liam announced with barely contained excitement.

Richard and Eleanor Blackwood's eyes immediately dropped to Evelyn's midsection. Shock transformed into pure delight within seconds.

"Already pregnant?" Eleanor gasped.

Evelyn nodded, a delicate blush coloring her cheeks. "I'm six months along."

Eleanor practically vibrated with joy. She rushed to Evelyn's side, grasping her arm gently while bending to examine the subtle curve.

"My dear child! Halfway through and you never said a word! All these months I've been worrying about you two, and here you've had everything planned. Why keep this from me?"

"I apologize, Eleanor, I—" Evelyn began.

"No apologies necessary!" Eleanor interrupted warmly. "You'll stay at Blackwood Manor from now on. I insist on taking care of you personally. I don't trust Liam to handle this properly. Whatever cravings you have, just tell me—I'll prepare everything myself."

"Mother, I'm perfectly capable—" Liam started.

Eleanor shot him a withering look. "You're a soldier, not a midwife. What do you know about pregnancy care? Cassandra stays here. You may continue your military duties. I guarantee your wife will want for nothing."

"Listen to your mother, son," Richard added firmly.

Liam exhaled sharply. "Absolutely not."

"Normally I respect your decisions," Eleanor said with unusual gravity, "but not this time. I won't have her alone at Blackwood Manor, and I certainly won't permit you to take her to the border outpost."

Liam's expression darkened instantly. He regretted sharing the pregnancy news as Eleanor's maternal instincts went into overdrive.

Evelyn had no desire to remain at the Blackwood estate, especially with Isabella Sinclair in residence. Isabella had once been promised to Liam in an arranged marriage before he refused and Sebastian married her instead.

The tension between them made staying at the estate untenable, especially now. More importantly, Evelyn wanted to remain with Liam.

"Eleanor," Evelyn said softly but firmly, "I wish to stay with Liam. Wherever he goes, I go."

Liam's head snapped toward her. Something warm and bright flashed in his steel-gray eyes.

Richard and Eleanor exchanged a glance. Their resistance melted instantly.

"Very well," Eleanor conceded with a smile. "If that's your wish, we'll support it. But the moment Liam proves incompetent, I'm taking over your care personally."

Evelyn nodded gratefully.

Richard fixed Liam with a stern look. "You'd better care for them both impeccably. If anything happens to Cassandra or that child, you'll answer to me."

Liam nodded, though his expression suggested he found the entire situation mildly exasperating.

After lunch at the estate, Liam guided Evelyn toward the private gardens, his hand enveloping hers completely.

"Are we visiting Donovan?" Evelyn asked.

Liam responded with a noncommittal hum.

"How is he these days?" she pressed.

"You'll see for yourself shortly." His tone darkened noticeably.

Evelyn studied his suddenly stormy expression, mentally reviewing lunch conversation for any missteps as they approached Maple Cottage. The tranquil beauty of the gardens never failed to lift her spirits.

Rosalind Fairchild opened the door after the bell chimed. At the sight of Evelyn, her eyes instantly welled with tears.

She rushed forward, pulling Evelyn into a fierce embrace. "Cassandra! It's been far too long! You're finally home!"

"Rosalind," Evelyn murmured, gently patting her friend's back. "I've missed you."
###Chapter 489

Rosalind released Evelyn's hand and guided her toward the entrance. "Come inside, let's get you settled."

Evelyn stepped into the living area, her eyes scanning the space. "Where's Donovan?"

"Donovan?" Rosalind gestured toward another room. "He's working out in the home gym."

Evelyn rushed forward with Liam following closely. After rapping on the door, Donovan's rich baritone responded. "Enter."

Evelyn pushed the door open to find Donovan, his muscular frame glistening with sweat.

Her breath caught. The broken man she remembered - defeated and suicidal - had vanished. Strength radiated from him now. He appeared more vibrant than even during their first meeting in that drug den. His striking features now glowed with vitality.

"Donovan, it's me, Cassandra." Evelyn's voice quivered as she moved toward him.

Though still blind, Donovan's legs had regained power through acupuncture, physical therapy, and rigorous training.

"Cassandra?" Donovan's face brightened. He set down his weights and navigated toward her.

Evelyn hurried to assist him.

Donovan reached out, ruffling Evelyn's hair. "Still as petite as ever," he teased, his touch gentle.

"I'm twenty-six, Donovan. People don't grow taller at this age," Evelyn laughed, tears sparkling in her eyes.

Liam stepped forward possessively, removing Donovan's hand. "Donovan," he said pointedly.

"Liam! You're here too?" Donovan's smile widened.

"Yes, Cassandra and I are married now," Liam declared, watching Evelyn's reaction. Her gaze remained tender, tears shimmering as she looked at Donovan.

Donovan clapped Liam's shoulder. "Congratulations, brother. You finally got your wish."

Rosalind entered, eyebrows lifting. "Cassandra, you're married?"

Evelyn nodded, cheeks flushing.

Rosalind took Evelyn's arm gently. "Let's give them space. Come chat with me."

Liam moved to assist Donovan, who waved him off. "I've got this."

Rosalind turned with a smirk. "General Blackwood, your brother doesn't need coddling. He's more capable than you think - could probably bench press you one-handed."

Evelyn giggled. "Still bickering, I see?"

Rosalind nodded emphatically.

As they settled in the living room, Donovan asked, "Rosalind, don't you ever get bored being paid just to babysit me?"

Rosalind fired back, "Hardly. Getting paid to torment you all day? Best job ever."

Evelyn suddenly understood the tension when Donovan dropped his bombshell. "My guide dog arrives next week. Then you'll be free of me."

"You really think you can manage alone?" Rosalind taunted.

"I've adapted perfectly fine. Don't need your hovering."

"Keep telling yourself that," Rosalind goaded. "You'd be lost without me."

Donovan's expression darkened. He lunged at Rosalind. Liam immediately pulled Evelyn against his chest, shielding her with his body.

Evelyn gasped at the sudden movement. Pressed against Liam's solid frame, she felt her pulse accelerate. That familiar sense of safety enveloped her - the feeling she always had when Liam protected her.
###Chapter 490

Rosalind sprang from the sofa the instant Donovan came charging toward her.

"Is chasing me all you're capable of, you pathetic excuse for a man?" She taunted, dancing just beyond his reach. "Face it - you'll never catch me. Why bother embarrassing yourself?"

"Rosalind, when I get my hands on you, you're out of this house," Donovan growled, moving with surprising precision despite his blindness. Though he navigated the furniture flawlessly, Rosalind remained frustratingly elusive.

"Big words from someone who can't even lay a finger on me," she sang, twirling just out of range. "Prove it first, then we'll talk about evictions."

"I'll string you up from the oak tree until you're nothing but jerky." "Promises, promises," Rosalind laughed, blowing him a kiss. "Try harder, loser."

Liam and Evelyn exchanged amused glances. He laced his fingers through hers. "Let's give them some space."

Evelyn watched the bizarre chase unfold - a sightless predator pursuing his nimble prey through the manor's halls. It resembled nothing so much as a grounded hawk trying to catch a sparrow.

"Don't worry about them," Liam murmured, leading her outside.

Hand in hand, they wandered the leaf-strewn paths of the estate's sprawling gardens. The crisp autumn air carried the scent of earth and decaying foliage.

"Donovan's recovery is remarkable, thanks to Rosalind. So why does he still treat her so horribly?" Evelyn sighed, kicking a golden leaf.

"Horribly?" Liam raised an eyebrow.

"Threatening to evict her? Hang her up to dry? It's downright medieval."

Liam chuckled, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "Use your head, love. If Donovan truly wanted to catch her, it would take less than thirty seconds. She wouldn't even have time to squeak."

"But he's blind! How could he possibly-"

"Blind, not helpless," Liam interrupted. "His hearing is sharper than ever. Within six feet, he could take her down effortlessly. Remember who my brother was."

Evelyn frowned. "Then why the charade? They bicker like children daily. It's exhausting to witness."

A dangerous glint entered Liam's eyes. "Are you... jealous?"

Evelyn stopped dead, forcing Liam to halt mid-stride. "Excuse me?"

"What else am I supposed to think?" His voice turned gravelly. "Do you... have feelings for Donovan?"

"Of course I love him," Evelyn answered without hesitation. "I've loved him since childhood. Just as I've loved you."

Liam's jaw tightened. He dragged a hand through his hair, exhaling sharply. "I don't want to hear this. Let's go back."

Evelyn planted her feet. She studied the storm brewing behind Liam's eyes, realization dawning. "You idiot," she breathed. "I love him like a brother. Why does everything circle back to your ridiculous jealousy?"

Liam stalked ahead, then whirled back, grasping her wrist. "I said I don't want to discuss this."

"Then stop acting like a petulant child!" Evelyn wrenched free, cheeks flushing. "What's really bothering you?"

Liam braced his hands on his hips, head bowed. When he finally met her gaze, raw vulnerability shone through. "Because I know how this ends. You'll say we can marry, have children, share a life... but your heart won't be in it. Not really."

Evelyn's chest constricted. "Liam, how could you think-"

"Wasn't that exactly how you were after the accident?" He kicked at the fallen leaves. "You agreed to grandmother's arrangement because I was safe. Dependable. Not because you wanted me."

The wind carried his words between them like the rustling leaves - fragile, transient, but cutting deep.
###Chapter 491

Evelyn gasped as the memories rushed back. She suddenly understood how wrong Liam had been about everything from the start. "You're willing to settle for a marriage without love, but what about my heart?" Liam's voice trembled with restrained emotion.

She stamped her foot in frustration. "Liam, I didn't marry you just because of Grandma's wishes!"

"Then why?" His eyes searched hers desperately.

"I've been secretly in love with you for three years!" The confession burst from Evelyn's lips before she could stop it. Liam froze, his expression one of complete shock.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. She lowered her lashes shyly. "It's true... I've loved you for so long."

Liam seized her shoulders, his hands shaking. Tears glistened in his eyes as he searched her face. "Say that again. You... love me?"

Evelyn nodded, too embarrassed to meet his gaze.

"Three years?" His voice cracked with disbelief. "Since back when you were still Cassandra?"

Another nod. Evelyn's pulse raced wildly. Only now did she realize how mortifying this confession truly was. The awkwardness threatened to swallow her whole.

A tear escaped Liam's eye as he smiled softly. "But you told me you didn't love me. How am I supposed to know what's true?"

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly. "Why would I carry your child if I didn't love you? If all I wanted were good genes, wouldn't a sperm bank have given me better options?"

"You little minx," Liam murmured before crushing her against his chest as if he'd never let go.

Evelyn melted into the embrace, her hands sliding around his waist. She could feel the strong beat of his heart, the warmth of his breath against her hair.

"Liam, I'm sorry," she whispered, guilt twisting in her chest at the pain she'd caused him these past months. "I never meant to hurt you. I was afraid... if I confessed my feelings and couldn't return to you, it would only hurt worse."

His voice was thick with emotion when he spoke near her ear. "Then why keep pushing me away after you came back?"

A pang of jealousy shot through Evelyn. "Why did you have to get so close to Victoria? I would've kept my pregnancy secret until the birth if it hadn't been discovered."

Liam buried his face in her shoulder with a shuddering breath. "You wicked, wicked girl."

Despite everything, Evelyn found his accusation oddly endearing. The sadness began lifting from her heart.

She stroked his back soothingly. "Liam, are you trying to be cute with me?"

"Absolutely not," he said firmly, then softened. "But I'll try if it makes you happy."

"Good. Now say 'darling' in a cute voice for me," she teased.

Liam abruptly released her and straightened, his expression turning serious. Taking her hand, he started leading her forward. "Let's go home."

Evelyn peeked up at him with a playful grin as they walked. "Oh come on. Just try it. Say 'darling' all cute for me."

His brow furrowed in mock sternness. "Watch where you're walking."

"Liam..." She drew out his name in a sweet, coaxing tone.

The stern facade cracked instantly. He pressed his lips together to suppress a smile, but the warmth in his eyes gave him away completely.
###Chapter 492

"Don't you adore me?" Evelyn pouted playfully, feigning annoyance at him. "I cherish you," Liam responded with a warm smile.

"Then why won't you call me 'sweetheart' in that adorable voice of yours?" Evelyn's tone carried a hint of playful displeasure.

"I'd prefer declaring 'I love you' a million times over," Liam countered smoothly.

Evelyn's grin widened. Locking eyes with him, she challenged, "Very well then, say 'I love you' a million times."

Liam suddenly stopped walking and effortlessly scooped her into his arms.

"Why are you carrying me again?" Evelyn gasped, instinctively wrapping her arms around his neck for support.

"You weren't watching your step. If you fell, it would shatter my heart," Liam stated with complete seriousness.

Evelyn nestled against his broad chest, her heart swelling with joy. A wave of warmth enveloped her, making her feel weightless with happiness. The moment felt dreamlike yet utterly perfect in its blissful reality.

Back at Blackwood Manor, Evelyn had just settled comfortably on the plush sofa when Rosalind called.

"Rosalind, what's the matter?" Evelyn answered softly.

"Cassandra, why did you leave so soon? We barely had time to reconnect." "Did Donovan manage to corner you?" Evelyn asked knowingly.

"No, he didn't catch me. He's currently in the shower," Rosalind whispered conspiratorially.

"Rosalind, what would you do if Donovan actually caught you?" There was a brief silence before Rosalind replied dejectedly, "He's making remarkable progress in his recovery. For the past six months, he's been pushing himself relentlessly to surpass me."

"He's undergoing intensive training, consulting specialists, and following every treatment protocol. I might resign once he fully recovers. Though my monthly compensation is quite substantial..."

"Don't concern yourself with finances. The Blackwoods can easily manage that," Evelyn reassured her. "Donovan's improvement is entirely thanks to your care."

"I'm simply fulfilling my professional duties. This is what I was hired to do."

"Rosalind, at least wait until Donovan's vision fully recovers before leaving." "He hardly needs my assistance anymore. Despite his blindness, he's become remarkably self-sufficient - sometimes even more capable than sighted individuals. He can chop vegetables and cook entire meals by touch alone," Rosalind marveled.

Her voice filled with admiration as she continued, "His determination ensures he excels at everything he attempts. When his sight returns, he'll be truly extraordinary."

"Indeed, Donovan has always been someone I deeply admire," Evelyn said proudly. Just then, Liam emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray of freshly cut fruit. His brow furrowed slightly upon hearing Evelyn's words. After setting down the tray, he settled beside her and playfully captured her hand, tracing gentle circles on her palm that made her giggle.

"I'm sorry about earlier," Rosalind apologized.

"Rosalind, do you think Donovan might be teasing you intentionally?" Evelyn hinted carefully.

Rosalind laughed heartily. "The harder he works at his recovery, the more it seems he dislikes me."

Evelyn sighed in response.

"As long as he continues improving, that's all that truly matters. I haven't failed his parents, and I can justify my generous salary," Rosalind said before exhaling deeply.

"You've more than earned it, Rosalind."

"So Cassandra, are you happy being married to General Blackwood?" Rosalind inquired with genuine curiosity.

Evelyn's gaze drifted to Liam. A radiant smile illuminated her face as she responded with a contented, "Mmm-hmm."

"I wish you endless happiness," Rosalind said warmly. "I won't keep you any longer. Congratulations on your second marriage!"

###Chapter 493

Evelyn let out a soft laugh at Rosalind's mention of "second marriage." After exchanging a few more words, their phone call came to an end.

She leaned closer to Liam, her breath warm against his ear. "Do you really like holding my hands that much?"

Liam turned his head, his lips brushing her cheek as he murmured, "More than you can imagine."

Evelyn pulled her hands away with a playful huff. "They're just ordinary hands. You have a perfectly good pair yourself."

"Yours are different," he whispered, his voice thick with emotion.

Suddenly, he cradled her face and captured her lips. When she gasped in surprise, he took advantage to deepen the kiss. Panic flared through her as she pushed against his chest, creating the barest inch of separation.

"Liam, you—"

"Don't move," he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument.

She froze instantly. In one smooth motion, he lifted her onto his lap, one arm securing her waist while his other hand tangled in her hair. The kiss that followed was desperate, hungry—as if he was making up for every moment they'd spent apart.

His mouth moved with fierce passion, yet his hands remained restrained, carefully avoiding any inappropriate contact. Evelyn could feel the tension in his muscles, the deliberate control he exerted over himself.

She'd noticed this about Liam before—his incredible self-restraint. There had been times she'd wondered if he might be... incapable. Her pregnancy had proven otherwise. The man was more than capable—and frighteningly determined.

Throughout her pregnancy, Liam had been the picture of restraint. They shared a bedroom but slept in separate beds. His idea of a honeymoon was simply being together—reading side by side, taking leisurely walks while holding hands, or sitting in comfortable silence as they watched the sunset.

He'd taken over all the cooking, meticulously planning nutritious meals while banning anything remotely unhealthy. He'd delegated his military duties to his subordinates, silenced his phone, and ignored all but the most urgent matters. To Liam, nothing in the world mattered more than Evelyn and their unborn child.

The winter morning sunlight filtered through the bare branches outside, casting dancing patterns across the living room floor. One particularly bright beam illuminated Evelyn's face as she reclined by the window, basking in the peaceful morning.

The tranquility shattered when the front door burst open with a crash. Evelyn turned sharply to see Victoria Hudson standing in the doorway, her chest heaving with exertion, her expression twisted in fury.

Victoria's wild eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Cassandra? What are you doing here? Where's Liam?"

Evelyn rose slowly from the chair, her protective instincts flaring as she assessed the threat. Despite being Liam's legal wife, she couldn't shake the feeling of being an intruder in this moment.

With one hand instinctively covering her stomach, Evelyn edged closer to the window. "He's... making breakfast in the kitchen."

Victoria let out a derisive snort. "You have the Supreme Commander of Aldenria's armed forces making you breakfast? Are you insane? Do you have any idea how valuable his time is? You—"

Evelyn swallowed hard, her pulse quickening as Victoria took an aggressive step forward. Just as she was about to respond, Liam appeared in the doorway, a plate of food in hand.

His voice cut through the tension like a blade. "I'm making breakfast for my wife. It's the most natural thing in the world. Why should my military rank have anything to do with it?"
###Chapter 494

"Wife?" Victoria stormed into the living room, her fists clenched so tight her knuckles turned white. The fury in her voice was barely contained as she spat out, "Liam, are you two actually married?"

"Yes, we are," Liam answered smoothly, his expression unreadable.

Victoria's face darkened like a thundercloud. She jabbed an accusing finger at Evelyn's barely visible baby bump. "And you're claiming that child is yours?" she hissed through gritted teeth.

"Obviously it's mine. Why wouldn't I?" Liam took a step toward her.

Victoria let out a frustrated growl, grinding her teeth loud enough to hear.

"Would you like some breakfast?" Liam offered casually.

"You know damn well I didn't come here for breakfast," Victoria snapped.

"Good, because I didn't make any for you. There's extra if you're hungry. If not, the door's that way." Liam's tone was ice cold.

"Liam, don't you think you're rushing into this marriage?"

"I don't."

Evelyn stood silently nearby, watching the exchange. Her heart felt like it was being crushed under a boulder, each breath coming harder than the last.

She didn't care about keeping their marriage secret. But seeing how intimately Liam interacted with Victoria made her stomach churn. They moved like lifelong confidants, their connection obvious even in anger.

Rational or not, the jealousy burning through her veins was overwhelming.

Evelyn pressed a protective hand to her stomach as she pushed past them toward the front door. Liam moved to intercept her.

"Where are you going, Cassandra?"

Her face hardened as she shoved his hand away. With deliberate movements, she reprogrammed the fingerprint lock, entering a new code and scanning her thumb while everyone watched.

"Why are you changing the password?" Victoria demanded, her frown deepening.

After finishing the reset, Evelyn turned back to the room. "Ms. Hudson, from now on you'll knock before entering my home."

"What about me? You haven't even registered my print yet," Liam protested, confused.

Evelyn shot him a withering look. "Same rules apply. Knock first. If no one answers, don't bother coming back." Liam suddenly burst into laughter, his face lighting up with undisguised affection.

"I've lost my appetite," Evelyn muttered. Then she stomped up the stairs - each heavy step a clear indictment of Liam's behavior.

Victoria's eyes nearly bulged out of her head. She whirled on Liam. "You're seriously marrying someone like that?"

"She's adorable!" Liam replied, his gaze following Evelyn up the stairs.

"Adorable?" Victoria scoffed. "She just locked us both out of your house! She can restrict my access, fine, but yours too? That's not adorable, that's psychotic!"

A shadow crossed Liam's face. "Victoria, there's never been an 'us.' Cassandra's jealous, that's all."

Victoria stared at him in disbelief.

Liam looked down, smiling to himself. "Everything she does when she's jealous... I find it completely charming."

Victoria planted her hands on her hips, breathing hard through her nose. "You've lost your mind. You're claiming a baby when she's barely showing. She's jealous over nothing, and you think it's cute? Love really has blinded you."

Liam gathered the breakfast tray from the dining table and headed upstairs. "You'll understand when you're married."

Victoria's face twisted in disgust. She paced the living room like a caged tiger, her hands still firmly planted on her hips, searching for some outlet for her boiling rage.

###Chapter 495

Though Evelyn was furious, she couldn't deny the fact that Liam had remarried Cassandra.

After locking herself in the bedroom, Cassandra grabbed her phone and dialed Rosalind. She had already informed her assistant about the marriage to Liam on their wedding day.

Rosalind had been thrilled and showered her with blessings, telling her to enjoy the honeymoon with Liam. But Cassandra's happiness was shattered when Victoria showed up uninvited less than a week later.

When Rosalind answered, Cassandra's voice trembled. "Rosalind, could you book me a flight? I need to return to the lab immediately."

"What happened? Did General Blackwood do something?" Rosalind sounded alarmed.

"Not just him. Victoria came too. They're both making my life miserable."

"That woman again! Why can't General Blackwood cut ties with her?" Rosalind's tone turned sharp with irritation.

"He never could. I regret saying yes to this marriage," Cassandra whispered, her throat tightening with unshed tears.

"Don't say that, Cassandra. General Blackwood adores you," Rosalind tried to comfort her.

The more Cassandra thought about it, the angrier she became. Hot tears pricked her eyes. "I don't trust him anymore. Victoria waltzes in and out of our home like she owns the place."

"She even had the nerve to question whether Liam was really the father of my baby and if we rushed into marriage. And he just stood there, not defending us at all!"

Rosalind gasped. "What? That's unacceptable! Cassandra, even if your family isn't here for you, I am. Hold on, I'm coming right now."

A gentle knock interrupted them. "Cassandra, open the door," Liam's voice filtered through.

Cassandra covered the phone and snapped, "I'm not hungry! Go have breakfast with your precious friend!"

Silence followed.

She collapsed onto the bed, pulling the covers over her head as she continued talking to Rosalind. Pregnancy had made her emotions volatile lately.

Deep down, she knew Liam probably meant no harm. She wouldn't have minded if Ryan had visited instead. It was Liam's constant involvement with Victoria that stung.

After reading for hours, Cassandra finally dozed off. Her phone's ringing startled her awake. Rosalind's name flashed on the screen. It was noon, and her stomach growled in protest.

"Rosalind?" she answered groggily.

"I'm here, but General Blackwood won't let me in. He's ordered me to leave!" Rosalind sounded furious.

Cassandra jumped up, throwing on a robe. "That's ridiculous! I'm coming down right now."

Liam was in the living room when she descended the stairs. He closed his laptop at the sound of her footsteps and approached her.

"You must be hungry. I've kept lunch warm for you," he said, reaching for her hand.

Cassandra pulled away. "Not hungry. I'm leaving with Rosalind."

As she tried to pass him, Liam caught her arm from behind and pulled her close. He rested his forehead against her shoulder. "Why are you so angry?"

Exhausted, Cassandra sighed. "Liam, if you didn't want a secret marriage, fine. But could you at least stop making me worry?"

"I'm with you every single day. Isn't that enough to reassure you?" Liam murmured, inhaling her familiar scent. His heartbeat quickened as he held her tighter, unwilling to let go.
###Chapter 496

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "Are you really this naive or just playing dumb?"

"Completely clueless," Liam answered honestly.

Her fingers tightened around the research notes she was holding. "I may be brilliant in my field, but when it comes to political games and manipulation? I'm utterly defenseless."

Liam looked genuinely perplexed. Gently, he turned her to face him, cradling her face between his hands. His dark eyes searched hers intently. "No one will ever outmaneuver you while I'm here."

With a sharp movement, Evelyn broke free from his grasp. She took two steps back, her emerald eyes flashing with anger. "That's rich coming from you. You're exactly why Victoria just played me like a fiddle."

Confusion and hurt flickered across Liam's handsome features.

Seeing his blank expression only fueled Evelyn's frustration. She shoved against his chest with surprising force. "If anything happens to our baby because of your carelessness, I swear to God, Liam Blackwood, I'll divorce you so fast your head will spin."

The word "divorce" hit Liam like a physical blow. Before he could respond, Evelyn had already turned on her heel and stormed away.

Liam didn't hesitate. Snatching his military coat, he sprinted after her. By the time he reached the parking lot, Rosalind was already holding the car door open for Evelyn. "General Blackwood, don't worry," Rosalind assured him smoothly. "I'll get Ms. Wright back to base safely."

"Like hell," Liam growled, yanking open the opposite door and sliding into the backseat beside Evelyn.

The entire ride back to the military compound passed in suffocating silence. Evelyn kept her face turned resolutely toward the window, ignoring Liam's attempts to take her hand. Each rejection made his jaw tighten further.

Back at base, Evelyn disappeared into her quarters without a backward glance. That night, Liam's calls and texts went unanswered until finally, her phone was turned off completely.

Morning found Evelyn dressed and ready before dawn. She couldn't afford distractions today - not with the weapons prototype due for testing.

The research lab buzzed with unusual energy when she arrived. Colleagues swarmed her the moment she stepped through the door.

"Cassandra! Is it true?" Ethan Reynolds practically bounced with excitement. "You actually married the Ice General?"

Evelyn's eyes widened. "How on earth did you all—"

"News travels fast in the science division," Ethan grinned, nudging her shoulder.

"Come on, give us details! Who proposed to whom?"

"Was it a shotgun wedding? You can tell us!"

"Does this mean we'll be seeing General Blackwood lurking around here more often?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when a heavy stack of files slammed onto her workstation with enough force to make everyone jump. Her stomach lurched as she looked up into the scowling face of Theodore Graves.

Ethan shot the team leader a disapproving look. "That was completely unnecessary, Theo. Cassandra's pregnant, for God's sake. You could have—"

"If she's pregnant," Theodore interrupted coldly, "then she should take her maternity leave now. This isn't some hobby you can pick up and drop whenever you please, Wright. Where the hell have you been all week?"

Evelyn counted to five before answering. "I got married."

"Did you file the proper leave request?" Theodore demanded, his voice rising.

Evelyn glanced around at her colleagues, but their sympathetic expressions offered little comfort against Theodore's wrath.
###Chapter 497

"I didn't get a chance to file for leave," Evelyn explained through gritted teeth.

Theodore Graves let out a derisive laugh. "No time to request leave? That's the lamest excuse I've ever heard."

Evelyn took a steadying breath before responding coolly, "It was an emergency situation. The engagement happened late at night, and I had to fly back to Aldenria for the wedding ceremony first thing in the morning."

Theodore's expression remained stony. "I couldn't care less about your marital arrangements," he snapped. "You'll be recorded as absent without leave for seven days. Half your monthly salary will be deducted. And forget about receiving any annual bonuses."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson with barely contained rage. It wasn't about the financial penalty - she couldn't stand being treated so unjustly.

Liam had been the one who rushed her home for the wedding. Yet as her superior, he hadn't properly authorized her leave, resulting in this absurd punishment.

The injustice burned hotter with each passing second. She powered on her phone, watching as notifications flooded the screen.

"Hold on," Evelyn said with deceptive calm. "Let me check with my husband about this."

Theodore's brow furrowed. "Why would you need his input?"

"To confirm whether he approved my leave."

"Is your husband suddenly heading HR now?" Theodore sneered.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she dialed Liam's number.

"Cassandra?" Liam's voice carried an unusual warmth through the receiver.

Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Did you approve my leave when I returned to Aldenria for our wedding?"

"I delegated it to Victoria. I authorized a full month's leave," Liam responded seriously, clearly surprised Evelyn had returned after only a week.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, drawing a slow breath. Just hearing Victoria's name ignited fresh fury in her chest.

The realization hit her - Victoria had made her look like a fool yet again. The money meant nothing, but the humiliation stung.

Without another word, Evelyn ended the call, powered off her device, and slammed it onto the desk.

She fixed Theodore with a bitter smile. "Deduct whatever you want - salary, bonuses, whatever. Save yourself the trouble of notifying me."

Theodore jabbed at the scattered files. "Is this what you've been wasting time on? What is all this?"

Evelyn flipped open the folder to find printed copies of her confidential research. Her face burned with outrage. Snapping the file shut, she rose abruptly, cradling her abdomen. "How dare you access my computer?"

Theodore snorted. "You still haven't explained your so-called research, yet you question me? While you're collecting taxpayer money to play games?"

Evelyn forced herself to remain composed. She knew her computer automatically wiped all data after each session, transferring everything to encrypted drives. The hydronium research shouldn't have been accessible.

Her hands clenched into white-knuckled fists as realization dawned. Through gritted teeth, she muttered a curse before demanding, "Who gave you these files? Who's using you to spy on me?"
###Chapter 498

Theodore Graves' face twisted in fury. His jaw clenched so tight I could hear his teeth grinding. He glared at Evelyn with a look that could melt steel, barely restraining himself from lunging at her.

"You dare call me incompetent?" Theodore spat, his voice dripping with venom.

He jabbed a finger toward Evelyn. "Listen here, Cassandra Wright. With this level of insubordination, you don't belong in Team B—let alone on this military base."

Evelyn remained perfectly still, her expression unreadable as she watched Theodore's tantrum unfold.

Snatching up the files, Theodore shoved them at the other scientists. "Look at this garbage. Does any of this make sense to you? It's just random numbers and formulas thrown together."

As confidential documents circulated the room, Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs. "Those aren't for your eyes."

Theodore smirked. "Getting defensive? Afraid people will realize you've been slacking off?"

Evelyn's hands instinctively cradled her stomach as she took a slow breath. Though her research notes were being passed around, most of the scientists just frowned in confusion.

When Ethan Reynolds and Benjamin Hart examined the documents, their eyes widened. They exchanged a loaded glance before staring at Evelyn like she'd grown a second head.

Without a word, they shoved the papers back at Theodore. "Mr. Graves," Ethan said urgently, "return these to Cassandra immediately."

"Does anyone actually understand what she's working on?" Theodore demanded.

Ethan and Benjamin—the only ones familiar with hydronium research—stayed silent. But others piped up:

"I can't decipher any of it."

"Seems to be some advanced compound, but I'm lost."

"Fascinating, but completely over my head."

Theodore tapped the files against his palm, triumphant. "Cassandra, between this worthless research, your disrespect, and your week-long absence, I have more than enough grounds to terminate your position."

"Terminate who?"

A deep voice rolled through the room like thunder.

Every head snapped toward the doorway where Liam Blackwood stood, his imposing frame flanked by Victoria Hudson and Ryan Sullivan. The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.

"General Blackwood," the scientists chorused, straightening to attention.

Liam gave a curt nod.

Theodore scrambled forward, all smiles now. "General Blackwood! What an honor. To what do we owe this visit?"

Liam's gaze had locked onto Evelyn the moment he entered. His chest tightened seeing the exhaustion lining her face.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's shoulders slumped as she noticed Victoria entering with Liam. Only two people had access to the hydronium research—her and Liam.

The documents hadn't come from her. That left one possibility, though she refused to jump to conclusions about how or why.

"Mr. Graves," Liam said casually, "who were you planning to terminate?"

Theodore eagerly handed over the files. "General, look at this. Cassandra's so-called 'research' is just fabricated data. She's contributed nothing to any projects—just collecting a government paycheck while lazing about."

Liam skimmed the documents before returning them. "Follow protocol in handling this matter."

With the General's implicit backing, Theodore stood taller, smugness radiating off him.

Evelyn stared at Liam, betrayal flashing in her eyes. His motives were a complete mystery to her.
###Chapter 499

Evelyn was taken aback by how quickly Liam revealed everything to Theodore. Her fingers curled into tight fists, nails digging into her palms.

Theodore suppressed a chuckle, maintaining his composure as he cleared his throat. His gaze softened when it landed on Evelyn before addressing Theodore. "Did she really call you incompetent?"

"Absolutely. The entire Team B heard it," Theodore snapped, his face flushing with anger.

Liam merely hummed in response.

"Not only did she disrespect her superior, but she also skipped work for an entire week. Given such irresponsible behavior, I recommend immediate termination," Theodore added sharply.

Liam turned to Victoria with a raised eyebrow. "I specifically instructed you to arrange a month's leave for her. Why wasn't this done?"

The room fell silent in shock as Victoria stammered, "I've been overwhelmed with work and it slipped my mind."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. The flimsy excuse grated on her nerves, stirring irritation in her chest.

Liam's attention returned to Theodore. "There's your answer. This oversight falls on Ms. Hudson."

"But why would Ms. Hudson handle Cassandra's leave?" Theodore looked genuinely perplexed.

"Isn't Ms. Hudson responsible for managing my affairs?" Liam countered.

"Well, yes, as your personal assistant—"

"Then doesn't that include matters concerning my wife?"

The realization hit the room like lightning. All eyes turned to Evelyn with widened eyes. Theodore was the last to comprehend the situation.

Evelyn shot Liam a scorching glare. They'd agreed to keep their marriage private, yet here he was announcing it to the entire research facility.

Theodore's face paled. "General Blackwood... you're married?"

A simple nod from Liam prompted a wave of congratulations from the staff. Evelyn stood frozen, her pulse racing.

Theodore forced a congratulatory smile that quickly morphed into nervousness. "Y-Your wife is...?"

Liam's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Indeed, the very woman who called you useless happens to be my wife."

Evelyn's heart skipped unexpectedly at Liam's proud declaration. Though she'd wanted discretion, the way he claimed her so openly sent warmth flooding through her veins.

As colleagues offered their well-wishes, Theodore looked like he might faint. "My deepest apologies, General Blackwood! I had no idea—"

Liam clapped Theodore's shoulder. "No harm done. You can blame my wife for the workplace misconduct and that disastrous data cluster she left you."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. Why was Liam supporting these false accusations?

A smug smirk played on Victoria's lips.

Evelyn couldn't decipher Liam's motives. Were men only devoted before marriage? Yet she knew Liam wasn't that type.

Seeing Liam wasn't angry, Theodore relaxed. "Having Mrs. Blackwood on Team B is an honor. Even if she... takes liberties with attendance."

"So my wife is exempt from Team B regulations?" Liam asked coolly.

"Of course! Mrs. Blackwood may come and go as she pleases. I won't interfere with her research," Theodore backpedaled hastily.

Liam nodded in approval. He strode to Evelyn, capturing her hand in his. The tenderness in his gaze made her breath catch. "Cassandra, let's go."
###Chapter 500

Liam's behavior shifted abruptly. His usual composed demeanor had vanished without warning.

Evelyn was momentarily stunned when they took Cassandra away. She instinctively reached for Theodore. "My research files—"

Liam intercepted her hand, guiding it downward with unexpected force. "Those documents are irrelevant now."

"Irrelevant?" Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. A storm of emotions churned within her as she processed his words.

Before she could protest further, Liam forcibly escorted her out of the research facility. Victoria walked beside Ryan, observing the tense couple ahead. She leaned closer to Ryan, her voice dripping with faux concern. "Did you know Cassandra's academic credentials are fraudulent? Liam's aware, yet he's letting personal feelings cloud professional judgment." Her lips curled in satisfaction. "He insisted on placing her in research just to give her an impressive title."

Ryan frowned, his tone measured. "Given Ms. Wright's capabilities, I doubt she'll underperform in the department."

Victoria's smirk deepened. "Are you blind to what just happened? Still defending her?"

Ryan shook his head slowly. "Something feels... off about this situation."

"What do you mean?" Victoria's fingers tightened around her purse strap.

"It's Liam. He's not acting like himself."

Victoria's posture stiffened. "Explain."

"He's never tolerated anyone disrespecting Cassandra before. Yet today, he sided with an outsider accusing her of negligence."

Victoria preened, casting a triumphant glance at the arguing couple. "Theodore and I attended university together. Liam's courtesy is clearly for my benefit." When Ryan remained silent, she added, "Don't you agree?"

Ryan exhaled sharply through his nose, turning away. His gaze suddenly caught on Rosalind approaching with an armful of pastry boxes.

"Ryan!" Rosalind's cheerful greeting rang across the courtyard.

Ryan stopped abruptly, his entire demeanor brightening as he focused on her.

Victoria's hand landed possessively on Ryan's shoulder. "So? About what I said earlier—"

Ryan shrugged her off with visible irritation.

Victoria's expression darkened. Following Ryan's gaze, she spotted Rosalind and let out a derisive laugh. She reclaimed her grip on Ryan's shoulder, pressing closer. "Oh my, do you have feelings for Cassandra's little assistant?"

Rosalind froze mid-step, her smile vanishing.

Ryan forcefully removed Victoria's hand. "Stop touching me when you talk."

Victoria laughed, nudging Ryan's chest with her elbow. "You're absolutely smitten, aren't you?"

Ryan ignored her, his attention fixed on Rosalind's retreating figure. "Ros—"

He moved to follow, but Victoria seized his wrist. "We have work to do. Where do you think you're going?"

Ryan wrenched free. "Don't you have your own affairs to mind? Your nosiness is exhausting."

He sprinted after Rosalind while Victoria glared after him before continuing to trail Liam and Evelyn.

Rosalind had barely taken ten steps when Ryan caught up, breathless. He positioned himself directly in her path, grinning despite her obvious displeasure. "Are those donuts for me?" He nodded at the stack of boxes in her arms, recalling how he'd mentioned his favorite childhood bakery to her last week.

Rosalind took an exaggerated bite of one donut, then glanced at the remaining five boxes. "In your wildest dreams."

Ryan's face fell slightly. "You can't possibly eat all those alone."

"I'm sharing with Cassandra."

"Two people still can't finish six boxes. Maybe I could—"

"Ask Victoria to buy you some," Rosalind snapped. "If we have leftovers, I'll give them to Donovan in munitions."
