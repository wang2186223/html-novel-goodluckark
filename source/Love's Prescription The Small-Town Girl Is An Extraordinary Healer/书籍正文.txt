###Chapter 1 Shocking News


By the time March rolled around, Shoildon was buzzing with one jaw-dropping news afteranother.

Word spread first that Isaac Bennett-the eldest son of the city's wealthiest and most influential family-had been in a devastating car crash, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

Another shock followed quickly: the prestigious Bennett family had chosen to bind themselves to the newly risen Willis family/ through marriage.

The biggest stir came from the pairing itself-the groom, none other than the now-disabled Isaac, and the bride, the Willis family's eldest daughter, a young woman raised far from the city's refinement in an isolated rural backwater.

Miles away from the glittering skyline, Verena Willis, the name on everyone's lips, remained in Trisas, the rural place she'd always known.

The chime of an incoming message broke the silence of the modest living room where she sat.

One glance at the screen showed a message from her assistant.

The text read, "Evelyn, I've got a patient with an extremely rare case. They've been waiting for you for six months.When can you come take a look?"

The screen dimmed as Verena pressed the power button, her delicate fingers lingering over the device.In her clear eyes, sorrow flickered.

Around the world, people knew her as Evelyn Rowe-the miracle-working healer-but fame meant nothing when she couldn't save the person she loved most. Her grandmother had slipped away the moment she picked up her scalpel, unable to wait any longer.

From behind her came the muffled edge of her parents' voices, their quarrel leaking through the thin walls of the house. "Alec, the company is drowning in unfinished business, and Kaia's eighteenth birthday party is right around the corner. Tell me, which is more important-a pile of work and a major family celebration, or a dead person? Besides, we need Verena back in the city so she can learn proper manners. If she acts like some country hick girl after joining the Bennett family, it'll be the Willis name everyone laughs at!"
"Stop calling her a country hick girl. She's your daughter!"
"If she weren't my daughter, do you think I'd bother making the trip to fetch her?"
Verena stifled a small laugh as their bickering went on.

The two people arguing in the room were not strangers but her own parents, Alec Willis and Laura Willis.
Once,they had been ordinary employees, clawing their way up inch by inch until success finally came.
Back in those early years of scraping by, they had no time for a child, so her grandmother, Shawna Willis,had taken her in when she was only a month old.
Even with their hectic schedules, her parents had still managed to think of her now and then, sending word or a token of affectionwhen they could.
The change in their priorities began the moment their business took off and they launched their own company. At seven years old, Verena gained a younger sister, Kaia Willis, and from that day forward, her arents' interest in her began to fade. As the Willis fortune grew, they slid seamlessly into the ranks of high ociety.
aura would call from time to time, but her conversations were never about Verena's schooling or health.stead, she would go on about Kaia, the younger sister she called the family's lucky charm, as if Laura's ly mission was to brag about the child who supposedly brought them prosperity.
hor narents came back to Trisas for a visit. sunuori, Laura became pregnant again and gave birth to a son. From that point on, all of their attention went to Kaia and the boy. Money arrived regularly, but they themselves stayed away for fifteen years.
If Shawna hadn't passed away, Verena was certain her parents would have gone on ignoring them entirely.

···

Only after the funeral rites were done did Verena agree to travel to Shoildon with them.
They spoke warmly, as though eager to have her close, but she understood what was really at play. After all,it was easy enough to learn the news in Shoildon with a quick search online.

Laura broke the silence as they neared the Shoildon residence.

"Verena, keep in mind-if anyone asks about your education, you tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine with a master's degree and that you're about to start your internship..."
In her mind, Laura had never pictured Verena as anything more than a small-town clinic doctor.Trisas,after all, was nothing but a secluded mountain town in her eyes.
Since Verena had never attended college-or so she believed-Laura assumed she'd only picked up a few simple skills from the local medics.

The few comments she'd overheard from Shawna about Verena studying medicine had been enough for her o settle on that assumption.
corith's medicine program was ranked first in the country, and Laura had no qualms about using its name prop up her own image. Heaven forbid anyone discover that her eldest daughter's practice was in some ural backwater. That, she thought, would be humiliating.
erena sneered at Laura's vanity, knowing Laura had never cared to truly understand her. In all her life, Laura had never once asked about her education. Once, Verena missed two of the exams due
to illness, resulting in low scores. When Laura later learned her scores were low, she had concluded her daughter was unfit for higher learning.
Even when Shawna tried to tell them the good news of Verena's admission to a top-tier university,both parents brushed it aside, mentioning work matters before abruptly ending the call.
After that, Verena and Shawna stopped trying to share anything meaningful with them.
Verena looked Laura in the eye and said evenly, "I never studied at Acorith College of Medicine."
The bluntness made Laura's lips press together. In her eyes, Verena's refusal to play along wasn't strength -it was stubbornness.
Of course she knew Verena had never been a student there; that was the whole point of telling her to lie.Compared to Kaia, who might not match Verena's beauty but had achievements to show for herself, Verena was nothing but an embarrassment.
Before she could scold her, Alec's pointed cough from the front seat forced her to bite back the words.Letting the matter drop, Laura shifted her focus with a softened tone, the indulgence in it clear.
"Anyway, your sister's used to being spoiled. Try not to provoke her, alright? She gets upset easily and refuses to eat when she's in a mood."
Verena couldn't help finding it all a little ridiculous. Almost eighteen and still carrying herself like a pampered child, Kaia was the very picture of being spoiled.
Their exchange ended as the car rolled to a stop in front of a lavish villa that all but flaunted its wealth.Verena stepped out first, taking in the grand facade.
From the entrance, a girl in a cute T-shirt and short skirt came dashing toward them-Kaia, in all her youthful eagerness.
"Dad, Mom, you're finally back!" Kaia's voice rang out, bright and eager. The brightness dimmed when her gaze landed on Verena. Her eyes lingered, scanning Verena from head to toe.

Clad in aplain cream hoodie and pale yellow pants with clean white sneakers, Verena's look was ordinary at first glance. Yet her delicate features, flawless skin, and calm, distant aura gave her a beauty that couldn't be ignored.Nothing about her spoke of years spent in some remote countryside.

Kaia knew exactly who she was looking at-her full-blood sister-but the two had never shared a home.

Life in Shoildon had made Kaia the untouchable little princess of the Willis family, the jewel in their parents'eyes. This sudden reappearance of an elder sister left her with a subtle, uneasy knot in her chest.

"Oh, Kaia, honestly. How can you come outside wearing so little? Aren't you freezing?"

Laura's eyes went straight to the thin fabric Kaia wore before she quickly slipped off her own coat and draped it over her.

With a giggle, Kaia leaned against her mother. "Ha-ha, Mom, it's really not cold at all."

It was a scene warm enough to melt the chill from the air-but Verena had never been part of such moments.

Laughing together, Kaia and Laura headed inside, leaving Verena standing where she was, as though her arrival had already been forgotten.

As she walked, Kaia's eyes found Verena for a brief moment, casting a lingering, unreadable look over her shoulder.

At the sight of his younger daughter, Alec's expression softened, and he turned to bridge the gap.

"That's your sister, Kaia. She's done very well for herself. Scored high marks on her college entrance exams and already secured her spot at Acorith College of Medicine..."
###Chapter 2 Kaia's Insincerity


Alec paused as something seemed to click in his mind. He remembered a conversation from years ago with his mother, when she casually mentioned that Verena had never taken any college entrance exam.

A long, weary breath escaped him. "You'd be so much better off if you were more like Kaia."

Verena didn't even bother dignifying that with a reply. The comment was absurd enough to amuse her. They could recall every tiny quirk Kaia had, yet when it came to something as important as her education, no one had cared to ask. They simply assumed she fell short in comparison.

···

The Willis family home felt like foreign ground to Verena. It was strange to think this place was meant to be hers, yet she was stepping inside for the very first time.

Laura guided her down the hall toward a bedroom, her voice tinged with concern, and offered a reassuring smile. "If there's anything here that doesn't suit you, just tell me, alright?"

Verena kept her tone even. "Thanks, Mom."

"Sweetheart, you don't have to be so polite. I am your mother."

When Laura lingered in the doorway instead of leaving, Verena asked, "Was there something else?"

Laura and Alec had spent years clawing their way into high society, seizing their break the moment it appeared.Still, they were newcomers, and many in those circles saw them as outsiders. The Bennett family,on the other hand, was adynasty-wealthy,well-connected,and deeply rooted in prestige.

So when the Bennett family suggested a marriage alliance, Laura wasn't about to refuse. She could already picture the benefits, envisioning all the doors it would open.

But Isaac's accident had left him permanently disabled, and Laura couldn't imagine giving her precious younger daughter to him. That was when she decided to bring her eldest home. For a brief moment, staring into Verena's calmn, unflinching gaze, Laura felt the sting of guilt. She hadn't been there to raise her, and there was no real bond between them. The guilt was genuine, but the detachment was stronger.

Even so, she told herself this was an opportunity for Verena. A girl from a small,remote place, who had struggled in school and now worked as a doctor in a quiet town like Trisas, could only benefit from marrying into the Bennett family. Disabled or not, Isaac represented wealth, comfort, and security.

"You need to get some rest for now, Verena. There's someone I want you to meet later tonight, and I'll be the one taking you."

Laura didn't say who, but Verena didn't need to ask. It would be Isaac. She had already read about his accident online. The thought made her want to laugh and shake her head all at once. Expecting anything different from these parents had been foolish. Children who grew up feeling like afterthoughts learned to carry both bitterness and resignation.

"Alright." Verena gave a simple nod, though her agreement had nothing to do with Laura. She had come to Shoildon with only one purpose in mind-Isaac. A quiet thought crossed her mind, wondering what state he might be in now.

Laura's lips curved slightly when she saw no resistance. "Good. Get some rest, then. I'll leave you be."

Just as she was about to head out, she turned to Verena and said, "When you see him tonight, if anyone asks about your schooling, tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine wit a master's degree. Don't worry about them finding out otherwise-I'll take care of it."

Once the door clicked shut, Verena stretched out on the bed. Raising her right hand, she noticed the faint tremor in her fingers.

Six days had passed since she failed to save Shawna on the operating table. The scalpel had slipped, and her right hand hadn't stopped shaking since. For a surgeon, such trembling was the surest path to ruin.

Her mind churned with thoughts until sleep crept in, pulling her, into an unsettling dream.

In another room, Kaia lounged across the sofa, her phone lighting up with group chat messages. Everyone wanted to know-was her sister beautiful? The question soured Kaia's mood. Calling Verena pretty felt like an understatement. Even in simple clothes,she had the kind of beauty that caught and held the eye. Her complexion was smooth, unblemished, almost too refined for someone who had spent years in a remote backwater. Next to her, Kaia felt like the girl-next-door-sweet and harmless, but lacking genuine allure.

The questions kept coming, so Kaia finally typed back. "She's alright, not ugly."

She knew the answer was a blatant lie, yet the words had slipped out on instinct.

By now, everyone in Shoildon had heard whispers about the upcoming marriage between the Bennett family and the Willis family.

The city's wealthy young people were curious about the woman Isaac-once a man of unmatched promise-was set to marry.

Seeing Kaia's lukewarm reply, the group went quiet. Not ugly... It was the kind of phrase that hinted the woman was plain at best. Poor Isaac, they thought.

Among those reading was Bobby Bennett, Isaac's younger brother.

A sharp curse left his lips before he turned toward his mother, Danica Bennett.

"Mom,I get that my brother's legs aren't in the best shape... but does that mean you have to set him up with someone who can't do anything? Kaia says her sister's not exactly attractive."

The comment struck Danica with a dull ache. Like any mother, she wanted her son to have a worthy match.

Still, Isaac's condition went far beyond his injured legs. Certain aspects of his health as a man had been permanently damaged. As the matriarch of the Bennetts, she couldn't let whispers about the family spiral out of control. The safest route was to choose a bride who posed no threat-Verena Willis, the eldest daughter of that family.

"This is my decision, and you have no say in it," she said, masking her emotions with a cool tone.

Bobby's jaw tightened in anger.

Unmoved,Danica turned away and started up the staircase, uninterested in soothing his temper. A message from Laura had just arrived, asking her to set up a meeting between Verena and Isaac that evening.


Stepping into Isaac's dimly lit room, she crossed to the window without pause and yanked open the curtains.



Harsh daylight spilled across the floor,driving away the gloom.

Isaac was stretched out on the bed, his eyes shadowed but unblinking, his face as sharply defined as ever.

Knowing he was awake, Danica spoke plainly. "You'll be meeting a girl tonight. And you will marry her."

"If that's the plan, why waste time with a meeting? Just register the marriage and be done with it," Isaac answered,his voice flat.

A mixture of compassion and unspoken indignation churned in Danica's chest. No one outside the family knew that the accident had taken not just Isaac's health, but also her husband's life. With her son in this state,she dared not announce her husband's death, fearing it would shake the company's stability.

"Don't fight me on this. It's only polite to meet her first."

When she left the room, the shadows seemed to close in around Isaac again. Pain and self-disgust clouded his eyes. In his mind, his father's death was a burden he would always bear.

By the time dusk settled in, Verena was woken by a few knocks on the door before it opened. It was Kaia.

With a tone that wavered between forced cheer and thinly veiled condescension, Kaia said, "Verena, you're about to marry into the Bennett family. Congratulations. They're the top family in Shoildon."

Years of studying abroad had sharpened Verena's instincts, and Kaia's insincerity was as plain as day.

One look was enough to know Kaia disliked her.

In silence, Verena continued folding her quilt, patiently waiting to hear the rest of what Kaia had to say.
###Chapter 3 She's Not Good Enough For You


As Verena stayed silent, Kaia added, "The Bennett family might have a good name, but lsaac is already crippled. People say that when a man's legs are paralyzed, his sexual function is often affected too.l honestly don't want you marrying into that family."

While her words sounded concerned, Kaia's real hope was that Verena wouldn't become part of the Bennett family. Even with Isaac's health problems, he was still someone Kaia had once cared for. And if Verena married him, her life would undoubtedly turn out better than Kaia's.

Verena understood exactly what Kaia was trying to do, so she spoke plainly. "If you don't like me, that's fine.You don't have to pretend you're worried because..."

Verena stopped mid-sentence when she caught the flicker of surprise in Kaia's eyes, and then continued as if it meant nothing, "The feeling's mutual. I don't like you either."

That blunt truth left Kaia momentarily speechless. She hadn't imagined Verena would tear away her false concern so openly.

It was only after Verena had stepped out of the room that Kaia found her voice again. She stamped her foot in anger and snapped, "Who do you think you are? So arrogant! You're nothing but a country bumpkin from a backward place."

Verena had only reached the doorway. Hearing the insult, she turned back, remained just outside, and faced Kaia. "Your parents are from that same backward place. Should I let them know you think everyone from there is a bumpkin?"

The words left Kaia frozen in place. Verena's sharp, unyielding stare made her feel as though every hidden thought had been uncovered.

Her dislike for Verena deepened. This time, though, she didn't argue back and stormed off in a huff.

Kaia had just descended the staircase when Laura appeared before Verena. A shadow darkened Laura's expression.

Verena could guess the reason. Kaia must have run to her, claiming she'd been bullied by her older sister.

"What did you say to Kaia?" Laura asked, her tone sharp and accusing, as though she had already taken Kaia's side. It was clear she hadn't considered there might be another side to the story.

Such blind judgment was something Verena found hard to tolerate.

With a faint, mocking smile, she asked, "And what did she tell you?"

"I'm the one asking you!" Laura retorted.

Her temper spiked at Verena's question in return, certain that growing up in a rural backwater had stripped her eldest daughter of proper manners.

"She called me a country bumpkin, so I reminded her that if that's true, then you and Dad would be bumpkins too, because yo both grew up in the same place."

"Ridiculous! Kaia would never say something so disrespectful." Laura's fury deepened. "It's bad enough you angered your sister, but now you're making up lies? You've got some nerve, Verena."

The whole thing struck Verena as absurd. Laura pressed her for an answer, yet refused to believe her when she gave it. Was Laura only interested in hearing what matched her own opinion?

Verena wasn't the type to back down and had a way of provoking people further. Laura's refusal to believe her made her say, "If you've already decided I'm lying, then so be it. You believe Kaia no matter what. But you won't ever get an apology out of me. If I'm such a problem, I'll just go back to the countryside and let Kaia marry Isaac herself."

She knew exactly what Laura was aiming for and used it to shut her down.

"You!" Laura was genuinely provoked, but she held her temper in check, reminding herself of the real reason she had brought Verena to Shoildon.

She couldn't make sense of how different her daughters had turned out. Kaia was accomplished and sweet-tongued, always winning her over. Verena, in contrast, was unremarkable, stubborn, and dishonest.Years apart had made her feel like a stranger.

"Get your things together. You're coming with me to the meeting. And change your clothes. I'll have one of the servants bring you an outfit."

Verena's decision to come to Shoildon had nothing to do with her unfairly biased parents. The moment she saw the news, she had recognized Isaac.

She didn't care about dressing up to see himn. So when she came downstairs, she wore exactly what she had on before.

Laura, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, looked visibly unhappy. "Why didn't you change?"

"I don't feel like it," Verena said in an unhurried tone.

"You..." Laura could only glare, her patience wearing thin.

It dawned on her that Verena was not as submissive or easy to control as she had assumed.

Still, her priority at the moment was securing the marriage arrangement with Isaac.

"Alright, fine. If you won't change, then let's just go..."



Over in the chat group of the wealthy young people, Bobby kept directing questions at Kaia.

"Kaia, what kind of work does your sister do?"

Even though they shared the same group, Kaia usually had little reason to speak with Bobby.

Her thoughts raced the moment she saw him reach out to her first.

Not wanting Bobby to feel overlooked, she replied quickly, "My mom told me she works as a doctor in a small town."

Bobby's brows drew together slightly. Adoctor? If that was true, then at least she might be able to care for his brother. Thinking along those lines, he grudgingly accepted the idea of Verena being unattractive.Kaia knew her mother had planned to spread the claim that Verena was a master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine.

Kaia had poured years of effort into getting into Acorith College of Medicine and earning people's admiration, so the thought of Verena reaping such recognition without working for it irritated her.

With a hint of mischief in mind, Kaia put on an air of casualness and added, "But she never attended university. She probably just picked up a little from the local doctors."

"What? She never even went to university?" Bobby's surprise was obvious.

The title of "doctor" now felt suspicious to him.

Irritation welled up in Bobby. Isaac had graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in the world.It was bad enough to marry someone plain-looking, but to have her be undereducated as well...

Unable to keep it in any longer, Bobby sent a message to Isaac. "Please, don't marry Verena Willis. She's not good enough for you. Her sister said she never even went to college. Looks aside, she doesn't have much education."

Isaac was seated in a private room at Spice Restaurant, already waiting.

The setting there was elegant and calming.

Neither Isaac nor Danica, however, had the mood to enjoy the view beyond the window.

For Danica, this meeting was purely a business arrangement.

For Isaac, it was nothing more than a reminder of his own shortcomings.

When his phone chimed, Isaac glanced at the message from Bobby. His striking features stayed impassive.

Danica caught sight of Bobby's message as well.

She shut her eyes for a brief moment before saying, "Isaac, please don't resent me. I have no other option."

In her mind, the only way to stop the damaging rumors about him was for him to marry and quietly adopt a child, passing it off as his own.Isaac's lips curved in a faint, bitter smile. Resentment was a luxury he couldn't claim. In his eyes, he was the reason his mother had lost her husband.

Even so, Isaac sent Bobby a reply. "Watch your tone."

Bobby's temper flared when he read it. In a moment like this, Isaac was still telling him to be polite. Did Isaac even understand the real issue?

At that time, Verena and Laura reached Spice Restaurant.

Verena was tall and wearing flat shoes; Laura, teetering in high heels, had to hurry to match her pace.
###Chapter 4 Showing Off Something For Sale


As she walked, Laura whispered to Verena, "No one needs to know you never made it past secondary school.Just tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. That's the story. Got it?"

Verena had no desire to bother her with a reply.

Upon reaching the reserved room, Laura fixed her hair and straightened her clothes while Verena raised her hand and knocked.

The moment Danica heard someone knocking at the door, she knew the eldest daughter of the Willis family had arrived. This was the marriage arrangement she had personally set in motion. Now, as Isaac was about to meet Verena, emotions twisted inside her.

There was a time when Isaac had been her greatest pride. If that accident had never happened, he would be standing next to the most accomplished woman, not someone without much education.

Conflicting thoughts tugged at Danica. She couldn't bear the idea of others looking down on her son,yet she disliked the Willis family for trading their daughter's future for money.
"Come in," Danica instructed, her voice leaving no room for hesitation.

At once, Verena turned the handle and stepped into the room.

The eyes of both Danica and Isaac immediately settled on her.

Verena's outfit was plain-a loose sweatshirt with comfortable pants.Her hair was tied back, though a few strands brushed against her forehead. Minimal makeup left her features untouched, but her beauty was impossible to overlook. Among Shoildon's most polished ladies, she would still draw attention. She carried herself with a calm assurance that made her presence hard to ignore.
For a brief second, Danica just stared, surprise and admiration flashing in her gaze.

Isaac's brow furrowed instead. "So... you're from the Willis family?"

Danica's words came out with a hint of uncertainty, and Laura edged her way inside from behind Verena.Wearing an eager smile, she responded, "Good evening, Danica. That's me. Laura."

Laura guided Verena forward with a bright smile. "This is my daughter, Verena Willis."

Danica's look of surprise was impossible to miss, and Laura felt a wave of satisfaction. Verena carried Alec's features, and that face was something worth showing off. It comforted Laura to know her eldest daughter still had qualities that made her proud.

"Verena, is it?" asked Danica.

She studied the young woman's striking beauty and the confidence she carried. Nothing about her matched Bobby's claim that she was"110t exactly attractive." If this was considered.unattractive, then Shoildon would have no beautiful women left.

A flicker of satisfaction passed through Danica's.eyes. She was relieved to find the woman didn't match Bobby's unflattering description.

She still wanted a daughter-in-law who was easy to control and wouldn't go around exposing Isaac's issues in bed, but she also hoped the girl wouldn't be plain-looking. Appearances mattered, and whoever married into the family had to look the part.

Reading the satisfaction in Danica's expression, Laura felt a quiet surge of pride. Verena was her own flesh and blood, and when it came to looks, se easily outshone Shoildon's most polished ladies.

"Yes. Danica, this is Verena," Laura repeated warmly.

"Please, have a seat..." Danica's voice softened slightly.

While the two mothers traded polite remarks, Verena's attention shifted to Isaac seated across from her.

He wore a simple black shirt and sat in a wheelchair with a light blanket draped over his legs.

Catching her eyes on his legs, Isaac's fingers tightened over his knees, but his expression stayed steady and distant, as if her glance carried no weight.

 When their gazes locked, Verena showed no sign of discomfort. Instead, she gave him a poised smile. Even in a wheelchair, he was exactly as she remembered. He was cool, unyielding, and commanding in presence.

As they looked at each other, Danica motioned for Laura and Verena to take their seats.

Laura praised Verena like she was describing a rare gem, stressing her merits in case Danica harbored any doubts.

Danica felt entirely satisfied with what she saw.

Still, she couldn't help but find something unpleasant about the way Laura kept pushing her daughter forward. It felt less like introducing a future bride and more like showing off something for sale.

The reality was that lsaac's legs were already in a poor condition, and even though the Bennett family remained wealthy and influential, he wasn't the best choice for a husband.

By lowering Verena's position so much, Laura gave the impression she didn't care if her daughter ended up looked down upon or mistreated, as long as the marriage into the Bennett family happened. To Danica, such a mother was hard to respect.

With Verena and Isaac saying barely a word between them, it fell on Danica and Laura to keep the conversation going.

After several minutes of small talk, Danica finally asked Verena, "Miss Willis, your mother told me you hold a master's degree from Acorith College of Medicine. Is that right?"

This detail mattered to Danica. Having a doctor in the family would make caring for lsaac far more manageable.

The moment the question left Danica's lips, Laura grew tense. She feared Verena would stubbornly deny it,so she gave her daughter a discreet nudge under the table.

Laura thought no one would notice, yet both Danica and Isaac caught the movement.

A faint line formed between Danica's brows, while Isaac's cold, impassive gaze remained unchanged.

Verena raised her head, set her utensils down with steady hands, and gently dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering, "No."

Danica's face lost some of its warmth, and Laura's expression shifted sharply.

Inwardly, Laura fumed. Damn it, Verena was still as rigid as ever. Why couldn't she think on her feet? Did she have to embarrass her like this?

Her anger nearly boiled over, but she forced herself to hold it in andprepare a way to salvage the situation.

Before she could speak, Verena added, "I graduated from Pine Hill University."

Laura's eyes widened, and her face went through several changes. Pine Hill University was one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, and the revelation left her momentarily stunned.

Verena, on the other hand, stayed steady, her expression showing no hint of disturbance.

Laura's frustration nearly boiled over. She had always known Verena had grown up in a less refined place,but she hadn't expected her to be so bold in making up stories.

Claiming a degree from Acorith College of Medicine was already stretching the truth, yet now she dared to say she had graduated from Pine Hill University? Did Verena really think the people here would believe such a thing? Her lie had no shred of credibility.

Danica's surprise showed in her eyes. She looked from Verena to Laura's stiff, uneasy face, and in that moment, something clicked. The realization brought a deeper crease to her brow.

Isaac kept his gaze on Verena, and she responded with another gentle smile. It was warm, inviting, and carried the freshness of early spring.

That single smile lightened Isaac's mood in a way he couldn't explain. He quickly turned away, his brows knitting together as a strange wave of self-consciousness washed over him-not because she was outstanding, but because her kindness made him feel small in an ufamiliar way.

"Attending Pine Hill University is certainly impressive. You must be very talented," Danica said, her tone cold and detached.

Graduates from Pine Hill University stood among the most gifted people in the world, and calling them merely talented hardly did them justice.

Laura realized Danica had already caught on to the lie, but she forced herself to press forward. "Ha-ha, yes,it's very impressive. I must have gotten things mixed up... confusing it with the school Kaia will be attending."

The exchange left the dining table steeped in uncomfortable silence.

Without any more hesitation, Danica said, "I'm very pleased with Verena, and I'm sure lsaac is as well.Regarding the marriage agreement..."

"Mom," Isaac chimed in, stopping her before she could finish.

 ###Chapter 5 | Want To Help You


Danica sent Isaac a pointed glance that carried a silent warning.

Isaac paid no attention to her look and said, "I'd like a word alone with Miss Willis."

Since Isaac had spoken, Danica held back any further comment. She already knew his intentions. If only he would simply cooperate. Most likely, he was planning to convince Verena to back out.

With a slow exhale, Danica kept her poise. "It seems Isaac wants to speak privately with Verena and know more about her. Laura, let's step outside for a bit, shall we?"

She understood that Laura was eager for this marriage to happen.

Danica's words served as a subtle nudge to Isaac not to interfere with the agreement.

The response caught Laura off guard. She hadn't expected Danica to be so lenient after Verena's outrageous lie.

Feeling pleased, Laura replied, "Yes, they could use some time alone."

She gave Verena's shoulder a light pat, her voice holding a note of caution. "Verena, remember to take care of Isaac. He's your fiancé now."

Verena lifted her glass for a sip, a faint smile curving her lips. Her dislike for Laura hadn't changed, yet the thought of Isaac being her fiancé brought a quiet thrill to her heart.

When the two women stepped out, Isaac spoke. "My legs are useless now. They'll stay this way for the rest of my life."

His deep, slightly hoarse voice carried the weight of someone who hadn't spoken much in a long time,and his cool, detached tone made it sound almost void of emotion..

Yet Verena understood that his words were a warning, meant to remind her of the kind of man she was about to marry. What else?" she asked, her clear eyes fixed on him like a mirror that reflected everything.

Isaac hesitated. His throat tightened, and a shadow crossed his gaze as he thought of the unspoken truth.Then he forced himself to lay it bare. "I can't function like a normal man anymore. I can't give you happiness or the life of a normal marriage."

Isaac understood that his mother's intentions went beyond silencing gossip; she also hoped to steady the company's position. Even so, neither reason justified binding a woman to him in marriage. Becoming his wife would mean giving up her own happiness and future. In his mind, he was already a ruined man,and there was no need to pull someone else down with him.

At those words, Verena walked around the table until she stood directly in front of him.

From where he sat, Isaac had to lift his gaze to meet the eyes of anyone around him.

Verena lowered herself into a crouch so she was looking up at him instead.

It was the first time since the accident that Isaac wasn't forced to look upward at someone.

"Can I touch your legs?" Verena asked.

There was no hesitation in her tone. Her clear eyes held no judgment or avoidance, as though she were speaking to any other man and not one paralyzed from the waist down. Unlike the rest of his family, she didn't treat his injuries as a forbidden topic.

Since the accident, every relative who looked at him carried pity and regret in their eyes. They didn't speak the words aloud, but their glances said it all. He was crippled, no longer a complete man.

Most people knew that paralysis often meant a loss of sexual function, and he was no exception. Rumors about his body had spread, and the cruel truth was that they matched reality. The wound they left was sharper and more suffocating than any blade to the chest.

Isaac fixed his deep gaze on Verena. "Do you realize what you're saying?"

She nodded, her expression steady. "Yes, I do."

They had been strangers until this moment, yet lsaac felt an odd sense of familiarity when looking at her. He couldn't explain the reason. Driven by instinct, he gave his answer. "Okay."

With his consent given, Verena's eyes curved with a soft, genuine smile.

For a brief moment, Isaac's focus wavered.

When her fingers touched his leg, he could see the movement, yet no sensation reached him.

He followed the sight of her slender fingers as they began at his knee and slowly traveled upward.

To an outsider, the gesture might have looked like she was trying to flirt, but Isaac knew better. He was a man living with paraplegia, completely powerless and without feeling below the waist.

Her hand stopped on his thigh, tapping lightly before she looked up.an you feel that?"

Isaac gave a small shake of his head.

Her touch resumed, inching closer toward the base of his thigh, until Isaac reacted on instinct and caught her hand.

"What are you trying to do?" His voice was edged with warning.

Verena let out a quiet laugh, pulling her hand back without resistance.

"Isaac, I want to help you."

"Help me?" he repeated with a mocking twist to his tone. "Help me with what exactly?"

"I want to help heal your legs."

The statement landed like a sudden crack of thunder in the still air.

It sounded ridiculous, yet something in her unwavering expression sparked an unfamiliar flicker of hope inside him.

When reality set back in, Isaac let out a bitter laugh at himself, Countless experts had studied his condition and found no cure, yet here he was letting the words of a woman he barely knew stir something in him.

"Do you realize how cruel a joke like that is to someone who's disabled?" Isaac asked. In his mind, even open contempt would have been kinder than offering a false hope.

Isaac slowly loosened his grip on her hand.

"I'm being serious," Verena said, her gaze locked firmly on his.

Her reason for coming to Shoildon was solely because of Isaac, and she had no intention of abandoning that purpose halfway.

He regarded her with a chill in his eyes. "Then tell me why you want to help me. And what makes you think you're capable of it?"

Verena faltered for a brief moment. She had already realized that Isaac had no memory of her.

"Do you really not remember what happened in Clokron's Dragon Quarter?"

In Isaac's mind, there was no doubt he had never seen her before. She was a woman of striking beauty-someone whose presence would command attention anywhere. If they had crossed paths, there was no way he could have forgotten her.

He gave a slow shake of his head. "I've been to Dragon Quarter plenty of times, but I've never once seen you there."

A quiet sigh escaped Verena. So that was it. Maybe it had something to do with the recent accident.

She wasn't certain of the specifics of his condition and would need to look into it before deciding anything.

Without the accident, Isaac couldn't have forgotten her. No one forgot the person they once pursued-unless they had lost their memory. And for him, amnesia seemed the most likely explanation.

"Isaac, I don't know the full extent of your condition yet. Once I've reviewed your medical files, I'll give you a clear answer. But... could you at least not shut me out right now?"

Isaac's eyes stayed on her, his silence stretching between them.

Looking into those eyes that seemed to pierce through him, he felt his usual resolve weaken for the first time. After what felt like a long pause, he spoke unexpectedly. "Alright."

A beat later, he added, "If you can heal my legs, I'll give the Willis family everything they're asking for. But my condition makes marriage impossible. A life with me would be a life spent alone."

Verena froze, and then realization struck her. Her eyes flicked almost instinctively toward his crotch. "You..."

The glance made Isaac's face heat with shame. When their eyes met again, the clarity in her gaze made him feel a rare and uncomfortable urge to turn away.


###Chapter 6 Don't Turn Me Away


Isaac's hands tightened around the armrests of his wheelchair, drawing on nearly all his strength before he managed to suppress the wave of self-loathing inside him. When he finally spoke, his voice was steady and cold. "Just as you thought, I have every condition that comes with being a cripple."

The meaning in his words was unmistakable, and Verena grasped it instantly.

When she met his gaze, it felt as though a shadow had settled over his eyes.

An ache spread through her chest without warning. It was hard to believe that the once proud and refined heir of the Bennett family had come to this.

His refusal had nothing to do with rejecting an arranged marriage-it was rooted in a deep and consuming sense of inferiority.

Without thinking, she closed her fingers around his hand. "Isaac, don't turn me away."

Once,those words had belonged to him. Now, she was the one saying them.

The resolve in her gaze was fierce, so fierce it felt like heat on his skin.

Since the day of the accident, he had shut the door on every show of concern, unwilling to endure the pity that always followed.

No one he had pushed away had ever insisted on staying-not even his mother.

Something he couldn't name moved through him, and he found himself saying, "Alright."

Her smile broke across her face in a way that was soft yet luminous. "Then it's settled."

For a moment, he let himself get lost in that smile, and the reason he had requested a private talk with her slipped from his mind entirely.

It struck him then that this woman he barely knew had already managed to pull down the barriers he held against everyone else.

Matters he would stubbornly stand his ground on with anyone else seemed to bend whenever she was involved, and somehow those moments had turned into talks of engagement and marriage. His plan had been to convince her to walk away from the arrangement, yet this was where they had ended up.

...

The conversation between Verena and Isaac about the marriage lasted less than twenty minutes before they reached a decision.

When the meeting concluded, both families went their separate ways.

The moment Laura sat down in the car, the polite smile she had been wearing crumbled.

Thinkingback to Danica's subtle hints during the meeting made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

Her patience finally gave way, and she scolded Verena, "You shameless girl! Did you forget what I told you?I said you should tell people you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine, but you went and said Pine Hill University instead. Do you honestly have no idea how to tell a more convincing lie?"

Verena cut her off mid-sentence. "I told the truth."

Her eyes stayed steady, without the slightest trace of guilt for being called out.

For a split second, Laura almost believed her. But she knew the truth-Verena had never attended college and only held a high school diploma.

Watching her daughter stubbornly stand by her claim only fueled Laura's anger and contempt. To her, it was proof that rural life had left Verena with an unruly and brazen nature.

"Kaia spent three years working hard to get into Acorith College of Medicine. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to enter a top university? Especially one like Pine Hill University." Laura's voice sharpened as she shot Verena a sidelong-glance. "Now look at the mess you've made. You told such a huge lie you can't even maintain it. Didn't you see Danica's reaction when you claimed Pine Hill University? Who would believe something so ridiculous? You've dragged the Willis family's name through the mud with your constant lying!"

Verena felt no surprise at Laura's opinion. To Laura, she would always be nothing more than an uneducated,ill-mannered girl from the remote countryside. A mother who never even tried to understand her child had already failed in that role.

When Laura brought up Kaia as a comparison, Verena could only find it amusing. Kaia had spent three years working hard to get into the college that now wanted to invite Verena as a lecturer. If Laura knew that, her temper would likely explode.

Verena responded sharply, "You think calling myself a Pine Hill University graduate is a lie, but claiming I went to Acorith College of Medicine isn't?"

As she looked at her mother, whatever expectations she had once held for her vanished completely. Her voice turned sharp and cold. "Don't forget, you're the one who taught me how to lie. You're the compulsive liar here,not me."

Laura froze, caught off guard by the bluntness of the retort.

She drew in a breath to scold Verena for her disrespect, but Verena cut her off. "I don't care to hear any more. You wanted a marriage arranged with the Bennett family. Now it's done. You're satisfied, I'm satisfied,and there's nothing else to talk about."

The car pulled up to the Willis Villa just then, and Verena stepped out without giving Laura a chance to reply.She headed straight for the front gates.

Watching her daughter's back disappear, Laura's irritation swelled to its peak. To her, Verena was nothing but an ignorant, uncultured hick with no sense of manners. Such defiance toward her own mother had to have been encouraged by that meddlesome Shawna in the backward place she came from.

If Isaac hadn't been crippled in both legs, and if Laura hadn't wanted to protect Kaia's future happiness,she would never have agreed to bring Verena back from such a dreadful place. In her mind, only the children raised under her own roof counted as real family. The Willis Villa spanned four floors. The first was the living room, the second held the family's bedrooms,the third was used for storage, and the fourth was reserved for guests.

The whole thing bordered on ridiculous. There were only five people in the family, yet Verena's room had been tucked away at the far end of the third floor, right beside the storage closet.

On the second floor, the spare room had been set aside solely as Kaia's study.

If not for the arranged marriage, there likely would have been no intention to bring Verena back at all.

For that reason, Laura's behavor came as no surprise to Verena, though it still left her with a bitterness she couldn't quite name.

As she began making her way upstairs, the sound of footsteps echoed from above.

When she lifted her gaze, a tall young man was descending the staircase. He wore a relaxed hip-hop outfit,and though his face held traces of youth, it was undeniably handsome.

Verena had never seen him before, but the easy manner in his stride and his casual clothing made it obvious. This was her younger brother, Luka Willis.

At the same time Verena spotted him, Luka's eyes also fell on her.

Her hair was tied back in a simple ponytail, and her clothes were plain, yet her beauty was striking.In that instant, Luka knew without doubt she was his eldest sister.

He had once heard through the chatter in the wealthy young people's group chat that Verena was supposedly unattractive, a rumor that had left him feeling embarrassed.

Now, seeing her in person, he could only conclude those claims were pure fantasy.

Her finely shaped features were bare of makeup, yet her face still radiated a quiet elegance, and there was an undeniable cool detachment in her eyes.

That same glint in her gaze mirrored something in his own, leaving Luka certain she was family. He found himself wondering who had started the rumor about Verena being unattractive in the first place. At the start, Luka had no particular feelings toward Verena, but neither did he oppose her. Still, the fact that she had caused trouble for his cherished sister, Kaia, left a mark.

With a sharp little scoff, Luka dismissed the thought. Beauty meant nothing if she had already offended Kaia.

###Chapter 7 What Was She Planning


Luka recalled Kaia's earlier complaints about Verena, and the irritation he felt toward her only deepened.

Kaia had tried to kindly remind Verena to mind her manners in front of others, yet Verena had brushed off her good intentions and even turned on her.

Since childhood, Luka and Kaia had been inseparable, and he had never tolerated anyone treating her poorly.

With that thought, he slid his hands into his pockets and continued to head down the stairs at an unhurried pace.

Verena's eyes rested on Luka for no more than two seconds before she looked away. If Kaia didn't accept her as anything more than an outsider, there was no reason to expect warmth from a brother she had never known.

In her mind, it made no difference how much they disliked her, so long as they kept their distance.Unfortunately,KKaia and Luka seemed to share an unspoken agreement to find ways to provoke her.

When Verena walked past Luka, she noticed his foot suddenly jut out into her path.

A low, amused scoff escaped her. So this was his plan, to make her stumble and perhaps send her tumbling down the stairs.

Before he could succeed, she planted her foot firmly on top of his, stopping him mid-motion. His foot had already been moving forward, and the unexpected weight forced his balance forward. Seizing the moment,Verena gave him a push from behind.

Unprepared,Luka lurched forward and tumbled down the steps, a startled cry tearing from his throat."Ah!"

The sound of his voice rang through the stairwell as he rolled to the bottom.

From the landing above, Verena turned and looked down at him, her expression cold.

Kneeling on the floor, Luka clutched the railing, the sharp sting in his knees leaving him too weak to get up.

Just then, Laura walked in through the door, and the scene that met her eyes stopped her in her tracks.

"Luka!"

She rushed forward in a panic, bending to help Luka to his feet.

Right as Luka opened his mouth to curse, Laura's voice reached him, and he instantly changed to a pitiful tone. "Mom, Verena pushed me down the stairs."

Laura had already been irritated with Verena's behavior earlier in the day, and now, knowing she had shoved Luka only stoked her fury. She had endured Verena's unpleasant attitude for the sake of the marriage alliance, but her son was her world. Anyone who dared hurt him would have to answer to her.

Her eyes flashed as she fixed Verena with a hard glare. "Why did you push your brother?"

Verena took in Luka's fake display of grievance with a faint smirk, thinking how well the two siblings played their parts, even using the same tactics.

Verena answered Laura's question with a shrug. "He made the first move and tried to trip me, so I simply turned it back on him. Figured he should learn what it feels like."

Her tone stayed even, not rushed, as though she was just stating plain fact rather than defending herself.

Luka was only fifteen, and her composure made him uneasy, worried that Laura might actually believe her.

Clutching at Laura's arm, he changed the subject with a voice that wavered as if holding back tears. "Mom,Verena really did push me down the stairs on purpose. I didn't try to trip her. My leg hurts so much...could it be broken?"

Lately, word had spread all over Shoildon that Isaac had lost the use of both legs. Everywhere Laura went,people were shaking their heads and mourning how far the golden boy had fallen.

Because of that, when she heard Luka complain about his leg, her alarm spiked.

She quickly tried tosoothe him. "Don't worry, l'Il get you to the hospital right away." Verena's indifferent expression, however, only made Laura's anger boil over.

Once she had called for an ambulance, Laura turned sharply to Verena.

"So you've barely set foot in this house and you're already flexing like you own the house? If I let this slide,you'll forget who's in charge around here, and that's not happening."

With that, Laura stormed up the stairs, her hand raised high, ready to strike Verena across the face.

Right before the slap connected, Verena caught Laura's wrist, forcing it firmly downward.

Laura's eyes widened in disbelief. "How dare you..."

She started to speak, but Verena's grip tightened, making Laura draw in a sharp breath from the pain.

Locking eyes with her, Verena spoke in a slow, measured tone. "I already told you-he tried to trip me first,so I pushed him down the stairs. Laura Willis, I never expected fairness from you, but don't think you can treat me like prey just because of other people. If you want me to marry Isaac and get everything you're hoping for, then you'd better not push me too far. Otherwise, you can send your precious younger daughter instead."

Once the words were out, Verena let go, and Laura stumbled backward. She almost lost her footing but managed to grab the railing in time.

Without another glance, Verena walked up the stairs.

Laura remained frozen, staring at Verena's cold, unyielding figure, her mind replaying the piercing look in her eyes.

That clear gaze held a fierce determination that made Laura feel as though she was facing a stranger.

Before Kaia's birth, every phone call with Verena had been met with timidity and obedience.

She had always believed her eldest daughter was easy to control. What unsettled her now was not just the defiance-it was the unfamiliarity that came with it.

If Verena's earlier refusal to change clothes or lie as instructed hinted at her unwillingness to be manipulated, her most recent words revealed something deeper. There was cunning and calculation behind them.With only a few sentences, Verena showed she understood Shoildon's social undercurrents and the exact reason she had been brought back from the countryside. For her to know their intentions yet still return,what was she planning?

Laura began to wonder if bringing Verena back from the countryside had been a mistake. What if sending er to marry into the Bennett family ended up destroying the advantages Danica had promised them?

Shame burned in her chest, tangled with frustration. Laura had convinced herself that a girl raised in a ackwater would be too meek to cause trouble, and that she would be too ignorant to understand her chemes. After all, Laura herself had come from that same place, and her early years in the city had been othing but a blur of nerves and uncertainty.

ut Verena saw through everything. The girl's insight left Laura feeling exposed. At the same time, she felt a ense of odd guilt. Verena was still her daughter, and no one knew her prejudices better than she did.

nen another thought struck. Was it not a daughter's responsibility to lighten her mother's burden?arrying into the Bennett family would secure Verena a future wrapped in luxury and influence. Yet, instead showing gratitude, the girl dared to talk back with the kind of defiance shaped by too much time spent ound Shawna.

ka, on the other hand, wasn't trying to untangle any complicated feelings. He just stood there, stunned by rena's tone. To him, it was proof of what Kaia had said all along-that Verena was nothing more than a ty, ill-mannered country girl with no real worth.

###Chapter 8 She Told The Truth


At the Bennett home, the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted through the air as Danica lounged on the sofa,chatting casually with Isaac.

"Verena is pretty," Danica said, pouring the coffee with practiced ease. "Still, growing up without her parents around and never getting a proper education leaves its mark."

Danica had never cared much about a person's bank account, yet schooling was another matter entirely.The Bennett family held one of the highest standings in Shoildon, and while Verena's family history didn't trouble her, the gap in education could invite friction.

She thought back to the dinner at the restaurant, where Verena had claimed she was a Pine Hill University graduate.That memory brought a faint crease to her brow.

"Maybe she dressed up the truth a little," Danica added with a faint shrug. "No matter. Once she's married in, we can smooth things out."

She slid a cup toward Isaac, who accepted it and let it rest on his lap without taking a sip.

"She told the truth," he said, his deep voice breaking the quiet between them.

The coffee pot halted midair before Danica set it down. "What are you talking about? And how are you so sure?"

Isaac didn't bother with an immediate reply. His eyes lingered on a droplet clinging to the rim of his cup,watching it tremble before sliding down.

Memories from earlier flashed in his mind, the way Verena had knelt slightly to meet his gaze, her slim hand resting lightly on his useless legs, her voice steady as she said, "I want to help you."

This was the first time he had ever seen her, a complete stranger until now. Still, there was something quietly steady about her that drew him in and made her seem trustworthy.The honesty in her gaze and the sincerity in the way she carried herself left little room for doubt. When she said she graduated from Pine Hill University, it felt impossible to question her. Lying just didn't seem like something she'd do.

Across from him, Danica noticed his distant expression. It struck her that Verena had spoken to him in private earlier. Maybe something she had told him made him believe her.

Danica wasn't surprised by his sudden silence. Since the accident, Isaac had become the kind of man who measured his words, speaking only when necessary before letting the conversation dissolve into silence.

She tried to speak, but the words slipped away before they could form, leaving her with nothing but a sigh.At this point, whether Verena had told the truth or not no longer seemed to matter. Once the girl became part of the family, she would be shaped into the kind of daughter-in-law they expected.

Skepticism came naturally to Danica when she thought about Verena's claim. The moment she mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University, Laura's startled reaction had been impossiblé to miss.

Given Laura's love of flauntingany scrap of prestige, a daughter with that kind of degree would have been paraded in front of everyone long ago. The idea that she could have allowed such an outstanding daughter to stay in the backward place was laughable.

What puzzled Danica more was how Verena had managed to sway Isaac, a man far too sharp to be easily fooled.


...

Night settled in as Verena lay in bed, her gaze fixed on Isaac's name in her contacts.

Impulse overrode hesitation, and she tapped into the chat, typing out a quick message. "Are you home?"

Isaac read the text, brows drawing together, and then sent back a single word."Yeah."

A small, knowing smile tugged at Verena's lips. There had been a time when he filled their chats with long,eager lines instead of clipped answers.

Her profile photo sat as a blank white square, while his was a stark black. Vith most men, that kind of short reply could pass for arrogance or a sign they wanted the conversation ver.


ut Isaac wasn't most men. This was simply who he was, reserved with anyone who didn't matter to him.

is nature was no mystery to Verena. She had always known him that way.

e asked without hesitation, "Could you send me your medical records?"

le request made Isaac's grip on his phone tighten slightly.

e Bennett family had turned to some of the most respected doctors in the field, yet none had succeeded estoring his ability to walk.

hough his hope had never completely died, the constant string of disappointments had worn him thin.

eyes dropped to the blanket draped over his legs, and a crease formed between his brows. Was it worth ing the heartbreak again?

ore he could decide, the phone buzzed in his hand.

short words lit up the screen. "Trust me."

ething in those words settled into his chest like a quiet ember, giving off a warmth he hadn't felt in a time. Could she really help him stand again?

brushed the edae of the armrest as a thought formed. After so many failed attempts, maybe one The quiet gave Verena space to think. Staring at the ceiling, she let old memories creep in before sending another message. "Do you really not remember me?"

Back then, she had almost been ready to say yes to him, but life had pulled them in different directions.

Isaac paused at the question, and his mind wandered back to their private conversation at Spice Restaurant,when she had also asked if he remembered what happened in Dragon Quarter, Clokron.

The name stirred nothing. His brow knitted as he searched his memory, finding no trace of her.

He replied at last, "Sorry, I don't remember much. Have we met before?"

The moment she read his question, Verena felt a quiet sense of confirmation sette in. It was exactly what she had expected.

The accident had stolen pieces of Isaac's memory, but to him, nothing felt missing. He assumed their paths had crossed before and that she was simply a stranger he hadn't remembered meeting.

To her, it felt as if his memory had selectively erased her alone, leaving a strange gap only they could navigate.

His case was a bit complicated, and the therapy would take time.

"Forget it. We'll talk another time," she responded.

His medical history demanded her attention far more than any question about the past. Whatever was wrong with his legs was the real priority; everything else could wait.

Isaac's eyes lingered on the messages she had sent, his lips pressed into a flat,unreadable line.

···

Later that evening, Kaia swept in from outside.

Two servants trailed behind her, each struggling under stacks of books so tall they nearly blocked their view -every one ofthem written by respected medical authorities from around the globe.

Clutching her thickest and most treasured volume to her chest, Kaia stepped inside with a satisfied gleam in 
her eyes.

The moment Kaia spotted Laura sitting on the sofa, she rushed toward her, eager to spill her excitement.

"Mom, look at this!" Kaia's voice carried a mix of pride and excitement. "I finally got my hands on the latest release by my idol, Evelyn." She flipped it open and tilted it toward Laura. "Their research is brilliant.The way they see the world of medicine is unlike anyone else. Honestly, I think the person might be a true genius."

Her tone shifted into something wistful. "It's just... no one knows who the person really is. Aside from a name, we don't know their nationality, gender, or even what they look like. Meeting them someday would be incredible."

Kaia's academic excellence had been a constant source of pride, never once causing Laura to worry.

Laura reached over and patted herdaughter's head, smiling warmly. "Kaia, you're so hardworking and well-mannered."

The company would one day belong to her son Luka, so Laura had no plans to involve Kaia in its operations.All she wanted was for her daughter to make a name for herself in a field of her choice and bring prestige to the family.

Her smile faded as another thought intruded. "Not like Verena, who seems to live for provoking me."

If Luka's injuries had been more serious, Laura would have made sure Verena paid the price.

Kaia listened in silence, a faint satisfaction settling over her as her mother spoke.
###Chapter 9 We Should Work Together To Stop It


Kaia liked Isaac, yet her feelings never clouded her judgment enough to consider marrying a man with a disability. She would never agree to be his wife, and she wouldn't stand by if anyone else tried to marry him either. That was the root of her resentment toward Verena.

With a quiet sense of satisfaction buried deep inside, Kaia put on an act of worry and asked, "Mom, what did Verena do to make you so upset?"

Laura, more than ready to let out her anger, began telling Kaia about the falsehoods Verena had told in front of the Bennett family.

"That's Pine Hill University we're talking about! Did she think it was some random, insignificant school?Claiming she was enrolled there only makes it look like we're lying. She ruined my reputation today, and the more I think about it, the more it infuriates me. And if that wasn't enough, she even pushed Luka down the stairs. If Luka hadn't come out of it unhurt, I would have really let her have it."

Kaia could hardly believe what she was hearing. Verena truly was living in a fantasy. She was just a girl from a backwater place, with nograsp of reality and no ability to tell a convincing lie.

Pine Hill University? Did she honestly think everyone else was that gullible?

Biting back her laughter, Kaia offered Laura a few words of comfort before heading back to her room.She opened the group chat for the young people from the elite families, a habit she had before ending the night.

The moment she clicked in, she noticed that Bobby had tagged her name directly.

That small action made her feel as if she had gained the Bennett family's special attention.

Scrolling upward, she saw that someone in the chat had brought up Bobby first, asking him about Isaac and Verena's first meeting.

Bobby's answer was vague, but it was obvious he did not approve of the idea of Verena becoming his sister-in-law.t after that, Bobby tagged Kaia and asked, "Do you know what's going on with your sister? What's she


I's hopes for Verena to end up with Isaac were no secret to Kaia, yet the thought of it happening was thing she would never accept.

she passed along what Laura had told her earlier, she left out the part about pretending to be from h College of Medicine. Instead, she told the group that Verena had gone so far as to ĉlaim she was a ate of Pine Hill University.

st to make fun of it was Slater Lyons, Bobby's closest friend. "Pine Hill University? Did I really just at? That's one bold lie."

g that message, Bobby's patience thinned at once. He questioned what kind of woman his mother sen for his brother. In his mind, lacking looks was forgivable, but being poorly educated and lying as e nothing was far worse.

take long for the group chat to erupt with ridicule.

t of embarrassment touched Kaia as the insults piled up. Instead, she let a small, pleased smile her face.


kept up her carefully built image of a gentle and kind young woman.

a message in Verena's defense. "She only said that because she didn't want people to look down he's actually a good person with no bad intentions. The city's new to her, and it's not easy to ase, don't speak a step in to shut down the idea of the marriage between their families.

And she was right. Bobby grew angrier with each comment he read. If Verena were allowed to marry Isaac,it would spell disaster for his future.

At one point, Bobby had thought that if she stayed in line, he could learn to put up with her. But after realizing she was a skillful liar, he became sure she would only cause trouble. Isaac, who rarely cared about anything and lacked her slyness, could be taken advantage of easily. Bobby would not let that happen.

Bobby didn't hesitate before pulling up Kaia's profile in the group chat and sending her a friend request.

When the notification appeared on her phone, Kaia almost doubted her own eyes. Could it really be that Bobby from the Bennett family had taken the first step to contact her?

Rather than fading quickly, her shock mingled with a sense of excitement.

In Shoildon's social circles, her family might be considered among the wealthy, but they were barely on the bottom rung, while the Bennetts sat securely at the top. Bobby's presence in the group was purely due to his friendship with Slater, and he had never bothered to interact with the rest of them.

Fighting to keep her composure, Kaia tapped "accept" without delay, and then typed a polite question as if the request meant little to her. "Mr. Bennett, was there something you wanted to discuss?"

Without missing a beat, Bobby responded, "Why don't we meet in person?"

The simple message sent a rush of thrill through her. Though she had once been drawn to Isaac, Bobby was just as much a catch. Now that Isaac's disability had changed everything, the idea of Bobby showing interest in her was something most women she knew would envy.

Playing at hesitation, Kaia chewed lightly on her lip before replying, "Mr. Bennett, are you sure this is a good idea? It feels rather sudden."

Bobby nearly scoffed at the screen, already guessing what she must be imagining.

With one hand, he typed out his real reason for reaching out. "You don't want Verena marrying Isaac, right?Then we should work together to stop it." From the way Bobby had reached out, Kaia had first assumed he might have taken a personal interest in her.

It caught her off guard to realize he disliked Verena enough to want to join forces in stopping her marriage to Isaac. What she hadn't anticipated was Bobby's willingness to work with her, and that discovery brought a spark of satisfaction. The chance to block Verena from marrying Isaac while drawing closer to Bobby felt like a perfect victory on both fronts.

Kaia wanted nothing more than to agree to Bobby's proposal. Still, she knew she had to keep up the illusion of being a caring sister to Verena. If she let her open dislike show, that would shatter the gentle,innocent image she had worked so hard to craft. Men tended to admire women who seemed sweet, soft-spoken, and kind.

"This marriage was arranged by our parents. We can't just undo it. Besides, marrying your brother is the best thing that could happen to Verena. As her sister, I should be glad for her, not stand in her way."

Bobby had never spoken with Kaia one-on-one before, but whatever goodwill he might have had toward her evaporated after only a few minutes. He'd seen enough manipulation in his life to recognize when someone was pretending.

Each word of her message was laced with insincerity and hypocrisy. If she truly cared about Verena's happiness, she wouldn't have paraded Verena's humiliations in the group chat for everyone to see. Verena had her flaws, but Kaia was just as bad,maybe even worse.

###Chapter 10 You Really Are Kind-Hearted


Bobby had no patience for people who hid behind self-righteousness to mask their manipulation. If Isaac's future happiness hadn't been on the line, he wouldn't have wasted a breath on someone as foolish as Kaia.

For the sake of his goal, he swallowed his distaste and didn't call her out. Instead, he played along and tried to convince her.

He typed out a long message. "Do you really think marrying lsaac is the best thing that could happen to your sister? She grew up far from the city's pace, never went to college, never stepped into elite circles. In a family like mine, she'd be out of her depth before the first dinner party. When the conversation turns to business or high society, she'll have nothing to say. And don't forget-Isaac may be in a wheelchair,but his mind is as sharp as ever. He's still the same strategist who dominated the business world. They're not equals, and being with him won't give Verena a shred of happiness."

Kaia didn't give a thought to Verena's well-being. Her only objective was to break the engagement.

She wished she could meet Bobby now and discuss the plans to stop this marriage. Still, she knew she had to mask her eagerness, play the part of the reluctant participant.

When his message went unanswered, Bobby recognized the ploy instantly. Kaia was dangling hesitation to draw him in. He pressed anyway, guiding her toward joining forces. "She claims a degree from a prestigious university, but it's a lie. People will talk. And if word gets around that the Willis family stooped to disgraceful tricks just to push her into the Bennett family, you won't just damage her reputation-you'll drag your whole family's name through the mud in Shoildon."

The barb landed exactly where Bobby intended. He'd offered Kaia a neat escape from her fake benevolence, and, just as he expected, her reply came back almost instantly.

"That's true. Verena's far too timid-marrying into the Bennett family would only see her pushed around.And because of her bold lies, the Willis name would be tied to rumors of using shady tactics. Worse still,your Bennett family would end up being the laughingstock." Bobby scanned her message, his lips curling in silent disdain. Fool. Who in their right mind would dare mock the Bennett family? Only moments ago she'd been insisting Verena would be lucky to marry into their ranks,and now she was parroting his words without hesitation. Her sudden agreement told him everything-Kaia was willing to join forces with him.

Another message came through before he could finish the thought. "Although I know this isn't right,for Verena's sake and for the Willis family's dignity, I'll work with you."

A humorless chuckle escaped Bobby. Kaia had a knack for wrapping her schemes in silk, making herself look noble while pretending her hands were clean.

If it weren't for his determination to keep Verena away from Isaac, he wouldn't waste a single word on her.

"You really are kind-hearted to a fault," Bobby replied, the sarcasm tucked neatly behind a smooth tone.

Kaia's cheeks warmed when she read it. Was that a compliment? Many had praised her before, but never someone of Bobby's rank. She'd heard he was proud, even dismissive, and rarely spoke well of anyone.Could he actually be interested in her?

Kaia lingered over the message, her thoughts tumbling ahead of her.

With Isaac confined to a wheelchair, Bobby stood as the Bennett family's brightest heir. His tone almost hinted at interest-didn't it? If Isaac couldn't be won, then Bobby would make an excellent prize instead.

Feeling a rush of satisfaction, she responded wit a feigned modesty, "I'm honored you'd say that. My concern is only for Verena-it's not about being kind. She's my sister, after all. If I won't think for her, who will?"

Bobby didn't even bother responding. What a ridiculous woman.

Switching back to business, Kaia asked, "So, where and when should we meet?"

Still undecided, Bobby sent a short reply, saying, "I'll let you know."

"Alright," Kaia answered, punctuating it with a cutesy emoji.

Without a glance at it, Bobby tossed the phone onto the table and headed straight for lsaac's study. A firm rap of his knuckles sounded against the heavy door.

Isaac sat behind his desk, eyes scanning a stack of documents. At the knock, he didn't even glance up."Come in," he said, his tone flat and detached.

The latch clicked, and the door swung open almost immediately.

Bobby strode in without hesitation, his voice brimming with urgency. "Isaac, did Verena tell you she graduated from Pine Hill University? Don't buy it-she's justa-"

"Get out," Isaac interjected, his voice like ice.

He knew exactly where Bobby was going with this and had no interest in hearing the rest.

The sharp dismissal threw Bobby off balance, but he tried to push through. "Isaac-"

One glance from Isaac stopped him cold.

The slight furrow of Isaac's brows and the glint in his eyes carried a silent, unmistakable warning.

Bobby had feared that look since they were kids. When Isaac got serious, backing down wasn't just smart-it was instinct.

Bobby swallowed his frustration and walked out without another word.

Isaac's gaze lingered on the door long after it shut, his expression unreadable.

Out in the hallway, Bobby replayed the exchange in his mind-lsaac's cold indifference, Kaia's manipulations. If Kaia could be that rotten and she was Verena's sister, then Verena couldn't be much better.

A low, derisive laugh slipped from Bobby's lips. The Willis sisters-one a hypocrite, the other a fraud.Disabled or not, Isaac deserved better than either of them.

Bobby was determined to stop this marriage from happening. Resolved, he chose a meeting spot, set the time, and sent Kaia a short message telling her to meet him tomorrow.

Morning came, and a gleaming red sports car rolled smoothly along the main road, its driver locked on the traffic ahead.

Halfway through a turn, a muffled ringtone buzzed from the inside pocket of his jacket.

Bobby took out his phone, checked the screen, and pressed it to his ear. "Mom, what's going on?"

"Don't 'what's going on' me," Danica retorted immediately. "Why aren't you at the office?"

There was no way Bobby was going to explain where he was really headed, so he kept his tone light."Taking a day off.Got something important to handle."

"Important?" she scoffed. "The only 'important' things you do are eat, drink, and waste time. Get yourself back to work."

Bobby's lips twisted in a dry smile. Same old script. In her eyes, he'd never been anything more than an idle boy who knew nothing but how to enjoy himself.

Telling Danica he was out digging for ways to sabotage the marriage alliance wasn't part of Bobby's plan,but the constant nagging scraped against his nerves.

His patience snapped. "I'm doing this for lsaac's future, whether you see it or not. Maybe you don't care,but I do. Verena isn't beautiful, she isn't properly educated, and she's completely unfit to be by his side.I don't know what scheme you've got in motion, but disabled or not, Isaac is still the Bennett family's eldest son. He deserves a wife who matches him in every way, not someone far beneath him. How can you ignore what he wants-or what's best for his life?"

The heat in Bobby's words was met with nothing but silence on the other end.
###Chapter 11 Only Such A Woman Was Worthy Of Isaac


A faint, bitter smile tugged at Danica's lips. Isaac was her son, and pretending she didn't care was impossible. But what good was caring when she understood, better than anyone, that the car accident had cost him more than just the use of his legs?

She closed her eyes, the doctor's words still echoing clearly in her mind-the day she found out the crash had also left Isaac with sexual dysfunction. The mix of helplessness and heartbreak had left her feeling empty inside.

News of Isaac's leg injury alone had already sent the media into a frenzy. If news of his sexual dysfunction ever spread, there was no predicting how cruel the rumors would get, or how fast public opinion could turn against their family.

Yes, she had two sons, but their strengths were painfully mismatched. Isaac had the talent to lead but couldn't produce an heir, stripping him of the right to inherit the company. Bobby had the ability to continue the bloodline but lacked the strategic mind for leadership.

That day, Danica vowed to herself that no one would ever learn about Isaac's condition. Determined to secure Isaac's future and keep the company stabe, she acted fast, arranging a marriage planned down to the finest detail. The Willis family was the match she chose.

If she followed Bobby's advice and sought a match with a lady from a powerful, equal-status family, she couldn't be certain they wouldn't one day use Isaac's secret against them. Women from those circles often came with sharp minds, deep schemes, and dangerous family backing. The Willis family, on the other hand,was easy to handle in both power and intellect.

And Verena, raised in a backward region, was either blissfully unaware of the manipulations of city life or too inexperienced to take part in them. A bride like that would be the easiest to control. Even if Verena eventually learned about Isãac's condition, Danica was confident she could ensure the girl stayed silent.

This was something Danica had no intention of letting Bobby find out. Letting out a slow sigh, she said, "You're still too young. Even if I explained, you wouldn't grasp the whole picture. Just concentrate on preparing yourself for the company. Isaac's issues are between him and me.Don't get yourself involved. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting to attend to."

Before Bobby could get a word in, she ended the call.

Glaring at the ended call, Bobby felt irritation churn inside him. Every conversation played out the same.She talked to him as if he were a child, leaving him feeling small and dismissed.

Frustration burned in Bobby's chest, and he spat out a curse before tossing his phone aside.

Unexpectedly, the phone struck the steering wheel, jolting it just enough to send the car swerving off course.

Suddenly, his heart jumped as he spotted a pedestrian right in his path. Bobby then jerked the wheel at the last second, barely avoiding them.

Right as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the car smashed into the roadside barrier.

The airbag burst open, but the sudden swerve sent his head hitting the window.

Bobby felt a warm trickle slide down his temple, and within moments, his vision blurred and faded to nothingness.

Shouts erupted as nearby pedestrians rushed toward the wreck. Someone was already dialing for an ambulance.

Verena, bored and out for a drive, slowed when she spotted several cars stopped ahead. She rolled her window down, curious about the commotion.

Suddenly, a voice rang out over the noise of traffic. "Is there a doctor here? Please! Someone's been in an accident!"

An accident? Verena's brow furrowed.

She unclipped her seatbelt in one swift motion and pushed through the gathering crowd. The wrecked vehicle was a red Ferrari. Through the cracked glass, Verena spotted the driver slumped unconscious behind the wheel.

Turning to the bystanders, she said firmly, "The front's taken a bad hit. There's a chance the fuel line's damaged, and it might catch fire. We have to get him out right now."

At her words, a few sturdy men immediately moved forward to assist.

"Lay him flat," Verena instructed. "And avoid putting pressure on his chest."

Once the man was clear of the car, she dropped to her knees beside him, unbuttoning his clothes layer by layer until she reached his undershirt.

She quickly lifted his eyelids, checked his breathing, and immediately started CPR.

When two complete cycles failed to get a response from the injured man, she continued without pause.

Her composure and precision mirrored the calm efficiency of a trained emergency responder, easing the fear of those watching.

Finally,faint movement flickered in Bobby's eyes.

Verena noticed it instantly, exhaling a quiet breath of relief. He was coming back.

In his haze, Bobby felt like he was stuck in a nightmare. Every heartbeat sent a fresh wave of pain through his skull. A calm, steady voice urged him toward awareness, cool in tone but strangely captivating. Curiosity pulled at him, and with effort, he pried his eyes open.

When Bobby's eyes finally opened, Verena gave him a warm smile. "Good, you're awake. How are you feeling? Any pain or discomfort?"

Her voice was calm and held a soft concern.

Bobby simply looked at her, blinking like he'd momentarily forgotten how to speak.

Thinking he was still groggy from regaining consciousness, Verena asked again,"Other than your head,do you feel pain anywhere else?" Her voice filled Bobby's ears, soft and reassuring, while his gaze stayed fixed on her.

One clear thought settled firmly in his mind-this was exactly what he imagined a perfect sister-in-law should be! Beautiful, elegant, kind, and offering just the right touch of care. Only such a woman was worthy of Isaac.

Verena noticed his unwavering gaze and assumed the accident had left him dazed.

The wail of an approaching siren broke the moment, and the ambulance pulled in beside them. Without drawing attention to herself, she eased back into the crowd.

Bobby wanted to call out, to ask her name, but the paramedics quickly lifted him onto a stretcher and into the ambulance.

From the sidewalk, Verena watched the vehicle speed away. A faint crease appeared between her brows.Was it just her imagination, or had that young man's face looked strangely familiar, like someone she'd seen before?


···

The moment the hospital called, Isaac ordered a driver to take him there without delay.

When he reached the ward, he found Bobby lounging on the bed, casually munching on a banana.

As soon as he spotted Isaac, Bobby hurriedly tossed the fruit aside. "Isaac, you're here."

Isaac didn't answer right away. Instead, he turned to his assistant. "Step outside for now. I'll call if I need you."

With a respectful nod, the assistant slipped out, closing the door behind him.

Rolling his wheelchair forward, Isaac stopped directly in front of Bobby. His eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the bandage wrapped around Bobby's head. "What happened?"

A pang of guilt flickered through Bobby. Ever since the accident that had taken their father's life and left Isaac in a wheelchair, the family had been overly cautious about driving. If Isaac knew he'd been in another accident,he'd worry for sure.Forcing a grin, Bobby waved it off. "It's nothing,just a scratch."

Isaac stayed quiet, his gaze locked on Bobby, unblinking.

Bobby could feel the truth clawing at his throat, and lying to Isaac was impossible.

Looking away, his eyes shifted uneasily. "I just accidentally crashed into the roadside barrier and ended up with a mnild concussion. Nothing serious, just a minor accident."
###Chapter 12 Show Her Respect


Isaac's voice rumbled low, carrying more frustration than he intended. "How many times do you plan on gambling with your life?"

Understanding the concern beneath the reprimand, Bobby dropped his gaze. "I'm sorry for making you worry. Mom's already had enough to bear... We shouldn't give her more to lose sleep over."

Earlier, during the ride to the hospital, Isaac had already pressed for details and confirmed Bobby's injuries weren't serious.

Since that severe car crash, Danica hadn't slept soundly once. He refused to pile more strain onto her.

"Get some rest. I'll arrange for someone to bring you home later," Isaac said evenly. "Leave Mom to me.I have work to deaI with at the company, so I'll head out now."

As Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair toward the door, Bobby's mind flashed back to the aftermath of the accident. His hand shot out, gripping Isaac's arm. "You absolutely can't marry Verena!"

Isaac's jaw tightened. He didn't want to hear it. Given Bobby's condition, he kept his irritation in check. "Let go," he instructed flatly.

The lack of reaction made Bobby's pulse jump. "I'm telling you the truth-Verena's no good. The Willis sisters are both trouble. One family doesn't raise two entirely different kinds of people. The ones who lie easily are the ones with the deepest schemes."

Recalling the elegant stranger he'd seen that day, Bobby leaned forward urgently. "Don't marry her.I already found the perfect woman for you! She's beautiful, kind... she saved me during the crash. Looked about your age too. From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one who could match you. Too bad I didn't get her contact before the medics hauled me off."

With unshakable certainty, Bobby finished his pitch. "Isaac, just go to the Willis family and call off the arrangement. You should marry that incredible woman instead. I'll track her down for you, no matter what. So,what do you say?"

To Isaac, the suggestion sounded nothing short of reckless-naive, even childish.

A faint chill settled in his eyes as he fixed Bobby with a steady stare. "Who taught you to speak about a woman like this behind her back?"

The weight of Isaac's glare robbed Bobby of his next words.

"The arrangement with the Willis family stands," Isaac said, voice cool and resolute. "And I don't want to hear another word of this nonsense."

Turning his wheelchair toward the door, he paused as though remembering something. Without fully facing Bobby, he added, "And for the record, Verena isn't the liar you make her out to be. She will be your sister-in-law, so you'll show her respect. In this family, we don't slander people in their absence."

Isaac's tone carried enough authority to leave Bobby momentarily frozen. Only when the door clicked shut did he release the breath he'd been holding.

Well, this was rich. What kind of game had Verena played to get lsaac on her side after meeting him only once?

The thought only fueled Bobby's resolve. No matter what it took, he would not allow Verena to marry Isaac.Now that he'd found someone who truly matched his brother, there was no way he'd back down.

···

Autumn's breath swept through the streets, scattering golden leaves until they lay thick over the pavement like a gilded carpet.

Muted colors dulled the scenery, giving the city a quiet, almost somber air.

Inside a warmly lit private dining room, two figures sat facing each other-a man and a woman separated by decades in age.

The man, nearing sixty, wore his years in the silver streaks along his temples and the faint creases at the corners of his eyes. Across from him sat Verena, poised and elegant, her hair flowing in a silky cascade down her back, her frame slender and composed.

A genial smile tugged at the man's lips. "Evelyn, ever since we said goodbyes to each other in Clokron, I've been trying to arrange another meeting. It seems this busy bee finally decided to grace me with her presence."

This was Wendell Branson, a distinguished professor at Acorith College of Medicine.

Their acquaintance began in Clokron, where they had collaborated on medical work.

Recognizing the teasing note in his voice, Verena lifted her cup, her expression warm."It's true-personal matters have kept me away. I owe you an apology, Professor Branson."

In those early Clokron days, Wendell's opinion of her had been far from favorable. Her aloof manner and quiet reserve had struck him as a sign of inexperience. But after the ordeal in Dragon Quarter, his view shifted completely. He no longer merely respected her-he admired her. Talented physicians of her age were exceedingly rare, and she was one of the few who stood out beyond doubt.

With a satisfied glint in his eyes, Wendell lifted his cup, letting it gently meet Verena's in a soft chime.

"Evelyn, we've known each other long enough for me to skip the pleasantries," Wendell said warmly."I'd like to extend an official invitation for you to deliver a lecture at our college."

The offer made Verena pause, her thoughts drifting for a moment. Shawna's death on her operating table still lingered like a shadow in her mind, and the occasional tremor in her hand reminded her it hadn't fully passed. Added to that, she'd been pouring her energy into analyzing Isaac's condition, leaving little room for anything else.

Verena's voice held a trace of regret as she responded, "Professor Branson, I truly appreciate the honor.But right now, I have a critical patient who needs my full attention. You understand that preparing for a lecture demands complete focus and precision. At present, I'm overwhelmed. Once this treatment is complete,if your invitation still stands, I'll gladly accept and give it my all.".

Wendell's smile deepened, his tone laced with good humor."Very well, I'll hold you to that. And if you dare refuse me then, I'll tell the whole world that the celebrated young doctor is making a fool of an old man." Verena gave a small nod, her voice steady. "You have my promise."

That answer seemed to genuinely please Wendell. "Alright then. Enjoy your meal. I'll step out for a moment."

Leaving the private room, Wendell made his way toward the restroom.

On the return walk, a voice rang out behind him.

He turned to see a young woman in a blue dress hurrying toward him, her face lighting up.

"Professor Branson, it really is you!" Kaia exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.

Wendell recognized her immediately as one of his most engaged students from Acorith College of Medicine.
"Kaia. I didn't expect to see you here. Are you having a meal here?"

Thinking of Bobby, she nodded with a shy smile. "Yes, I'm here with a friend."

She then asked, "And you, Professor? Are you dining alone?"

"I'm with..." Wendell hesitated for a couple of seconds, remembering Evelyn's preference for privacy.Guessing she wouldn't want to be mentioned, he said, "...someone I look up to."

Kaia's eyes widened. "Someone you look up to? That must be someone truly remarkable!"

Wendell smiled faintly. "Extremely. In fact, one of the most talented young professionas I've ever known."

Eager to continue the conversation and leave a good impression, Kaia quickly said, "That reminds me.I recently bought several medical books, and one of them was by my idol, Evelyn Rowe. Some of the terms and advanced theories are a bit beyond me. Would it be alright if I messaged you later for guidance?"
###Chapter 13 Young Role Model


When Kaia revealed that her idol was Evelyn-the same woman he was dining with-Wendell let out a warm laugh.

Kaia was always active in class. Her genuine love for medicine was impossible to miss, and that spark amused Wendell.

"You're welcome to ask me anything that confuses you,"said Wendell, leaning forward slightly. "Medicine isn't for the faint of heart, but your energy tells me you can handle the challenge. In fact, I've got something you'll want to hear."

Her eyes lit up instantly. "What's that?"

"Evelyn will be giving a lecture at our university this year. Only two hundred seats are available, but I can make sure one of them has your name on it."

The news hit her like a rush of adrenaline. "Are you serious? Evelyn's really coming here to speak?"

"Completely serious," Wendell replied with a certain smile.

Kaia couldn't hold back the excitement that burst out of her before she had the chance to stop it. "Professor Branson, this is incredible! Thank you, thank you so much! Meeting Evelyn has been my dream for as long as I can remember. She's the greatest physician alive in my book."

Wendell brushed her gratitude aside with a light wave. "Save your thanks. I can't keep my role model waiting.Goodbye."

Kaia gave a quick nod, though her curiosity flared. Who could possibly inspire a man like Wendell?

The question tugged at her until she found herself trailing after him at a careful distance.

She watched him disappear into a private dining room, and her gaze stretched toward the doorway.The figure inside was undeniably a woman, and shockingly young. Could someone like that truly be Wendell's 
role model?

Drawn by intrigue, Kaia edged closer to the door. The woman sat turned slightly away, long hair cascading down like a curtain that hid her face completely. No matter how she craned her neck, Kaia couldn't get a proper look.

"The food's gone," said Wendell from inside, his tone light with amusement.

Kaia had just started to lean in for a clearer look when the door shut in front of her. Curiosity lingered, and she still hoped to catch a glimpse of the woman Wendell looked up to. Even so, the thought didn't trouble her for long. What truly mattered now was that she was finally about to meet the person she had admired for years.

Despite the feminine ring of the name Evelyn, Kaia had always pictured the famed medical author as a man -tall, refined, and striking, with the kind of presence that turned heads.

Her mind still busy painting that picture, she pulled out her phone on the way to the restroom and began typing with excitement. "Two incredible reasons to celebrate! Just found out that my lifelong idol, Evelyn Rowe, will be giving a lecture at our school, and Professor Branson has reserved me a spot."

The post took off in seconds, her notifications filling with reactions.

"No way! Are you talking about the legendary surgical genius Evelyn Rowe?"

"Isn't the mysterious doctor supposed to be impossible to track down? Kaia, you're unbelievable! How did you find this out?"

"Evelyn's my inspiration too! I wish I'd gotten into Acorith College of Medicine. Please stream it for us!"

Kaia's chest swelled with pride as the comments poured in. Evelyn's name carried weight, and knowing she was part of that moment made her glow.

Elsewhere in the restaurant, Wendell leaned toward Verena with a grin. "You'll never guess who I bumped into outside-a female student who practically thinks you hung the moon."

"Is that so? Why didn't you bring her over to get my autograph?" Verena teased, one brow raised. Wendell let out a laugh as he gestured toward her. "You're so good at disappearing, I wouldn't even know where to find you if I brought someone by."

Verena took a slow sip of water, entirely unbothered.

After leaving the restroom, Kaia stepped into a different private room.

Smoothing her hair back, she offered a polite smile. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting,Mr.Bennett."

Across the table, Bobby sipped lazily through a straw, not even acknowledging her apology.

Unfazed, Kaia leaned forward slightly. "Speaking of waiting, what happened last time you invited me out?1was there for quite a while."

"Something came up," he said flatly, brushing it aside. "Let's just talk business."

Her brows knitted for a brief moment at his tone, but she quickly smoothed her expression. A man of his standing was bound to carry a certain detachment, she reasoned.

Forcing a pleasant nod, Kaia asked, "All right. What's your plan?"

Bobby said indifferently, "If I had one, we wouldn't be meeting here at all."

When it came to rival companies, Bobby could dream up strategies in his sleep. But taking down a woman who had no real defenses? That wasn't something he had an easy answer for.

Kaia's teeth caught her lower lip as she feigned uncertainty. "Let me think..."

From the moment Bobby brought up the idea of teaming up, Kaia had already begun shaping the perfect setup in her head. Her birthday celebration was just around the corner, and it would be the ideal stage. If Verena happened to get caught stealing something during such a grand affair, the consequences would be swift and irreversible. The Bennett family would never let a woman with a stain like that marry into their family, and the marriage alliance would unravel effortlessly.

Kaia had already pictured the scene where Verena would be publicly embarrassed, and the thought filled her with anticipation.From the beginning, she struggled with the idea of sharing her parents' attention with someone else. The moment she met Verena, she found her cold detachment infuriating. What made things worse was that Verena showed no interest in trying to win her over, not even pretending to be agreeable. That quiet defiance only deepened her resentment.

Still, if anything devious was to happen, she knew better than to let herself appear behind it.

Her brows drew together as she played at thinking hard. "Honestly, I've got nothing. Maybe I should ask a friend of mine. She's never short on ideas."

Bobby saw right through her little act, though he let it slide without a word.

"Fine," he said simply, his tone unreadable.

With phone in hand, Kaia tapped at the screen with exaggerated purpose.

A moment later, she gave a bright little gasp. "She wrote back already!"

The truth was, her inbox was as empty as her performance was rehearsed.

With mock seriousness, she glanced at the screen andthen announced, "She thinks we should set Verena up. Something like making it look like she stole something. The Bennett family wouldn't stomach that in a daughter-in-law, right? Especially when she's already lied to you about her education. That would give your family every reason to call off the arrangement."

Bobby leaned back, his gaze steady and deliberate as it rested on her.

That look chipped at her confidence, and she softened her voice. "You probably think this is too low, don't you?If you want, I'll tell her to forget it."

Bobby watched the way she acted, all sweetness and flair, and sneered inwardly. The whole performance struck him as nothing but a polished lie.

Yet his answer was plain. "If the result works in our favor, the rest doesn't matter."

Their discussion wrapped up quickly after that, and Bobby wasted no time coming up with a reason to leave. Once outside, he reached for his phone and dialed a familiar contact.

Slater answered without hesitation, "What's up?"

"I need an update," Bobby said. "Have you found anything about the woman who pulled me out of trouble that day?"
###Chapter 14 Keep Warm
Bobby's hopeful expression deflated when Slater let out a weary sigh on the other end of the line."It's not that I'm unwilling to help," Slater said, his tone edged with frustration. "But you're giving me nothing solid to work with. Long hair, pretty face, soft voice... you just described half the women walking around downtown.And without cameras in that area, I'd be hunting for a ghost."

A wave of disappointment washed over Bobby. He'd set his heart on finding that perfect sister-in-law,but with so little to go on, he knew Slater couldn't work miracles.

"Fine, fine. Dinner's on me another day. I'll handle it myself," Bobby muttered, forcing a casual tone before ending the call.

...

For the past few days, Verena had buried herself in Isaac's medical records, combing through every detail with painstaking care.

Countless late nights had passed before she finally pinpointed a treatment plan she believed could work.

Closing the thick medical journal in front of her, she pressed her fingers to her temple, easing the dull ache in her head. With her free hand, she reached for her phone on the desk and opened the chat with Isaac.

She typed a short message.e you free?"

When Isaac read the notification, he didn't answer right away.

Since he sent his medical records to her that day, she hadn't reached out once, and he hadn't chased after a reply.

He had only been waiting, quietly, for news he told himself would never come. In his mind, the promise she'd made was nothing more than a moment's kindness. Surely, after seeing the bleak truth in his records, she would have let the matter drop. Seeing her name light up his screen sent an odd, unshakable ripple through Isaac, one he couldn't quite put into words.

His reply came clipped and restrained. "Need anything?"

A brief silence had stretched before Verena finally saw his message. Even in two short words, there was a chill in his tone, a wall he kept firmly between them.

Leaning back in her chair, she tapped out a response. "I've gone over your case thoroughly these past days.Because of your legs' unique complications, surgery will be extremely difficult-and I'm not in the right state to perform it now. But I can begin treatment using traditional medicine."

His brow lifted at that. "Traditional medicine?"

The reaction didn't surprise her, but she guessed he might be uneasy. Her fingers moved quickly over the keys. "Don't worry. My strength lies more in traditional methods than in modern procedures. For your condition, stabilizing it with traditional treatment before surgery gives us the best chance. I'm confident I can achieve a 70% success rate for your recovery."

Isaac's gaze sharpened instantly.

Seventy percent?

That wasn't a casual claim. Doctors were often cautions when talking about success rate, and if she was stating seventy percent outright, it meant the odds of failure were slimmer than most would dare to promise.

Other doctors had never been so bold-most gave him no more than a 30% chance. Yet here was Verena,speaking of 70% as though it were within reach. The number filled him with a strange mix of disbelief and a flicker of hope.

Was she simply reckless, or did she truly have the skill to back it up?

His hands shook slightly as he typed his answer. "Alright. Tell me when you're free, and we'll meet."

Verena replied quickly, "Okay."
 
The send button had barely been tapped before something occurred to her. "By the way, I haven't joined a hospital since returning to the country. When it's time for the operation,the hospital..."

Isaac quickly responded, "That's nothing for you to worry about. I'll see to the arrangements."

At her desk, Verena shifted in her seat, the cool air from the cracked window brushing against her skin.Outside, night had fallen, and the wind whistled low andsharp through the opening.

Clad in only a thin knit sweater, she hugged herself against the chill before rising to latch the window shut.

The movement brought an uninvited memory-Isaac's arms wrapping gently around her from behind, his voice low and cautious. "Verena, it's freezing. Don't push me away... let me keep you warm."

A lighthearted warmth threaded through his words, softened by the hint of teasing.

Much had shifted since those days.

Once, he had managed to win a place in her heart, only for their paths to separate. Then came the accident -a single moment that reshaped the course of his life entirely.

If not for Shawna's critical condition pulling her back home, and the headlines about him flashing across her screen, she might never have learned that his vanishing act had been the aftermath of a devastating car crash.

With that in mind, Verena let her fingers dance over the screen, typing with a sly curve to her lips. "My fiance, the air's turning cold. Keep yourself warm, especially those legs. Use gentle heat therapy, massage them often,keep the muscles working. Don't make me fret over you."

The message reached Isaac mid-thought. His grip faltered, and the pen slipped from his hand, clattering onto the desk before rolling to the floor.

After the accident, his family had cocooned him in silence, skirting around the subject of his injury. Even his last personal doctor, following Danica's orders, avoided speaking the wordin his presence, careful never to graze that raw nerve. The more delicately they tiptoed, the more he felt like something fragile-an artifact too brittle to endure a single crack. But Verena didn't flinch from it. She spoke plainly, giving him steps to care for himself as if nothing set him apart. With her, he felt like any other man. And yet... was she growing a little too at ease with calling him her fiance?

Isaac's gaze darkened slightly, his eyes fixed on the single word fiance as if trying to read between its letters.

"Alright. I'll keep that in mind."

A faint thought tugged at him-had he been too dlistant with her? His thumb moved almost on its own,pressing out another line. "Make sure you stay warm too."

Verena had stepped into the shower after sending the last message. She hadn't expected anything more from him. Yet, stepping out with damp hair and steam curling around her, she spotted two unread messages lighting up her phone-both from Isaac.

The corners of her mouth lifted as she read them, pulling forth a memory of him from before the accident stole pieces of who he was.

People always described Isaac as aloof, untouchable-a man who kept the world at arm's length. But with her, he'd been almost boyishly compliant.

If she was upset, he'd bow his head without hesitation, murmuring, "Alright. I get it. I won't make you upset again."

Shaking herself back into the present, Verena reminded herself of what truly mattered now. His legs came first. Everything else could wait its turn.

...

The evening of Kaia's birthday arrived.

The Willis Villa gleamed under layers of opulent decoration, every corner dressed for grandeur.Down in the sprawling room, a swirl of young socialites filled the space, their laughter and chatter weaving through the music. From the third floor, the sound of laughter floated up in bursts, but Verena ignored it entirely. Slipping into fresh clothes, she left through the villa's side door, heading for the garage.

The sleek black vehicle waiting there was courtesy of Alec.

Whatever existed between Alec and Laura toward her, affection wasn't part of it.

Still, Alec's stance was different from Laura's-where Laura thrived on taking from her, Alec's actions were steeped more in guilt than malice.

Moments later, the black vehicle eased through the villa gates and onto the road.

Meanwhile, a silver Cayenne approached from the opposite direction, Bobby at the wheel.

He wouldn't have bothered showing up for Kaia's birthday if it weren't for the need to block any potential alliance between the two families.

His grip on the steering wheel was relaxed, his pace unhurried.

A passing car caught his attention. At first, it was just a glance-until the half-lowered window revealed the face of a stunning woman at the wheel. His pulse jumped. That face...

"Hey!" Bobby called out, jerking the wheel in a sudden turn before flooring the accelerator to close the distance.

The pursuit didn't go unnoticed. Verena's brows drew together-she couldn't recall crossing anyone who'd have reason to follow her.

A glance at the rearview mirror showed the silver vehicle closing in, irritating her instantly.

With a flick of her wrist, she cut the wheel sharply, sending the black car veering into a new route without hesitation.

###Chapter 15 Failed Plan
The villa district wasn't packed with cars, but the streets split off in every direction.

Verena pressed harder on the accelerator and guided the wheel through turn after turn.

Bobby kept his eyes on her car as it slipped smoothly through each curve. He could tell she'd already spotted him.

She was almost gone from view. His foot hovered over the gas, but he hesitated. That severe crash had scarred their family, and he couldn't risk repeating the past. Still, if he stayed cautious,the perfect woman for his brother would get away.

That tug-of-war in his head cost him precious seconds. By the time he realized it, her car had vanished, and he'd steered straight onto a blocked-off road under construction.

"Damn it!" he exclaimed.

Over at Willis Villa, the party buzzed with chatter.

"Kaia, the clock's ticking. Shouldn't you already be up there kicking off the party?"

"Yeah, didn't you promise you'd choose a partner for the opening dance once things got started? We're dying to find out who the mystery man is."

Kaia's friends' voices carried a playful urgency.

She knew she should be on stage, but Bobby still hadn't shown up. She wanted everyone to see that he'd made the effort to come for her birthday.

Keeping her tone light, she said, "Just a little longer. There's one guest I'm still waiting for."

Her friends exchanged curious glances. "Who could possibly be that important?"

A warm flush spread across Kaia's cheeks. One of them grinned knowingly. "Oh, I see that blush. Don't tell me this 'guest' is more than just a casual acquaintance?"

Inside, Kaia's heart agreed, but she kept her smile composed.

She leaned closer to the young woman who just spoke and deliberately said in a hushed but teasing voice,"Don't spread such rumors. That guest is Bobby Bennett."

The words hung in the air for a beat before gasps and raised brows broke the quiet.

"Seriously? Bobby's actually coming?"

"Wait,did I hear you right? Bobby never shows up to birthday parties unless it's for Slater."

"Kaia, just spill it. What's going on between you two?"

The cluster of women watched her with eager eyes, their curiosity as obvious as their envy.

In her mind, Kaia heard Bobby's voice again, praising her for her kindness. She had never been certain about his feelings, but the way her friends were talking planted a hopeful thought.

Men liked gentle, genuine women. Bobby wasn't one to fake his words. That had to mean something...right?

Her face warmed, the heat creeping into her cheeks.

Thirty minutes had slipped by, yet there was still no sign of Bobby anywhere.

The same women who had envied her earlier now leaned close to whisper.

"Strange. She was so sure Bobby wouuld be here, but it's been forever."

"Do you think he ditched her?"

"Shh, lower your voice before she hears."

Kaia was standing close enough to catch every word. The anticipation she'd carried all evening curled into embarrassment.

Her fingers tightened around her glass. Pushing down the sting, she moved gracefully from guest to guest, raising her glass with the same practiced smile.

One gulp drained her wine. With her smile stilI fixed, she slipped onto the balcony and pulled out her phone.

Meanwhile, Bobby remained stranded on that half-finished road.

The place was nearly deserted, and the darkness only made it harder to find his way.

Bobby finally called for someone to pick him up. But before he could even pocket his phone, it lit up with another call.

Before Bobby could even say hello, an urgent voice rushed through the line. "Mr. Bennett, the party's starting any minute. When can we expect you?"

Getting the chance to meet the woman he thought could be the perfect sister-in-law should have been a win, yet he'd ended up chasing her straight onto a road closed for repairs. Losing sight of her and winding up lost had already soured his mood, and now Kaia's call pressed him for answers.

"I won't be making it," he said sharply. "If you still want to move ahead with the plan against Verena,have Slater take over. Call him yourself."

To anyone looking in from the outside, Bobby and Slater were nearly inseparable. So when Bobby had agreed to show up for Kaia's birthday, Slater had casually decided to go too.

Her stomach dropped at his words. Was he really bailing? After she'd told everyone he was coming? The thought of facing the guests now made her skin prickle.

Kaia fought to keep her temper in check and spoke in a calm tone. "Mr. Bennett, is there something pressing that's holding you up? We made an agreement to work side by side, yet the plan hasn't even begun and now you're pulling away?"

Rather than explain, Bobby ended the call without another word, unwilling to waste more time.

The flat tone on the line made Kaia's grip on her phone tighten. Heat rose to her face and her breathing grew uneven, the sting of frustration sharp in her chest.

But she forced herself to remember the bigger picture-Verena's wedding to Isaac needed to be stopped, and that mattered more than her pride right now.

Pushing the anger down, she pulled up Slater's contact and hit call.

The call went through without delay, and Kaia spoke without preamble. "Hi, Slater, this is Kaia. Are you around?"

In truth, his familiarity with her was minimal. Most of what he knew came from Bobby, and nothing in those accounts made her seem like someone he could fully trust.

Slater had never approved of Kaia, yet politeness kept his tone steady as he said, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis.My grandfather suddenly fell ill, and I need to stay with himn. I can't leave right now, but I'll make sure someone delivers a gift on my behalf."

Normally, receiving a gift from someone of Slater's influence would have been enough to make Kaia's evening. Tonight, however, was about more than her birthday-it was the perfect chance to deal with Verena, and his absence was a blow.

"Alright, I understand," she replied, though the stiffness in her voice betrayed her disappointment.

The call ended, and her jaw tightened. So muchfor help-at the moment she needed allies the most, they all had somewhere else to be. Looked like she'd have to handle this herself.

Taking the stairs two at a time, she headed for the last room at the far end of the third-floor hall.

Her knuckles rapped against the door, and her voice carried through it. "Verena, it's me. The party's started -come downstairs."

Not a single word came back to her.

A twinge of unease crept in. She twisted the handle and stepped inside.

The quiet inside the room felt heavy. She called Verena's name again as she crossed the space, but the silence stayed unbroken.

Though part of her already suspected the truth, she moved methodically, unwilling to overlook even the smallest hiding place. The bathroom was empty. So was the wardrobe. Not a single sign of anyone.

Hands curling into fists, she turned to leave, spotting a servant walking past in the corridor.

"Have you seen Verena?" she asked sharply.

The servant shook her head. "No, Miss.I haven't."

Kaia's temper flared. Not seen Verena? As if she could simply vanish without notice.

Kaia wondered when Verena had left and how she had missed it.
###Chapter 16 Stop Bothering Me


"Alright. Go finish your work," Kaia said, her words clipped and cold.

The moment the servant disappeared down the hall, her restraint shattered. Fists tightening in midair, she swept the stack of files off Verena's desk without even glancing at them, the papers scattering as she stormed out.

She returned to the ground floor living room still wearing the same hard expression.

Laura had just wrapped up chatting with a group of guests when she spotted Kaia's look. Concern etched her face as she crossed the room.

Her hand rested lightly on Kaia's cheek. "Sweetheart, is something bothering you? You don't seem like yourself.Are you alright?"

It wasn't sickness draining the color from Kaia's face-it was the heat of her anger.

Her teeth pressed into her lower lip as she forced the emotion down, but her eyes began to glisten,reddening until they looked ready to spill over.

Just as expected, the sight of her in that state threw Laura off balance. "Honey, what happened? Did someone give you trouble? Just say the word and I'll take care of it."

A small sniffle escaped as Kaia answered in a trembling voice, "No one's bullying me, Mom. I'm just... really disappointed."

"Disappointed?" Laura asked, brows knitting. "About what?"

Drawing in a steadying breath, Kaia lowered her voice."It's my eighteenth birthday. I was so happy, because for the first time, my friends and the whole family were here to celebrate. I went upstairs to bring Verena down so we could cut the cake together, but-"
 
The rest was carried away by a tear that finally broke free. Laura's mouth tightened. "So? She refused to come?"

Kaia's head moved slowly from side to side. "I knocked, but no one answered. When I opened the door... she wasn't even there."

Laura's frown grew more pronounced, and Kaia pressed her teeth into her lip, doing her best to mask the quiet hint of triumph tugging at her mouth. Her tone turned soft and uncertain. "It's my eighteenth birthday,a huge milestone for me, bout Verena didn't even show up. Mom... do you think she can't stand me? Did I mess up so badly she's going out of her way to stay away?"

Tears slid down her cheeks, completing the picture of wounded innocence.

The sight made Laura's heart ache, and she pulled Kaia into her arms.

"No, sweetheart, of course not. You're wonderful-anyone would like you. This isn't about you. It's Verena's fault. She grew up in a backwater place and still hasn't adjusted to city life."

Even in their quiet corner, a few guests glanced over at the scene.

Laura's hand stroked Kaia's shoulder. "Don't cry, people are watching. Go and mingle with the guests. I'll talk to Verena myself."

With a quick dab at her eyes, Kaia nodded. "Alright, Mom. But please don't be too hard on her. Maybe...maybe something more important came up."

That hint of generosity softened Laura's expression, though it sharpened her annoyance toward Verena.

Laura's tone sharpened with irritation as she spoke. "She's got nothing going on all day,so what could possibly matter more than showing up for your eighteenth birthday?"

Kaia caught the look on Laura's face and knew Verena was in fora scolding. The sting from her earlier setback began to fade.

After a few more soft words between them, Kaia straightened her posture and returned to the party, her smile back in place.

Once she was gone, Laura stepped outside to the quiet of the backyard, pulling her phone from her pocket to make a call.

Out on the road, Verena glanced at her ringing phone, the caller ID confirming exactly what conversation was waiting for her.

The moment Verena picked up, Laura's voice came fast and sharp. "Where are you? It's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Why aren't you here? Get back right now!"

With one hand steady on the wheel, Verena gave a quiet, amused chuckle. "Can you explain why I'm supposed to care about Kaia's birthday party?"

That answer nearly made Laura snap-Verena had never been one to obey her.

"She's your sister! How can you act like it has nothing to do with you? It's not often we're all together for Kaia's birthday, and you just slipped away like it didn't matter. What's going on with you? Do you really need a personal invitation before you'll bother to come?"

Verena let out a cold, disdainful scoff at that. So this was what Laura called a family celebration? The truth was laughable. All Laura wanted was to parade her around like some prized token-to show everyone that the Willis family had opened their arms to the girl raised far from privilege. That kind of story, if told the right way,would polish the family name like nothing else.

Exposing Laura's motives wasn't worth the effort.

A sharp laugh escaped Verena's lips before she spoke. "So now you remember me because it's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Funny, because where were you when it was mine? Where was the family then? Or did I stop counting as family back then?"

Laura went quiet. A flicker of guilt pricked at her, but it was gone almost as quickly as it came.

Verena had a clear sense of what was running through Laura's mind, but she also knew that any flicker of guilt would fade quickly, especially with Kaia and Luka nearby, soaking up all her affection.

Verena's voice turned cold. "I told you before, stop bothering me. What I said before was a threat,and I mean it. Keep pestering me over these petty things, and I'Il make sure you don't get anything you're after." Verena ended the call without waiting for a reply.

Verena's words left Laura frozen, too shocked to form a response. It wasn't until the dull,mechanical tone buzzed in her ear that the full weight of Verena's rudeness hit her. That tone, that attitude-who did she think she was, speaking to her like that?

Laura's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white, her face clouded with fury. I it weren't for the party already underway and guests mingling throughout the place, she would've ordered someone to haul Verena back for a proper scolding.

...

Elsewhere, barely a mninute after ending the call, Verena's phone lit up again.

Expecting Laura to continue her tirade, she glanced at the screen and saw a different name-Barrie Lyons,a former patient.

She answered without hesitation, "Mr. Lyons, what's going on?"

The reply came in an older, slightly hoarse voice. "Dr. Willis, are you still overseas?"

"I'm not," Verena responded plainly. "I'm back. In Shoildon, actually."

"That's excellent news. I'm in Shoildon too," Barrie replied, the relief clear in his tone.

He wasted no time getting to the point. "The old problem with my right leg started acting up again. The pain hit so hard earlier I almost lost consciousness. I had a doctor come to the house, but nothing he did made a difference. I've finished the medicaton you prescribed. If it's not too much trouble, would you be able to come by?"

Verena had no real obligations that evening. She simply needed to breathe away from the suffocating atmosphere of the Willis Villa. So availability wasn't the problem. And when it came to her own patients, she never hesitated-no matter the hour, she always made it a priority to reach them as soon as possible.

"Of course," she said. "Send me your address, and I'll head over now."

Barrie dictated the location, and Verena keyed it into her GPS.

Her foot pressed harder on the gas, the car picking up speed.
###Chapter 17 Beautiful Yet Untouchable


Less than an hour later, Verena pulled up outside a sprawling private estate where a middle-aged man stood waiting at the gate.

The moment she stepped out, the man walked briskly toward her. "You must be Dr. Willis, right?"

When she nodded to confirm it, he said warmly, gesturing for her to follow, "Great, this way."

They moved through the corridors and entered a room lined with gleaming display cases, each one filled with medals and awards. An elderly man lay propped on a bed, sweat beading his forehead as a younger man helped him sip water.

"Bring the medical kit-now," Barrie instructed as soon as he spotted Verena.

His gaze shifted to the younger man. "Slater, get a chair for Dr. Willis."

Slater grabbed a chair without delay, but when he turned around and was about to gesture for Dr. Willis to sit, he froze, his attention caught entirely by the woman before him.

The first thing that stuck him was how effortlessly beautiful she was-delicate features framed by an air of quiet confidence. The second was disbelief. Could this poised young woman really be the famed Dr. Willis his grandfather often praised?

He gave a quick blink, forcing himself back to the moment before offering her a courteous smile. "Please,Dr. Willis, take this seat."

"Thank you," Verena replied, her tone warm as she accepted.

The smile she gave him felt like the first breath of spring air after a long winter.

A simple curve of her lips shouldn't have left an impression, yet it stirred something faint in his chest.

While he steadied himself, theservants entered with the prepared medical instruments. Verena reached for a pair of scissors, glancing at Barrie. "I'll need to cut the fabric above your knee to examine the injury "Do whatever you must," Barrie said firmly, not flinching despite the sweat sliding down his temple.

With a swift and steady motion, she sliced the trouser leg cleanly up to the thigh, her movements practiced and precise.

The damage beneath was impossible to miss-skin swollen tight, bruises blooming around the wound.

It wwas the same leg that had carried a bullet wound from Barrie's youth, a reminder of the battle that left him with a burden he would never fully escape.

The injury had happened years back, but the pain never truly left him. As the seasons shifted from autumn to winter, it flared with such intensity that sleep became a rare luxury, whether it was day or night.

Gasps rippled through the room the moment everyone caught sight of the swollen knee.

Concern etched itself across Slater's face as his gaze lingered on the injury.

Without letting her expression shift, Verena leaned closer for a precise look. "I'm going to begin with the treatment. It might sting, so try to hold still."

A dry chuckle escaped Barrie. "I've endured worse in my time. This willbe nothing."

"You still carry the grit of a soldier, Mr. Lyons," Verena replied, the praise genuine in her tone.

Their history as doctor and patient meant Barrie knew what kind of tools she might need and had them prepared.

Though the world knew her for her surgical skill, her deepest strength lay in the art of traditional medicine.

One of the driving forces behind her studies in Clokron had been the desire to unite the best of both traditional and modern medicine, giving her patients every advantage in recovery.

From the medical bag, she drew out an assortment of silver needles, each chosen for a specific point, and placed them with flawless precision.

From the corner, Slater watched the confident rhythm of her hands, the quiet focus in her eyes,and couldn't help but be struck by how capable she seemed.

Once the final needle was in place, Barrie's face had turned ashen, and the veins along his forehead throbbed visibly beneath his skin.

"My grandfather looks like he needs water," Slater said, his brow knitting in worry.

Still jotting notes onto a prescription pad, Verena responded flatly, "That won't be necessary. This reaction is expected. He'll be fine in a moment."

Her words proved true. Within minutes, the strain in Barrie's face eased, color returned, and the chill in his leg was replaced by a spreading warmth.

"Only you can take away this pain, Dr. Willis," Barrie remarked, relief clear in his voice.

Slater exhaled slowly, the tension leaving his shoulders, though amazement still lingered.

His eyes shifted to Verena, who sat with her head gently bowed, completely focused on jotting down the prescription. A few loose strands framed her face, and there was something quietly captivating in the way she moved. It made it nearly impossible to pull his gaze away.

Many women had caught Slater's eye before, yet none carried the kind of presence Verena did. What he felt wasn't the fleeting thrill of attraction, but something sharper, weightier-an awareness that she stood on a level far above his reach.

It wasn't the pull of romance; it was the quiet reverence a person might feel when looking at the moon,knowing it was beautiful yet untouchable.

Twenty minutes passed before Verena began removing the silver needles from Barrie's leg with practiced care.

"The medicine's ready," she said, her tone calm but deliberate. "This time, Mr. Lyons, you need to stick to the plan. Your condition's been dragged out far too long. We might not be able to heal it completely, but we can take most of the pain away. Take the medicine, rest properly, and in this weather-keep warm at all times." Barrie, who once commanded the room like a general, now looked almost shy.

"Thank you, Dr. Willis. I'll take your advice seriously this time," he said with a sheepish chuckle.

The change in him caught Slater off guard. He wasn't used to seeing his grandfather defer to anyone.

Seeing Barrie's sheepish look, Verena offered a light smile. "It's getting late. I should be going."

Just as she was getting ready to leave, Barrie turned to Slater and spoke without hesitation."Make sure you settle the payment with Dr. Willis."

She shook her head, still smiling. "There's no fee. I didn't provide the medicine or the tools. Just spent some time on the treatment. Besides, after everything you've done for our country,helping you is an honor."

A man like Barrie, a soldier who had fought and bled for his country, was someone she held in the highest regard.

Her words seemed to warm him even more.

"You're young, yet your skills are outstanding, and your manner is even better," he said with genuine admiration.

Then his eyes shifted toward Slater, mischief creeping into his voice. "If my grandson were as capable as you, I'd have encouraged him to try to win you over."

Slater's cheeks flushed the moment he heard those words. "Come on, Grandpa, where did that even come from?"

Used to handling moments like this with grace, Verena offered a steady, courteous reply. "Your grandson is devoted and respectful. I'm sure the woman he marries will be someone truly special."

Barrie had already braced himself for her refusal to give his grandson a chance, but even so, a faint sense of regret settled in. A granddaughter-in-law like her was simply out of reach.

###Chapter 18 Ideal Sister-In-Law VS Traditional Medicine Doctor


After Verena walked out, Slater's curiosity got the better of him. He turned to his grandfather and asked,"Grandpa, this Dr. Willis seems incredible. Who exactly is she?"

Instead of answering directly, Barrie posed his own question. "When you first laid eyes on her, did it cross your mind that someone so young might not be capable?"

Slater gave an awkward scratch to his nose but admitted with a nod that he had thought so.

A proud smile spread across Barrie's face as his eyes lit up. "She's the surgeon who gave me my new heart in Clokron."

Shock spread across Slater's face. "You mean she really did that?"

Remembering how deftly Verena had handled the traditional treatment earlier, Slater tilted his head. "But isn't she a traditional medicine doctor? How could she manage a heart transplant?"

Barrie laughed softly and spoke with weight in his voice. "She's a rare talent."

It wasn't often that Slater heard such praise from his grandfather. The more he thought about it, the more respect he felt for the striking Dr.Willis.

As the night wore on, Slater applied medicine to Barrie's wound. Once the treatment was finished and his grandfather had drifted into sleep, he stepped quietly from the room.

That was when his phone buzzed with a call from Bobby.

Without any small talk, Bobby asked, "Why weren't you at Kaia's birthday party tonight either?"

He had just arrived home and called Kaia, planning to check on the outcome of the night. Instead, she told him that neither he nor Slater had been there, and worse, Verena had been absent too, which meant the plan had fallen apart.

Kaia's voice trembled over theline, carrying the sound of hurt and frustration. Bobby wasn't overly concerned about the failed attempt. Since Verena wasn't marrying Isaac immediately,there would be other chances to make sure the wedding never happened. What he truly wanted to know at that moment was why Slater had stayed away.

Once Bobby gave Kaia a few words of comfort, he ended the call and immediately rang Slater.

As he walked back to his room, Slater explained why he hadn't shown up at the party. "I was on my way out the door when my grandfather started feeling worse again. I couldn't leave him like that, so I stayed with him instead."

Knowing the seriousness of the old man's health, Bobby's voice grew concerned right away. "How is he doing now?"

Slater thought of the calm, dignified face before answering, "Relax, an incredible doctor stopped by and used a special kind of traditional treatment. He's doing fine now."

Relief washed over Bobby's voice. "Glad to hear that."

Only then did Slater realize something about Bobby's earlier question. "Hold on. You asked me why I weren't at Kaia's party EITHER. Does that mean you weren't there either?"

A long sigh came through the phone. "Don't get me started," Bobby retorted. "On my way to the WVillis Villa,I ran into the woman I consider my ideal sister-in-law, but I ended up losing track of her."

That statement left Slater confused. "Your ideal sister-in-law? I thought you couldn't stand Verena. Since when did she become your ideal sister-in-law?"

A short, dismissive scoff came from Bobby. "I'm not talking about that liar."

His thoughts drifted back to the day of his car accident. In his hazy state on the ground, he had opened his eyes to see a striking face and heard a soft, reassuring voice.

"I mean the gorgeous woman who pulled me out of that wreck,", he continued.

The memory of that moment and what happened tonight had him grinning like a man hopelessly smitten."You know what happened? She drove past me tonight with her hair down, and for a second,I saw her through the half-lowered window. She looked incredible. Even as she broke away from my pursuit, all I could think was that I'd never seen anyone so effortlessly cool. If you'd been there, you would've felt the same.There's something about her that just pulls you in. She's stunning. That's exactly why I keep saying she's perfect to be my sister-in-law!"

By the end, his tone brimmed with enthusiasm, pride spilling into his words as though she were already part of his family and he was boasting to his closest friend.

Slater narrowed his eyes in doubt. "That sounds over the top. Is she really as impressive as you claim?"

Thinking of the woman who had treated his grandfather, Slater let out a laugh before Bobby could reply.With a hint of rivalry in his tone, he said, "That woman you keep calling your ideal sister-in-law doesn't even come close to the traditional medicine doctor I met tonight. She's thoughtful, well-spoken, and carries herself with real grace. Her skills are no joke-just a few needles and some herbs, and my grandfather was finally able to rest. And honestly, she's beautiful too."

Bobby gave a dismissive snort. "No way. The woman I've set my sights on is far more beautiful. You must not have seen many real beauties to think otherwise."

A sly grin crept into his voice as he teased, "Slater, has your sense of beauty gone downhill lately?"

The moment his taste was mocked, Slater responded instantly, "Look who's talking. I'm willing to bet that your so-called ideal sister-in-law is just a plain-looking nobody."

Bobby's eyes went wide as he practically yelled into the phone. "Don't you dare insult my ideal sister-in-law!"

Slater kept pushing. "Who even is your sister-in-law? She doesn't know you, yet you're bold enough to claim her as your family."

The heat rose in Bobby's face, turning it a deep red, and his neck stiffened as he argued back without holding anything in.

Neither willing to back down, the two young men, barely past their teens, bickered like schoolboys until the argument fizzled out without a winner. Verena had spent the night studying Isaac's condition, working until nearly dawn before finally falling asleep.By the time she opened her eyes again, the clock was edging toward noon.

Her phone lay beside her pillow, and she picked it up to send a message to lsaac.

"Do you have time later today? I'd like to sit down with you and talk through the specifics of your treatment."

Isaac was on his way to a press conference when her message came through.

Reading her words made him pause for a moment, his mind turning to the thought of surgery.Other doctors weren't positive about his leg condition. He wondered if going under the knife was even possible.

A swirl of emotions moved through Isaac, tinged with unease, yet the pull of anticipation was impossible to ignore. More than anything, he wanted to walk again and return to living as he once had.

Dropping his gaze, Isaac let his long thumb tap across the keyboard. "I'm available. If it works for you, we can meet right now."

When Verena read his reply, she could clearly see the depth of his desire to regain the use of his legs.

She answered simply, "Of course."

Not long after she sent her message, Isaac followed up with a list of restaurants offering various cuisines.

Verena picked one from the list and responded, "See you soon."

Once the message was sent, she set her phone aside and climbed out of bed to freshen up.

Isaac pocketed his phone and gave the driver a clear order. "Take us back and drive straight to Milo's Gourmet."

With a respectful nod, the driver replied, "Yes." He then steered the car into a U-turn at the intersection.

Though uncertain, the assistant seated up front still spoke up. "Mr. Bennett, should we just forget about the press conference..." Isaac's tone remained light. "There are plenty of people handling it. They don't need me there just for appearances."


What he said was the truth. His attendance at the event served no real purpose beyond ceremony.
###Chapter 19 Familiarity


The past weeks had drained Isaac, leaving him running on barely four hours of sleep from the night before.Events like this hardly seemed worth his time.

Reading his mood, the assistant simply replied, "Understood. I'll let them know."

Roughly an hour later, Verena's car rolled up to the venue.

The restaurant radiated charm-every corner was dressed in elegance, with subtle touches of romance that softened the air.

A waiter greeted her at the entrance and led her toward a secluded private room.

Pausing at the door, he knocked, and then pushed it open with a polite announcement."Mr. Bennett,your guest has arrived."

Verena stepped inside, and the door closed quietly behind her.

From his wheelchair, Isaac's gaze followed her every step.

Her white dress brushed her ankles, a camel shawl resting gently on her shoulders, while her hair spilled down her back likea glossy waterfall.

There were no designer tags or ostentatious brands on her, yet she carried herself with a presence that made society's most polished women seem ordinary. The old saying came to mind-true elegance was born from beauty, figure, and poise. She possessed all three in abundance.

For the briefest moment, something familiar stirred in Isaac's mind... but before he could pin it down, the feeling slipped away.

Seeing Isaac's gaze fixed on her, Verena smiled warmly and greeted him, "Mr. Bennett, it's been a while."

That smile of hers hit him harder than expected, and for a fleeting second, Isaac felt like a thief caught in the act of staring. Inclining his head, he said evenly, "Please, take a seat, Miss Willis."

Verena didn't bother with pleasantries. She sat down and spoke with clarity. "I've reviewed every detaii of your medical records. It's not as severe as it seems. Just set a date, and we can start treatment."

His fingers tightened slightly on the armrest before he asked, "You're the first doctor to sound this certain.Are you absolutely sure?"

She could tell his doubt wasn't directed at her, but at the disappointment he'd endured. Hope was a fragile thing for someone who had been let down too many times.

Leaning forward, she laced her fingers beneath her chin and met his eyes. "You told me you'd trust me. So why hesitate now?"

Her voice carried a gentle lilt, almost coaxing.

Isaac blinked, his gaze sliding away as though her eyes were too much to hold.

Her lips curved in amusement. "What's wrong? Do you truly not believe me?"

His head lifted instinctively, only to find her watching him with a brightness that seemed to outshine the rest of the room. He turned away almost instantly.

After a short pause, his voice dropped to a quiet, "Sorry."

Something about his own reaction unsettled him. Other women never rattled his composure, yet around Verena, the steady ground he stood on felt uncertain-like he was in unfamiliar territory with no map to guide him.

Catching the way he avoided her gaze, Verena remained silent for a moment, and then let out a soft,playful laugh.

Isaac's eyes lifted toward her, catching the curve of her smile.

A faint crease formed between his brows. "You..."

"What's with the solemn face, Mr. Bennett?" she asked, her tone light. The sound of her laughter held an unfamiliar warmth, so unlike her usual composed reserve, carrying an ease that felt almost inviting.

Realizing she was poking fun at him, Isaac's lips curved in a faint, reluctant smile.

When the waiter arrived with their food, the mood shifted into something more casual, their conversation flowing lightly.

Isaac kept his answers brief, letting Verena guide most of the exchange.

They hadn't gotten far when the waiter, stepping back after setting down a plate, accidentally brushed the edge of the thin blanket over Isaac's knees with the walkie-talkie clipped to his pocket, sending it tumbling to the floor.

The man immediately murmured an apology, but Verena was already on her feet. "Don't worry about it, 1'lI handle it," she said quickly.

Isaac's gaze followed her as she bent to retrieve it and walked toward him, a subtle frown crossing his face.

Knowing Isaac cared about cleanliness, Verena had stopped the waiter's intention to pick up the blanket and put it back on his legs.

She shook out the blanket neatly and set it on the chair beside him, her movements smooth and deliberate.

Isaac had just opened his mouth to refuse when Verena knelt gracefully at his side.

Without a word, she slipped the shaw from her shoulders and spread it carefully across his legs,her fingertips lingering as she smoothed the fabric, grazing his thighs in fleeting touches.

He, however, felt no sensation in his legs-only a strange mix of unease and familiarity as he studied her closeness. Why did it feelas though this level of tenderness belonged to a deeper bond? Was it merely because she was his future wife?

"This blanket is far too thin. Make sure you swap it for something warmer when you're home," Verena murmured.

When he looked up again, she was back in her seat, the table between them once more. His eyes drifted toward her hands, and his voice came quietly. "Thanks."

Her gaze swept over him, a faint crease forming on her brow. "Why's your face suddenly flushed?"

That made him blink, caught off guard.

She ddn't look away, noting the warm tint across his cheeks and the slight haze clouding his eyes.

Rising, Verena stepped to his side, gently pushing back his hair to rest her palm against his forehead.

As she leaned in to check his temperature, her body closed the space between them.

Isaac's spine went rigid as a faint, soothing fragrance drifted into his senses, his line of sight now framed by her flawless features.

A sharp thud of awareness struck his chest.

Lowering his gaze, he felt his pulse quicken beyond reason.

Without the shawl on her shoulders now, the elegance of her silhouette beneath the snug knit dress became more obvious.

A knot formed in his throat, and he almost turned away-until her firm voice cut in, "Stay still."

Though her tone carried an edge, it oddly wrapped him in a sense of comfort.

Isaac's head dipped instinctively, eyes closing as his fingers clamped hard around the wheelchair's armrests.



"You're running a fever," Verena murmured with a slight frown, pressing the call button on the table.

She had assumed his flushed face was from embarrassment, but clearly, it wasn't.

A waiter appeared moments later.

With calm politeness, she suggested, "Please bring some fever medicine."

The server nodded and departed without delay. When the medicine arrived, she scanned the instructions, poured a glass of water, and extended both toward him. "Here, take these."

"Thank you." Isaac studied the pills inhis palm before asking quietly, "Why do you..."

The question hovered on his tongue-why did she care about him so much?

Halfway through forming the words, his gaze locked with the lively light in Verena's eyes. A quiet chuckle escaped him, and he gave a small shake of his head. "Forget it."

After he swallowed the pills, she leaned back slightly and asked, "Have you decided on the hospital for the operation? Once we finish the first stage of treatment, surgery will still be necessary." 
###Chapter 20 What Makes You Trust Her This Much


With a small nod, Isaac said, "I've already chosen one. It's a private hospital that belongs to the Bennett family."

Verena took note of how unwell he seemed. "That's good. The privacy there will be secure," she said. "WNe'll stop here for today. Just let me know once you've decided on the exact date for the treatment."

Almost without hesitation, Isaac answered,"A week from now."

Once the time was set, the two went their separate ways.

When Isaac settled back into his car, his observant assistant immediately noticed that the "blanket"covering his lap was not the same as before.

"Did something happen, Mr. Bennett?" the assistant asked.

The stare from the front seat was hard to miss. Isaac opened the file resting on his lap and gave a short cough. "It's nothing."

Catching the strain in his voice, the assistant asked, "Are you feeling sick?"

Without looking up from the file, Isaac replied in a steady tone, "I've got a fever."

"I can run out and get some medicine right now," the assistant suggested.

"I already have some," Isaac said. "Just keep this from mny mother."

Since the accident, Danica had been quick to worry whenever his health showed even the slightest decline.

The assistant knew better than most how protective Danica had become.

"Understood," the assistant replied with a nod.

The mention of medicine brought Isaac's thoughts back to the restaurant, to the moment he nearly asked Verena why she treated him with such care. What was the reason behind her concern? Part of him assumed it was nothing more than a fiancée's obligation. Perhaps the Bennett family had something she wanted.

Yet beneath those guesses lingered a faint, unshaped hope-though even he could not say exactly what it was.

Out of nowhere, Isaac remembered the two questions Verena had asked him in the past. The first had been on the day they met, when she wanted to know if he recalled anything about Dragon Quarter in Clokron.

The second had come through a message, where she asked if he truly did not remember her.

A strange, hard-to-name feeling surged through him, clouding his thoughts.

He shut the file in front of him, leaned back against the seat, and pressed his fingers to his brow in an effort to clear his head and push aside the thoughts he didn't need.



That afternoon, Isaac's phone rang. It was his friend, Cayden Moore.

Cayden said, "Stop by the hospital tomorrow. I'll go ahead and run a few tests while you're there."

A master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine, Cayden had built an impressive reputationin his field.


Following the car accident, the Bennett family had called in other renowned doctors to examine Isaac, but Cayden was the one who had consistently been at his side.

With only a week left before the scheduled treatment with Verena, Isaac felt that Cayden deserved to know the situation as both his doctor and his friend.

He chose to be upfront about it and said, "I'm scheduled for surgery next week."

"What? Hold on-what are you talking about?" Cayden's voiçe jumped in alarm. "What kind of surgery?What exactly do you mean?"

Isaac answered, "I found a doctor who believes she can treat my condition with a decent chance of success.She says it's around seventy percent, and I'm willing to take that shot."

"Say that again?" Cayden's disbelief was clear, as if he couldn't trust his own hearing. "Seventy percent?Who would dare make that claim? Even I can only be thirty percent confident with your case."

The frustration in his voice lingered before he paused, and then spoke more carefully. "Isaac, I get that you're eager to get back on your feet, but this isn't something you can rush. Don't let desperation push you into a reckless decision."

From his wheelchair, Isaac stared out at the view from the office building.

"I understand," he said quietly. The memory of those eyes, so familiar they almost hurt to remember, rose in his mind. "But I want to trust her."

Cayden's curiosity burned to know who had convinced Isaac of something so far-fetched. "Tell me her name.Which world-class doctor is it?"

"Verena Willis," Isaac answered.

The name made Cayden search his memory. He was familiar with countless renowned physicians across the globe, yet this one drew a blank.

"Who exactly is she? I've never heard of her. What's her story?" Cayden asked further.

Isaac hesitated. Her background? Should he tell Cayden she was the eldest daugter of the Willis family,or admit she was his future wife?

The image of Verena kneeling before him flashed through Isaac's mind, her voice soft as she said, "Don't turn me away." He paused, his throat tightening for a moment, and then quietly answered, "She's my fiancée."

That single word froze Cayden in place, leaving him silent for a few moments.

"What did you just say?" he asked wth a frown. "Isn't your fiancée the eldest daughter of the Willis family who didn't grow up with her parents?"

Cayden normally tunedout that kind of news, but beca use Isaac was a friend, he'd picked up a few things Cayden continued, his voice rising, "Isaac, have you even heard what people are saying about her? She never attended college, so where exactly did she learn how to practice medicine? She's even been lying about graduating from Pine Hill University. And you've only had one meal with her, haven't you? What makes you trust her this much?"

Isaac barely drew in a breath before Cayden interjected, "Absolutely not. A woman like that cannot be trusted.Wait before you do anything reckless. I'll dig into her background myself."

Isaac started to reply, but the call had already ended. His forehead tightened in an involuntary frown.Cayden's logic was hard to argue with. After all, he had met Verena only once. Why did he trust her so much? Yet the way his friend dismissed Verena left an unpleasant weight in his chest.

Respected as a promising young physician, Cayden was often invited back to his old university to give lectures.

When his last class wrapped up that afternoon, he had intended to begin gathering information, only to spot Kaia walking down the corridor.

The sight made his eyes brighten. As Verena's sister, she might be the perfect source to question.

He strode toward her and called out, "Kaia."

She was moving alongside two other women, heading for their next lesson.

The sound of Kaia's name made her companions exchange curious glances in her direction.

A flicker of pleasure crossed Kaia's face. She was well aware that Cayden was one of Isaac's closest friends.Though his status didn't rival Isaac's, it still far exceeded her own.

At their university, Cayden held the quiet admiration of many female students.

She slid a stray lock of hair behind her ear and offered him a warm smile. "Professor Moore, is something the matter?"

Cayden inclined his head slightly. "I need to ask you a question. Are you free right now?" Kaia looked at her friends. They traded looks full of envy before slipping away to give them space.

Their reactions made Kaia feel a surge of pride, and she replied with a warm smile, "It's my pleasure to help you,Professor Moore."

Cayden wasted no time. "Did your sister Verena study medicine?"

The question left her momentarily speechless. He had stopped her just to bring up Verena? First Bobby, and now Cayden. People she had once admired from afar and never dreamed of approaching were suddenly seeking her out, all because of her sister.
###Chapter 21 I'm Here To Pick Up Miss Verena Willis


Kaia seethed inwardly. If these people wanted to know all about Verena, then she would paint them a picture of just how "outstanding" Verena was. For a split second, she did not feel so let down.

She straightened up right away, and then spoke with an offhand tone. "Verena is, more or less, a doctor.From what I've heard, she spent some time at a little clinic back in the village, picking up old remedies from a village healer who never went to school for it. Treating something as minor asa cold is probably her limit."

Cayden's brow furrowed as he processed that. A tiny clinic in the village? Taking care of nothing but a cold?Someone practicing folk medicine thinking she could perform surgery?

As Kaia spoke with that doubtful note in her voice, Cayden wondered how lsaac could have fallen for anything so outrageous. The whole story sounded likea farce to him. For Verena to claw her way into the Bennett family, she seemed willing to say anything. Pretending to have a fancy degree was one thing,but acting like she could perform actual surgery was going too far.

When he had thanked Kaia, Cayden turned and walked away.

As she watched him disappear into the distance, Kaia's lips curved into a sly smirk.

She had no idea who he would pass this information along to, yet the thought of Verena being dismissed as incompetent filled her with deep satisfaction.

After all, she wasn't even bending the truth. Verena really had been nothing more thana village-trained healer in a remote place.


···

When the meeting ended, Isaac's assistant handed him his phone. "Mr. Bennett, Mr. Moore tried calling four times."

Isaac tugged at his tie and accepted the phone. "Alright. You can go now." After the assistant walked out, Isaac dialed Cayden's number.

The moment the call connected, Cayden spoke in a rush. "Isaac, listen to me, you cannot allow Verena to operate on you. I just discovered she used to work in a small clinic. She learned everything from a self-taught healer in her village and never went through proper medical training. I've studied your case for months, and even then I only have a thirty percent chance of success. Yet she, who never even set foot in a real medical school, claims she has seventy percent. Isaac, don't you think that's strange?"

With a grave tone, Cayden added, "Besides, a surgery of this scale isn't something to hand over to just anyone. Isaac, you have to take responsibility for yourself. Your condition has already gone through too many failed procedures, and you know better than anyone how dangerous another attempt could be. I've studied several different approaches, but none promise success. And with medicine advancing every day, if the timing isn't right, we can still wait. But if this operation goes wrong and causes permanent damage, you could..."

Cayden almost told Isaac he could end up bound to a wheelchair for life, yet the words caught in his throat.

Isaac understood anyway. He sat frozen with the phone in his hand, letting Cayden speak without interruption.

Cayden continued, "Verena's entire experience comes from a tiny clinic, and she might not even know how to handle a scalpel properly in an operating room. You must not let her be the one to operate on you."

Suddenly recalling another option, Cayden interjected, "Isaac, you've heard of Evelyn Rowe, the famous surgeon overseas, haven't you? The mysterious doctor is one of the top authorities in this field. I reached out to them on your behalf, but because of certain complications, they haven't replied yet. Just give me two more days, and I'll find a way to get through to them."

Isaac understood that Cayden's concern was genuine. He bowed his head and stayed quiet for a long moment.

Cayden had made sense.

His faith in Verena had no solid ground. Maybe it was only because she had been the one to crouch beside him and speak after his injury. "Cayden, I appreciate it. I'll think it over again."

The following day, Verena opened a message from her assistant, Julianna Ford.

The message said, "Evelyn, I need your help. Do you remember that special patient you turned down before? He hasn't stopped hounding me since last night. He keeps insisting that only you can do that surgery. Could you at least check into it?"

Verena froze for a moment. To carry out surgery...

Verena remembered the day Shawna had been stretched out on the operating table, and just as she lifted the scalpel, Shawna passed away.

From that day forward, each time she tried to hold a scalpel, her right hand began to shake uncontrollably.

Nearly a month had passed since Shawna's death, and she had been struggling to step out from under that shadow.Yet every time she picked up a scalpel, her hand trembled without her control, a fatal weakness for any surgeon.

Verena let out a quiet sigh and answered, "It isn't that I'm unwilling. The truth is, I simply can't hold a scalpel right now.I need time to get past this, and I already have a special patient waiting for me."

After pausing to think, Verena added, "Just refuse him outright. If he pesters you again, give him my contact info and tell him to talk to me himself."

With no alternative, Julianna passed along her words exactly as they were.

Upon reading the reply, Cayden was overwhelmed with frustration and a sense of helplessness.

His connection with Julianna was the only reason he had been able to reach Evelyn. Since Evelyn had rejected him so firmly, how could he possibly keep begging?

Still, adding Evelyn to his contact list seemed like a smart move, and perhaps it might open a door later.

Yet after sending the friend request..

An hour slipped by. Another two hours went by.

Then three hours dragged on.

By ten hours, there was still nothing.

···

Time moved swiftly, and soon the day of Isaac'streatment arrived.

On the evening before the treatment day, Verena saw a message from Isaac pop up on her phone. "I'll be sending a driver for you in the morning."

Verena answered, "Alright."

After pausing for a moment, she added, "Don't be nervous. Stay calm. It's just an early-stage treatment."

Isaac sat in his study, his gaze drifting blankly toward a tree outside the window.

When he saw Verena's message, he laid his hand on his lifeless legs, lowering his eyes as his thoughts sank.

At dawn the following morning, Kaia returned from her run to see a glossy black luxury car waiting at the villa gates.

Kaia's beauty often made her stand out in Shoildon's circle of wealthy ladies. Before she even came of age,wealthy young men had already chased after her, and once the ceremony ended, even more suitors appeared.

The moment her eyes landed on a luxury car in front of her home, she assumed another admirer had come calling.

Kaia couldn't tell a thing about engines or brands, but the car's shine was striking enough to catch her attention.

With a bright smile, she brushed her hair into place, hurried across the drive, and knocked against the glass.

The driver rolled the window down, and Kaia folded her arms, acting like she was annoyed. "Would you mind not parking outside my place? I've said it before-I already have feelings for someone.Please let your boss know he should stop trying to reach out."

While acting indifferent, she stretched her neck for a quick glance inside, but the back seat was empty.

Unmoved by her assumption, the driver answered without emotion, "I'm here to pick up Miss Verena Willis."

Her grin vanished at once. "What did you just say?"

Using the exact same tone, the driver repeated, "I said I'm here for Miss Verena Willis."

Her chest swelled so tightly it felt as though it might burst wide open.

Her hands slipped to her sides, and she pulled on a strained smile. "Fine.I'll bring her out."


 ###Chapter 22 Spare Me The Act


At the dining table, Laura slowly swirled her spoon through her coffee.

When Kaia stepped inside, Laura's face brightened. "You're home. Sit down and eat something with me."

Hiding her irritation, Kaia moved closer and spoke quickly. "Mom, I spotted a car out front when I got back.At first, I figured it was Wayne Happer trying to drag me to lunch again. But when I asked, it turns out the driver was here for Verena."

"Verena?" Laura's brows knitted together. "She barely set foot in Shoildon. Who would even know her?"

After a pause, her frown deepened. "Probably some worthless acquaintances."

Kaia noticed the dismissive tone, bit her lip, and then let out a sudden smile. "I thought the same thing. Still,it doesn't sit right with me."

Her voice grew sharper, and her brow tightened. "If it's just casual friends, then fine. But what if she ends up tangled with the wrong kind of men? Don't forget, she's Isaac's future wife. One wrong rumor could wreck her standing. Think of how people will talk about the Willis daughters if this gets out."

At those words, Laura slammed her cup onto the table, splashing hot coffee across the surface.

Her voice turned cold as she snapped, "If she dares to fool around and ruin the alliance between the Willis family and the Bennetts, I'll see to it she pays dearly for it!"

Kaia hid the smirk tugging at her lips and placed a gentle hand on Laura's wrist. "Mom, I'm only speculating.Maybe Verena isn't that type of girl."

Laura narrowed her eyes, clearly certain that Verena was the type of woman she had suspected.

Upstairs on the third floor, Verena gathered her things, grabbed the medical kit, and stepped out of her room.

As she came down, she caught sight of Laura and Kaia sharing breakfast together, a picture that almost seemed warm and ordinary.

Her eyes rested on them for only a moment before she quickly turned away.

"Hold it right there," Laura barked, freezing Verena just as she reached the door.

Verena stopped in her tracks without glancing back. "What is it you want from me?"

A dark scowl spread across Laura's face. "Running out this early-who exactly are you sneaking off to meet?"


For a brief moment, Verena looked taken aback, but she quickly turned around, her eyes landing on Laura before drifting toward Kaia.

Kaia tried to meet Verena's stare with ease, yet the weight of that unwavering gaze broke her composure.Her throat tightened as she looked away in discomfort.

A sharp laugh slipped from Verena as her eyes returned to Laura. "If you're going to accuse me,at least make the lie believable. Having a voice doesn't give you the right to spit out garbage."

The table rattled as Laura struck it, rising to her feet and jabbing a finger at Verena. "This is the respect you show me when I'm trying to guide you?"

"Guide me? What authority do you think you even have?" Verena retorted.

Laura's rage only deepened when Verena dismissed her so openly in front of Kaia.

"I'm your mother. That alone gives me every right to discipline you," Laura snapped.

To Verena, the claim was nothing but a joke, and she laughed outright, the sound edged with scorn.

"Oh, so you do remember that I'm your child too. For a while, it felt like you were only a mother to Kaia and Luka. When it comes to me, nothing I say ever matters, but the moment they speak, you take every word as the truth."

With that, Verena turned a sly smile on Kaia. "Save your plotting. The car outside belongs to Isaac, not some 'wrong kind of men'. You're too young to be tossing around filthy ideas-try keeping your thoughts, and your She was teasing Kaia deliberately, repeating the same things she had told Laura. Just before coming downstairs, she had happened to overhear part of their conversation.

The blunt strike drained the color from Kaia's face. She clung desperately to her image of obedience before Laura, holding back any retort, and let tears spill instead.

Verena cut her off before the tears could even fall. "Spare me the act. I'm the one being slandered here, and I'm not weeping. You're the one making things up-so why are you crying? Do you really feel wronged, or do you just think I don't have the right to call you out? Pathetic."

With a short, dismissive laugh, Verena turned away, walking off without giving either of them another second of her time.

The sting of Verena's words left Kaia speechless on the outside, but her chest burned with fury.

Laura, on the other hand, felt an uneasiness she couldn't shake. She knew she played favorites, yet even with that awareness, she couldn't stop herself. And now, Verena's defiance stirred not just guilt but also an echo of resentment, perhaps because it reminded her too much of Shawna, her late mother-in-law.

"Mom..." Kaia noticed the flicker of guilt in Laura's expression, and dread took hold-what if that guilt made Laura soften toward Verena and give her more attention?

What Kaia couldn't see was that Laura had already sensed her fear and understood her intention,yet even so, Laura's instinct remained the same: to stand firmly on Kaia's side.

...

Medical kit in hand, Verena stepped into the car, and before long, the ride brought her to the location Isaac had sent.

When the car stopped, the driver addressed her with quiet respect. "Miss Willis, Mr. Bennett is already inside the hospital waiting for you."

Her gaze lingered on the private hospital towering before her, and for a moment she stayed silent. She had messaged Isaac before, telling him that they would begin with a traditional approach before surgery.For the traditional treatment, they didn't need the equipment of a hospital, so why would he choose to meet her at a hospital today?

Setting her questions aside, Verena walked straight toward the top floor, making her way to the VIP ward where Isaac was waiting.

In the end, Isaac chose to place his trust in Verena.

Since Evelyn couldn't be found, Cayden grew uneasy about leaving Isaac in the hands of someone who appeared untrained in medicine, so he came along to watch closely.

Although he offered to help Verena, he had already decided in his mind that he would take over the operation if necessary.

Inside the ward, the two men sat in silence until a knock sounded against the door.

"Come in," Isaac called out.

Cayden's eyes stayed locked on the door as it swung open.

Through the doorway stepped a young woman in a simple V-neck sweater and faded jeans. Her frame was slender but carried a quiet elegance, and her face was striking enough to draw every eye. With no makeup at all, her natural beauty shone, most of all in the clarity of her gaze.

For a heartbeat, Cayden was caught off guard by herpresence, and only when she greeted them did his attention drop to the medical kit in her hand.

His surprise slipped out in his voice. "You're Verena Willis?"

In response, Verena gave a courteous nod, her gaze shifting briefly from Cayden to Isaac.

The sight left Cayden astonished. Who had ever claimed she was plain? Anyone making that claim had clearly never stood in the same room with her.

Still, this was no time to focus on appearances. Isaac's condition came first, and the presence of a traditional medicine kit only deepened Cayden's doubts. Isaac shared in the confusion, his brow furrowing. "Wasn't today meant to be the surgery?"

Verena glanced at Cayden briefly before addressing Isaac directly. "I recommended we start with traditional methods first and hold off on surgery until the timing is right," she said calmly. "Doesn't that sound wiser? If you'd like, I can show you our chat history."

###Chapter 23 Isaac Is My Fiancé


Verena realized at last why the hospital had been chosen for the first day of the treatment-it was because Isaac had assumed the surgery would happen immediately.

Checking their old messages, Isaac scrolled through his phone and discovered the mistake. In his eagerness, he had latched onto the word "surgery" and paid no attention to her earlier explanation.

"I was careless," Isaac admitted, lowering his voice. "I misunderstood."

Cayden exhaled in quiet relief at hearing there would be no surgery just yet, though the worry in his eyes never faded. Turning to Verena, he pressed his doubts.

"Miss Willis, as far as I know, your experience with traditional medicine only comes from the small clinic at your hometown. Do you truly believe you can handle Isaac's condition? This isn't something trivial."

Even though she intended to begin with traditional methods, which were more conservative, Cayden's distrust was obvious.

Verena knew Cayden didn't trust her, and she understood why-trust was never given freely to a stranger.

She kept her composure and answered evenly, "You don't need to worry. I would never risk misleading someone from the Bennett family. I wouldn't make promises unless I was certain of them."

Cayden, trained in modern medicine, had only a shallow knowledge of traditional practices. If Verena was determined to rely on them, there was little room for him to object.

Sensing both men's unease, Verena shifted her gaze toward Isaac and allowed a small smile. "Isaac is my fiancé.If I would harm anyone, it certainly wouldn't be him."

Her words landed harder than either expected.

Isaac's head lifted at once, his throat working as he swallowed. The word "fiancé" had rolled from her tongue without any deliberate sweetness, spoken so naturally it almost startled him. He had always thought of their arrangement as nothing more than a transaction. But now, hearing it so simply from her lips, the title carried a warmth he hadn't anticipated.

Isaac finally looked away from Verena and addressed Cayden, saying, "I know you're worried about me,Cayden, but I've decided to place my trust in Miss WVillis."

Positioned between the two, Cayden glanced from lsaac on one side to Verena on the other. They were bound to marry sooner or later, and as someone outside their alliance, it wasn't wise for him to interfere too much. More importantly, as long as no hasty surgery was involved, he had no reason to push back.

After a brief silence, Cayden cleared his throat. "If you've chosen to trust her, then as your friend, I'll stand with you."

At that, Verena opened her medical kit and looked at Isaac. "Shall we begin the treatment?"

His hands clenched around the wheelchair's armrests, but he gave a firm nod. "Go ahead."

Verena's lips curved in a soft smile as she crouched in front of him. She pulled back the blanket covering his legs, reached into her kit, and retrieved a pair of scissors.

Before Isaac fully grasped her intent, the scissors cut through the fabric, and she slid the pant leg up to his thigh in one swift motion.

Caught off guard, Isaac stiffened at the sudden exposure.Heat crept into his chest, but he forced himself to look away, reminding himself this was simply part of the treatment.

Verena didn't miss his unease. In fact, she noticed something else-despite six months of inactivity, his legs still held strong lines of muscle, the kind that came from years of dedicated training. It hadn't been long since the injury, and traces of his old athleticism remained.

With a small laugh, she said lightly, "You know, your legs are actually quite impressive."

The comment startled Isaac. Impressive? His head turned sharply toward her, searching her expression for mockery. But there was no trace of it-only a steady, admiring gaze, as if she were looking at something genuinely remarkable. 
When his eyes met hers, Isaac felt his heartbeat falter for a moment.

He tried to mask the rush in his chest with humor. "Tell me, is 'impressive' really the kind of word you use for a man's legs?"

Her lips curved in amusement. "Then maybe I should say they're beautiful instead," she teased, playing along.

The odd stirring returned to him, a flutter that unsettled his composure.

Sensing it was time to pull back, Verena let the banter end there.

She lowered her hands onto his legs, pressing gently several times before rising to her feet. She said to Cayden, "Could you move him onto the bed?"

"Of course," Cayden replied without hesitation.

He assisted Isaac onto the bed, while Verena took a seat beside the bed, set her kit on her lap, and carefully chose a silver needle.

Cayden folded his arms across his chest, watching in silence.

Between her fingers, the slender needle gleamed. She positioned it with practiced precision, and then pressed the tip against a point on Isaac's leg and drove it in smoothly.

One of Cayden's brows lifted; her technique looked nearly identical to that of seasoned traditional doctors he had seen before.

Flat on his back, Isaac fixed his gaze on the ceiling, his expression unreadable.

As her hand pressed on a pressure point, Verena asked quietly, "Do you feel anything?"

Isaac gave a slight shake of his head. "Nothing."

Without hesitation, she drew another needle and set it into a different spot.

"And this one? Any feeling?" she asked again. His eyelids lowered as he answered softly,-"No."

Another needle went in, followed by her steady question. "What about now?"

Isaac kept his lips pressed tight, wanting to respond but unable. His lifeless legs seemed to mock him,reminding him of how far beyond saving he might already be.

Isaac stayed silent, his fists tightening hard against his sides instead of answering Verena's question.

When he only shook his head, she could see the shadow of disappointment settling over him.

Her hand came down softly on his clenched fist as she spoke in a steady voice. "I'm only asking so I can understand the extent of the nerve damage. The fact that you can't feel anything right now doesn't mean it's hopeless. Your case is unusual, but there's no need to be afraid. We can work through it step by step."

Isaac's eyes lowered to the delicate hand resting on his own. Warmth seeped through his skin, traveling upward until it reached his chest and lodged in his heart.

Those words seemed to wrap around him like a balm, making his throat tighten as he murmured, "Thank you."

Verena answered with a small smile, "You've thanked me enough already. You don't have to be so polite."

Then she returned to her task, sliding more needles into place as part of the treatment.

After every insertion, she checked for his response, repeating the question with care.

Even though his answers never changed, he found himself calmer, more willing to face the truth of his condition.

About half an hour later, she began removing the needles. "This process takes time," she explained. "You'll need two or three sessions each week. I've already written a prescription. Your assistant can buy the herbs from a shop that specializes in traditional medicine. I'll message you updates as your recovery progresses."

From the side, Cayden had observed every step. The confidence in her technique and her composed manner forced him to admit he might have misjudged her abilities.Still, something about her unsettled him. Her voice carried a note that tugged at his memory, stirring an odd sense of familiarity.

As Verena packed away the last of the needles and finished her instructions, Cayden finally spoke up. "Miss Willis, have we met before?"

###Chapter 24 I'll Be The One To End It


Verena studied Cayden for a moment, curiosity flickering in her eyes. After a brief pause, she confirmed her answer. "No, we've never met."

Cayden's brow tightened with a faint crease. The sound of her voice stirred something in him, but he struggled to recall where he had heard it before.

Once she denied the connection, he didn't press further. Instead, he gave a short nod and stepped forward to help Isaac back into his wheelchair.

"You seem fine enough," Cayden remarked. "But I just received an urgent call from the hospital, so I'll need to leave."

Isaac nodded and said, "Go on."

As Cayden walked out, silence settled over the room, leaving only Isaac and Verena behind.

The quiet broke when Isaac's phone buzzed loudly on the table.

Glancing at the screen, he picked it up. "Mom? What is it?"

On the other end, Danica's voice came firm and clear. "I have news for you. The wedding with Verena has been scheduled for next month."

Isaac's expression tightened, his dislike for her domineering tone written plainly on his face.

Not giving him a chance toreply, Danica pressed forward. "You should remind yourself of the bigger picture.I'm well aware you don't care for Verena, but the Bennett family cannot afford your resistance. Remember your position-you're a Bennett.That means sacrifices. Even if it feels unfair, you'll endure it for the family's sake."

Her words slammed shut any room for argument.

Isaac swallowed hard, answering in a low voice, "I understand."

He was not the kind of man who accepted destiny without a fight, nor did he ever follow his mother's commands without thought.

His marriage with Verena was nothing more than a name on paper, and before he met her, he had every intention of rejecting the Willis family's daughter. However, once he finally laid eyes on her, he felt an instinctive urge not to resist. What drew him in was not her appearance, but a feeling he found impossible to define.

With a slight turn of his head, Isaac quietly observed Verena as she gathered the medical kit.

When she noticed his eyes on her, Verena's lips curved into a calm smile. "I heard your mother just now. She thinks you don't care for me, but insists you should keep the family's interests above your own."

Raising the kit into her arms, she gave him an easy smile. "Do you feel marrying me is unfair to you?"

Her hand landed lightly on his shoulder. "Relax. You don't have to like me, and I won't force anything on you.If you truly feel trapped by this arrangement, I'll be the one to end it when the moment arrives."

The ease in her tone made it seem as though the matter didn't bother her in the least, which was only natural given how little they knew each other.

But Isaac's chest tightened unexpectedly, as if her words had struck somewhere tender.

"I.." He tried to speak, but his throat closed around the words, leaving only silence behind.

Isaac thought about telling her that he didn't feel any dislike toward her. Yet saying that aloud would suggest there was some affection between them, and that was unthinkable considering how little time they had spent together. What mattered more was the reality that he was in no state to give his heart to anyone.A man bound by crippled legs and plagued by other failings-how could he possibly have anything to give in love? Romantic feelings were never meant for him.

Verena picked up on the sudden gloom in his expression, and it brought back a memory-how he used to follow her around with unwavering determination. She'd get fed up sometimes and tell him to leave her alone for good. What was it he used to say in return? Ah, yes. "In this life, it's only you. Once we're married,you'll see me every day. There won't be any staying away."That bold promise lingered for a moment in her thoughts before fading away like a passing dream.

Watching him sit with his head lowered, she found his quiet despair almost too heavy to endure.

Walking closer, she bent over and ran her fingers playfully through his hair. "I'm only teasing. I'm not upset.Besides, feelings can grow, can't they? We've got time to understand each other and see where things lead."

Her head tilted slightly, her smile gentle, as if she were comforting a child.

Isaac's lashes trembled while his gaze lingered blankly on the woman in front of him.

The purity in her eyes and the softness of her smile stirred a faint familiarity, though he couldn't place when or where he'd seen something like it before.

Heat from her palm grazed his hair, leaving a tingling trail that rippled through him.

A lump rose in his throat, and he wonderedif he imagined it. Her touch felt effortless, almost too familiar,as if closeness came naturally to her.

The thought, however, was pushed aside at once. In his condition, who would willingly draw near? More likely, she only valued the title that came with being tied to the Bennett family.

Part of him wanted to protest-that not every kind of love could be forced to grow.

But when he looked into her eyes, whatever argument he had formed slipped away before he could speak.His hand curled slightly against his leg, and with his eyes lowered, he gave a slow, instinctive nod. "I get it.You're not wrong."

Hearing his reply, Verena straightened up and spoke with calm sincerity. "Let's stop here for today. If anything feels off after you get home, please promise me you'll let me know immediately."

The concern in her voice left him pressing his lips together before he answered in a low tone, "Alright. I will."

Her eyes lingered on his unruly hair. His unexpected compliance drew a small smile from her. "Good boy."

Her hand brushed through his hair once more, a playful gesture like a reward, before she gathered her kit and walked out.

Left alone in his chair, Isaac's eyes drifted to the empty doorway. His hair stuck up awkwardly in the middle,leaving him looking a little ridiculous.

Inside the Willis Villa, Alec and Laura lounged on the sofa with the financial news playing, while Kaia busied herself at the counter preparing coffee for them.

Verena had just turned toward the stairs when Laura called out to her, "You're back already?"

With only a brief look in Laura's direction, Verena kept her tone flat. "I'm heading upstairs to rest."

As Verena turned to walk away, Laura chimed in, "The wedding date with the Bennett family has been settled. You and Isaac need to choose a day soon to have your pre-wedding photos taken."

"I'm aware," Verena replied curtly.

A reminder wasn't necessary; Verena would not have forgotten.

Laura's unease grew at Verena's constant detachment. What if this stubborn girl stirred up problems that jeopardized the Willis projects the Bennetts had backed after the marriage?

Holding back the unease twisting in her chest, Laura softened her voice and said, "Verena, are you still upset with me? I only said those things because I didn't want to see you misled. That's the reason I spoke so harshly. You have to believe that everything I do comes from a place of care."

She did feel a flicker of guilt for the accusation she'd thrown at Verena that morning, but compared to what was at stake, that guilt barely registered.

Verena, however, couldn't stop the quiet scorn rising in her mind. Laura had shown no hesitation when it came to pointing fingers. And now that sherealized she was in the wrong, she conveniently wrapped her actions in the excuse of concern. Hiding behind the words"everything I do comes from a place of care"didn't make her accusation any less calculated.

###Chapter 25 Their Love Had To Remain Hers


Verena looked at Laura and gave a quiet laugh. "I don't waste anger on just anyone. Only the people who matter get that side of me. So relax. Why would I be upset with you?"

The way she spoke made it sound like Laura's presence was of little importance.

Across from her, Laura's eyes fixed on her daughter, and her expression stiffened beneath layers of carefully applied makeup. All morning she had wrestled with guilt over how she had wrongly accused Verena,and waiting here was her way of making amends. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with dismissal. Was Verena really suggesting she didn't matter? She was still her mother. But then, considering Shawna had been the one to raise Verena, it wasn't surprising. To Laura, the girl standing before her was nothing but a thankless child who threw her kindness away.

Kaia had been quiet until now, but after hearing Verena's cutting remark, she rose and slipped an arm around Laura's shoulders.

"How could you talk like that, Verena?" Kaia asked, frowning at her. "Mom's already trying to make things right with you. Don't you think it's disrespectful to speak to her this way?"

Her words weren't meant for comfort. They were meant to make Alec see Verena as insolent enough to deserve punishment.

Verena met Kaia's gaze with a cold stare. "Politeness depends on who I'm dealing with. And with the two of you, there's no need for it."

Her glance shifted to Alec, who opened his mouth as if to say something but held back. Without another word,she turned and walked upstairs.

For a moment Kaia stood frozen, unable to form a reply. When her thoughts finally caught up, anger took hold of her. She hated herself for always losing ground in arguments and never being sharp enough to outtalk Verena. Growing up the way she did had made Verena quick with insults, but that was all she had. On second thought, Kaia felt a flicker of relief, realizing her sister's only skill was a sharp tongue and nothing more.

Breathing hard from frustration, Laura pressed her hand against her chest. She looked over at Alec, who sat unmoving on the sofa. "Can you believe this? Just look at what's become of her! How could she claim I'm not worth basic respect? I am still her mother!"

While Laura raged, Alec's eyes stayed fixed on the floor. Regret flled him far more than anger whenever he thought ofVerena.

Long ago, he had planned to bring Shawna and Verena to Shoildon, but Laura's constant objections always got in the way. It was only after Shawna pasśed away that Verena finally came to live in his home.

Those lost years left a distance between them, and Alec had tried to bridge it as a father. Still, the gap was too wide. He and Verena had spent so long apart that it felt impossible to truly reach her now. When he heard Verena speak so coldly to Laura, he couldn't find it in himself to blame her. He only blamed himself for falling short as a father.

Interrupting his thoughts, Laura's sharp voice demanded attention. "Why won't you say anything? Look at the kind of person she's become under your mother's guidance!"

Alec drew a slow breath and met Laura's gaze. His words came out steady. "You keep saying you're her mother, but was there ever a moment you actually tried to teach her the right way?"

A hintof offense crossed Laura's face. "What are you suggesting? Do you really not remember who stood beside you back when you had nothing? I had no time to teach our eldest daughter properly because I had given you my full support back then. Are you seriously blaming me for this now?"

Hoping to avoid an argument, Alec softened his voice. "She just came to the city, so it makes sense she's unfamiliar with how things work here. As her mother, you're supposed to lead her forward, not just criticize her. You keep saying she's rude and unrefined, but let's not forget, we left her to live wih my mother for more than twenty years. If Verena had grown up with us, she would have been a different person."

Kaia almost opened her mouth to tell Alec about Verena's rudeness and the way she had shoved Luka down the stairs. But when she noticed the heavy guilt in Alec's eyes, she forced herself to keep quiet.

Her gaze flicked between Alec's troubled face and Laura's contemplative look, and a bitter sense of grievance welled up inside her. Why did Verena's return seem to steal all of their attention?

That grievance soon turned into unease. If her parents kept focusing on Verena, would their love eventually belong only to her?

The thought unsettled her even more when she remembered that Verena was set to marry Isaac, which would surely bring her even greater favor at home.

Grinding her teeth, Kaia made up her mind. She would never allow that to happen. Their love had to remain hers, and their focus should never wander to anyone else.

"Dad, Mom, don't let Verena's issues take over your thoughts anymore," Kaia steadied Laura on the sofa and gave a bright smile. "I actually have some good news to share with you."

As Laura quietly questioned whether she had been too harsh with Verena, Kaia's cheerful voice suddenly drew her attention back.

"What kind of good news?" she asked.

Alec was curious too, so he turned his eyes toward Kaia.

Now that both of them were paying attention, Kaia's smile grew warmer. "Not long ago, when I was eating out with a friend, I happened to meet one of my professors."

Then, with a touch of pride, she added, "You remember-the one who's always been especially fond of me."

As always, Laura remembered every detail about Kaia.

She leaned closer with a smile and asked, "You're talking about Professor Wendell Branson, aren't you?"

Kaia nodded eagerly. "I stopped to greet him, and he ended up sharing something with me."

She let the pause linger on purpose, letting their anticipation build, and then went on with a bright smile."This year, our medical school is bringing in Dr. Evelyn Rowe, the world-famous physician, to give a lecture. Since Professor Branson knows how much I admire Evelyn, he saved me a place right away, worried I might miss the chance."

Laura's eyes widened in surprise. "Is that true? Didn't you once tell me Evelyn rarely makes public appearances? If your school managed to invite Evelyn, they must have gone to great lengths.And your professor holding a seat for you clearly shows how highly he thinks of you."

She wrapped her arms around Kaia and praised her warmly. "Kaia, you really are remarkable."

Enjoying every bit of her mother's affection, Kaia smiled with deep satisfaction.

Alec was pleased that his younger daughter had earned her professor's favor. And the name Evelyn stirred his curiosity.

Life is inseparable from illness, aging, and death, and regardless of how much power or wealth a person possessed, the opportunity to build ties with a doctor of Evelyn's reputation was far too valuable to overlook.

Although Alec had heard of Evelyn before, he realized he knew almost nothing about the doctor beyond the name.
###Chapter 26 | Want To Meet Verena

Alec leaned forward slightly and asked, "What kind of achievements has Evelyn made in medicine?"



Kaia's eyes lit up at her father's interest, and she answered with enthusiasm, "Evelyn's incredible, Dad!A few years back, in Clokron, they led a groundbreaking heart transplant that shook the entire medical community. That operation alone made Evelyn famous, and since then, many of Evelyn's successful high-risk operations have been written into medical textbooks. Every medical student looks up to that legendary doctor."



The mention of Evelyn made Alec thoughtful.Years of dealing with society's elite had taught him how much they valued their health. Forming a connection with someone like Evelyn could open doors in ways money and power couldn't.



With that thought in mind, Alec rested a hand on Kaia's shoulder and instructed, "When the lecture is over, make sure you get Evelyn's contact information.Don't let a chance like this pass you by."



Even without his reminder, Kaia had already resolved to do just that. To her, Evelyn wasn't only a famous doctor-they were her greatest inspiration.


She gave a cheerful nod and said with a smile, "You don't need to worry, Dad. I'll definitely take the opportunity."



...



Shock ran through Bobby when he learned Isaac and Verena's wedding date had already been set. He had assumed there was still time to derail what he considered a mismatched marriage, but his mother and the Willis family had moved faster than expected.



If he didn't act quickly, Verena, the girl he believed to be deceptive, would officially become part of the Bennett family. He was determined to see her in person and decide for himself what sort of woman she truly was. In his mind, she couldn't possibly be beyond his ability to control.


Acting on imnpulse, Bobby hurried into his room,grabbed his phone, and dialed Kaia's number. Though he had never thought much of her, she was his only link to Verena in this urgent moment.


The call connected not long after.


It struck Bobby that they hadn't spoken once since the last birthday party. When Bobby's call lit up Kaia's phone, the memory of being left hanging at her birthday party rushed back,souring her mood. Still, his decision to reach out stirred a faint hope that he might finally be giving her some thought.



Kaia's voice was soft as she asked, "Mr.Bennett,what can I do for you?"



Instead of polite chatter, Bobby got straight to the point. "I want to meet Verena."



The words hit Kaia like a shock. Her face stiffened,and after a stunned pause, she stammered, "Wha... what did you just say?"



The idea sounded so unbelievable that she questioned whether she had heard him correctly.


Bobby repeated himself without hesitation, "Let Verena know | expect to see her tomorrow. If not,just pass along my number."



Kaia struggled to understand what she had just heard.What reason could Bobby possibly have for wanting to meet Verena? No matter what drew people near her or what their intentions were, they always seemed to be asking about Verena in the end. It had happened with Cayden before, and now it was happening again with Bobby. Forcing herself to keep calm, she asked in a tentative tone, "Why exactly do you want to meet Verena, Mr.Bennett?"



His brows drew together in irritation. "I don't owe you an explanation. Just give her the message."


Kaia's mind raced. The last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena, especially since she had once sent a message in the group chat, hinting that Verena wasn't attractive, and everyone had believed her. If he saw Verena in person, that lie would unravel instantly


"That's a shame," said Kaia flatly, spinning the lie without a hint of emotion. "Verena hasn't been around much lately, and even I barely run into her. She keeps to herself most of the time. Our family hardly speaks with her, so I doubt she'd be open to someone she doesn't know. I don't have any way to reach her,either."



The way Kaia spoke made Verena seem cold and full of herself.



Doubt crept into Bobby's mind as he listened to KCaia.He figured Verena might be distant, but it seemed unlikely that Kaia didn't have a chance to speak with her sister at all.



Rather than press the issue, Bobby picked up on Kaia's unwillingness to help and decided not to question her motives any further.


Bobby's voice was flat. "Alright, if you're not interested in helping, I'll just handle it on my own."



That was all he said before he ended the call.



The moment she heard his words, Kaia felt panic rising in her chest. Someone like Bobby, with his influence,wouldn't struggle for long if he set his mind on finding Verena. The chance of them meeting seemed impossible to avoid. If Bobby ever saw Verena and thought she was beautiful, he might stop objecting to the marriage with Isaac altogether.



As these thoughts spun in her head,Kaia's anxiety only grew. Even though her feelings for lsaac had faded after his accident, she hated the idea of Verena ending up with the man she once wanted but could never have. The thought alone was unbearable, and she simply couldn't allow it to happen.



Worry twisted Kaia's expression as she gnawed at her lip and tried to come up with a way to keep Bobby and Verena apart.



Suddenly, Kaia's eyes landed on the steaming bowl of soup a maid had just brought to the bedside table, and an idea sparked in her mind.



Since Bobby had never met Verena, he wouldn't recognize her. If something happened to ruin Verena's appearance before their meeting,Bobby would surely turn away in disgust and refuse to accept her as a future sister-in-law.



The image of a scarred Verena flashed through Kaia's mind, and she burst out laughing at the thought



The following morning arrived.



Verena finished washing up and headed downstairs,making her way to the dining room for breakfast.


Kaia had already been lingering in the kitchen for more than thirty minutes, waiting for just the right moment. She scooped up a bowl of steaming soup with extra care when she heard footsteps approaching.


After Verena took her seat at the table, Kaia moved slowly toward her, balancing the bowl.



Verena took a small bite of the bread the maid had handed her and noticed a flash of pink in her peripheral vision. That shade of pajama belonged to Kaia alone, making it clear who had been lingering in the kitchen the entire time. She wondered what ridiculous scheme Kaia might be brewing now.



One eyebrow lifted, Verena kept a close watch on Kaia without turning her head.



Without warning, Kaia tripped and came stumbling in Verena's direction. In a split second, Verena set her bread aside and sprang out of her chair to avoid the collision.



Her quick move made the chair scrape loudly against the floor.



Kaia was so startled by the sudden noise that she backed away, completely forgetting the bowl she was holding.



Hot soup sloshed over the rim, burning her hand and making her cry out as she dropped the bowl. Some of it even splashed up onto her neck.



Tears filled Kaia's eyes while she clutched her burned hand,blaming Verena for startling her on purpose.



She gave Verena an angry glare, clearly about to start yelling.


Before she could speak, Verena interjected coldly,"Not a great feeling, is it, Kaia? Burns pretty badly when your own scheme turns against you."
###Chapter 27 Surveillance Footage
Tears welled up in Kaia's eyes as the pain hit her, and her gaze grew red wen Verena called her out so bluntly. She pressed herlips together, determined not to admit a thing. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Honestly, I don't get it."


Verena looked at Kaia's face, taking note of the features they had in common. This was her sister,after all.


Still, Verena couldn't ignore the fact that Kaia wanted her disfigured.



Before coming to Shoildon, Verena had assumed that her sister, whom she had only met once, likely didn't think much of her. She never imagined that Kaia would actually hate her this deeply.



Trying to keep her feelings in check, Verena kept her tone cold and held Kaia's gaze. "Kaia, you don't like me, and I don't like you. We're both well aware of it.I haven't gone after you, so don't think you can start with me. As long as you behave yourself, I'll let you do whatever you want. I'm not interested in fighting for anything you want. But if you ever try something
against me again, I promise I'll make you pay dearly."



Kaia found it impossible to tolerate the way Verena looked down on her. She had grown up beside their parents,spoiled by them,while Verena had lived out in the countryside, so why did Verena always act so high and mighty?



By now, Alec and Laura were both at work, and Luka was out somewhere with friends. With nobody around to back her up, Kaia felt completely alone.



Holding her hand over her scalded neck, Kaia glared at Verena and warned,"Do you really think I won't tell Mom and Dad that you're bullying me? That you spilled hot soup on purpose just to hurt me?"



With her patience gone, Kaia didn't bother to act like the good sister anymore.



Verena faced Kaia's empty threat with a faint smile. "If you have time to complain, you should hurry up and go to the hospital. If you're slow, you might actually end up with scars."



There was a challenge in the way she spoke her final words.



Kaia,who cared more about her looks than anything else, lost all color in her face the second she heard the word "scars."
Several drops of hot soup had splashed onto her face as well.



She shot Verena a furious glare and gritted her teeth."You're evil. You really are the worst."


Anger boiled inside her, but Kaia forced herself to focus on getting to the hospital first.


She gave quick directions to the driver, and soon she was on her way tothe hospital.



After doctors reassured her that her face would be fine, Kaia stretched out on a plush VIP bed, snapped a picture of herself, and posted it online with a simple caption: "At the hospital."



Within minutes, a few of her so-called friends from her circle of rich acquaintances sent messages to her in the group chat, pretending to be worried. "Kaia,what happened to you? How did you end up like this?"



Kaia let the questions pile up and waited until her phone buzzed with nearly a dozen messages before deciding to answer.



Kaia finally replied, "Don't worry, it's nothing serious.Verena just came to live with our family. We're not really close. I wanted to do something nice and made her some soup, but when I handed her the bowl, she bumped it and the soup ended up all over me."

Because people in the group already looked down on Verena for faking her academic background, not many were willing to defend her.



After reading Kaia's message, one of the group members quickly commented, saying, "You're telling me that was an accident? She definitely meant to do it!"



Someone else jumped in right after. "Of course she did. She's jealous that you're so pretty and probably wants to ruin your face."



Watching the flurry of reactions, Kaia felt pleased with herself, but she kept up her sweet and innocent act."Please don't misunderstand her. Verena can be difficult, but I really don't think she did it on purpose."



To make her message seem even more pitiful, she added a sad-faced emoji at the end.


When Bobby read through the group chat, his eyebrows knitted together in doubt. He wasn't convinced by what Kaia said. After all, these two were sisters, so it seemed unlikely things would get so ugly.Besides,after talking to Kaia a few times, he knew she was good at putting on a show and couldn't be trusted.



Someone else in the group shared his doubts and tagged Kaia. "You can try to explain, but people are still going to question you. Doesn't your house have cameras in the dining room? If you show the recording it'll be clear whether Verena meant to do it or not."



Other people quickly chimed in with agreement."Exactly, just upload the video."



Kaia had already seen this coming. She had spent her ride to the hospital editing the footage so it would look the way she wanted.


Still, she couldn't let herself seem too eager to share it.



She responded in the group, "Okay, I'll go look at the recordings now."



After a few minutes, she picked the video she had already prepared and sent it into the chat.



In the video, a woman with long hair sat at the dining table, her back turned toward the camera. Moments later, another woman appeared, wearing a pink nightgown and holding a bowl of soup. It was clear the one in the pink nightgown was Kaia, and the woman seated with her long hair flowing down could only be Verena.



The footage showed Kaia standing about three feet from the table. As Verena pushed her chair back and rose to her feet, her arm swept out and hit the boWl,sending hot soup splashing across Kaia's arm. With the way the video was shot, it looked like Verena did it on purpose.



Of course, Kaia knew the truth. Verena never made contact with the bowl at all; she had only lifted her hand while getting up.



But Kaia had cut out the key section of the recording



After seeing the video, everyone in the group sent messages to comfort Kaia, believing Verena did it on purpose.



When Bobby finished watching, his frown grew even deeper, and a mix of emotions clouded his face. Kaia was far from innocent, but anyone willing to hurt her own sister was no better.



He had always thought Verena was just a compulsive liar who wanted to outshine everyone else. After he saw this, she struck him as jealous and vindictive. If Isaac really ended up marrying her,the entire Bennett family would be thrown into chaos. He could not let that happen. As long as the marriage hadn't taken place, there was still time to stop it.



Determined, Bobby threw off his covers, got out of bed, and stormed toward Isaac's study.



He didn't pause to knock. Instead,he marched right in and blurted out, "Isaac, I'm serious. You can't marry  someone like Verena. You have no idea how cruel she can be. She almost ruined her sister's face. If you go through with this,our family will never know peace. If you don't believe me, I have the video to prove it..."



"Enough!" Isaac slammed his folder on the desk, and the sharp sound made Bobby jump.



In a cold, steady voice, Isaac replied, "I've told you before, Verena is going to be your sister-in-law.I won't let you talk about her like that."



Isaac folded his hands in front of him and stared Bobby down. "Or do you think now that Dad's gone,what I say doesn't matter anymore?"
###Chapter 28 He's Lucky To Be Marrying Me
Isaac had never spoken to him that way before.Bobby wanted to defend himself, but when he met lsaac's piercing stare, he suddenly felt like a little kid who had missed the point entirely.



His fingers twisted the edge of his shirt, and he dropped his gaze. "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac," he mumbled.



Isaac understood him well enough to know what was really going on. Bobby was not being defiant for the sake of it. He simply could not bring himself to accept Verena as part of their family.



With a quiet but forceful voice,Isaac said, "Look at me."



Reluctantly, Bobby pressed his lips together and looked up to meet Isaac's eyes.



Isaac's face was unreadable. His gaze was intense,and it made Bobby feel small under the weight of it.



He admired Isaac, but whenever lsaac put on that stern look, Bobby always broke into a cold sweat.


Every instinct told Bobby to look away, but he could not muster the nerve. He swallowed hard and waited in tense silence.



After a pause, Isaac's voice cut through the air."You're old enough to know better. It's time you focused on your classes. I expect you to help me with company business when you can. As for everything else, leave it alone. If I catch you speaking badly about Verena again, you'll find out exactly how harsh I can be."



Bobby wanted to protest. He wished he could say he only wanted to protect lsaac, that Verena was dangerous, and Isaac was fooled by that woman.



But with Isaac sitting right there, so intimidating,Bobby could only bite back his words and give a silent nod.



He stepped out of the study, but his frustration bubbled up the more he thought about it. He ran a hand through his hair and let out a long sigh.



That was when voices drifted up from downstairs,as the servants greeted Danica.



A spark of hope lit up in Bobby's eyes. Isaac might have lost his objectivity when it came to Verena, but Danica certainly had not. She had always hated women who acted out of jealousy. If she found out about this, maybe she would be the one to call off the  arrangement.


That idea brought Bobby's spirits back to life,hope flickering in his eyes.


Bobby rushed down the stairs and nearly tripped as he hurried into the living room to find Danica.



She had just come in from outside and was settling onto the sofa, still holding a glass of water. She hadn't even taken a sip before Bobby's sudden entrance startled her, making her cough.


"Are you alright, Mom?" Bobby asked as he moved beside her, gently patting her back.


Danica tried to catch her breath, and then shot hima sideways look. "What on earth has you in such a rush?"



Bobby responded immediately, "Mom,you can't let Verena marry into our family. I thought she just liked to exaggerate, but now I see she's really got a manipulative side. Please, before the wedding, go talk to the Willis family and call off this arrangement.You'd be saving Isaac from a terrible mistake."



He said everything in a single breath, leaving Danica staring at him in disbelief. She blinked a few times before answering, "Have you gone crazy?"



The question caught Bobby off guard. He grabbed her shoulders and spoke with even more urgency. "I'm being serious, Mom!"


Danica said nothing for a moment. She had weighed Isaac's engagement to Verena carefully, thinking it was the best decision for their family.


Seeing Bobby act so impulsively made her lose patience. She brushed his hands away and snapped,"How many times do I have to tell you not to meddle in Isaac's life? Are you even listening when I talk to you? Right now, your job is to work with lsaac and learn how to manage the company, not run around causing trouble. Tell me, when was the last time you even showed up at the office?"



Her scolding stung, and Bobby looked away, refusing to meet her eyes. "I don't care about running the company," he muttered to himself.



Hearing that, Danica's temper snapped. "Then what do you care about? Tell me. What actually interests you?"



With her voice rising, Bobby fell silent. Danica crossed her arms, glaring at him with obvious disappointment."You and Isaac grew up under the same roof, but he turned out responsible and hardworking, and you-well, you're just a headache. Go on, get out of my sight!"


Before she had even finished, Bobby had clenched his fists and stormed from the room. No one ever listened  to him. Would it really hurt them to watch a simple video? All they ever did was yell at him.



...



A black sedan sat parked right at the front gates of the Willis Villa, with the driver standing patiently nearby.



From her seat on the sofa, Laura glanced up and spotted Verena making her way downstairs. "Verena,you need to keep your eyes open during the photoshoot today. I don't want you doing anything that gives people a reason to laugh at us."


Since Verena had spent her childhood far away from city life,Laura constantly worried she might embarrass the family when faced with all the luxury, especially the wedding gowns and sparkling jewelry.


Luka interjected, "You probably don't recognize any of those brands, so it's best if you just watch Mr.Bennett and follow his lead. If he picks a dress, just go along with it. Don't make a scene by choosing the wrong one."



Both Laura and Luka already knew about Kaia's accident and her trip to the hospital. Under normal circumstances, Laura would never have ignored what happened, but today's event was simply too important. Noticing the irritation on Luka's face, Verena gave a calm smile and said, "This is my wedding, and I'm the one at the center of it. I'll wear whichever dress I like.Your opinion has nothing to do with it."


Laura's face tightened. "Don't be ridiculous. Who do you think the wedding is really about? Isaac is the center of attention, not you. If you do something to upset him, he could easily call off the entire wedding."


Before Laura could say anything more, a smooth,deep voice drifted in from the entryway. "Mrs. Willis, it sounds like you don't have mnuch faith in me."



All three of them turned to see who had spoken.


Isaac had just arrived, seated in his wheelchair, with his assistant guiding him through the door.


Laura's demeanor changed instantly. She forced a bright smile and greeted him. "Mr. Bennett, what a surprise. We weren't expecting you today."


Kaia came down the steps just then, and the sight of Isaac made her heart race. His condition didn't take away from his presence or his good looks. Even while sitting in that wheelchair, he looked every bit out of reach.



Verena stood there, caught off guard as she met Isaac's eyes. She only snapped out of her daze when lsaac moved beside her and gently took her right hand in his.


"Today's for the pre-wedding shoot. Verena is my fiancée, so it only makes sense that I came to pick her up," Isaac said, turning his attention to Laura.


His tone was courteous, but the chill in his gaze was unmistakable. There was not a hint of warmth in his eyes, only a depth that was impossible to read.


Laura froze for a split second, surprised by how directly Isaac referred to Verena as his fiancée. It was clear he had no plans to call off the wedding. Her face lit up with a practiced smile. "You're absolutely right.It's a real honor for Verena that you came for her yourself."



Hearing Laura's comment and recalling what he had overheard on his way in, Isaac frowned slightly. Laura seemed to have no problem talking down to her own daughter.



He was about to speak up when Verena beat him to it."I'd say Isaac is lucky to be marrying me, too. There's no need to put your daughter down."


For a brief moment, lsaac looked surprised. Hlis eyebrows arched in amusement.



Laura's smile vanished. Kaia stared at Verena with wide eyes, shocked that she would say something so bold.



In Kaia's mind, the Willis family could never compare to the Bennett family. She wondered how Verena could possibly be so fearless-how could she say that marrying her was lsaac's stroke of luck?
###Chapter 29 Liar



Laura glared at Verena, ready to lash out, but Isaac spoke up first. He nodded and said quietly, "She's right. Honestly, I do feel lucky to be marrying Verena."



Laura could only stare at him, completely thrown off by his response.



Kaia also turned to look at lsaac, unable to hide her shock. There was even a small, amused smile on his face.



Neither Verena nor Isaac lingered at the house. They said their goodbyes and headed out together.


Once inside the car, Verena looked over at Isaac. She was practically glowing, her eyes full of curiosity.


For a while, Isaac pretended to focus on the scenery outside, but eventually, he couldn't ignore her gaze any longer.



He finally turned and asked, "What's with that look?Why are you staring at me?"



That seemed to snap Verena out of it. She blinked and said,"Oh. I just wanted to know if you meant what you said back there." Isaac gave a slight frown. "Which part are you talking about?"



"All of it," she replied, her tone playful.


In reality, he had only spoken a couple of sentences,but the meaning behind them lingered



When Isaac fell quiet, Verena pressed her hands into the seat and leaned a little closer.



They were both sitting in the back, and Isaac's height made him look even more imposing.


As soon as he noticed her moving closer,he instinctively leaned away.



Verena wasn't going to let him get away that easily.She looked up at him, grinning. "Weren't you supposed to send someone to pick me up? What made you decide to come in person?"



He had sent her a message last night saying the driver would be there in the morning.



Verena had assumed it would be just the chauffeur.She hadn't expected him to show up too.



Isaac really meant to let the driver handle it and meet her at the bridal shop. But when the driver was ready to pull away this morning, he changed his mind on a whim and got in, not bothering to think too hard about it.



"| was just passing by and thought we could go to the bridal shop together," he said, pretending it meant nothing.



"Oh," Verena blurted out, dragging the word slowly though her tone made it clear she didn't believe a word of it. The Bennett Mansion and the Willis Villa were nowhere near each other, and only someone completely clueless would buy his excuse. If he had gone out of his way to come for her, could it mean that feelings he didn't remember were starting to rise back to the surface without him even noticing?



That thought made Verena's smile grow a little wider.


She sat up straighter, and then closed her eyes,settling back as if she wanted to rest for the ride.Isaac noticed her quiet confidence and almost asked if she still doubted his motives. For a moment, he wanted to clear things up, but then he thought better of it. Even if she questioned him, he honestly did not know how to explain his own actions.



Their car rolled to a stop not long after.


A thick winter fog drifted over the streets, making the whole morning feel soft andstill.


Isaac waited in his wheelchair while his assistant moved to help, but Verena stepped forward and placed her hands on the chair's handles. "I'll take care of this."



The assistant hesitated, glancing at Isaac for direction.Isaac gave a small nod, so he simply followed behind,watching the two of them.



Inside the bridal shop, a team of staff members stood by the door, ready to greet them.


As soon as Verena pushed Isaac inside, the staff all bowed politely.



Warmth filled the space, and bright lights danced across glass cases, making every wedding dress look even more dazzling.



A young sales assistant stepped forward, her smile directed at Isaac. "Good morning, Mr. Bennett." Then she turned to Verena, her eyes lighting up."And this must be Mrs. Bennett. She's absolutely stunning."


For a second, Isaac hesitated at the name. Mrs.Bennett?



He almost corrected the assistant, wanting to explain they weren't married just yet, but Verena only gave a small, polite smile. "Thank you," she said, her voice gentle.



Isaac glanced over and noticed her smile. It was warm and sincere, and she did not seem at all bothered by being called Mrs. Bennett.



When Isaac didn't reply, the sales assistant quickly added, "Mr. Bennett, would you like to see our wedding dress styles? | can-"


Isaac cut her off, his tone even. "I'm not particular.Your job is to help Mrs. Bennett with anything she needs."



Verena arched her eyebrow in silent amusement.



The sales assistant forced a quick smile, and then nodded."Yes,absolutely."



Verena took her time looking through the racks and picked out several wedding dresses. Meanwhile, the sales assistant chose a few matching suits for lsaac.


In the end, Verena settled on an off-the-shoulder gown with a flowing train. The back was laced with smooth white ribbons that needed to be tied. Right then, the sales assistant left to find a suit for lsaac.



Once she finished changing, Verena pulled the curtain aside.



The soft sound caught Isaac's attention. He glanced up and stopped short, unable to look away.



There stood Verena, her long hair pinned up with care, and the pale dress brought out the soft glow of her skin.



She wore only a touch of makeup, but it gave her cool, elegant features an unmistakable charm.



When Isaac just stared at her in silence, Verena grinned and called out, "Are you so dazzled you forgot how to speak?"



He shook himself from his thoughts and cleared his throat.



Her smile widened.She had always known how shy he could be. "Come help me out," she remarked.



Without thinking too much, Isaac rolled his chair over to her.



When he reached her, Verena turned away, tilted her head back, and said, "I can't tie up the back of this dress. Give me a hand, will you?"



To make it easier, Verena bent her knees and lowered herself a little.



Isaac glanced down and took in the graceful lines of her shoulders. Her back was smooth and delicate,and a tiny black mole on her left shoulder blade caught his eye, making her look even more intriguing-and somehow oddly familiar. For a moment, Isaac froze. Verena noticed and reached back, placing the ribbons directly into his hands.



She teased him gently,Ir. Bennett, are you going to help or not?"



That snapped him out of it.



He started working on the ribbons, but his fingers were awkward and cool as they brushed against her bare skin. The heat from her back sent a shock through him,and he immediately pulled his hand away.


He fumbled for words. "I, um, maybe the sales assistant should do this part."



He backed his wheelchair away, suddenly too nervous to meet her eyes.


Watching him pull away so quickly, Verena suddenly remembered how she once told him to stop shutting her out. He had promised her back then. Yet here he was,doing the same thing all over again.


She straightened and spoke in a quiet voice. "You're such a liar."



Though she barely spoke above a whisper,Isaac still caught what she said. His gaze dropped, fixated on his unmoving legs. He found himself spiraling, thinking about how she'd let him touch her just now. The problem wasn't her, and deep down, he knew it. For someone like him, feeling broken and less than whole, there were certain things he would always feel were out of reach.



Experience had taught him that nothing in life comes for free, and he couldn't fool himself into believing this marriage was about love. Since she never voiced any complaints, there had to be something else she wanted-and that wasn't him.



The sight of Isaac's brooding silence left Verena with a heavy heart. It was easy to see how much pain he was hiding, and she understood it would take time before he'd be himself again. Pushing him for more wouldn't help either of them.



A gentle smile found its way onto her face as she spoke. "I'll just wait for the assistant, then."


Isaac looked over, surprised to find only kindness and understanding in her eyes. There was no hint of annoyance about his refusal, just a warmth that made himn feel oddly forgiven.



With Verena standing there so at ease, lsaac grew restless, unsure whether he was allowed to reach for what he wanted-almost like a child who didn't know if he was allowed a treat. It surprised him how deeply she'd managed to get under his skin, considering how little time they'd known each other.



He couldn't help watching her for a moment longer,and then looked away.


A moment later, Verena broke the silence. "But..."



Isaac's head snapped up at the sound of her voice.



Closing the curtain, Verena caught his eye. Mischief sparkled in her gaze as she spoke with quiet conviction. "You said you wouldn't shut me out. I'll let you off the hook for now, but next time, you better remember your promise."



Before Isaac could think of a reply, she slipped behind the bright white curtain, the fabric falling quietly in her wake.
###Chapter 30 My Fiancé Gets Embarrassed Too Easily
Isaac froze, his ears filling with the sound of his own heartbeat. Something unfamiliar stirred inside him,sharp enough to crease his brow. It wasn't anger-more like a restless curiosity about this feeling he couldn't quite name. Each time he pushed Verena away,his chest only grew heavier, as if his steady logic slipped for a moment.



His fists tightened as he stared at the curtain drawn tightly in front of him. Without fully thinking it through,he wheeled himself forward, an impulse driving him closer.



His hand caught the fabric, and he pulled it aside.



Verena stood just beyond the opening, her back to him as she adjusted the train of her gown.



The gown's ribbons spilled loose down her spine,the silk strands falling in graceful disarray that somehow felt both elegant and chaotic.



Isaac swallowed hard, his throat working as he forced his eyes away. Still, he moved into the fitting room,stopping only when he was behind her.
Slowly,he lifted his hands to gather the ribbons.



The gentle tug made Verena think the shop assistant had returned to help her.


A small smile curved her lips as she said without glancing back, "Thank you. My fiancé gets embarrassed too easily."



Her voice carried a sweetness she didn't even try to hide, the kind that gave her simple words a note of quiet affection.



Isaac's grip on the ribbons grew firmer. It wasn't the words themselves-it was how carefully she chose them. She never pointed out his limitations, never said a thing about his chair. Instead, she had simply excused him as shy.


Isaac blinked, and then answered quietly, "You're welcome."



The sound of his voice made V/erena whip around in surprise. "You?"she asked.



A warm glow filled her face as her eyes brightened and a sincere smile spread across her lips, soft and unguarded.



Isaac blinked, his lashes trembling slightly as the weight of his earlier behavior settled in-it struck him  then just how overly sensitive he had been.


He closed his mouth into a firm line, lifted his eyes to meet Verena's, and said, "I might be feeling a little shy right now, but there are things we'll need to adjust to,since we're going to be married."



Verena hadn't expected Isaac to come to that kind of understanding so suddenly, and the shift in him caught her off guard.



She tilted her head slightly, her eyes glinting with curiosity. "Do you really believe that?"


Isaac paused for only a moment before answering, "I do."



A smile touched Verena's lips as she replied, "Then I'll count on you, my sweet fiancé."


Those last two words were spoken so lightly they might have passed unnoticed, yet they struck something deep inside Isaac. Just hearing her call him that brought him an odd sense of calm.



"You keep drifting off into your own world," Verena teased,her tone carrying a hint of playfulness.



Her words snapped lsaac back. Only then did he realize she had crouched in front of him, patiently waiting for his help. "My apologies," he said quickly, gathering the loose ribbons to tie them.



He moved with as much care as he could manage, but his fingers brushed against her skin as he worked.



"Your hands are freezing," Verena remnarked with a soft laugh.



Isaac froze, worried his cold fingers brought her discomfort. He was about to pull back and suggest letting an assistant handle it, but Verena spoke again,her voice carrying quiet concern. "Do you have trouble sleeping at night?"



Her question caught him off guard.


After a beat, he gave a small nod. "Yes."


The truth was that the accident had scarred him mnore in spirit than in body. Ever since that day, restless nights and endless nightmares had haunted him. He hated the weakness he carried, hated even more that his survival had come at his father's expense. From then on, sleep had felt heavy and hollow,never bringing him any comfort.


Verena noticed the faint crease in his brow and chose not to press further. She could already guess why he lived with insomnia. Isaac tied the final ribbon just as the sales assistant stepped into the room.



She gave lsaac a small bow and apologized, saying,"I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, Mr. Bennett. There was a mix-up with the stock."



Isaac pressed his lips together before he responded in an even tone, "That's alright."



Not long after, both he and Verena changed into their wedding outfits, and the staff led them to the location for the photos.


Roughly thirty minutes later, their car rolled to a stop.As they stepped out, the photographer welcomed them with a broad grin. "Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett."


Verena sized him up. He was young, with a slight belly,and when he smiled, his eyes curved into cheerful slits,giving him a clumsy but likable appearance.



She returned the smile and nodded politely."We'll be counting on you today."



The process of taking pre-wedding photos turned out to be detailed and slow.



Once the session started,the photographer positioned them carefully, giving instructions step by step. He arranged them so that Verena stood holding a bouquet, her eyes lowered in a soft smile, while Isaac,seated in his wheelchair, was to wrap one arm around her waist and look at her with affection.



A staff member handed the bouquet to Verena, and she moved to stand at Isaac's side.


"Mrs. Bennett, you look stunning. Let's see a smile,"the photographer remarked warmly, showering her with compliments as he adjusted her pose and waited for just the right angle.


Then his attention shifted. "Mr. Bennett, put your arm around your bride's waist."



Isaac's gaze fell on Verena. The gown she wore revealed the sides of her waist, covered only by a thin sheer layer. Placing his hand there would be almost the same as touching her skin.



He stayed still for several seconds, unable to move.



The photographer peeked up from his camera and chuckled. "Mr. Bennett, are you that captivated by how lovely your bride is?"



Verena's eyes slid toward Isaac, amusement flickering in her expression.



Catching her look sent a sharp jolt through him. He quickly turned away and lowered his head.



After more urging from the photographer, he finally raised his arm and rested it on her waist. Because of his seated position, he had to reach higher than felt natural.



The photographer snapped several shots and then checked the screen. Verena's pose was graceful,her smile effortless, but lsaac's hand looked stiff and awkward in the picture. His eyes, instead of showing warmth, were far too serious, leaving the photo without any real trace of romance.



The photographer turned to Isaac with a grin. "Mr.Bennett, these are pre-wedding photos, not a board meeting. You've got to soften up. Let your eyes do the talking-make it look like you adore her so much the camera can feel it."



To demonstrate,the photographer widened his eyes in an exaggerated way, and then squinted dramatically,even making circles with his hands to mimic glasses.



Verena let out a laugh at his performance, while Isaac's long fingers tightened slightly before he answered, "Alright. I'll try."


His reply seemed to reassure the photographer, who went back to arranging them for another pose.



But when he checked the next picture, he groaned. "Mr. Bennett, you look ready to give a speech in front of a crowd, not vow eternal love."



The image told the story. Verena's face glowed, her posture graceful and easy, while Isaac sat rigid.His jaw was set, his eyes fixed with too much resolve. Instead of tenderness, the picture carried the weight of a formal portrait.



They repeated the process again and again, but the results barely changed. The stiffness lingered in every frame.



The photographer's booming instructions slowly wore down to a hoarse murmur, his patience draining.


Isaac couldn't remember the last time he felt this out of place. Since the accident, he had never faced a camera while seated in his chair, and now the weight of it pressed heavily on him. Looking at Verena so effortlessly radiant only made him feel like an intruder in his own wedding photos.



His chin dropped, and both hands pressed tightly against his motionless legs.


Standing close, Verena caught the change in him. As the photographer stepped away to sip his water, she touched Isaac's shoulder and bent down until her lips were near his ear. "Forget about the camera," she whispered. "Just focus on me."

###Chapter 31 Verena Kissed Him
When the photographer came back, he asked Isaac and Verena to shift into a different pose.



He decided on a pose that felt straightforward and did not require much interaction between them.



"Let's try to get the feeling right this time," he said aloud. "Mrs. Bennett, I want you to sit on Mr. Bennett's lap and loop your arms around his neck."



At the mention of "lap," Isaac's brow tightened. His legs might hold steady enough, yet the weakness in them meant that even the smallest slip could send her tumbling.



Catching on to his discomfort, Verena chose not to bring up his legs and instead teased lightly, "Relax, I'm not that heavy."



His eyes lingered on her, and a quiet warmth stirred inside.She clearly understood his concern had nothing to do with her weight.



Words were about to leave his lips when the photographer cut in, saying, "Mr. Bennett, if you think she might slip, hold her back and steady her head with

your hands."


Before he could even register the instructions, Verena had perched sideways on his lap, her toes brushing against the floor.



Since Isaac had no sensation in his legs, he never noticed that Verena was hardly placing her weight on him.



She slipped her slender arms around his neck, and her skin felt both cool and soft against him.



The brush of her skin sent a sudden tension through him, and his hands moved instinctively to steady her back. His legs gave him nothing, but his chest could not ignore the warmth pressing against it.



Balancing with the help of her legs, Verena leaned close enough that her upper body pressed against his.


When he lowered his eyes, he caught the sweep of her lashes, the sharp line of her nose, and the bold color painted across herlips.



So close to her now, lsaac breathed in a gentle fragrance, a sweetness that seemed to drift through the very air around them.



"That's it, wonderful!" said the photographer as he kept giving instructions. "Now lean in a bit closer."
At his words, Verena tugged Isaac's head lower toward her.



Leaning in, Isaac found himself staring directly into her eyes.



Not content yet, the photographer pushed them further, saying, "Closer. Closer than that."


On this attempt, Isaac leaned in without waiting,and before Verena could guide him, he was already close.A smile spread across her face, delighted by his initiative.



Verena's expression struck the photographer as flawless, and he nearly clicked the shutter right then.Yet when his eyes shifted to lsaac, he spotted the stiffness in Isaac's posture.



The photographer clicked his tongue thoughtfully and said, "Let's try something else. Touch noses for me,show a little more closeness."



Verena gave a small nod and lifted her chin, brushing the tip of her nose against Isaac's.


The moment Verena leaned closer, the photographer snapped the shot.



Her shift made Isaac's lashes tremble, and the hand resting at her back gripped more firmly without him

 realizing it.



A faint wince crossed Verena's face as the pressure brushed against a bruise from earlier.



He quickly eased his hold and met her eyes with regret. "I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?"


She gave a calm shake of her head, unbothered. "It's nothing. Let's keep going."



Holding her position steady, Verena stayed still while Isaac's thoughts drifted. "Did I hurt you..." The words echoed in his mind as if he had spoken them to someone once before.



Catching his faraway look, Verena angled her head and, to her own surprise, pressed her lips against his.



When her warm lips touched his cool ones, a fierce spark rushed through Isaac's thoughts like a sudden current.



In that instant, Isaac forgot how to think or move,and only the steady throb in his neck reminded him that Verena had kissed him.



Watching the scene unfold, the photographer's face lit with satisfaction, and he snapped the shot at once.



"These turned out better than l imagined." He stepped back,eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he studied the shots one by one.



At the sound of the photographer's praise, Verena eased back a little from lsaac.



While pulling back, she caught sight of something amusing. Isaac's ears burned red with shyness, yet his expression showed no trace of anger.



The look on his face tempted Verena, and she decided to tease him.



Following her playful impulse, she leaned in close,smiling as she whispered gently into his ear, "You were the one who got distracted, so I had to think of something. Otherwise, the photographer would grow impatient. And hey, we're getting married soon, so this shouldn't be that big of a deal, right?"


Her words came in a softened tone, and she tilted her head,looking straight into Isaac's eyes with a spark of mischief.



A visible swallow moved along lsaac's throat as her gaze held him, and he quickly lowered his eyes. His voice, rougher than he noticed, came out as he murmured, "Sure... it's fine."


Verena accepted his answer with a nod, let her teasing drop,and smiled while lifting herself from his lap.



After holding that posture for so long, her legs had gone numb, and her soles tingled sharply as though pierced by countless tiny needles.



Isaac saw the way she shifted her legs and caught the strain on her face, yet he chose not to ask about it.



Once that moment passed, the rest of the shoot moved along with unexpected ease, free from the serious look the photographer had stressed earlier.



By the time the session ended, the clock had slipped past ten in the evening. Isaac brought Verena home before telling the driver to continue on to the Bennett Mansion.



Inside the car, lsaac took the contract from his assistant's hand, but not a word on the page would stay in his mind. Instead, the memory of Verena's kiss kept replaying, the delicate warmth still lingering on his lips.



Caught in that memory, Isaac's fingers drifted up and brushed his lips without him realizing it.


The assistant repeated Isaac's name more than once,but no answer came back.



Through the rearview mirror, the assistant noticed Isaac's fingers resting against his lips.


In a louder tone, he called out, "Mr. Bennett,are your gums hurting?" Startled out of his thoughts by the sudden volume,Isaac pulled his hand back and gripped the contract,saying, "No, I.. only noticed a problem with the contract."



"What?" The word "problem" sent a jolt of tension through the assistant. As he turned to look, his mouth hung open in disbelief. "Mr. Bennett, you... the contract is upside down."



When Isaac glanced down and saw the words printed upside down, he quickly adjusted the pages,as though snapping out of a dream.



Noticing the shock on his assistant's face, Isaac cleared his throat and mumbled with unease, "Today ...the photo shoot wore me out a little."


The assistant could hardly believe it. Wore him out?



Never before had he heard lsaac, the tireless workaholic, confess to exhaustion.



Though surprised, he gave a nod, silently recognizing the effort Isaac had made.







After they finished taking the pre-wedding photos,Verena started getting busy with other things. 
During her time overseas, she began taking patients suited for traditional treatments. Along with the newcomers, she still kept in touch with her longtime patients for regular follow-ups


On this particular day, Barrie was scheduled for his follow-up visit.



Her errands kept her out until late in the afternoon,after which she drove straight to the Lyons family's residence.



At the same time in the Willis Villa, Laura stood behind Kaia in the dressing room, resting her hands firmly on the girl's shoulders. With a tone both earnest and serious, she said, "Kaia, tonight marks Mr. and Mrs.Lyons' thirtieth wedding anniversary. Many powerful guests will be at the party. When you attend,you must build connections with them. Do you understand?"

###Chapter 32 Do You Happen To Know Dr. Willis
The Lyons family had nothing to do with the Willis family, so Kaia couldn't believe it when Slater suddenly sent her an invitation.



When Kaia saw the invitation, she didn't know what to think. Laura, however, immediately guessed that Slater might be interested in Kaia.



The idea excited Kaia, though she could only remember one embarrassing moment when he skipped out on her birthday party. Aside from that,they hardly spoke. Maybe Slater only reached out because he was close with Bobby, and since she had been interacting with Bobby a lot recently, he felt it natural to include her too. Whatever the reason, Kaia didn't mind. As long as the connection worked in her favor,she welcomed it.



"Mom,you don't need to remind me. I already know what I'm doing," said Kaia, proudly adjusting the pearl necklace in front of the mirror. She turned slightly and asked, "How do I look?"



Laura's eyes softened as she watched her daughter dress so carefully. "You look beautiful, sweetheart. The prettiest of them all."



Laura stood behind her, fixing a few strands of Kaia's hair before another thought came to her.



"Oh, isn't Slater's grandfather Barrie in poor health?Since you're studying medicine, you could show him a few ways to take better care of himself.Maybe even send some health supplements. His son and daughter -in-law are known to be very devoted. If Barrie takes a liking to you, it could open doors for us."



In Shoildon, the Lyons family didn't hold as much power as the Bennett family, but they were still influential. If the Willis family managed to win their favor, their standing in the city would rise quickly.



Kaia fully understood the value of her mother's suggestion and knew exactly why it mattered.


She turned to her mother with a confident smile."You don't have to worry, Mom. I've already taken care of everything. Just relax."



Pleased that Kaia grasped her intentions, Laura brushed her fingers across her daughter's cheek. "You really are thoughtful."



Then Laura's smile faded as she thought of Verena."Your grandmother spoiled Verena too much. I can't count on her anymore." Noticing that Laura had completely lost faith in Verena, Kaia didn't bother to offer false comfort anymore. She simply held her mother's hand and said sweetly, "But you still have me,right?"



Laura's pride swelled at Kaia's words. Even if Verena was beyond saving,she still had her younger daughter.From childhood, Kaia had always been exceptional.She was even considered a lucky star, since the family became millionaires shortly after her birth.



As she grew older, Kaia stood out in her studies, and it seemed likely she would one day become a respected doctor who brought honor to the family. It was proof that children thrived when they grew up beside their parents. The difference between Kaia and Verena made that obvious.








Even on her way to the Lyons estate, Kaia clung to the hope that Slater might like her.


It wasn't until Slater gave her a polite nod and told someone to show her to the party venue that Kaia understood she was nothing more than one guest among many.



"Do you want me to send these gifts to your grandfather?" asked Slater's assistant, gesturing toward the stack of boxes Kaia had brought.

 Slater had never thought well of Kaia, and the only reason he invited her was to ease his guilt for skipping her birthday party.


What he truly couldn't stand was the way Kaia tried so desperately, and so insincerely, to force a connection with him.



Slater glanced at the boxes, and then waved dismissively. "Put them in the warehouse. After the party, let the servants divide them up."



The assistant nodded and quickly ordered the staff to move the boxes into storage.



The Lyon family's estate had two main buildings. The party was held in the front building, while the back was kept more private.



Kaia quickly grew bored at the party since everyone already seemed familiar with one another, leaving her with no chance to join in.



Frustrated, Kaia slipped out of the party with a glass of red wine and strolled onto the small briddge that led toward the back garden.



Then she caught sight of a white figure ahead and stiffened. Was that Verena? What was she doing here?



Her eyes went wide, and without thinking, Kaia  followed after her.



She trailed behind until she realized Verena was making her way toward Barrie's quarters.



Kaia's thoughts raced. It couldn't be true. What connection could Verena possibly have with Barrie?



Even though she struggled to believe it, a ripple of worry spread through her chest.



She hurried her steps, trying to close the gap between herself and the woman ahead.



Just a few steps later, a familiar voice called out behind her, "Who are you sneaking after? You look way too suspicious."



Bobby shifted his gaze to where Kaia was looking.Ahead of them, a woman in a white dress with long hair walked away, her figure strikingly familiar.



Kaia's nerves spiked again. Bobby had mentioned that he wanted to meet Verena. If he realized the woman ahead of them was her, everything would fall apart.He might decide Verena was good enough to be his sister -in-law and stop trying to break the marriage arrangement. Worse still, all the lies Kaia had told him about Verena would collapse the moment he saw her face. She couldn't let that happen.



Thinking fast, Kaia spun around and pulled out her

  phone. "I'm not following anyone. I was just looking around. Anyway, didn't you say you wanted to meet Verena? I can give you her contact info so you two can talk<.”



Her words caught Bobby off guard, though he still looked skeptical. "You're serious?"


Kaia nodded quickly. "Of course. Why would I lie about that?"



Bobby pulled his phone from his jacket pocket."Alright then. I'll trust you on this one."


Once he sent the friend request, Bobby held out his phone for her tosee."This the right one?"



Kaia gave it a quick glance, and then smiled as she nodded. "Yeah, that's her."



Satisfied with her answer, Bobby slipped his phone back into his pocket and walked off without another word.



The moment he left, Kaia pulled out her phone. She switched to her alternate account and accepted Bobby's request.



There was no way she'd let Bobby meet Verena, so she wasn't foolish enough to give him a real number.


In fact, she hadn't even added Verena on any chat app  herself.



By the time midnight drew near, the party had finally come to an end.



In Barrie's room, Verena had just completed another round of treatment for him.



Barrie had been feeling much stronger recently, and tonight he leaned against the headboard with a cheerfuL expression.



"I'm really sorry for taking up so much of your time,Dr. Willis," Barrie said apologetically.


Verena gave a calm smile. "Please don't say that. It's part of my responsibility."


After exchanging a few more words with him, Verena excused herself and left the room.



By then, most guests had already drifted out of the front building. After saying goodbye to Slater, Bobby was ready to head out as well.



Just as he turned to leave, he stopped short. A woman in a white wool coat and faded denim jeans passed by.Her skin was luminous, her lashes curled delicately,and her profile was striking. What caught him most was her cool, almost untouchable air. That was...



"Hey!" Bobby shouted as he rushed after her. Verena came to a stop, her brows knitting as she turned to the young man blocking her path. "Who are you?"



"I'm the one you pulled out of that wreck. You saved me after the crash," said Bobby, his voice rushing with excitement.



At his words, Verena finally recalled the incident.


She gave a small nod. "So, what is it? Are you feeling unwell, or do you need something from me?"


Bobby nodded eagerly, words rushing to the tip of his tongue but refusing to come out. "I've got something to tell you, but... give me a moment to find the right words."



"Do you happen to know Dr.Willis?"

###Chapter 33 Should I
Compete With You



Bobby was about to speak when Slater came over and asked if he knew Dr. Willis.



"Dr. Willis?" Bobby blinked in disbelief, his eyes flicking to Verena before he turned to Slater. "Wait-are you saying she's the one who treated your grandfather?"



Slater gave a firm nod. "Yeah. That's her."



Bobby stared at Verena, stunned. "You're not just gorgeous-you're talented too?"



Noticing the awe on Bobby's face, Slater asked curiously, "Wait,do you actually know her?"



Bobby swallowed hard and gave a quick nod. "She's the doctor who pulled me through after my car accident."



Leaning closer,Bobby whispered with barely contained excitement, "She's exactly the kind of woman I'd want as my sister-in-law."



Slater let out a short laugh. "What are the odds of that?"
All of a sudden, every argument they'd had felt meaningless.



Catching their exchange, Verena gave Bobby a warm smile. "It was nothing, really. I'm just glad to see you doing well."


That easy smile left Bobby frozen in place.She really was everything he imagined-beautiful, graceful, and impossible to ignore.


When Slater caught Bobby grinning like a fool, he gave him a teasing shove.



Bobby snapped out of his daze, suddenly remembering something important. "Oh, right, Dr.Willis." His voice grew urgent. "If you were able to treat Slater's grandfather, then your skills must be remarkable. I need your help. My brother's legsare paralyzed... do you think there's any chance he can be treated?"



Bobby had been tempted to blurt out that she should be his sister-in-law, but he knew he'd only get yelled at for that. Instead, he took the long way around,hoping lsaac would eventually see for himself how kind and extraordinary the doctor truly was.



Noticing his desperation, Verena gave him a calm smile. "It's hard to explain in words. Every case is different, and I can't say anything for sure until I see the patient myself."


By coincidence, she happened to be studying Isaac's condition at that very time.



Bobby's brow creased as he asked, "Have you ever treated someone with leg paralysis?"


Verena answered calmly,"I've worked on two cases like that before. And I'm currently treating a patient with leg paralysis."


His words rushed out. "And did they recover?"


Verena gave a small nod. "It took years of treatment and steady recovery, but in the end, both of them walked again."



The moment her words sank in, Bobby lit up, all thoughts of his earlier schemes vanishing. "Dr. Willis,please-you have to help my brother."


Verena's voice stayed steady. "I'll need to examine him first before I can say anything."



Even though surgery still weighed on her mind as a difficult barrier, she knew she had to keep pushing herself to face patients directly.



Bobby held out his phone eagerly. "Can I add you on the chat app? I promise I won't bother you with random messages." After a moment of thought, Verena nodded."Alright."



The second she agreed, Bobby broke into a wide smnile.



Once she added him, Verena slipped her phone back into her pocket. "When you're home, ask your brother if he's willing to meet me. If he agrees,we can set up a time."



Bobby nodded over and over. "Alright, alright-I'll talk to him for sure."



With a slight press of her lips, Verena offered a calm smile and said, "Well then, I suppose it's time for me to go."



The moment Verena mentioned leaving, Bobby cheerfully waved her off and kept smiling until she disappeared through the front gates.



Slater, unable to watch any longer, shoved Bobby's hand down. "Seriously? She's already gone, and you're still standing here grinning like an idiot."



Bobby folded his arms and lifted his chin with pride."What do you expect? She's smart,gorgeous, and the perfect sister-in-law. I could smile at her all day without getting tired of it."



Slater couldn't stand that smug expression on his face. He let out an exaggerated gasp. "Oh, right-I never told you. My grandpa once said I should go after Dr.Willis myself. So what now? Should I compete with you to see if she'd rather be my girlfriend or your sister-in-law?"



Bobby's temper flared. "Dream on! She's already destined to be my sister-in-law. You don't get to challenge Isaac. And if you try... I'll-"


He jabbed a finger at Slater, paused dramatically for a few seconds, and then blurted out his so-called threat. "I'll cut you off as a friend!"



Once upon a time, Slater never would've been able to measure up to Isaac. But now, with Isaac bound by his disability, things weren't the same anymore.


After throwing out his so-called threat, Bobby didn't bother waiting for a reaction. He wasn't angry-just in a rush to get home.



Left standing in the chilly night, Slater shook his head as Bobby stormed off. "Unbelievable. I was joking,and he's already acting like we're about to break up as friends."




...



Back home, Bobby sprawled across his bed, his eyes fixed on the ceiling Phone in hand, his gaze stayed locked on the new contact he'd just added-Dr. Willis.



Her profile picture was nothing but a white backdrop,simple yet giving off a calm, reserved vibe.



Still, Bobby was convinced she carried both wisdom and grace.



With that thought in mind, Bobby tapped her profile,erased the name "Dr. Willis," and proudly renamed it "Perfect Sis-in-Law."



He admired the change for a moment, and then went back to his homepage looking pleased with himself.


Earlier that day,he had gotten Verena's number from Kaia and added her as a friend. Her profile now sat just beneath the one he labeled as Perfect Sis-in-Law.



When his eyes landed on the golden profile picture,Bobby let out a mocking sneer. "So tacky. No sense of style at all."



He opened her chat and quickly sent a message,saying, "Verena Willis,I want to meet. Tell me when you're free."



Whether Verena was right for lsaac or not, her past lies about her education and her attempt to disfigure her sister had already filled him with disgust. Normally,

 he wouldn't have bothered with someone like her. But since she was about to join their family, he had no choice but to meet her face-to-face. He was determined to uncover who she really was and how she managed to fool lsaac so completely.



He sat there with his phone in hand, eyes fixed on the screen as he waited for her reply.


Meanwhile, over at the Willis Villa, Kaia sat before her vanity, her makeup still perfect, yet her expression was clouded with frustration.



Anyone could tell her mood had soured completely.


A knock came at the door, and Laura's voice followed."Kaia, who did you meet today? Tell me everything."


Kaia bit her lip as she unclasped her necklace. "Mom,not tonight. I'm exhausted and just want to sleep."


Laura longed to hear about her daughter's social wins,but after Kaia's response, she had no choice but to drop the subject.
###Chapter 34 Bobby Confronts Verena
Laura gave a small nod before saying, "Alright, get some rest. We'll catch up tomorrow."


Once the sound of footsteps vanished down the hall,Kaia flung the pearl necklace to the side without hesitation.



When Kaia returned home earlier, Laura had noticed something was weighing on her and asked if the evening had gone poorly.



Instead of explaining, Kaia had shaken her head,claimed she was tired, and quickly used that excuse to head upstairs.



The truth was different. Kaia wasn't tired at all, but she couldn't figure out why Verena had appeared at the Lyons family residence. What baffled her even more was the sight of Verena inside Barrie's quarters. Barrie held status and influence, yet Verena, who had no place in that circle, dared to show up there?



An uneasy feeling pressed against Kaia's thoughts. She tried piecing it together, but no matter how long she turned it over in her mind, she found no answer. At last, she told herself she must have been imagining

  things. After all, someone like Verena couldn't possibly have ties to Barrie.



With that idea to cling to, her nerves finally began to settle.



Kaia pulled out her phone, intending to check the wealthy young people's group chat, hoping to see if anything new had been shared.



When the chat app loaded, she realized she had signed into her alternate account, where one unread message was waiting.



Since that account remained private, she instantly knew Bobby was the one who had sent it.


She tapped into their conversation and read his note about wanting to meet Verena, which curved her lips into a smirk. The sharpness in his words revealed just how little regard he had for Verena.


That thought made Kaia laugh, though it still didn't satisfy her. What she really wanted was to see Bobby push with everything he had to put an end to Verena and Isaac's wedding.



It was clear to Kaia that Bobby's pride left no room for anyone trying to tell him what to do.



Her eyes dropped to her phone as her fingers danced quickly across the screen. Once she reread the message for accuracy, she hit send without hesitation.



When Bobby's phone buzzed, he snatched it up, sat bolt upright in bed, and gawked at the screen in shock.



The words on his screen made him read them twice."You need to stop speaking to me with such disrespect. I'll be your brother's wife soon, and as Isaac's brother, the least you can do is show me courtesy."



Rage surged through Bobby as he reread the message.He knew he had been sharp with her on purpose, and even if his tone wasn't polite, who gave her the right to call him out? She wasn't even married into the family yet, and she was already strutting around like she owned the place. If she behaved like this now,what kind of arrogance would she show once she officially joined the Bennett family?



His thumbs flew across the screen as he responded,"You're not Isaac's wife yet. I'll speak to you however I damn well please, and it's not your concern."



The moment Kaia saw his response, a slow, satisfied smile curled across her lips. Bobby was already losing patience, and that was exactly what she wanted. If she kept pressing, his resentment toward Verena would deepen, and he'd soon be desperate to block the marriage altogether.

 She leaned back and began typing again. "Do you think I enjoy wasting my time on you? If you weren't Isaac's brother, I wouldn't bother at all. Once I marry him, I'll be part of the Bennett family, which makes it my responsibility to correct you. If I don't straighten you out now, people will say members of our Bennett family have no manners. That shame won't just fall on you-it will stain all of us."



The message sent Bobby into a fury. She was already tossing around phrases like "our Bennett family," as though she had a claim to it. She hadn't even joined the family yet, and still she dared to posture like a rightful Bennett.



Fingers pounding against the screen, Bobby snapped,"Listen carefully. Don't try to play teacher with me.Unless I decide otherwise, you'll never be my sister-in -law, not now, not ever. And don't forget, the wedding hasn't even happened yet. You act like it's guaranteed, but if you fail to step into the Bennett family, don't come crying about it later."



When the message was sent, Bobby closed the app and flung his phone carelessly onto the nightstand.



Each time Bobby thought about Verena beside Dr.Willis, it only made him more determined to steer Isaac toward marrying the doctor. After just a handful of conversations with that cold and cunning woman, he caught himself wanting to march over and ask Dr.Willis to marry lsaac on the spot. A woman like her,kind, elegant, and lovely, was exactly what lsaac needed.



It drove him crazy wondering how two people sharing the same last name could be so completely opposite.



Silence filled the room as Bobby's fist crashed against the mattress. Forget Verena-what mattered nowN was finding a way to bring lsaac and Dr. Willis together. He had no doubt that once they met, lsaac would be captivated.



Of course, Bobby understood his brother well enough to know that a direct suggestion would be rejected outright. But if he disguised it as a medical consultation, Isaac might agree without resistance.That way, his condition could be treated while their bond quietly deepened-a flawless plan.



The image of Isaac healthy again and standing beside Dr. Willis played vividly in Bobby's mind, fueling his resolve like fire.



Jumping to his feet, Bobby shoved on his shoes and strode quickly out of the room.



At the same time, Kaia studied Bobby's latest message,her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.



His sharp response confirmed he was seething, and Verena's reputation in his eyes was beyond repair.


The thought brought a smug smile to Kaia's lips as she hummed a light tune on her way to the bathroom to wash off her makeup.


As long as Bobby blocked the marriage, her lie would remain safe, because Verena would never get the chance to cross paths with him.



Inside the Bennett Mansion, Bobby made his way down the hall until he reached Isaac's door.



Remembering how badly Isaac had snapped at him the last time he barged in, Bobby decided to knock politely this time.


Isaac's voice called out, "Come in." Bobby placed his hand on the knob, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.



There he found Isaac propped against the headboard,a thick book resting in his hands.


With a forced laugh, Bobby strolled closer and teased,"So,buried in a book again?"


Setting the book down on the blanket, Isaac lifted his eyes and said, "Alright, what do you want?"


Dragging a chair from the desk, Bobby sat near the bed and grinned. "What else could it be?I just felt like  talking."



Most people might have believed him, but lsaac knew better. Bobby never came by at this hour unless something was on his mind.


After lifting the book again, Isaac resumed reading and said,"If you don't have a point, then get out."


Snatching the book from lsaac's hands, Bobby blurted out, "Okay, okay-I'lL say it."


Isaac kept his calm, watching Bobby in silence.



Meeting Isaac's steady gaze, Bobby's mouth tightened as he hesitated.



What he wanted was to rant about Verena's arrogance,but the memory of lsaac's harsh scolding last time made him switch tactics instead.



"So here's the thing-I came across an incredible doctor recently." Bobby's eyes sparked with enthusiasm as he leaned forward. "You wouldn't believe it. Every other doctor failed with Barrie's illness, but she actually managed to stabilize him!"

###Chapter 35 Why Not Just Give Her A Chance
Bobby leaned forward eagerly and blurted out, "Isaac,I've already added her on the chat app. Why don't you set up a time to meet her? I swear, with her skills, she could fix your legs for sure!"



He was too caught up in his own excitement to notice the faint crease forming on Isaac's brow.



The mention of Barrie's so-called recovery pulled a smirk from lsaac. Dozens of renowned doctors had failed, and yet this one was supposed to succeed?



Picking up his book, Isaac flipped the page and said evenly, "That won't be necessary. I know my own condition better than anyone. No matter how capable she is, it makes no difference for me."


While he spoke, an image of Verena surfaced in his thoughts.Why was it only her that stirred hope in him,only her he felt he could believe in?



His lips pressed into a thin line before he added, "I'm already in treatment. You don't need to involve yourself in this."



Up until now, Cayden had been the one overseeing  Isaac's treatment. So when Isaac mentioned being in treatment, Bobby immediately assumed Cayden was still handling it. He vaguely recalled Cayden once admitting that the surgery carried no more than a thirty percent chance of success.



It wasn't that Bobby distrusted Cayden's abilities, but faced with the promise of a doctor who appeared even more remarkable, his loyalties naturally shifted.


After all, Dr. Willis had claimed she'd successfully cured two patients with leg paralysis-and if that was true, then surely she was the better choice.



Realizing Isaac wasn't going to agree easily, Bobby decided to pour on the charm and persuasion.



"Isaac, I'm asking you to believe me. This doctor isn't ordinary. Think back to Barrie's illness a few years ago -every specialist, here and overseas, refused to take the risk of that impossible heart transplant. But she did it,and she pulled it off flawlessly. Please, just meet her once. Maybe she really can change everything for you."



When Isaac kept his eyes locked on the book,showing no sign of giving in, Bobby grew frantic and yelled,"Don't you even want the chance to walk on your own again?"



For just a second Isaac's hand stilled on the page, but then he calmly turned it and kept reading.


Catching himself, Bobby slapped a hand over his mouth and murmured, "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac."


Trying to recover, he added, "I only meant she's exceptional. If she could handle Barrie's case, she can handle yours too. Why not just give her a chance?"


Isaac had tolerated Bobby's endless peading,but the refusal to drop the subject left him weary,and a dull ache began to settle in his temples.


At last, Isaac closed the book, fixed him with a cold,unblinking look, and said, "Barrie's illness is different from mine, so don't compare them. Your praise for that doctor is just the view of an outsider, and it means nothing to me. I have no reason to meet her,and I won't be accepting her treatment."


Then his voice turned firm as he instructed, "That's enough. It's late. Go back to your room."



Bobby had clung to the hope that lsaac might finally say yes,but the blunt refusal knocked the wind out of him. A wave of sadness and frustration washed over him, because in his heart, everything he said had only been for lsaac's sake.


Bobby kept his frustration to himself. If Isaac didn't want him stepping in, then fine-he'd stop wasting energy on someone who clearly didn't want the help. Let him pick whichever doctor he wanted, and if he had someone in mind to marry, then so be it. That was his business now.



Resigned to it, Bobby sighed out a flat "okay" before dragging himself back to his room.







In the days that followed, Verena spent her time shuttling between the Lyons estate and the Willis Villa.


At last, after two long weeks of treatment,Verena pulled out the final needle from Barrie's leg and smiled. "Congratulations. From here on out, you won't need these sessions anymore."



Before Barrie had a chance to respond, Slater's eyes lit up with joy. "Are you serious, Dr. Willis? My grandpa truly doesn't need the treatment anymore?"



Verena gave a confident nod, and Slater immediately bowed in gratitude. "Thank you so much,Dr.Willis."


She steadied him by the shoulders and smiled. "His progress is thanks in part to the care you've given him."


"Indeed." From the bed, Barrie clasped Slater's hand,his dim eyes filled with warmth. "You've grown thin looking after me like this."



Placing his firm hand over Barrie's frail one, Slater met his gaze with devotion. "Grandpa, I don't feel tired at all. Nothing matters more than your health."


As Verena watched the tender exchange between grandfather and grandson, her thoughts drifted to her own grandmother, Shawna. If only Shawna were still alive... Without her, Verena had no real family left in this world.



A tightness formed in her throat, but Verena forced the memory away with a steady blink.


Turning back to Slater, she instructed, "His condition is stable,but small problems remain that need medicine.I'll write down the prescriptions, and you can handle preparing them for him."


Slater gave a firm nod. "Alright, I'll take care of it."



Devoted as ever, Slater personally took charge of preparing every dose of Barrie's medicine.



When Verena handed over the prescriptions and finished her instructions, she added warmly, "That's everything for now. I won't be coming for the treatments anymore, but if your grandfather feels unwell, just call me. Unless something unusual keeps me away, I'll come without hesitation."



Overwhelmed with gratitude, Slater kept thanking her again and again for helping his grandfather recover. Once Verena departed, Slater carried the herbal medicine she prescribed into the kitchen and began preparing the brew himself.


As the herbs simmered, Slater pulled out his phone and snapped a quick picture of the steaming pot


Grinning with pride, he uploaded the photo with a caption:"These remedies are working-Grandpa's legs are finally improving. Couldn't be happier!"



Back at the Willis Villa, relaxing on the sofa, Kaia scrolled idly through her phone until Slater's update appeared, sending a rush of excitement through her.The herbs and supplements she had sent to the Lyons estate had actually taken effect.


Pride swelled in her chest, and a smile tugged at her lips. Even the remedies she had chosen so casually were helping Barrie heal-it almost felt like proof she had a natural talent for medicine.



Scrolling back to reread his post, Kaia's grin widened until she let out a laugh. Everyone knew how devoted Slater was to his grandfather, so if Barrie's recovery was tied to the herbs and supplements she gave, then surely Slater would start viewing her differently.



From the couch nearby, Laura shifted her gaze from the TV when she heard Kaia laughing and asked with curiosity, "Kaia, what's on your phone that's got you so cheerful?"



With her cheeks warm from excitement, Kaia eagerly passed the phone to her mother and said, "Mom,you've got to see what Slater posted."



Peering at the screen for a moment, Laura's eyes went wide in surprise. "Goodness! Is that the same herbal medicine you sent over before?"
###Chapter 36 Since When Do You Care About Me
With a smug lift of her brow, Kaia remarked, "What else do you expect? Others hand out jewels or overpriced trinkets, but I'm the one who gave herbs and supplements."



At those words, Laura's face glowed with pride as she cupped Kaia's cheeks. "That's my daughter.Absolutely extraordinary!"



Satisfaction welled up in Laura's heart. She had always believed Kaia brought fortune to the family. After all,it was only after giving birth to Kaia that their fortunes rose,giving them the means to invest and step into high society.



Even with the Bennett family offering them advantages through marriage, Laura could sense Danica's condescension toward them.



In Laura's mind, whatever benefits came from the Bennetts would never last forever.



What she longed for were lasting gains, and winning the Lyons family's respect while widening her circle was far more valuable. Praise from a parent always struck deep, and Kaia's eyes curved with pride as satisfaction spread across her face.



From this moment, Laura grew more certain of one undeniable truth.



Gripping Kaia's shoulders, Laura spoke with fiery enthusiasm. "Kaia, do you see it now? Society is full of pretty socialites, but respected doctors are rare.The higher a family climbs, the more they obsess over their health. That's why you must master medicine.Once you do, powerful families will line up for your attention."



Her imagination ran wild with images of the most powerful people bending over backward to win her favor, and the very thought filled her with glee.



Catching Laura's meaning, Kaia nodded eagerly.She said sweetly, "Mom, you don't have to worry. I'll take medicine seriously. Just think, if it weren't for the herbs and supplements I picked out, Slater's grandfather would probably still be stuck in bed.Clearly, I've got a real gift for this."



Laura's heart swelled with relief at Kaia's words, but before she could respond, Verena stepped in from the doorway.



The sight of the cozy scene between mother anddaughter didn't surprise Verena anymore; she had grown desensitized to it.



She was about to slip by without a word when Laura's voice cut through the room.



"Where did you run off to this time?" Laura asked.



Before, Laura wouldn't have cared where Verena had gone. Yet with Kaia filling her with pride today, she couldn't help but measure one daughter against the other. How could her two daughters be so completely different?



The more she compared them, the more bitterness and resentment churned in her chest.



Stopping in her tracks, Verena shot Laura a sidelong glance. "Since when do you care about me?"



Laura shot up from her seat, clearly put off by Verena's tone. "Who do you think you're trying to impress with that superior act? Save it for someone else who'll actually put up with it."



Laura's gaze drifted proudly to Kaia. "See the difference? Kaia has always been thoughtful and obedient. She's in college now, and every teacher sings her praises. Just recently, with a few herbs she picked out, she even managed to help someone recover." Then she turned, pointing a sharp finger at Verena."And you? You failed to get into college, and then wasted time trailing after some self-taught village healer, picking up nothing but a foultemper.At your age, you're still a nobody. You can't even greet your own mother properly-forget skill, you don't even have basic manners."



Silent,Verena fixed her gaze on Laura. Each word felt like a needle pressing into her skin, hitting the rawest part of her.



From the day her younger sister was born, she had sensed Laura's dislike. Still, she had never imagined that, in her mother's eyes, she meant absolutely nothing. She had told herself she wanted nothing from her parents, that nothing could wound her anymore.But why then did the chill inside feel so sharp?



Her throat constricted, and she forced a faint curl of her lips. In a near whisper, she said, "Ye5, I am rude,because after | turned seven, I no longer had a mother."



The year Kaia was born, Verena had just turned seven,and from that moment, a mother's affection vanished from her life.



Laura remained rooted in place after hearing those words, her mind blank, and it was only after Verena disappeared upstairs that she slowly returned to Kaia caught sight of the odd look on Laura's face, a look she despised whenever it was connected to Verena.



Biting her lip, Kaia moved closer and clutched her mother's arm. "Mom, with Verena's attitude, do you honestly think she is fit for joining the Bennett family?"



The moment she heard the question,whatever mix of emotions had been on Laura's face gave way to a firm,unyielding look.



Casting a cold glance toward the staircase, Laura remarked, "Suitable or not, she has to marry into the Bennett family."



Kaia understood all too well that profit always outweighed everything else in Laura's eyes. Her question hadn't been to get the answer she wanted but only to shift Laura's focus. The last thing she wanted was to watch her mother show guilt toward Verena.



With the moment behind them,Laura and Kaia settled back on the sofa, slipping easily into their familiar bond.



As Laura turned her attention back to the television,Kaia busied herself by boasting about her newest triumph to her circle of shallow friends. Inside the group chat with her friends, KCaia eagerly sent a message, saying, "Girls, I've got some good news to share."



Almost immediately, a friend replied in excitement,"What happened? Spill it!"


Kaia snapped a screenshot of Slater's update,dropped it into the chat, and added, "See this? The herbs and supplements I gave actually worked, didn't they?"


One of the women who also followed Slater reacted in shock. "Seriously? Those herbs in his post came from you?"


With pride swelling in her chest, Kaia answered,"That's right. I am studying medicine after all. I simnply chose some herbs and supplements that suited his grandfather's condition, and to my surprise, they worked."



At the end of her message, she tacked on a shy little emoji.



The chat quickly filled with envy, her friends gushing again and again about how amazing it was to be studying medicine.



Then one of them asked, "Kaia, after helping them like that, the Lyons family has to invite you to dinner,don't they?" Another one quickly added, "Dinner is just the beginning. With the Lyons family's influence, your position in society is sure to climb, Kaia."


Reading their chatter, Kaia couldn't hide her wide grin as she responded, "Please, I didn't help Slater's grandfather just to get a free meal."



Even as she denied it, her thoughts were already drifting into daydreams. After all, with the help she'd given, it was only natural that the Lyons family would invite her to dinner. And dinner with the Lyons family meant more than food-it meant an opening.




...


Back in her room, Verena showered, settled at her desk, and reached for her phone to send lsaac a message.
###Chapter 37 A Husband Reporting To His Wife

Verena sent a message, saying, "Just a gentle reminder. Don't forget you have treatment tomorrow morning."



At that moment, Isaac was tending to the plants on his balcony when the message came through.



Placing the watering can aside, he reached for his phone and answered, "Alright. I'll remember."



From experience, Verena knew he was the type tocut conversations short. Perched on the edge of her bed with a towel in hand, she rubbed her damp hair and asked, "Still awake? What are you doing right now?"



Without giving it much thought, Isaac opened his camera, took a quick photo, and sent it with the note:"Watering plants."



She had expected no more than a curt reply, so the photo caught her off guard, giving her the odd impression of a husband reporting to his wife.



Opening the picture, she saw rows of neatly kept plants on the balcony, evidence of the attention he had given them. The shot was simple and unplanned, yet it showed his legs and one arm draped over the armrest of his wheelchair.



Even with nothing fancy about it, the photo carried a quiet charm that was hard to explain.


Reading the short explanation beneath the photo,Verena suddenly pictured him standing in front of her,giving his answer in that plain, steady way of his.


A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and she began typing a teasing reply on her screen.



After pressing send, Isaac found himself unexpectedly unsettled.



To his surprise, he caught himself waiting for her response with unusual anticipation.



From a reasonable standpoint, it was nothing more than an ordinary conversation.



What he failed to notice was how the firm and unshakable man he was in business had turned hesitant,second-guessing himself.


At that moment, his phone buzzed, and any thought  of pulling back his message vanished as he hurried to open it. What arrived was a voice message from Verena,saying,"I was only asking casually. What, do you think I won't believe you? You even sent a picture.Honestly,it feels like a husband reporting to his wife, worried she won't trust him, so he has to send proof."



When the voice note finished playing, Isaac pressed his lips together. The casual way she spoke of "husband" and "wife" set his ears burning.


A second voice message soon arrived. "In that case,I enjoy it. I hope you'll keep this little habit, Mr. Bennett."


Hearing her playful tone, Isaac's fingers clenched tighter around the phone, and a faint glimmer of a smile lit his deep eyes.


Because her voice carried such softness and teasing closeness, Isaac found himself at a loss for words.His fingers lingered above the screen, unable to type a reply.



As nearly five minutes slipped by with no answer,Verena realized he was most likely retreating into silence once again.



Letting out a soft sigh, she chose to stop pressing him.


She tapped out a short message and sent it. "Alright then. I was only teasing. Don't feel pressured.Sleep well.Goodnight."


Once the message was delivered, Verena set her phone aside and slipped into bed.



As Isaac read her words, he could almost picture her smiling,full of warmth and patience.



His mind drifted back to the bridal shop,where he had turned down her request, and she had smiled then too,saying it was fine.



It struck himn that she seemed to hold limitless patience when it came to him.



All at once, Isaac's chest tightened. He pressed a hand against his heart, sensing a peculiar wave of emotion rising inside.


He struggled to name it, for the feeling was both heavy and suffocating yet oddly filled with joy.


The swirl of emotions consumed him until they fused into a single, vivid memory.



He remembered their first meeting,when Verena had crouched down, lifted her eyes to his, and whispered,"Don't turn me away."



Pulling himself out of the memory, Isaac finally typed out a message to her.



Yet no answer came to him immediately. By the next morning, Verena opened her eyes and found Isaac's message waiting.


His reply was brief. "I'll do my best. Goodnight."


Reading those words, Verena's lips curved into a gentle smile.


To her, it felt as though he was making an effort to bridge the distance between them.



Her playful remarks the night before had not gone wasted.



Rising from bed, Verena drew open the curtains,allowing warm sunlight to pour into the room.



The brilliance outside told her it would be a lovely day.


Once she had freshened up, Verena got into her car and headed out.


This particular day marked Isaac's scheduled treatment.




Upon reaching the hospital, she found Isaac waiting for her.



Placing her medical kit aside, Verena glanced around and noticed Isaac was the only one there.



She tilted her head slightly and asked, "Wasn't Dr. Moore supposed to be here today?"


Even though Cayden had stopped resisting her involvement, he had still attended every session until now.



That was why his absence caught Verena off guard


Isaac massaged his temples and said, "He's occupied with an important surgery today."



Noticing the faint crease in his brows and the tiredness in his face, Verena knelt before him and asked, "What's wrong? Did you not sleep properly last night?"


At the mention of the night before, Isaac lowered his gaze, stole a quick look at her, and then turned aside,murmuring uneasily, "About last night... I'm sorry."


With her brows lifting in puzzlement, she asked,"What do you mean by that? Why would you apologize?"


At her words, Isaac turned his eyes toward her.


Sounding both surprised and careful, he asked, "You're really not angry?"


After thinking it over, Verena realized he must have believed she was upset because she hadn't answered his message the night before. Finding his concern a little amusing, she said, "I was already asleep by that time. I only noticed your message when I woke up this morning."



Tilting her head with a sparkle in her gaze, she added,"So that's the reason you couldn't sleep properly?"


While she talked, Verena studied him closely,catching every subtle change in his expression.



Isaac shifted his eyes away from her piercing stare,uncertain of how to reply.



Deep down, he knew she had hit the mark.



He had no explanation for why it mattered so much to him whether she was upset.



If he thought about it logically, he should have known that someone as patient as her wouldn't grow angry over a slow reply.



When his silence stretched on, Verena laughed lightly."Alright then. Let's get started with the treatment."



Saying this, she stepped forward, ready to help him onto the bed.



Using his hands to roll the wheelchair back,Isaac said,"No,that won't be necessary. My assistant will help me."



During earlier sessions, when Cayden was there,it had  always been him who helped Isaac onto the bed.


Verena reached out and brought the wheelchair to a stop,cutting off his movements.



Looking straight at him, she said, "Isaac, since we're about to be married, helping you onto the bed is something I'll be doing sooner or later. You don't have to push me away."


Helping him onto the bed...


Color rose slowly across Isaac's face.


He understood her words carried no hidden meaning,spoken simply and sincerely.


Still,his thoughts ran wild against his will.


Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Verena caught his hesitation and smiled, believing he questioned her strength. "I can handle it. Just trust me."


For Verena, such a task was hardly worth mentioning.



Back in Clokron, she had once hauled an injured Isaac on her back through two entire streets.



Determination glimmered softly in her dark eyes.


For a moment, Isaac's mind emptied, and he simply nodded his consent. Once he gave in, Verena lifted his arm, draped it around her neck, and steadied it on her shoulder.



Using both hands, she braced his upper body and gathered her strength to raise him.


Once on his feet, Isaac loomed above her slight frame.Guiding him toward the bed, Verena strained with effort, and faint veins surfaced across her forehead.



Seeing her struggle, Isaac felt a sharp ache pierce his chest.



What if...



If he never regained his strength,would she be forced to carry his weight like this forever?



As his thoughts slowly cleared, Isaac realized he was already lyingon the hospital bed.
###Chapter 38 Don't Cry



Once Isaac was settled on the bed, Verena pulled a pair of scissors from her kit and neatly snipped open the hem of his suit trousers.


For the procedure to work properly, his trousers could not press against his thighs, or it would reduce the effect.



Before her eyes, his evenly built legs came into view.


Even after multiple sessions, Isaac still flushed with embarrassment whenever his legs were exposed to her gaze like this.



The beginnings of atrophy were already visible along his legs.



Shutting his eyes, Isaac pressed his fists tightly against the sheets at his sides.



Catching sight of his withdrawn posture, Verena remained silent,reaching instead for the silver needles to start the treatment.



Following her usual routine, she questioned Isaac a bout the sensations he felt with each needle she placed. The responses, however,were the same as before.


Still, Verena reminded herself this was only the beginning, and her confidence in curing him remained firm.



Within half an hour, the session came to an end.



While pulling out the needles one at a time, Verena repeated her usual reminder. "After treatment, don't let yourself get cold. Stay away from drafts or cool air,and watch your diet carefully. Avoid spicy or overly stimulating food."



When her hand moved toward the needle near the root of his thigh, her fingers unintentionally brushed against Isaac's skin.



Her eyes flicked upward, landing on his crotch,still covered by the dark gray fabric of his trousers.


From years of practice, Verena knew that patients with paralysis in the lower limbs often struggled with sexual dysfunction as well.


Back when she first reunited with Isaac after returning to the country, he had admitted that he was unable to function as a normal man.



She longed to raise the matter, but judging by lsaac's fragile state of mind, she knew another time would be more fitting.



Isaac might have lost sensation in his legs, but his eyes missed nothing. The directness of her gaze was impossible to overlook. Had she finally discovered the truth of his condition?



A crushing heaviness pressed against lsaac's chest,leaving himn unable to put his inner turmoil into words.In a rush, he ignored his condition and tried to push himself upright from the bed's edge.



Harsh reality struck when his arms gave out just as he managed to raise himself slightly, sending him collapsing back onto the mattress.


The sudden noise jolted Verena from her thoughts,and believing he only wished to rise, she quickly assisted him into his wheelchair.



"You should just call me next time," she remarked gently.


With his head lowered, lsaac murmured softly,"Thanks."



His assistant guided him into the changing room to put him into a clean pair of suit trousers.



In that moment, Isaac was overcome with a sense of humiliation. Even changing his trousers required another's hand. His fingers clenched tightly around the wheelchair's armrest. How could he possibly think of marrying her while trapped in such a condition?


When he didn't come out after some time had passed,Verena stood at the door and called out softly,"Isaac."


Isaac rolled out from the changing room, his voice deliberately casual as he asked, "What is it?"


Verena's eyes drifted toward him; dressed now in black trousers, his long legs still appeared striking despite the chair beneath him.



Her eyes shifted upward, lingering for a moment just beneath his waist.


Her initial plan had been to restore his legs first, to rebuild his confidence before tackling the deeper issue. Yet now, that approach felt like taking too much time. These issues could be treated at the same time.


Deciding it was wiser to face the problem head-on rather than delay it, Verena asked bluntly, "How serious is the damage to your male function?"


The sharp screech of the wheelchair brakes filled the room, jolting lsaac's body forward from the sudden halt.



Isaac's hand went rigid on the wheel, and after a pause,he lifted his head and asked hesitantly, "What did you just say?" "Stay calm," Verena said casualy, adopting her professional tone. "I'm asking because I need a clearer picture of your condition. In cases like yours,sexual dysfunction is common, but most of it can be treated. So whatever | ask next, I want you to answer honestly.It will affect how much I can help you regain."



Her voice carried no judgment, only calm professionalism, though she failed to see how deeply such words could wound a man's pride.



Isaac attempted to remind himself she was only his doctor. The reality, however, was harsher-she was also his fiancée. Both of them knew his issues, yet hearing such a question spoken aloud made him feel as if every fragment of his shame had been dragged into the open.



Though Isaac understood these questions were standard procedure, speaking about them in front of her tore at him with unbearable pain, as though his chest were being ripped apart. Every word felt like a cruel reminder that he was not only crippled but possibly impotent. Whether recovery was even possible remained unknown, but already he had begun grasping at fragile hopes.



For a long stretch, Isaac said nothing, and then gave a slow nod. When his voice finally emerged,it was low and strained. "Go ahead, ask." Once she saw his consent, Verena drew out a pen and flipped open her notebook.



Her first question was simple. "Do you often use sleeping pills?"



Isaac paused, and then gave a short nod."Occasionally"




From the night of the accident six months ago, Isaac had not known a single night of restful sleep.


He only swallowed two pills on the nights before a critical event or work obligation, hoping at least to function properly the following day.


Beyond that, his nights were either shattered by nightmares or consumed by vivid memories of the crash, memories that clung to him like a shadow and ate away at his mind. At times,he drifted into a hollow daze; more often, he simply lay awake. Again and again, he had to remind himself that his father's death was the weight he carried.


When the word "occasionally" reached her ears,Verena frowned and set her pen still for a moment.She understood his temperament far too well, and she knew he would never take sleeping pills unless an important event waited for him the next day. She suspected that on all the other nights, he chose to torment himself with memories instead. Once she finished writing down his answer, Verena lifted her gaze and asked, "Do you ever struggle with erectile dysfunction?"



Her voice remained steady, carrying the weight of a question spoken as though it were no more than a passing detail.


To Isaac, however, the words cut sharply, and hearing them from her made it sting all the more.



His hands clamped down on the wheels of the chair,and the veins on the back of his palms rose in strained ridges.



By then, Isaac no longer had the courage to form a single word.



He gave a firm nod, dropped his head low,and kept his eyes far from Verena's.



From above his bowed figure came the faint scratch of her pen moving across the page.



Isaac felt his heart sink like a stone. He thought that from the very start, he should never have clung to hope for his condition. He regretted ever agreeing to the marriage arrangement, for it had given Verena the chance to treat him and filled him with expectations he never should have carried. Verena had finished jotting down the information and prepared to ask another question,but when she lifted her eyes, she caught sight of Isaac's bowed head and the pitiful way he sat before her.



Although the room was filled with warmth, he sat in his wheelchair wearing only a thin white shirt. Sunlight filtered in from outside and stretched across his narrow frame, giving him an appearance so fragile and delicate it almost seemed unreal.


At that moment, Verena realized that her questions,which had seemed routine to her, had burdened him with unbearable shame.



The realization struck her heart with pain, and an overwhelming urge rose within her to pull him into her arms.



"Isaac." Verena spoke his name, and when his gaze lifted, she bent down so her soft lips could graze his lowered eyelids with the lightest touch.


Isaac sat in shock, his body frozen as though bound by stillness.



Verena drew herself upright and said in a quiet voice,"You promised you would trust me. So why are you so sad now? Your condition didn't come only from the accident. It's tied to your emotions and your state of mind. I told you that I would heal you, and I meant it. Have you stopped believing me?"


While speaking, she knitted her brows together and stole glances at Isaac's expression from the edge of her vision.



When she caught the faint shift in his expression,Verena lowered her head as if showing weakness. "Is it that you doubt me because I once worked as a doctor in a small town? Do you also see me as someone from a backward place, without knowledge,just like the ones who look down on me?"



By the time her words faltered with the edge of tears,Isaac grew unsettled, unable to bear the thought of her crying. In a rush, he blurted out, "No,I never thought that."



Recognizing the worry on his face, Verena refused to let him off so quickly. She kept her head lowered and made her shoulders tremble in a show of helplessness



Watching her like this left Isaac with the feeling that his heart was suspended in emptiness,reaching for something always just out of reach.



His hand lifted with hesitation, as if he meant to wipe away her tears. His voice caught as he said, "Don't cry.I believe you. I always will. You're going to be my wife Why would I ever look down on you?"


When his fingers stretched forward, they were caught gently in her slender hand.
###Chapter 39 You Seem To Be Enjoying It
Before Isaac could react, Verena lifted her head in one swift motion.



Her smile shone brightly, like sunlight breaking through a spring morning haze



With her head tilted slightly, her eyes curved with delight as she said, "'It's good that you think this way."



Her words came like a feather's touch, light and teasing, as she leaned in once again, brushing a kiss across the corner of Isaac's lips.



A tide of emotion crashed through Isaac.



She kissed him like she had done that many times,every gesture unforced, every glance assured.


His heart seemed to falter for a beat, while a faint fragrance clung to the air between them, leaving his mind stripped bare, unable to muster a single thought in return.



His lashes quivered, his gaze fixed yet vacant, staring at the woman before him as if spellbound. 
Noticing his daze, Verena's lips curved higher.Dissatisfied with his stillness, she leaned closer once more.



All he could see now was her face magnified in his vision-those fluttering lashes, the delicate arc of her features.



Her hand intertwined with his, and her lips found his again.



This was her third kiss of the day.



Was she simply exercising the privileges of being his future wife?



Or could it be... she truly cared for him?



Though Isaac entertained both thoughts, the latter rang louder in his heart.


Once planted, the idea grew like ivy, winding deeper into his mind.



His throat tightened; he swallowed hard, no longer holding back the frantic rhythm of his heart as he slowly closed his eyes.



But just as he surrendered, her lips left his.



When she saw him close his eyes, Verena's smile deepened. She leaned near his ear, her voice low and playful. "You seem to be enjoying it, don't you?


Her tone was deliberately laced with allure, threaded with a hint of mischief.



Isaac snapped back to his senses, eyes flying open,only to find her face inches away,her cheek nearly brushing his.



Meeting her gaze, he felt his heart skip, and then darted his eyes aside, clearing his throat instead of answering her teasing words.



That was when he noticed his hand was still laced with hers, fingers locked together.



His fingers were defined, smooth, and slender, yet they still seemed plain against hers.


Her hand, soft and delicate, wvith slender proportions and faint pink joints, reminded him of fine porcelain,flawless and fragile.



Verena,unaware of the thoughts lingering in his silence, tilted her head, forcing him to meet her eyes once more. Her lips curved as she teased, "Why aren't you answering me?"



Unable to retreat any further, Isaac's ears flushed red,his Adam's apple bobbing nervously.



"I..." His husky voice had barely formed when his phone vibrated from his suit pocket, cutting him off.



Their gazes locked; Isaac looked at Verena with a question in his eyes.


Amused by his expression, Verena released his hand,rose to her feet, and nodded. "Go ahead, answer it."



Isaac clenched his slightly damp palm, pulled out his phone with his other hand, and accepted the call.


The voice on the other end spoke first. "Hello, Mr.Bennett. I'm calling from Weaving Love Bridal Shop.The photos you and Mrs. Bennett took are ready.When would you like to come in with your wifeto select them?"



"Is it the bridal shop?" The room was quiet enough for Verena to overhear.



Isaac nodded, tilting the phone slightly aside. "They're asking when we want to choose the photos."



"Are you busy this afternoon?" she asked.



Isaac hesitated briefly, already sensing what she was leading toward. Then he shook his head. "Only minor tasks-I can leave them to my assistant."



Her lips curved. "Since neither of us is occupied, let's go today." With a slight smile, lsaac gave a short grunt of agreement before telling the staff member, "We'll be there shortly."


He quickly delegated his tasks to his assistant,leaving the driver to take the assistant back to the company.


And so, Isaac rode in Verena's car to the bridal shop.


When they arrived, the staff greeted them warmly.


The same young sales assistant who had initially been dismissive toward Verena last time now hurried forward, offering her a glass of water.



Though Verena remembered the slight, she let it pass,accepting the glass casually and taking a sip.



Seeing her calm demeanor, the sales assistant exhaled in relief.



Verena and Isaac settled onto the sofa, reviewing the photos displayed on the computer.


The staff member handled the mouse with care,pausing at each image for their input.


They viewed several shots, most showing lsaac's solemn face.


"Mrs. Bennett, what do you think of this one?" the staff member asked respectfully. 
Verena studied the photo, unimpressed. "Next."


The staff member scrolled down



"And this?"



She furrowed her brows slightly, raising her chin."Next."



They had selected three earlier, but nothing had pleased them since.



Though both were strikingly attractive, Isaac's expression remained stiff in most shots.



After nearly a dozen more images, Verena's eyes lit up.



In the displayed photo, her arms were looped around Isaac's neck, her body angled on his lap.


She tilted her face upward, while he leaned down,their lips touching lightly, noses nearly brushing-an intimate scene frozen in time.



The staff member, waiting for judgment, held the mouse still.



After gazing for a long moment, Verena's lips curved as she pointed, telling the staff member, "This one's my favorite. Make it large and frame it; I'll hang it in our bedroom."

  Her words sent Isaac's heart into a stutter.



The photo had captured the exact moment she kissed him spontaneously.



He hadn't expected it to turn out so vivid, so genuine -like a portrait of love itself.



And what surprised him most: Verena had claimed it as her favorite.



His mind replayed the sensation of her kiss that day,heat rising to his ears.



So,she liked such closeness,did she?



His shyness ebbed as he looked more closely, noticing a detail missed before.



She hadn't been sitting fully on his lap-a slight ggap remained.



Since his legs couldn't feel anything, he had thought she had truly sat upon him.



But clearly,she hadn't.



The memory surfaced: after the photo was taken,Verena had risen with an awkward stretch of her legs.



Only then did Isaac realize-she must have been balancing on her toes for too long, until her feet went numb.



Quietly, without a word, she had spared him discomfort. In the smallest of details he had overlooked,she had been thoughtful of his condition.



His heart stirred again, beating wildly as if it had slipped its cage, unable to settle back where it belonged.


While he drifted in these thoughts, two photos had already flickered past on the screen.



Then Verena seemed to recall something, turning her face toward him. "Oh, I forgot to ask your opinion.What do you think of this photo?"



Isaac had never been close with other women,though in his world of fame and fortune, many had approached him. Whether their gestures had been intentional or casual, he had always seen through them.


Now,looking at Verena-her innocent eyes meeting his with unguarded sincerity-an unfamiliar tide rose in his chest, carrying unspoken thoughts he could neither voice nor contain.



Just as Verena thought he might retreat into silence or deflect with indifference,. Isaac smiled softly."You're my future wife, Verena; you decide."



His voice carried justenough weight to reach the ears of those nearby.


Several female staff covered their mouths, whispering with envy. "Oh my, he's so gentle."


Verena froze,momentarily stunned. Warmth rushed to her cheeks, pulling her back to reality



As her gaze lingered in Isaac's bright eyes, she quickly pressed her lips together and turned back toward the computer, leaving him only her profile.


Isaac's eyes flickered with a newfound realization.



His gaze rested on the faint blush coloring her cheeks.


So-she could be shy as well.


By the time the sun had lowered its light, the selection of wedding photos was complete.



Isaac's assistant was already waiting at the entrance of the bridal shop. When everything was wrapped up,Verena and Isaac each departed in their own cars.



Some days later, Verena sat reviewing her freshly completed manuscript for a medical book.


Stretching her limbs, she felt her phone buzz across the desk.



The screen lit up with a name: "Gavin Reid." Gavin was one of her assistants.



Unlike Julianna, he was still a medical student, and his family carried notable influence in Shoildon.



In truth, he had been sent by his father to study under her guidance.


Yet despite those circumstances, Gavin and Verena shared a natural ease in working together.
###Chapter 40 Who Are You With
With a light laugh, Verena lifted her phone and accepted the call.


Before she could speak, an enthusiastic voice burst through the line. "Evelyn, I'm back from overseas!|just landed at Shoildon Airport. Do you have time to come get me? Let's go out for a meal; it's on me."


Securing the files from her desk inside the drawer,Verena answered, "Alright, wait there for me."


Once the call ended, she made her way to the garage and started her car.



The Willis Villa stood far from Shoildon Airport, a drive that took nearly forty minutes.



Inside the sprawling terminal, crowds of travelers bustled about.



Even among the masses, Verena's eyes landed on Gavin right away.



He was impossible to overlook, with his tall build and striking looks setting him apart As she walked from the entrance toward him, several young women attempted to draw his attention with admiring glances.



Gavin spotted her the moment she entered the hall,though one person after another approached him before he could move.



Just as he was about to head in Verena's direction,a blue-eyed blonde lady stopped him with a question.



Keeping his manners, Gavin remarked, "I'm sorry, but my friend is here to meet me. If you're trying to find the restroom, the staff can help you."



After speaking, he stepped past the lady and went directly toward Verena.



Verena cast a glance at the lady he had brushed off and teased, "It's been a while, but clearly you charm hasn't worn off."



Looking a little embarrassed, Gavin scratched his head and replied, "Evelyn, don't tease me like that."


Verena corrected him lightly, saying, "Here, just call me Dr. Willis."



Realizing he was a little shy, she chose not to tease him further. With a nod toward the exit, she said,"Come on, let's go. Didn't you promise me a meal?" Gavin arched a brow and replied, "Of course. You think I'd go back on my word? Let's go."



...


The Fortune Garden Restaurant ranked among the finest places in Shoildon, famed for its luxury and exclusivity, and often filled with the city's elite.



Without influence and deep pockets, an ordinary person would need half a year's pay just to afford a single drink there.



Outside, the entrance gleamed with a golden signboard, and a long red carpet extended thirty feet from the steps, lined with attendants greeting every guest.



A waiter guided them to a table reserved for them on the first floor.



Their seating was in the main hall, separated only by flower arrangements.



Gavin had hoped to secure a private room, but every one of them had already been booked.


Passing her handbag to the server, Verena looked at Gavin with a smile. "You've certainly gone big the moment you got back."

 Grinning broadly, Gavin replied, "Taking you out deserves nothing less, Dr. Willis."


Service moved swiftly in the upscale restaurant. As soon as a dish was set down, Gavin gestured toward it and said, "This one's their signature. Try it."


Lifting the serving spoon, Verena placed a portion of fish onto her plate and sampled it.


After nodding in approval, she remarked, "They've turned the fish into something delicate, free of any strong smell, yet rich in flavor. No wonder this place has such a name in Shoildon."



Then, as something came to mind, Verena asked, "By the way, are you done handling things over there?"


Gavin gave a shake of his head. "I managed most of it,but Julianna is finishing the rest."


With curiosity in her eyes, Verena asked, "So why did you come back so suddenly?"


Verena knew him too well; Gavin was never the type to leave things unfinished without a pressing reason.


Just as she had expected, he answered with sincerity,"There's someone here who matters a great deal to me. If I don't return now, I might lose my only chance."

 Her brow arched slightly, surprise flickering across her face for only an instant.



"So it's the girl in that photo you keep tucked in your wallet?" she asked.



That image was still clear in her mind; the girl looked sweet and innocent.



At the mention of the girl he admired, Gavin's features softened, and a rare gentleness settled over him.



He gave a small nod and admitted, "Yes. She's the one."


Turning the conversation back to her, Gavin asked,"And you? Word is you're marrying Mr. Bennett. You came back for him, didn't you? I remember how long he chased after you, and everyone thought it was hopeless. Looks like he finally won."


His words stirred memories of Isaac, who, despite constant doubt from others, had never stopped pursuing her and had given more than anyone else.



Her eyes grew tender without her even realizing it.



Without the slightest hesitation, Verena answered,"Yes. He's the reason I came back."



The thought of lsaac curved her lips into a gentle  smile, one that lit up her face with striking beauty.



Unaware of it herself, that glowing smile drew the gaze of a man seated on the second floor of the restaurant.



Isaac held his phone to his ear, listening to his secretary, though his eyes never left the sight below.


"Mr. Bennett, regarding the project..." his secretary remarked.



Isaac barely registered the words; all he noticed was Verena reaching over to fix the man's tie.



His lashes trembled as he swallowed the surge of bitterness, answering in a cold tone, "Some matters don't require you to check with me every time."



Ending the call abruptly, Isaac lowered the phone and set it aside.



From his place above, Isaac kept staring at the sight unfolding beneath him.



Across the table sat two figures, both youthful and striking in appearance.



Verena's radiant smile held such warmth and charm that Isaac found himself unable to turn away.



Across from her, the man carried himself with easy poise, his good looks enhanced by the cheer and confidence he projected.



Instead of continuing to watch, lsaac bent his head and seized his motionless legs with desperate force.



Though he urged his body to respond, no spark of feeling stirred in his legs.



What answered him instead was a sharp ache in his chest that refused to relent.



In that instant, Isaac understood just how wide the gulf was between himself and men who still stood whole.



To his eyes, Verena seemed to belong far more naturally at the side of that young man.



For a moment, he lifted his gaze, but it quickly sank again before he spun his chair and rolled away.



Overhead,the faint sound of wheels reached Verena's ears,instantly familiar.


With a fork in hand, she froze and lifted her head without thinking, her eyes sweeping the room.


Gavin noticed her distraction and asked, "Dr. Willis, did you just see someone you know?"



Finding no familiar face, Verena gave a small shake of  her head. "No. I thought I did, but | was wrong."


Her finger drifted toward Gavin's tie as she said,"Don't forget to give that tie back later."



The tie had once been lsaac's, and he had left it in her place.


It never crossed her mind that Gavin would arrive wearing it.



With a sheepish grin, Gavin explained, "Julianna told me to bring it for you. She said you needed it right away. I didn't have the space to pack it because I was rushing, so I decided to wear it instead."



Verena gave an exasperated roll of her eyes, thinking she had never met anyone quite so annoyingly straightforward.



Back inside the private room, lsaac listened as his business partner kept going on and on.



Instead of absorbing any of it, Isaac let the words slip past him.



No matter how hard he tried, his mind kept circling back to Verena, picturing her sharing laughter with that good-looking stranger at the table.



A sudden thought struck him-he, her fiancé, had never even shared a simple meal at the same table with Verena.



Admitting it to himself felt strange, but lsaac realized this unfamiliar ache in his chest was nearly driving him out of his mind.



Without thinking, he set his wine glass down with enough force to send a sharp clink ringing through the air.


Startled by the sudden noise, his business partner paused mid-sentence, worried he had overstepped after a few drinks and started to apologize.Before he could finish, Isaac interjected, "I'm sorry. There's something I need to take care of. Please excuse me for a bit."



Feeling a sudden urgency, lsaac grabbed his phone,opened the chat app, and tapped the contact pinned to the top of his chat list.



For a few moments, his fingers hovered above the screen, frozen. Then he finally typed a message,saying,"What are you doing right now,Verena?"


Just as she was halfway through her meal,Verena's phone buzzed with lsaac's message, and a mix of confusion and delight crossed her face.



Not once since his memory loss had he reached out like this, asking about her first. Setting her fork aside, Verena's lips curled into a smile as she responded, "I'm just having a meal."



Trusting in her honesty, lsaac found himself asking another question. "Who are you with?"


Phone in hand, Verena arched an eyebrow at the sudden burst of questions-especially the edge in his tone that didn't sound like him at all.


Unsure why he was acting so strangely,she frowned a little but still answered truthfully, "I'm with a friend."



Once she hit send, Verena waited but no new messages arrived from Isaac's side.


The silence left her baffled. Even though Isaac never said much in their chats, he was always the one who wrapped things up.



But this time, the conversation simply stopped with no word from him.



Remembering the faint echo of wheels rolling overhead earlier, Verena's eyebrow lifted in sudden realization.



Could it be that Isaac was in the same restaurant after all?


 
If that was true, it might explain why he was acting so of charaacter.



Without wasting a second, Verena turned to Gavin and said, "I'm really sorry, but something urgent just came up. Next time, let me know what your favorite dish is,and dinner's on me."



After grabbing the bag the server passed to her, she made her way upstairs in a rush.
###Chapter 41 You're The Only One | Choose
Gavin's eyes followed Verena's fading silhouette, his mind reeling. Was she truly walking away without another word?



Upstairs,the second floor held rows of private rooms,usually reserved for the wealthy and influential to hold their serious negotiations.



Once she climbed the stairs, Verena moved down the long corridor until her eyes landed on Isaac's assistant posted outside a door.



That sight confirmed it-Isaac was definitely inside.



Without hesitation, she quickened her steps toward the room.



The plush carpet absorbed the sharp click of her heels,rendering her footsteps nearly noiseless.



Not until Verena stood right at the doorway did the assistant finally notice her presence.



At once, he nodded in respect. "Miss Willis."



Then, he politely asked, "What brings you here?"
Offering only a small nod, Verena ignored his question and shifted her gaze toward the closed door. "Is Isaac inside?" she asked.



He confirmed with a nod. "Yes, Mr. Bennett is currently discussing a business deal with a partner."


Then he added cautiously, "Would you like me to let him know you're here?" | Choose scandal reporter."



Without hesitation, she added, "Go ahead and enjoy your food,then head home. Don't wait around for me.Think of this meal as my treat."



Almost at once, a simple OK emoji popped up on her screen.



Sliding her phone into her handbag, Verena patiently waited for the meeting inside to end.



Within the private room, the business associate checked his watch and realized their discussion had stretched close to four hours.



The atmosphere around lsaac carried such an oppressive weight that every passing minute felt longer than it was. At first, the negotiations had gone smoothly, but once Isaac stepped outside for a phone call and returned with a storm locked behind his eyes,the atmosphere never lifted. His reputation for being aloof and commanding suddenly felt understated-the pressure in the room bordered on suffocating.



At last, after offering one compromise after another,the man saw lsaac give a faint nod of approval. His endless persuasion throughout the afternoon had finally paid off.



Rising to his feet, the partner reached out for a handshake,which lsaac accepted with cold composure before responding evenly, "You may go now."



Taking the cue, the partner smiled politely. "In that case, I'll take my leave, Mr. Bennett."



Silence reclaimed the room, yet lsaac's mind refused to quiet. He kept replaying the image of Verena adjusting that man's tie.



Ties and belts-those were touches reserved for someone close, someone trusted. Even though Verena had clarified in the message that the man was a friend, and he warned himself not to read too much into it, the thought gnawed at him all the same.



With his head bowed, Isaac's eyes lingered on his useless legs, a shadow of ridicule flickering within. The man she had been with earlier was whole, strong,walking freely-everything Isaac no longer was.


While Isaac sank deeper into his thoughts, the quiet creak of the door breaking open drew his attention.



Believing it must be his assistant, Isaac didn't bother to look up, murmuring in a subdued tone, "Give me a little time alone."



Instead of the expected polite reply, a warm, melodic voice chimed in, "So even I'm not allowed to enter?"



That gentle tone carried both lightness and ease. A jolt ran through his spine, and a dull ache pressed at his temple.



Raising his head abruptly, he found Verena only a short distance away, her head slightly tilted as a playful smile curved her lips.



"How..." His voice caught, the word slipping out in disbelief.



For a moment it felt unreal, and he blinked to steady himself,half afraid she would vanish if he looked away."How did you even know I was here?" he asked at last.



"Well," Verena replied. Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she borrowed the very line he had once used while pursuing her. "Maybe I just felt it. You were thinking of me, weren't you? So of course I came."



Her playful words slipped out as naturally as breathing,yet each one stirred his chest like pebbles tossed into still water, unsettling his guarded calm. His jaw clenched,and an unfamiliar warmth rose to his cheeks.



"I..." The denial hovered on his tongue, yet he knew uttering it would betray the truth that she had indeed occupied his thoughts.



When Isaac didn't seem to remember this playful line he had once used, Verena felt no real disappointment,for she had prepared herself for this ever since his treatment began.



"Fine, I'll stop teasing you." Watching his silence stretch on, Verena's face brightened as she explained,"I actually came to clarify things. The man downstairs is both my assistant and my friend. He arrived back from overseas today, so I collected him from the airport, and we shared a meal together. And besides that..."



With a knowing smile, she looked directly at Isaac and added, "He returned because of the woman he loves.So please don't misread the situation, or else he might refuse to come to our wedding."



When Isaac realized Verena had sought him out just to clear things up, it was as if fireworks burst inside his chest, chasing away every shadow of doubt. The weight pressing on him disappeared, leaving behind a joy so fierce he struggled to contain it. Yet with her sincere gaze on him,he found himself unable to show that happiness openly.



He swallowed hard and turned his head to the side,holding firm as he murmured, "I didn't misunderstand anything."



He couldn't-he simply couldn't let his emotions slip through.



"Is that so?" Verena arched a brow at his awkward and then chose to humor him with a soft reply."That's fine then."



Quiet settled over the room, and once more Isaac let his eyes fall to the floor.



The hush was broken by the sound of light footsteps steadily nearing him.



Before he even raised his head, gleaming silver stilettos came into view against the ornate red carpet beneath him.



Verena halted before him, lowered herself to her knees, and guided his hand to her cheek with gentle intention.



"It doesn't matter if you misunderstood or not," she whispered. "I explained because I want you to understand that no matter how impressive someone else might seem, they mean nothing to me. You are the only one I choose, and I couldn't bear the thought of you being hurt by jealousy or sorrow."



The softness in her voice carried the patience of someone calming a sorrowful child, and at times her cheek brushed lightly against his hand.



To Isaac, it felt as though she was shattering every unspoken boundary, for who could lace such tender sweetness into words spoken with such innocence? A lump rose in his throat, and faint moisture shimmered in his eyes.



Again and again his lips moved without sound, and at last all he managed was a faint nod in silence.


From the look in his eyes, Verena understood that every word she had spoken had settled deep within him.







Upon arriving back at the Willis Villa, Verena slid her car into the garage, and the moment she entered the living room, Kaia's voice rang out to meet her.


"I'm honestly amazed. Who would've thought my dear sister kept such surprising talents tucked away?"Kaia remarked, letting every word drip with sarcasm.



Experience told Verena that whenever Kaia came looking for her, trouble usually followed. Wanting no part of it today, she moved to pass by, but Kaia stretched out her arm to block the way.



Verena turned toward Kaia,her brow pulling tight



Losing wasn't something Kaia ever liked to own up to,least of all when Verena was watching



Meeting Verena's steady stare, Kaia responded with a frown of her own.



Kaia had no idea that her baby-faced looks didn't carry the weight that Verena's calm,sculpted features did, and the fierce look she tried to pull off ended up looking more silly than serious.
###Chapter 42 Have You Been Following Me
Verena fixed Kaia with a cool gaze, her tone indifferent. "If you've something to say, say it plainly.I've no patience to waste time circling words with you."



Kaia folded her arms, her eyes cutting sideways like a blade, a sneer curling her lips. "No patience for me,yet you suddenly find boundless energy for private talks with another man?"



"What exactly are you suggesting?" Verena's tone stayed steady, as if untouched by Kaia's provocation.


Kaia could not stomach Verena's aloofness-always so distant, always carrying herself as if the world could not touch her.



With a sharp motion, she pulled out her phone and thrust it forward, showing Verena a photo sent by a friend who had spotted her at a restaurant.



"Verena, you play your cards well. One hand engaged to lsaac, and the other hand holding secret meetings with a man-smiling, chatting, looking far too comfortable."



Her smugness lit her face like a cruel lantern. "Tell me,

 if lsaac saw this photo, would he still cherish the thought of marrying a woman so false-hearted? With his position, do you think he'd stomach betrayal?"



Verena took the phone and glanced at the photo-her and Gavin, seated together. The angle was cunning, capturing them as if they were a young couple on a tender date, laughter shared without restraint.



She had already clarified things with Isaac. What gnawed at her was how Kaia had come to possess such a photo.



"Have you been following me?"



At the frost in Verena's gaze, Kaia shivered despite herself.


Snatching her phone back, she crossed her arms, and then stepped closer, her face twisted with defiance.


"So what if I did? If your conscience is clear,why tremble? This time, my friend simply happened upon you whispering sweet nothings with another man. But I'd wager you've been roaming about with plenty of them, haven't you? Hah-just as Mom says, that old hag from your backwater roots truly ruined you-"



Her words cracked off mid-sentence, for a sharp slap resounded, striking her cheek and leaving a vivid red mark. Kaia's eyes flew wide in disbelief.



"You... you actually dared to hit me?" Her chest heaved, fury blazing. "That old hag-"



Another slap split her lip before she could finish.



Clutching her burning cheek, Kaia staggered, utterly provoked. "That old hag, that old hag-"


Two more slaps rang out, each echoing through the living room like thunderclaps.


The force nearly toppled her, but before she fell, a hand seized her collar.



Verena dragged her close, brow furrowed, eyes sharp as steel. "Kaia Willis, hate me all you want-I don't care."



Her voice dropped, colder still. "But hear me well: my grandmother is not yours to scorn. Speak one more word against her, and each time I'll strike without hesitation."



With that, Verena shoved Kaia hard, sending her sprawling to the floor. "Don't test me again."


Even after, there was no relief in her chest. She turned from Kaia and climbed the stairs in haste.



Shawna had carried her worries for Kaia and Luka even  to her deathbed. What a bitter fate, to be burdened with such ungrateful kin.



Kaia sat crumpled on the floor, her cheek aflame,tears brimming as she stared up at Verena's retreating figure. Anger boiled within her, shaking her body,yet fear crept beneath it. Verena's cold mask had cracked,revealing something fierce, almost unhinged.



It was not that Kaia had not thought to strike back;but Verena's grip had been iron,leaving no chance.


Her fists clenched tight, hatred blazing. So what if Verena turned mad? In their parents' hearts, Kaia told herself,she would always outweigh her.


That evening, Alec and Laura returned from the company to find their beloved daughter greeting them with a swollen face.



At the sight, Alec's brows drew together.



Laura rushed over, her eyes wet with worry.	 heavens,Kaia,what happened to your face?"



"Mom,it was Verena..." Kaia bit her lip, shoulders trembling as tears streamed. "I spoke a few words when she came home. She claimed I meddled where I shouldn't, and then struck me again and again before shoving me to the floor."



Her sobs were pitiful, her voice woven with grievance "Verena?" Alec frowned,doubtful.


In his eyes, Verena had always been the quiet one never the sort to throw her weight about.


Seeing the hesitation, Kaia pressed on, her voice pleading. "Dad, it was truly her. Go upstairs and ask her yourself if you doubt me."



Tonight, she was determined-Verena would pay. Her parents had always cradled her in affection. Surely,they would not let her be wronged in silence.


But Kaia misjudged. Alec, seasoned by years of business, had his eyes on the larger game. Even if Verena had struck Kaia, she was about to enter the Bennett family through marriage. Trouble now would be poison in the well.


His voice came low, reluctant. "Verena's wedding with Isaac is at hand. Let's leave this matter for another time."



"So what if she marries Isaac?" Laura cut in, her face drawn with disdain. "I care nothing for the Bennett family's backing! Today, she dared raise her hand against Kaia in this very house, spitting on us all. Such insolence cannot go unanswered!"



Her fury boiled over; thoughts of currying favor with the Bennetts vanished like mist. All she wished was to storm upstairs and remind Verena who truly ruled this household. Verena's conduct had long been a thorn in her side, fueling a steady undercurrent of dissatisfaction.



Laura made to ascend, but Alec caught her arm.



Though his heart ached for Kaia, his mind weighed interests more heavily. He had not thrived in business by letting anger steer the ship.



He exhaled deeply. "Remember our alliance with the Bennett family through marriage. Verena's wedding is too near. Stirring conflict now would only sow weeds in our own path. The fewer storms,the better."



"Hmph, the Bennett family?" Laura sneered, voice dripping scorn. "Yes, we need their support, but don't fool yourself-Danica despises us. Were it not for Isaac's crippled legs, our family would never have had this chance. Do you think we'd be chosen otherwise?"



Her gaze shifted to Kaia, softening with pride. "With Kaia,we are hardly grasping at straws. She has already won the favor of the Lyons family-she healed Barrie Lyons' leg with her herbs and supplements. Their family may not rival the Bennetts outright, but they are close. To the Bennetts, we are beggars; to the Lyons family, Kaia is a benefactor. Now, tell me,which is the wiser path?"
 ###Chapter 43 Severing Ties
Laura gently clasped Kaia's hand. With a soft determination in her voice, she said, "Kaia, you don't need to be afraid. I'll make sure your pain means something."


Alec blinked in shock. "What did I just hear? Are you seriously talking about Barrie Lyons from Shoildon?"


Tilting her chin with quiet pride, Laura replied, "Who else besides the influential Lyons family could deserve Kaia's talent?"



Alec dropped his gaze to the floor and sank into thought.



Rumors from countless business events drifted back to him. Everyone knew Barrie's leg injury had left him nearly crippled.



Living with such relentless agony in old age was nothing short of tragic.



Yet somehow,Kaia had managed to restore him?



The Lyons family's reputation for paying back favors was legendary.


If Barrie's suffering had finally ended because of Kaia  the Willis family would stand to gain more than anyone could imagine.


That realization settled over Alec, and he finally loosened his grip on Laura's arm.



Just as Laura started toward the staircase, Alec called out, "Verena deserves to be punished, yes. But don't go overboard. The Bennett family may not hold the same weight for us later on, but it would be foolish to turn them into enemies."



Only a couple of dismissive grunts left Laura in response.



Dragging Kaia with her, she marched straight up to the third floor. Outside Verena's room, she pounded hard against the door.



"Verena! Come out here right now!"


Inside, Verena froze at the sound. She already knew Laura was coming to punish her for Kaia's sake.



The door swung open, and Laura's hand immediately slashed through the air in an attempt to strike.



Verena's reflexes took over. She caught Laura's arm and shoved it aside.



Unfazed,Laura swung again with her other hand, only to have Verena block the attack a second time. Still unwilling to give in, Laura lifted her arm for another blow. But this time, Verena seized her wrist,twisted sharply, and forced her into a lock that stopped her cold.


Laura's voice broke into a pained cry. "Let go of me!l said let go right now!"


At last, Verena loosened her hold and fixed her mother with a blank stare. "Tell me, what is it you really want?"



Kaia rushed to Laura's side and clutched her hand, her eyes darting to the red welt forming on her wrist.


"Mom, are you hurt?" she asked anxiously.


Rage burned hotter in Laura's chest than the sting in her arm, the defiance mattering far more than the mark.



She leveled a hateful glare at Verena. "Shameless girl!It wasn't enough for you to torment your sister; now you dare strike at your own mother?"


Verena's gaze didn't waver. "You came at me swinging without cause. Should I just stand still and take the blows?"



Laura gave a bitter laugh. "Don't forget who l am.l gave you life. If I decide to discipline you, then you 
have no choice but to accept it."



For a mother to speak such words to her child was almost beyond belief.



A faint tremor passed through Verena's lashes, and then her lips curled into a cold smile. "If that's how it is, stop calling me your daughter. I never once saw you as a mother anyway."



The defiance cut Laura like a blade.



She drew in a deep breath and gave a sharp nod. "So be it. If you refuse to recognize me, then I'll cast you off myself. From this moment on, you are no longer my daughter. Pack your things and get out of this house!"



Her hand thrust toward the stairs, her eyes glinting with icy disdain, untouched by grief or regret.



Get out? Verena let out a short, mocking laugh.


This house had never carried the warmth of a home for her anyway.



She strode past them without hesitation and spoke over her shoulder. "If we're breaking ties, let's make it absolute.From today, you are not my mother, and | am not your daughter. Remember this, Mrs. Willis-whatever I achieve in the future belongs to me alone.The Willis family has no claim on it." What Laura had truly wanted was a daughter who bowed her head.



There was something about the way Verena held herself that turned Laura's stomach.



As she listened to her speak, Laura couldn't hear anything but pride swelling in a voice that hadn't earned it.



She couldn't believe that Verena dared to talk about achievement in the future and warn them not to claim on it. If Verena hadn't been born as her daughter, she wouldn't be standing there at all, wrapped in privilege that was never really hers to claim.



In Laura's eyes, it was because of her upcoming wedding with Isaac that Verena dared to talk like that.



Pushed past the edge of reason, Laura retorted, "The Bennett family wants a daughter from the Willis family.You're not mine, so stop dreaming about marrying into that family."



Beside Laura, Kaia stood stunned. She hadn't believed Laura would actually cut Verena off at such a decisive moment.



A quiet smile tugged at Kaia's lips nonetheless,for this was exactly the outcome she had long desired. Now, Verena was no longer a rival for affection,no longer a daughter of the Willis family, and most importantly, no longer a candidate to marry lsaac.



Her wish was fulfilled.



The sound of Laura's frigid words trailed after Verena,halting her steps and drawing a dry laugh from her throat.



Laura seemed convinced that stripping her of status and denying her a marriage into a wealthy clan was the sharpest blow she could deal.



Yet Laura had never truly understood her daughter's heart.



Verena turned with a cold expression. "All right then.But don't fool yourself into thinking the Bennett family are yours to manipulate. When the consequences come, you won't be able to shoulder them. I'll be watching when it happens."



Neither Laura's glare nor Kaia's shocked face slowed her. She walked out firmly, without glancing back.



Kaia's mouth fell open. She had expected begging,perhaps desperate pleas for forgiveness, not this calm rejection.



In Shoildon, countless women longed to marry into the Bennett family, yet few had the chance.



Verena might've had a pleasant face, but without influence or real ability, women like her had no place standing beside a family as prominent as the Bennett family.



Becoming Isaac's bride as the daughter of the Willis family was the best thing that had ever happened to her.



And yet, Verena just let it go-no sorrow, no hesitation,nothing at all?



Neither Kaia nor Laura could stomach the way Verena carried herself, as though she were somehow above them both.



Confusion flickered across Kaia's face, while Laura's eyes remained fixed in disbelief at the spot where Verena had disappeared.



In her mind, Verena should have been nervous,maybe even desperate, instead of leaving with such ease and composure.



That very expectation had driven Laura to threaten her.



Yet the reply she had received left Laura feeling, if only for an instant, like the tables had turned and she was the one standing on uncertain ground. By the look on Laura's face, Kaia understood her mother hadn't truly meant to sever ties; the threat had been meant to intimidate, not finalize.



Verena, however, held too much pride, and unless Laura reached out to mend things, there was no chance she would ever agree to a marriage with the Bennett family.



Afraid Laura might later regret her words and try to smooth things over, Kaia chimed in quickly, "Mom,don't take her too seriously. She's probably just lashing out in anger. There's no way she would actually throw away the chance to marry into the Bennett family."



The thought gave Laura pause, but soon she nodded.After all, who would willingly give up such a good marriage?



A sharp snort escaped her. "That girl is stubborn to the bone. Let's see how long she pretends to stand firm."



To Laura, Verena's defiance was nothing more than a performance she expected to collapse in time.

###Chapter 44 She'll Crawl Back Before Long
As Verena walked down the staircase and crossed the living room, Alec stopped her with a call of her name."Verena!"



When she turned back, her face showed no expression as she stood waiting for his words.



Verena understood that Laura had only been able to come upstairs and confront her because Alec had allowed it.



If that had not been the case, he would not have stayed seated earlier while the commotion went on upstairs.



The realization left her with a bitter sense of irony.


For a time, she had believed Alec might be the only one in the family who still showed her some regard,even if it was out of his sense of guilt.


Feeling guilty,she believed,would have meant that he cared in some small way.


Now she saw that her thoughts had only been wishful assumptions. Alec rose from his seat and stepped closer, noticing that while her face stayed calm, her eyes carried both sadness and disappointment.



The expression struck him with a force he hadn't expected.



With sudden panic creeping into his chest, Alec asked in haste, "Verena, it's already late. Where are you planning to go?"



The tenderness in his tone gave the impression of a father speaking out of deepconcern for his child.



For a fleeting moment,Verena nearly allowed herself to believe it.



The false calm in Alec's manner only deepened the irony pressing against her.


With steady eyes fixed on him, Verena spoke with deliberate clarity. "Alec Willis, beginning today,you and Laura Willis are no longer my parents. Wherever l choose to go will never concern either of you."


Her clear gaze carried a cold sharpness, though a faint crease appeared between her brows.



Alec paid no attention to the change in her expression,for the weight of her words had already shaken him. For Verena to cut ties so firmly, Alec could only assume that Laura had spoken far too harshly upstairs.



No matter if Verena's actions came from sudden defiance or a real attempt to escape, Alec knew he could not afford a single misstep during the critical Bennett family alliance.



"Did your mother speak too cruelly to you?"



"So you knew she went upstairs to stir up trouble for me? I was under the impression you didn't."



With a sharp glance, Verena added, "The two of you as parents make me sick. If I had any choice in the matter, I would have never wanted to belong to this family."



Her words left Alec shaken to his very core, his body rooted in stunned silence as he watched Verena walking out of the lavish villa.


Coming to his senses, he rushed forward to the door and called out after her, "Verena, wait..."



From the staircase came a voice asking, "Why are you running after her?"



When Alec turned, he saw Laura and Kaia making their way down the steps. With arms folded and anger etched on her face, Laura walked toward him.



"Let her leave. Don't stop her," Laura said coldly toward the door. "I want to see just how far she'll manage without us behind her."



Alec felt frustration build at Laura's cold indifference.



Though he agreed Verena's stubbornness needed discipline, he never intended for Laura to drive away the Bennett family's future daughter-in-law without weighing the consequences.



With his face darkened, Alec asked Laura sharply, "I told you only to discipline her lightly. What did you say to Verena that pushed her to leave?"



Noticing Alec leaning toward Verena's side, Laura turned her anger onto him.



"She told me outright that she doesn't recognize me as her mother, so why blame me for her walking away?"



Laura's frown deepened, and her voice sharpened as she snapped, "Your eldest daughter is something else,Alec. She bullies Kaia and even had the audacity to strike me, her own mother. Truly, you must be proud of the child you brought up."


Catching Alec's inclination to defend Verena, Kaia hurried to nod in support. "It's true, Dad. Verena shows no respect for Mom. All Mom did upstairs was say a few words to correct her, and Verena twisted her hand right away. Look for yourself."



Kaia lifted Laura's wrist toward Alec, presenting it like a silent accusation.



When his eyes dropped, a vivid red mark stood out against Laura's wrist.


The faint crease on his brow gave Kaia her chance,and she sniffled theatrically before crying out,"It's bad enough that Verena bullies me, but to treat Mom this way is unforgivable!"



Laura's anger eased at her younger daughter's show of loyalty, and she stroked Kaia's hair with approval."You truly do think of me, Kaia."



Alec's eyes lingered on the mark, and the silence stretched heavy between them.



It had never crossed his mind that Verena would defy her parents so openly.


Laura, encouraged by Alec's silence, added, "I told her clearly that if she denies me as her mother, then I'll deny her as my daughter. From now on she has no ties to the Willis family, and she can forget about marrying into the Bennett family." Alec's temper flared the moment Laura brushed things off with her stubborn attitude.



Pointing at her in frustration, he could barely force out a word. "You... you..."


His chest rose and fell heavily as he glared at her."Haven't I warned you over and over? We can't afford any trouble with Verena and the Bennett family.You went and scolded her. What happens if she really refuses the marriage arrangement? How do we explain that to the Bennett family?"



The alliance promised great rewards, but a single misstep at this stage would give the Bennett family every reason to turn against them.


Kaia shrank back quickly, startled by the sudden fury in her father's tone. She had never witnessed him this enraged.



Laura flinched at first, her shoulders drawing in, but she quickly lifted her head high and let out a mocking laugh. "Do you honestly believe she has that kind of strength? She followed us from Trisas to Shoildon because she wanted to rise above he place in life, to shed her insignificance and turn herself into a woman of society. Without the Willis family behind her, she is nothing, and she can forget about ever marrying into wealth. Don't trouble yourself. This is only her rash temper speaking, and she will crawl back before long After what she did to Kaia and me, do I not have every right to vent my anger?"


Alec considered what she said, and it began to sound convincing.



To the Bennett family, Verena's standing in society mattered far more than who she really was.


If marrying into wealth was truly her goal, she would never dare to run away and cut ties.


Accepting that logic, Alec let Verena go without chasing her.


In the end, he believed it was only a matter of time before she came back.







Instead of driving away, Verena left the Willis Villa on foot because the car sitting in the garage had been a gift from Alec.



She refused to keep anything that tied her to the Willis family.


The villa stood in a secluded part of town, and at that hour, there wasn't a single car she could hail.


After a brief pause to think, Verena pulled out her phone and called Gavin. Three rings passed before the line clicked.


"Dr. WNillis, what do you need?" Gavin's voice came steady through the receiver.


Her tone dropped to something faint and weary."D you have time right now?"


Her weary tone pressed on him so heavily that Gavin answered at once, "Yes, I do."


She let out a quiet hum before asking, "Can you come get me and take me to a hotel?"



He didn't hesitate. "Of course. Just text me the address, and I'll head over."



A small smile broke across her face as she thanked him.Once the call ended, she shared her location.
###Chapter 45 | Miss You
While she lingered at the roadside, waiting for Gavin,Verena felt a dampness on her cheek.


She reached up to touch her face, only to feel water sliding down the back of her neck.


What began as a light mist quickly swelled into fat drops that smacked the ground in sharp bursts.


With nothing but open space around her, there was no protection from the storm.


The scene struck her as almost laughable, like a plot pulled straight from a soap opera.


Looking up at the dark sky, she let out a small laugh at her own thoughts and murmured, "I'm really not shattered over this. Ever since Kaia came into the world, I've known I wasn't the one who mattered most,so I've been bracing for moments like this. Don't try to twist it into something dramatic, understood? The rain's coming down so hard my clothes are already drenched."



A set of headlights finally cut through the downpour,and Gavin's car rolled to a stop. He stepped out holding an umbrella and made his way toward her.



His face showed regret the instant he saw how soaked she was. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting."



She smiled faintly and gave her head a quick shake."No. You got here just when I needed you."



Once she climbed into the car, Gavin circled around to the driver's side.



With a half-hearted smile, she said quietly, "I'm afraid I'm about to ruin your seat."



Noticing how forced her expression seemed, Gavin chose his words with care. "You look... sad.Something's bothering you, isn't it?"



Her lips curved at his careful tone, and she answered with a shake of her head, "It's not worth worrying about. I saw it coming, and they aren't worth my tears."


The steady way she spoke made Gavin think that whatever loneliness he thought he had sensed earlier was only his imagination.



He could sense deep down that the situation carried more weight than it appeared.


Rather than press her, he shifted the topic and asked, "Did you book a hotel room?"


Verena's head moved in a slow shake. "Take me to the one you're staying at."


Gavin's lips pressed together in a small nod. "Okay."


Turning the wheel, he guided the car forward, and the tires cut through the rain-soaked night.



The storm eased off quickly, and by the time they arrived at the hotel, the rain had stopped.



At the front desk, Gavin secured a suite, and then placed the key in Verena's hand as he walked her to the door.



After thinking for a moment, he suggested, "How about I buy you a drink?"


With her chest feeling tight, Verena gave him a soft smile. "Alright."



He called the front desk and placed the order for drinks,and soon they were delivered.


Even though the idea had been his, Verena was the one who drank far more than he did.



From the moment they settled in, she kept quiet,lifting glass after glass without a word. Before long, she abandoned the glass entirely and drank straight from the bottle.



As Gavin watched her drown herself so recklessly, he wanted to intervene but held back.



Once the final bottle ran empty, he sprang up and pulled it from her grasp. "That's enough. Go shower and get some rest."



He then called room service to clear away the bottles and glasses before making his way out.



The soft click of the door closing left the room in silence.



On the floor, Verena leaned against the sofa with her cheeks burning red.



There was no mistaking it-she was drunk.



Her mind,before the alcohol dulled it, kept circling back to Luka's hateful stare, Kaia's endless schemes both open and hidden, Laura's cutting voice, and Alec's shallow imitation of a father's love.



Why did the people who should have been her greatest support care the least?


She yearned, just like anyone else, for the tenderness of parents and the steady comfort of family.

 Sadly, the only person who had given her true love had already passed away.



And the one who once held her close had since let her fade from memory.



Once the liquor began to cloud her head,Shawna and that man became the only figures she could think of.



Isaac...


Out of nowhere, the ache of missing lsaac pressed heavily on her.



She felt an urgent need to see him right away.



Acting decisively and quickly had always been her way,and even drunk, she clung to that instinct.



Her fingers stumbled across the table until they reached her phone, where she scrolled to lsaac's name and pressed to call.


The line rang again and again with no answer, but she stayed on the call, unwilling to give up.


Over at the Bennett Group offices, the building had emptied out, except for the light still glowing in the CEO's office.



At his desk,Isaac continued working, his hands flying over the keyboard as he dealt with company affairs. Just outside, his assistant waited at the doorway,fully aware that lsaac often lost all sense of time when buried in work.



Isaac didn't like being interrupted when he was working, and the assistant was well aware of that. Still,the phone kept ringing without a break, and eventually,the assistant couldn't ignore it any longer.



He paused at the entrance, eyes fixed on the name flashing across the phone screen, fingers curling tight at his side. After a moment's silence, he knocked twice and stepped inside.



Isaac didn't look up right away. When he did, his expression was hard, his eyes sharp. "What is it?" he asked.



The assistant stepped forward holding the phone. "Mr.Bennett, Miss Verena Willis has been calling repeatedly,so..."



As soon as the name "Miss Verena Willis" reached his ears, Isaac stretched out his hand to take the phone."Why didn't you hand it over sooner?"



There was a brief pause before the assistant answered,"You once told me you dislike interruptions while you're working."


That was true; Isaac had made that clear before. Without another word, he accepted the call from Verena.



Before he could speak, a gentle female voice drifted through. "Isaac, I miss you."


Soft and slightly nasal, the voice clung to him like a kitten in need of affection. The sound stopped him cold, and color rose along his cheeks.



A slight tremor passed through his hand, and for a second the phone nearly slipped before he caught it again.



With the office wrapped in silence, the assistant at his desk heard Verena's voice clearly.



The words startled him, for the Verena he recalled had always carried hersef with cool elegance.



That she could sound so tender in private was something he had never imagined.



Seeing his assistant's distracted expression, Isaac pressed his lips into a line, covered the receiver, and said,"Leave now."



Realizing he had overstepped, the assistant hurried out and closed the door behind him.



When the door clicked shut, Isaac uncovered the receiver again.



Verena's faint murmur continued, repeating the same phrase over and over.



For a moment, Isaac's thoughts stalled; this was not the woman he was used to.



Normally,she would never act in such a way.



Quietly,he asked, "Verena, what's happening with you?"


Her reply came with a girlish giggle. "Isaac, I really miss you... I'm sitting alone in a hotel room; will you come and be with me?"



Her words dragged slightly, slurred with drink, yet laced with playful sweetness.



A tight swallow moved through Isaac's throat twice.



Never before had he witnessed her with so little guard around her.



Oddly enough, the sensation of being needed by her brought a quiet sense of satisfaction.



Lowering his eyes, Isaac's lashes quivered faintly as he replied,"Fine."



Once the call ended, he gave orders to his assistant to have a car made ready Meanwhile, Verena forwarded the hotel's address and,for the first timne that evening, thought to freshen herself up.


She slipped out of the damp clothes clinging to her body and stepped beneath the shower spray.


When she finished drying off, she pulled on the bathrobe provided by the hotel.


Her head swam with dizziness, the alcohol heavy in her body, though her mind stayed sober.


And like many who drank too much, a reckless boldness stirred within her.



Verena had barely settled onto the bed when the sound of the doorbell reached her ears.

###Chapter 46 Sleep Beside Me Tonight
Isaac reached the floor where Verena was staying,instructing his assistant to remain downstairs while he rolled toward the door whose number she had sent him.



The moment he pressed the doorbell, it swung open from within.


The first thing that caught his eyes was a pair of long,slender legs.


Isaac froze, and then slowly lifted his gaze to find Verena leaning lazily against the doorframe, wrapped in a bathrobe.



Her cheeks were tinted with a faint flush,softening her usually cool demeanor with an almost dangerous allure.



The air was heavy with the scent of alcohol.


In that instant, Isaac realized things might not be as romantic as he had pictured in his mind.


His brows drew together, his voice carrying concern he himself barely noticed. "Verena, what happened to you?" Worry shone clearly in his eyes, but she only smiled lightly. "Come in first, and I'll tell you."



Her tone was gentle, her voice almost syrupy.



Isaac didn't care about keeping any distance; it felt as though he were under her spell as he maneuvered his wheelchair into the room.



With a soft click, VVerena shut the door, and then turned and promptly seated herself on Isaac's lap.



Startled, Isaac stiffened, instinctively trying to push her to her feet.



Yet she looped her arms around his neck, pressing a finger against his lips. "Shh. Don't ask about that now,alright?"



Her slightly hazy eyes melted away the last of his resolve.


In a quiet voice, he asked, "Then... what do you want to talk about?"



"What should we talk about..." She seemed to truly think it over, her gaze roaming across his face before it lingered on his thin lips.



Her mouth curved into a sly smile as her finger trailed from his lips down to his chin, tipping it up."How about flirting with you?"



Her playful tone, sweet and teasing, brushed against his ears as her warm breath fanned his cheek.



Isaac was certain she was drunk.



Verena squinted at him, noticing the flush creeping over his ears.



As though she had uncovered some delightful secret,she teased softly, "Do you want to know how I'll flirt with you?"



Before lsaac could muster an answer, she leaned closer, whispering, "Your ears are red."



Then,with parted lips, she captured his heated earlobe,her damp tongue gliding across it.


Isaac's arm muscles twitched uncontrollably,his hands clutching the wheelchair's armrests in a desperate bid for restraint.



The sensation of her moist lips, the warmth of her breath, and the delicate fragrance clinging to her freshly bathed skin collided all at once against his nerves.



He tipped his head back, taking a deep breath as though wrestling with the tide rising within him. But Verena wasn't satisfied. Once upon a time,a single kiss from her would have sent him reeling with joy.


With mischief in her eyes, she cupped his face, turned it toward her, and brushed her lips against his.


A feather's touch.



Isaac's heart pounded in disarray, his eyes darkening with emotion. "Verena,you're drunk."



She pressed herself tightly against his chest. If she were sober, she might have heard the thunderous chaos of his heartbeat.



"Really, Isaac?" Verena murmured, her head sinking onto his shoulder. "I've teased you so much, yet you won't react. My heart might just shatter."



Her voice was husky, threaded with tenderness,carrying his name like a plea.



"Verena, could you please get up?" he asked,shifting uncomfortably.



Her hair brushed against his Adam's apple, sending an involuntary shiver through him.



"Alright," she agreed softly.



Isaac blinked in surprise, not expecting her to comply so easily. When he looked at her, she tilted her head back, smiling faintly. "Let's go to bed together. I'll help you in,and youI can sleep beside me tonight, alright?"


Sleep beside her...


With her drunken smile and dreamy eyes locked on his,Isaac's brows furrowed. He placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and reminded her, "Do you even know what you're saying? I am not like other men."



It was as much a reminder to her as it was to himself.



His gaze clung to her, shadowed by complex emotions and a touch of melancholy.


She was so perfect, yet he felt like a hollow shell. His legs were still unhealed, his body betrayed by dysfunction, and the road to recovery was uncertain.How could he dare hope?



Sensing the sorrow flickering in his eyes, Verena pressed her finger gently over his lips. "Isaac, I won't allow you to speak of yourself that way, nor will I let you belittle my abilities."



She leaned her forehead against his, smiling with quiet certainty. "I promised to heal you-every part of your body."



Her words carried a sharper meaning, sinking deeper.


Isaac stared at her radiant smile, and, as always, herpresence lit up the shadows clouding him. His gaze lingered; their closeness left him suddenly aware that her white bathrobe had slipped from her shoulders baring smooth, delicate skin.



The sight was laid bare before him.



He quickly turned his face aside, leaning back as if to retreat-only tocollide with the crescent-moon curve of her eyes. She smiled impishly, like a sprite caught mid-trick.



Verena continued to hold his gaze, unwavering.



The silence grew thick, the air pulsing with sparks of unspoken tension.



Then,lowering her head, she twined her arms tightly around his neck and pressed her lips to his. This time it was no fleeting brush. She nibbled, sucked, and kissed with heated persistence. It was exactly the way Isaac used to love.



Her sudden fervor left Isaac reeling, fearing he might be swept away. Yet the sweetness on his tongue filled his mind with joy so pure it felt like a rare gift-hers alone.



All reason slipped away



He was no longer passive. One hand cradled her head the other locked around her slender waist, tightening as he deepened the kiss.



Verena was taken aback, pulling back to speak, only for him to chase her lips instantly.



"Mmm-"



This was no gentle peck; it burned with passion



Though it was hard to keep up, Verena reveled in the familiar heat.



It was as if lsaac had never lost his memory.



The kiss deepened, his lips prying hers apart with a hunger that demanded surrender.



She tilted her head back, responding with equal fire.



In the hushed room, the sound of their kisses rang out.



Bodies pressed close, breaths tangled,as though they wished to fuse into one.




...



The night ebbed away.



When Verena's eyes fluttered open, vision clearing,a dull headache from drink throbbed at her temples.She turned over-and there lay a handsome face beside her.

###Chapter 47 Come Over At Any Time
Verena could hold her liquor well; not a single memory from the night before had slipped away.


In the end, it was she who had helped Isaac onto the bed.



When sleep claimed him, he looked unlike the man he usually was.


The tightness in his brows loosened, his breathing steady as the tide.


At rest,his face carried an air of warmth, as if he were someone easy to approach. But in truth, he never was.



Verena studied his features, her eyes gentle and clear as water.



She leaned her chin on her palm, her fingers slowly tracing the arch of his brow, gliding down to his high nose bridge, finally coming to rest on his firm,straight lips.


Isaac stirred awake, his lashes lifting to the sight of Verena's luminous face-bare of makeup, yet strikingly beautiful. Her head was slightly lowered, her fingertip brushing against his lips, as though... she was about to lean in and kiss him.



A softness appeared in Isaac's gaze. He tilted his head forward,wishing to close the distance between them.



But Verena suddenly whispered, "Isaac, I can't marry you."



His body stilled. His lashes quivered as if caught in a storm.



He parted his lips to speak, but no sound emerged.The silence pressed on his chest like a boulder,making it hard to breathe.



For the first time, lsaac tasted what it meant to be struck by a cruel revelation.



Was it because of his condition?



Because he was not like other men?



Because he had failed to give her what she wanted last night?



Catching the flicker of anguish in his eyes, Verena knew immediately he had misunderstood.


She hurried to explain, "Yesterday, I quarreled with my mother." At her words, the storm in Isaac's expression calmed a little. "She was partial to my sister and lashed out at me without reason. I fought back. Then she furiously declared I was no longer her daughter and cast me out of the Willis family. Your family wants the daughter of the Willis family. But I'm not that anymore,so I can't marry you as such."



Isaac's brows knitted tightly as he asked, voice tinged with urgency, "Were you hurt?"



Verena smiled faintly and shook her head. "No. She didn't succeed. I twisted her wrist, though-it turned red."



Even after such treatment from her own mother, she could still summon a smile.



It was a calm too brittle, a facade anyone could see through.



Watching her, Isaac felt a stab of pain and an urge to gather her into his arms.



"Isaac," Verena called softly.



"Yes?" he responded, his tone gentle.



"I never lied to you," she said, her voice quiet yet steady. "Before our first meeting, Laura thought | was a disgrace from the rural backwater. She told me to pretend I was a graduate from Acorith College of Medicine. But I told you all the truth-that I had graduated from Pine Hill University. None of you believed me. On the way back, Laura scolded me,saying | overreached. But the truth is, I really did graduate from Pine Hill University. It's normal if strangers doubt me, but even my parents don't know."



Isaac's mind drifted back to their first meeting.



She had sat at the dining table, declaring her truth with steady eyes. He had believed her then-those eyes left no room for deceit.



Instead of interrupting her, he just stayed silent,knowing she needed to say it all aloud.


Verena gave a bitter laugh. "Isn't it ironic? She's my biological mother, yet she knows nothing about me.Kaia, the daughter she adores, got into Acorith College of Medicine, and Laura treasures her like gold.But my studies? She never cared. Once, when I was a child, I caught a high fever and missed two of the exams, and my results slipped. From then on, they branded me as hopeless. They never asked again.They thought I didn't even take the college entrance exam. But the truth is, I had already been admitted early to Pine Hill University. They never knew-never bothered to know. My likes, my schooling, even whom I care for-they remain blind to it all. Yet Kaia's every move is known. As for Luka, they treat him as their pride and heir. Only me... I've always been invisible."


Her words struck lsaac like a knife, his heart aching with every syllable.



"My grandmother Shawna raised me. She alone cared.But she has passed on." Tears welled in Verena's eyes at the memory.



"Later, they brought me from the countryside to Shoildon, only for the sake of the marriage alliance.Kaia despises me most, but her hostility never mattered to me. What mattered was when she insulted Shawna last night. I couldn't stand it-I hit her.Hard enough to swell her face and bloody her mouth.I don't regret it. After that, Laura and I quarreled. She cut me off. Now, I'm no longer a daughter of the Willis family. So, Isaac, I can't marry you."


Without a word, Isaac drew her into his arms, holding her tightly.



In a low, steady voice, he vowed, "Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Only I have the right to decide who my wife will be."


Time passed, and Isaac eventually called his assistant to drive him to the company.


Verena helped him into the wheelchair, guiding him toward the bathroom to freshen up. Soon after, breakfast was delivered by the hotel staff.



They sat opposite each other. Verena reached across for the strawberry jam on Isaac's plate. "You don't like strawberries. Let me take this."



She spread peanut butter on his toast and handed it to him.



Isaac raised a brow in surprise. Not even his mother knew he disliked strawberries.



"How did you know?" he asked.



Verena lifted her gaze, her voice soft yet serious. "I know everything about you."



There was no playfulness in her tone, only sincerity.


Isaac was taken aback, at a loss for words.



Her calm acceptance of his silence showed she wasn't disheartened.



Deep down, she believed he would one day remember her.


Midway through breakfast, lsaac asked, "Are you planning to stay here?"



"Yes," Verena replied with a nod. A sudden thought crossed her mind, and her lips curved playfully. "If you're free, you can come over at any time."



Better to marry lsaac as the woman he loved than as the Willis daughter bound by duty


"Ahem... ahem..." Isaac choked on his water. Verena quickly handed him a napkin.



He thanked her, lifting his gaze to meet hers.Her eyes shimmered with unspoken meaning.



It was a silent reminder of last night.



Isaac's mind replayed the chaos of those moments.His ears reddened, and a flush crept down his neck.



The air thickened with awkwardness.



To be precise, it was Isaac who felt flustered.



Meanwhile, Verena's gaze lingered on him-steady,intent, and far from innocent.

###Chapter 48 Deeply Touched
Isaac's phone suddenly rang, breaking the awkward tension,and he picked it up at once.



From the receiver came the respectful tone of his assistant, Jacob Howard. "Mr. Bennett, I'm already outside the hotel."


Isaac's reply was calm and measured. "Alright. I'll be down shortly."



After hanging up, he turned toward Verena. "I'm heading to work now."


Verena's lips curved in a gentle smile. "Of course.Have a great day."


Isaac rolled his wheelchair toward the door, yet just as he was about to leave, Verena's soft voice stopped him. "Hold on a moment."



He paused and turned, catching sight of Verena walking over. She lowered herself to crouch in front of him.



He was about to ask what was wrong when she carefully lifted his tie and dabbed at it with a paper napkin.



Only then did he notice the corner of his navy tie had been touched by water.


His gaze fell on her intent expression, and his dark eyes brimmed with a feeling he could neither name nor deny.



When it came to him, she always caught the smallest of details, things even he overlooked.


"All set." Verena's smile bloomed, pulling Isaac back from his thoughts as his eyes rested on her face.



As she straightened his slightly rumpled tie, her voice softened like a spring breeze. "No matter how busy work gets, promise me you'll take care of yourself.Rest when you're tired."



Her eyes were clear as glass, filled with a warmth that seemed to seep into his chest.


For a fleeting instant, the scene resembled that of a wife sending her husband off to work.



Isaac's eyelashes quivered; his heartbeat leapt against his ribs, quick and unsteady.



In that moment, he had to admit one truth: he was deeply touched. "Mr. Bennett, there's a document for you to review."


By the time lsaac gatheed his wandering thoughts, he was already seated in the car.


Yet the storm in his chest had not calmed.



He glanced at the file Jacob held out from the front seat,but did not take it. Instead, his voice was low and steady. "Head to Willis Villa first."


The driver inclined his head. "Yes, sir." Then the wheel turned,altering their course.


Jacob quietly put the document away. But as he shifted, his eyes caught the sight of Isaac's tie-slightly crumpled, the corner dampened.



He blinked, startled. In the past, Isaac never tolerated even the slightest trace of disarray.



Had something shifted since last night?



Jacob remembered waiting nearly half an hour at the hotel entrance, only for lsaac to call and instruct him to return home.



"Jacob."



Hearing his name, Jacob straightened immediately "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?"



Isaac held his phone, lips pressed thin, his gaze lowered. "Next time Verena calls, no matter how busy I am,bring the phone to me at once."



Jacob froze for a beat, and then nodded quickly."Understood, Mr. Bennett."



For a second, he wondered if his eyes had deceived him.



Was Isaac...smiling?



It was hard to believe, not because he never smiled,but because the warmth in it resembled a man hopelessly in love.


Isaac pulled up Verena's number in his contacts, edited it, and pinned it at the very top.







The car drew to a halt outside Willis Villa.



"Mr. Bennett, would you like me to announce your arrival first?" Jacob asked cautiously.



Isaac's eyes narrowed on the villa gates, his brows knitting. His reply was cold as steel. "Unnecessary."


For the Willis family, empty formalities were not required.



Jacob nodded. "Alright." Then he moved to wheel Isaac forward.



At that hour, Alec had just finished breakfast and was preparing to leave for the office, while Laura,Kaia,and Luka were making their way downstairs.



The first to spot lsaac was Alec, who had just reached the living room entrance.


Surprise flickered in his eyes, but he quickly approached with a smile. "Mr. Bennett, when did you arrive? If you had told us earlier, we would have prepared coffee."



Laura and Kaia exchanged a quick glance.


Then,Laura rushed over.


Kaia,regretting her choice of pajamas, wished she had dressed better.Straightening her hair, she followed.



Only Luka remained at the table, eating his breakfast leisurely, his demeanor of a spoiled heir untouched.



He had heard that Verena left home yesterday, and the news secretly pleased him.



"Good morning, Isaac. Please sit!" Laura's smile was warm as she barked an order at the servant. "Don't just stand there-bring our finest coffee..."



"Don't bother," Isaac interrupted, his tone flat.



Where others plastered on smiles, his face remained unreadable.


Though seated in a wheelchair, the air around him was as commanding as a general on the battlefield.



Sensing something amiss, Alec's smile faltered."Mr.Bennett, is there something you wish to discuss?"



His first thought was Verena.



"There is indeed," Isaac answered. "It concerns my fiancée."



The Willis family exchanged startled glances.


Laura frowned, suspicion rising. "Isaac, what do you mean by that?"



Isaac's gaze lifted to her, a cold gleam flickering beneath his lashes.



Under that look, Laura's eyelids twitched, and a shiver ran down her spine.



"Isaac,why are you staring at me like that?"


His lips curved faintly, yet the smile carried an edge."I'm simply curious how you managed to drive my fiancée out of her own home."



The smile might have been polite, but the weight behind it pressed like a storm.



Kaia's heart froze-he was here for Verena



Alec thought bitterly that he should have foreseen Verena would bring Isaac into this.



He frowned at her lack of restraint.


But what mattered now was calming Isaac.


"Well, the truth is, Verena was just..." Alec was cut off by Laura, who shifted her tone to disdain. "So what if she was driven out? A daughter bold enough to challenge her own mother hardly deserves a place at home. Don't worry, lsaac. I only asked her to stay outside for a while. She'll return before the wedding.She grew up in a small village, accustomed to a carefree life. Without proper discipline, she'll only bring trouble to the Bennett family in the future."



Laura spoke as though even allowing Verena back was a gift.



Alec's face flushed crimson with fury.



Foolish woman!



But with Isaac present, he could not let his anger show. Isaac did not so much as glance at her. His voice was steady, his words striking like thunder. "You may see Verena as unimportant, but to me, she is one of a kind."



The declaration left the Willis family dumbstruck.



They knew all too well who lsaac was, the brightest heir of the Bennett family in Shoildon.



Even with his legs paralyzed, his shares and influence stood unshaken.



No one had imagined he would speak with such sincerity, such unmistakable affection.



At the table, Luka finally set down his glass after gulping milk, stunned.


He had never expected his eldest sister's charm to run so deep-deep enough to rattle Isaac himself.



Verena had truly turned the tide.

###Chapter 49 Her Supposed Infidelity
Laura pressed her lips together. Could it be that Isaac had come here to defend Verena?



The thought left her stunned. After all, Verena and Isaac had only met a handful of times.


Why,then,was Isaac suddenly showing such concern for Verena?



His deliberate appearance today to discuss these matters must have been triggered by something Verena said once she had left home.



The more Laura thought about it, the more her teeth clenched. Her dislike for Verena, already sharp, grew keener still.



Alec's face darkened; his expression carried the weight of regret.


Had he foreseen things spiraling to this extent, he would never have allowed Laura's reckless outburst the night before.



Isaac's visit-whether born of care for Verena or of concern for the Bennett family's reputation-meant one thing: their treatment of Verena had clearly displeased him.



Unlike Laura, who was carried away by resentment,Alec valued the family's standing far above Kaia's grievances.


"Isaac,you've mnisunderstood. We did not drive Verena out. She quarreled with her mother yesterday and stormed off in anger. In truth, we-"


"Mr. Bennett," Kaia broke in before Alec could finish.



Isaac's clear concern for Verena pricked her heart like a thorn.



He was the man she admired, and she could not endure watching Verena-someone she dismissed as insignificant-draw his attention.



Isaac turned his cold eyes upon Kaia.



She stepped forward with a strange smile tugging at her lips. "Mr. Bennett, your feelings for Verena may run deep, but there's something you likely do not know."



Her words stirred the curiosity of Alec, Laura, and even Luka.



Isaac's expression, however, remained as still as stone. Ignoring his frostiness, Kaia unlocked her phone,opened an album, and held the screen out toward him.



Alec and Laura leaned forward at once; even Luka,usually detached, walked over and craned his neck to see.



The image revealed Verena dining opposite a young man.



Their posture and gestures hinted at intimacy.



Verena leaned forward with playful ease, tugging lightly on the man's tie, while he scratched his head in shy embarrassment.


Both were young, striking, and their interaction appeared affectionate.



Anyone seeing the photo would take them for a budding couple.



Kaia caught the shock flickering across the others ' faces, and a cold glint of triumph flashed in her eyes.



With this, she was certain Isaac's regard for Verena would wither.



Luka snorted aloud, his scant tolerance for Verena plunging into outright disdain.



Who would have guessed she was so unruly? Engaged to the heir of the Bennett family, yet still bold enough to stir scandal elsewhere.



To marry into Shoildon's most powerful household should have been a crowning glory, but she still reached out for fresh excitement.



Alec's brows knitted tightly as he stared at the photo,his face a storm of surprise, anger, and shame.



Never had he imagined that his seemingly quiet and well-behaved daughter would carry on like this in private.



If outsiders got wind of it, the entire Willis family name would be dragged through the mud.



Laura,however, remained unnervingly calm, as though she had always known Verena's true colors.



Folding her arms, she inwardly praised Kaia for her move.



Losing the Bennetts as an ally was no small loss, but since Isaac clearly meant to defend Verena, why not turn his anger upon the very woman he sought to protect?



Besides, they still had the Lyons family to rely on.



If Isaac's fiancée was seen to be dallying with another man, his pride was  bound to take a blow. Surely, he would not let Verena off unscathed.



Verena dared to beg lsaac for help. Thinking of this,Laura was eager to see him teach her a brutal lesson.



A sneer tugged at Laura's lips.



Hah! Verena had dared to threaten her with such arrogance the night before.



Now she would reap what she had sown.



How bold would she remain once Isaac discovered her supposed infidelity?



"Mr. Bennett," Kaia said, her tone louder now, "I happened to capture this by chance. As for whether my sister has further entanglements with the man in the photo, I cannot say. But I felt you deserved the truth. You show her such devotion, yet she treats you like this, clearly unworthy of your care. With this evidence in hand, Mr. Bennett, do you still wish to stand by Verena?"



Kaia knew Isaac's physical state meant her hopes of marrying him were futile.



So,she dropped the pretense of being a dutiful sister and spoke without disguise.



Isaac let her finish her gloating speech, and then cast a single, unhurried glance at the phone. The profile in the photo was unmistakably Verena's-smooth forehead, curled lashes, a delicate nose, lips tinted with natural color.



Her skin glowed; her beauty was undeniable.


Even in this moment, Isaac found his gaze lingering upon her, admiring her beauty.



And as for the man sitting across from her...



The scene was not unfamiliar. He recognized Verena's outfit,remembered the playful tug on the tie



It was from the Fortune Garden Restaurant yesterday.He himself had been there.



He recalled how Verena had noticed his unease and quietly gone upstairs to reassure him.



Jealousy was never his way



Instead,memory stirred warmth within him.



Verena had soothed his fragile emotions, spoken with patience, and even kissed him.



While Isaac remained silent, Kaia mistook it for suppressed fury. Her lips curved into a smile of victory,relishing her own malice.



Yes-surely he would punish Verena for such shamelessness.



After all, what man could tolerate betrayal, least of all one as remarkable as lsaac?



Her hope was simple: that lsaac would call off the marriage arrangement in front of Alec, driving Verena into utter disgrace, making her lower her head and beg for mercy from the Willis family.



The thought set Kaia's pulse racing.



She kept her eyes fixed on Isaac, desperate not to miss a flicker of reaction.



Alec, Laura, and Luka also watched him, breath caught in their throats.



The room lay in silence, the air heavy as though frozen.



Just as the Willis family braced for lsaac's judgment upon Verena, a soft chuckle escaped him.



"If I recall correctly, Miss Willis, you are a student at Acorith College of Medicine, are you not?"



His question, utterly unrelated, left the family exchanging puzzled looks.

###Chapter 50 Chilling Threat

Kaia didn't know why Isaac suddenly shifted the topic,but hearing him bring up her elite school filled her with pride. Smiling with confidence, she nodded and said, "That's right, I'm studying at Acorith College of Medicine."



"A student from Acorith College of Medicine has fallen so low? How laughable. You followed your sister around, snapped pictures of her with another man,and showed them to her fiancé-and Miss Willis,even if any of it istrue, shouldn't your first thought as Verena's family be to stand by her?"


Isaac's stare cut straight into her, laced with sarcasm,and the cold sharpness in his eyes made her shiver.


Kaia stiffened where she stood, her face flickering through different emotions. Why was his anger turned on her? Shouldn't he despise Verena for supposed infidelity? Instead, his cold ridicule was aimed at her.


What she faced from him was entirely different from the reaction Kaia had imagined.


Kaia's once-bright smile collapsed into stiffness,and she blinked awkwardly before saying, "Mr. Bennett, I don't understand what you mean. My only intention

was to stop you from being misled."



"Not understanding doesn't matter." His voice was low,and his narrowed eyes glowed with danger. "But remember this. Secretly taking pictures is useless. I know my fiancée better than you do."


He already knew the Willis family dismissed Verena,and his words were chosen to strike them deliberately.


"And even if Verena really is that kind of woman,my feelings don't change," he added. "She's the only one I want. As long as she's willing to remain by my side,I'll overlook her flaws. Do you hear me?"



The declaration stunned everyone in the room,leaving Isaac the only one unfazed.


Alec's eyes widened as he stared at him, disbelief etched into his face. He wondered if the crash six months ago had damaged more than Isaac's legs. If nothing was wrong with lsaac's mind, there was no way he could have stood by Verena's side after seeing the photo and pushed back against eveything being said about the way she lived.



Of course, Alec kept those doubts to himself. What weighed heavier was the regret pressing in on him. If he had realized earlier how deeply lsaac cared for Verena,then regardless of Danica's opinion of their family,he would have done more to shield Verena.


Luka couldn't shake the feeling that lsaac's accident had scrambled something in his head. It was the only way to make sense of the way he spoke-like every word was soaked in blind loyalty.



Grinding her teeth, Laura struggled to make sense of it. What spell had Verena cast that could make lsaac so blind to her faults?



Kaia's complexion drained of color,her gaze burning with envy and bitterness. Isaac showed no fury toward Verena's betrayal. Instead, he twisted Kaia's accusations into shameful overreach. What did Verena possess that earned such unwavering love? She wasn't well educated, she lacked refinement-was her beauty alone enough to blind him?


Unable to hold her composure any longer, Kaia bit down on her lip until it stung. "Mr. Bennett,the photo isn't mine. A friend captured it while eating out, l...l Swear-"



Her voice cracked, breaking into sobs halfway, her shoulders trembling as though the weight of injustice crushed her.



Laura tugged her closer, pulling her under a protective arm.



"Isaac, must you take this so harshly? Kaia already told you she didn't take that picture. And even if she had, she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." Hearing Laura bring up his mother, Isaac easily saw through Laura's scheme.



Danica had always disapproved of the Willis family's behavior, yet she tolerated them for the sake of the marriage alliance. Laura clearly wanted to lean on that authority to sway him.



Isaac's brow tensed as he spoke slowly, each word deliberate. "Verena isn't just the woman I plan to marry. She makes her own choices. I didn't choose her so I could fix her or change her. I chose her because I want her to be happy. And no one-neither you nor my mother-gets to decide who she should be."



The Willis family gaped, stunned silent, unable to believe the level of protection Isaac gave Verena.


When faced with their disbelief, he added without hesitation, "The moment she becomes my wife, I'll sign over half of my shares to her name."



From behind his parents, Luka let out a sharp breath.Half? That was an amount beyond comprehension.



Alec,meanwhile, stood stiff as stone, haunted by one dreadful realization that wouldn't let go-lsaac's devotion to Verena was unwavering, and they had made the mistake of turning against her. Shock swept across Laura's and Kaia's faces, their voices colliding in disbelief. "What did you just say?"



The revelation struck like thunder-Isaac intended to hand over half of his company shares to Verena?



Their stunned expressions meant nothing to him. He already knew they dismissed Verena as unworthy,hoping she would walk away empty-handed. He was determined to prove the opposite-that she would thrive without any help from the Willis family.



He lifted his eyes, his gaze locking onto Laura with a chill that didn't waver. "One more thing," he said, his voice low. "I don't let things go easily. Whatever you put my fiancée through..."



A brief silence stretched before he deliberately shifted."I don't know how much my mother's generosity has bought you, nor do I care. But from me... I'm not sure if you can find any favors. What I can promise is this -I have the power to erase your family overnight."


The look in his eyes was glacial, deep and merciless,like the heart of winter itself. His presence filled the room,pressing down with a weight that felt inborn.


Laura's complexion drained of color, her jaw twitching as though the words cut straight into her.



Cold sweat trickled down her back despite the season's chill, each drop reminding her of the danger before her.



Her courage faltered, and for the first time, she lowered her eyes, a sharp pang of regret twisting inside her.
###Chapter 51 There Is Only One Solution
If Laura had realized earlier what was at stake, she would never have treated Verena in such a reckless manner.



Regret gnawed at her as she thought back-she should have heeded Alec's warning and avoided stirring the pot before Verena married into the Bennett family.



How had she let matters escalate into a quarrel with Verena? And to such a bitter extent?



Alec swallowed hard,desperate to salvage something from the wreckage. "Mr. Bennett, this is all a misunderstanding. You can rely on us-we'll bring Verena back home immediately."



"I don't care what you do." Isaac's cold voice cut like ice. "But mark my words-the one l intend to marry is Verena, not some so-called daughter of the Willis family. Don't dream of wielding your family name to press down on my fiancée."



Alec now fully grasped Verena's weight in Isaac's heart. What else could he possibly say? Without sparing him a glance, Isaac instructed Jacob to take him to Bennett Group.



Jacob gave a brisk nod and wheeled Isaac out of the villa.



That short visit had made one thing blindingly clear: Verena held a place in Isaac's life that no one could shake.



The moment Isaac left, Alec's anger erupted like a dam breaking.



"See the mess you've caused!" he thundered, pointing a trembling finger at Laura, his whole body quaking.



Laura stiffened her spine, casting aside her earlier fear,and retorted with steel in her voice, "What did I do? It was Verena, that stubborn girl, who stormed off on her own. How is this my fault?"


"You're still arguing?" Alec's face burned crimson as he lifted his hand toward her.


"Well,well... are you going to strike me now?" Laura's voice rose with sharp sarcasm. "Wasn't it you who allowed me to go upstairs to discipline Verena? And now,with things gone awry, you wash your hands clean and lay all the blame on me?"


Her words pierced Alec to the quick "I did let you discipline her, but I never told you to throw her out!" His face tightened,breath heavy."And Kaia-you used to be obedient. How did you turn so reckless the moment your sister came to live with us?"



"Dad... how can you say that?" Kaia's eyes widened,stunned by his sudden scolding.



Meeting his cold, furious gaze, Kaia parted her lips,only to feel a surge of anger and resentment twisting inside her.



She had never imagined Isaac would defend Verena with such ferocity, shattering her plans and leaving her humiliated.



Her resentment turned not only against Verena but also against Alec for his fickle nature.



Kaia had long known her father measured worth by profit.



Whoever shone brighter and promised greater gain would receive his favor.



Thus, she had trained herself never to stumble, never to err.



Yet she had not foreseen that lsaac's cutting words would overturn Alec's treatment of her compared to Verena. Hatred flickered in Kaia's eyes, though she clenched her fists to keep it hidden.



She despised Verena. She despised Alec. To the very marrow.



Seeing Alec's wrath turn toward Kaia, Laura rushed to shield her, protesting anxiously, "What does this have to do with Kaia? I won't let you speak to my daughter that way."



But Alec, recalling Isaac's warning, trembled with fury and shouted, "So Kaia is your daughter, and you conveniently forget that Verena is also your daughter?"



"Yes, Verena is my daughter-I haven't forgotten,"Laura snapped. "But so what? Sooner or later,she'll marry into the Bennett family and stand against me.She already disrespects me without shame-why should I treat her with kindness?"



Alec's chest heaved as he saw the cold indifference in her eyes. She still hadn't grasped the gravity of the matter.



His voice cracked with rage. "If you know she's marrying into the Bennett family, can't you see how easily they could crush us without even lifting a finger?Have you lived in comfort so long that you've forgotten the hardships we clawed through to reach this point? Teaching Verena a lesson is one thing,but you dared to drive her from our home!" He sucked in a breath and shouted, "Laura, how can you be so heartless!"



"You think I'm the villain?" Laura sneered, rolling her eyes. "Alec,weren't you the one who allowed me to teach Verena a lesson? Without your approval, would I have dared? Now that it's gone awry, you pretend to be righteous and throw all the blame on me. Stop acting like a saint!"



After decades together, Laura knew every crevice of Alec's mind and laid his hypocrisy bare with a few words.



Humiliated before his children, Alec's fury boiled over.



He ground out between clenched teeth, "You shameless liar!"



Laura shot back instantly, "Liar? Then what are you?A cunning fox? Or a hypocritical pretender?"



Pushed past his limit, Alec raised his hand, ready to strike her.



But Kaia and Luka rushed forward, pulling them apart



Laura, clutched by Kaia, snapped coldly, "Let go, Kaia I want to see if he truly has the guts to hit me."



"Madwoman! Lunatic!" Alec spat, straining against Luka's grip as if to lunge again.



"Enough! stop causing unnecessary drama!" Luka's voice thundered across the room, cutting through the chaos.



Alec and Laura froze, and once Alec ceased struggling,Kaia released her hold on her mother's shoulders.



All three turned to Luka.



Luka took in the sight-his father's disheveled suit, his mother's tousled hair.


His frown deepened. "Dad, Mom, I know you're furious about Verena, but don't forget Isaac's words before he left. He said plainly he will only marry Verena-not a daughter of the Willis family. The meaning is crystal clear. Whether she returns home or not, his decision stands. But now that she's stormed out in anger, if we fail to win her forgiveness before the wedding,she will turn Isaac against us. And the Bennett family can topple us as easily as snapping a twig."



Luka exhaled, speaking with calm reason."The priority now is not to quarrel but to devise a strategy to mend this. Otherwise, all our shouting will only hasten our downfall."



The other three Willis family members had been swept away by emotion, blind to reason. Only Luka, standing a step outside the fray,kept his head cool and pinpointed the crux of the matter.


Hearing his clear analysis, Alec felt a sting of shame,though he masked it.



Straightening his back, he smoothed his collar and forced composure.



Clearing his throat, he nodded stiffly. "Luka is right.We cannot afford to offend Isaac. The urgent task is to fix this matter at once."



Laura, too, steadied herself after Luka's sober reminder.





The four Willis family members sank onto the sofas,their minds heavy with worry as they pondered a way out.



After a long silence,Alec finally broke it.this moment, there is only one solution."

###Chapter 52 Apologize To Verena
The sting of Alec's earlier words lingered, and Laura and Kaia sat stiff with anger.



When he spoke, their eyes drifted toward him,curiosity momentarily breaking through their own thoughts.



"So,what exactly are you thinking, Dad?" asked Luka.



After drawing in a steady breath, Alec looked straight at Laura. "You need to bring Verena home and give her a proper apology," he said firmly.


Laura shot to her feet, her voice sharp with disbelief."Did I hear you right? Why should I be the one going after her? I'm her mother, and she ought to apologize to me. Who gave that girl the right to turn things upside down?"



In that moment, Alec couldn't stop himself from recalling how the wives of other powerful families always carried themselves with composure and grace.



"Why are you making this harder than it is?" said Alec,his voice edged with frustration. "You're the one who hurt her. What's so impossible about going after Verena and setting things right?"



The calm certainty in his tone only fueled Laura's temper. To her, Verena's running away wasn't all on her shoulders, so why should she be forced to clean up the mess alone?



Her frustration grew heavier with every thought, until she shouted, "Listen to me, Alec. I will never bend to that girl. Not now, not ever!"


Noticing her fury spiraling out of control, Luka tugged her gently back to her seat. "Mom, please. Tae a breath and let's at least hear Dad out."



Kaia steadied her mother with one hand and tapped her chest in a soothing rhythm. "Momm, Luka's right. We don't have a clear solution yet, so let's hear what Dad has in mind."



Every word of Luka's earlier reasoning had already sunk deep into Kaia's mind.


Even though Kaia's heart burned with dislike for Verena and she longed to see her cast aside, the idea of losing everything terrified her more.


Since Verena mattered deeply to lsaac,crossing her meant challenging the Bennett family itself-a risk that promised disastrous consequences.



Much as she despised the thought, Kaia knew Isaac's warning had been right all along. Destroying the Willis family would take lsaac little effort, and Kaia knew it.



Her place in society meant everything to her, and she would cling to it at any cost. From the start,she had been sheltered like a delicate flower, never knowing the weight of the outside world. Poverty was a fate she could never imagine enduring.



Anyway, she wasn't the one to swallow her pride and apologize to Verena.



Only after her children pleaded with her did Laura's temper ease slightly.



Settling back onto the sofa, she crossed one leg over the other and raised her chin high before cutting her gaze toward Alec. "You know Verena. That girl has a mind of her own. Even if I show up at her door, I can't promise she'll agree to come back."



Regret gnawed at her for ever dragging Verena into the city, since all it had done was stir up chaos in her life.



Recognizing the seriousness of the moment, Alec brushed aside her cold attitude. "Yes, Verena's stubborn. But don't forget-it was you who cast her out. That's the reason she bolted. Arguments between mothers and daughters never last forever. If you swallow your pride and speak from the heart, she'll come back with you."


No sense of maternal warmth stirred in her chest,since Verena had never once felt like a daughter she could call her own.



Laura kept her silence, and Alec's voice turned sharp."You made this mess, so you're the one who fixes it.Isaac already warned us. If the Bennett family steps in,we'll be ruined in no time. Go and face Verena, or stay here enjoying your luxuries until you're shoved back into a life of dirt and fields."



He spelled out the threat in plain terms, aware that nothing frightened Laura more than being dragged back into poverty. He was certain she grasped the weight of his warning.



As his words sank in, Laura's face shifted, the bravado slipping from her features.


In moments, the glamor she wore like armor crumbled,leaving her looking worn and fragile.



A heavy fear pressed into her chest as Alec's warning echoed in her mind.



The thought of Isaac exacting revenge for Verena's sake filled her with dread.



Never again would she allow herself to live in some crumbling, shabby house. The memory of living in poverty had worn her down long ago, and the fear of reiving it haunted her still.


Losing her status and prestige felt more unbearable to her than death itself.



Death seemed kinder than being forced back into that harsh,meager existence.


At last, reality struck her down, and she felt utterly defeated.



Only a short while earlier, she swore she'd never bow to Verena, yet now reality left her with no choice but to think again.



"Fine. If it means keeping this family afloat, I'll swallow my pride," she said through gritted teeth.



The moment Laura gave in, a collective sigh of relief slipped from the others.



In the end, the person who created the problem had to be the one to undo it.



"But where exactly is Verena? How am I supposed to track her down if I don't even know where she's hiding?"Laura snapped.



"That part isn't your concern," said Alec. "I'll have Larry handle the search." Her brows pinched together before she mumbled,"Alright then."



Once he finished delegating, Alec checked the time on his watch.



Isaac's sudden appearance had already thrown his entire schedule off balance.



"It's late already," said Alec, rising to leave."I'll head to the office. Stay alert for Larry's updates."



···



By the time midday rolled around, Larry Marsh finally sent Laura a message, revealing Verena's location along with a room number.


When she saw the name of the luxury hotel, doubt and unease twisted in her stomach.



How on earth could Verena possibly afford a place like this?



The memory of the picture on Kaia's phone came rushing back, and Laura's cheeks burned with shame.



How could she ended up with a daughter bold enough to act so shamelessly?



If word of this ever spread, she'd be the center of ridicule. Still, this wasn't the moment to dwell on shame.Laura ordered the driver to ready the car without delay.


When the car pulled up to the hotel, Laura stepped out by herself and headed straight for the elevator.



Reaching the door to Verena's room, she lingered,her thoughts colliding in a storm of doubt and pride.



The idea of lowering herself before Verena left a bitter taste, made worse by the cruel words she had used to cast her out.



Laura's fingers curled into tight fists as she forced her lungs to steady with slow, deliberate breaths.



Surely Verena would gloat at the thought of being begged to return, wouldn't she?



In her mind, there wouldn't even be a need for persuasion-Verena would fall in line and come back without protest.



Laura convinced herself Verena had run crying to Isaac,hoping he'd send them to fetch her. Riding on that certainty, she jabbed the doorbell.


Across the room, Verena leaned over her desk,grinding herbs she'd picked up earlier, mixing them into ointment meant to ease Isaac's injury. The sound of the bell brought back her promise to Isaac that morning-he was always welcome to drop by.



Thinking of Isaac's shy yet serious look, Verena let a smile spread and hurried to answer whoever was at the door.



A playful comment slipped out as she imagined Isaac behind the door. "You really do as you're told,Isaac..."


But as soon as she opened the door, Verena's smile disappeared completely.



Verena froze for a second, but then she quickly pulled herself together. "What are you doing here?"


"You already know why I came," said Laura, folding her arms as her voice stayed flat. "I shouldn't have said those things to you. You've made your point.Don't you think it's time to come back home?Wandering around like this-what kind of example is that?"



"Back home? Oh, that's funny," said Verena, her tone light as if she had just heard a joke. "Mrs. Willis, you've got the wrong idea. That isn't my home, and you're not my mother."



Laura instantly recognized how she was throwing her earlier words back at her. The stubborn look on Verena's face made Laura's chest tighten. How could the two daughters she gave birth to be so opposite?


Kaia had always been bright and obedient. But this one was useless, lost in her own fantasies.



If it weren't for Isaac, Laura wouldn't care if she ever saw Verena again.


She forced a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes "Verena, I was only angry when I said that. You shouldn't take it to heart. I've been worried sick about you. You can't be resting well in some hotel. Be a good girl and come back with me. The whole family's waiting for you."
###Chapter 53 Sharing A Night Together Makes A...

Laura's sudden change of tone left Verena knitting her brows in puzzlement. After all those years of cold neglect, without a shred of guilt, this abrupt sweetness reeked of suspicion.



In a flash, Verena recalled what Isaac had told her that very morning. The picture became clear-Laura's new approach must have been stirred by Isaac's warning.Otherwise, with Laura's temperament, she would never have come seeking her out. To Laura,she had never truly been a daughter at all.


The whole family was waiting for her? Verena mused with a faint smnirk. How bitterly ironic those words sounded.



With a small, wry smile, she said, "Last night, you made it plain you didn't recognize me as your daughter and told me to leave. Surely, those words are still fresh in your mind. There's no need for pretenses. What's spoken can't be unspoken-you own it, and so do l."



The reminder of the previous night's exchange darkened Laura's face. This obstinate girl was unearthing past grievances, even after she had ference stooped so low as to ask her to return home. Did Verena expect her to fall on her knees in apology?



Still,Laura forced a gracious smile, coating her words with honey. "Verena, they say quarrels between mother and daughter never last. Look, even when you struck my hand,I never took it to heart. Why cling to trifles? They were words said in anger, nothing mnore ..."



Verena answered with a soft chuckle.



Laura mistook it for yielding and felt a swell of triumph.As she thought, Verena feared abandonment; a few kind words, and she was halfway convinced. All their fretting had been needless.



But her joy was short-lived. Verena's smile faded,her voice cutting cold. "I never regret my words. While it may be true that grudges between mother and daughter should not linger, in my eyes, you lost the right to be my mother long ago."


Without another glance, Verena closed the door.Years of disappointment had eroded her patience.Besides, Laura's sudden visit was no act of concern-it was simply spurred by Isaac's warning.


The heavy thud of the door slamming shut struck Laura like a slap across the face. Wait-was this... a refusal to return to the Willis family home? 
Her features twisted with fury, her simmering anger now blazing. In her mind, it was always the child who sought forgiveness from the parent, never the other way around. She had already lowered herself by coming here, yet Verena dared to show her such disdain.



Seething, Laura pounded on the door and shouted,"Open the door, Verena! Open it now!"


Verena,unmoved,ignored the storm outside.



With silence behind the door, Laura's temper boiled over. She struck it again and threatened fiercely,"Have you forgotten the marriage alliance with the Bennett family? Do you not wish to marry lsaac and live a life of comfort? Isaac may care only for you,but his mother won't. If you're no daughter of the Willis family, she'll never agree! Go back now-there's still a chance!"



Even with the hotel's soundproof walls, Laura's shrill voice pierced through, revealing the depth of her agitation.



Unruffled, Verena lifted the receiver and called the front desk.



"Hello, how may I help you?" came a sweet voice.

 
Verena answered calmly, "There's someone outside my door causing a disturbance. Could you please take care of it?"



"Certainly, we'll be right there," the staff member replied courteously.



Verena thanked her and ended the call.


Soon after, hotel security arrived. Laura, hoarse from yelling,was approached by a young woman in uniform.



"Ma'am, we've had a complaint about a disturbance.Please leave at once," she said,gesturing to the exit.



Laura's brows knitted. A complaint? No doubt from that ungrateful girl.



She longed to retort, but her eyes caught the two burly guards standing behind the young woman.Clearly, they were not to be trifled with.



Swallowing nervously, Laura cast a venomous glare at the closed door, as though she couldpierce through and strike Verena down with her stare. That insolent brat had the upper hand this time!



"Do you know who I am? How dare you try to throw me out?" she barked, clinging to her Willis status.



But the young woman, smiling politely, replied,"No matter who you are, if you disturb our guests, you must leave." 
Realizing defiance was unwise, and fearing the guards might actually drag her away, Laura turned and left,her pride bleeding into silent rage.



At last, the corridor grew quiet.


Verena leaned back in her chair, staring up at the ceiling.



What exactly had Isaac said to provoke Laura's visit?


She could only guess, but the Willis family always put their interests first. Isaac must have warned them with sharp words, threatening their standing.


The thought of Isaac shielding her brought a soft smile to her lips.


She lifted her phone and sent him a message.



Feigning innocence, she typed, "Laura came to reconcile today,wanting me back home. Did you say something to them?"


In his office, Isaac was reviewing Willis Group's business reports when his screen lit up.



He glanced at it, saw Verena's message,and without hesitation replied, "Yes, I gave them a warning."



Lying on her bed, Verena broke into a wide grin at his candid admission. She loved that mix of seriousness and hidden shyness in him, so she decided to tease.



Instead of typing, she sent a playful voice message,her tone laced with charm. "Sharing a night together makes a difference, doesn't it? You're already standing up for your fiancée."



Her words-sharing a night together-slipped out softly, tinged with coquettish delight.


Isaac listened, and his heartbeat thundered in his chest.His ears turned crimson. Though nothing truly intimate had happened, last night's closeness had been charged enough to set histhoughts ablaze.



Her teasing was too vivid,difficult not to picture.


He pressed his lips together, steadying himself,and then recorded a reply, his tone restrained. "If you ever need anything, you can always come to me."


After a pause, worried she might misunderstand,he hastily added, "Not because of last night."



Hearing his hurried clarification, Verena burst into Laughter. Shy yet stubbornly dignified, he was undeniably endearing.


 
Glancing at the clock, she noticed it was nearly lunchtime. 
She tapped and sent him a video call request.



Isaac, seeing her avatar pop up, froze for a moment.


Reflexively, he adjusted his tie before accepting.


When the video connected, their eyes locked. Silence hung between them.



Verena studied him, waiting to see if he would break it.


Isaac,however, was still caught on her earlier teasing,momentarily tongue-tied.


At last, he cleared his throat and spoke.


"You..." He paused, gathering composure. "Did you want to talk about something?"



Through the screen, Verena noticed the faint curve at the corner of his lips. He was pleased, but still trying to mask it under his stern facade.



Her brow arched slightly-she hadn't realized he had this side to him.



Relaxing back, she twirled a strand of hair around her finger.



"Nothing in particular," she replied lazily, her voice dipped in playful lilt. "I just wanted to see whether my stern fiancé blushes when I tease him."

###Chapter 54 Touching Your Adam's Apple Through T...
Isaac could sense that Verena was teasing him deliberately.


For a moment, he paused, his fingers curling lightly against his knee.


He placed the phone on the stand before him, his figure looking slightly distant in the frame.


When his silence lingered, Verena smiled and urged gently, "Come a bit closer."


That way,she could see him more clearly.


But Isaac didn't move, so she coaxed again, "Come on,just a little closer."



Her voice carried a softness, almost sweet enough to melt the edges of his restraint, sending a subtle tingling through his heart.


His lips parted faintly, though no words came out. Still,he obeyed-bringing the phone nearer until his entire face filled the screen.



Verena fixed her gaze on him, unashamedly so. She  had to admit-he was strikingly handsome. The depth of his eyes, the bridge of his nose, and the lines of his features seemed carved with intent.



She made no effort to conceal her stare. As she herself had said, after sharing a night together,something had shifted between them.



Heat rose to Isaac's ears beneath her burning gaze.



Just as he was about to retreat from the camera,Verena suddenly laughed.


"Oh, your face isn't red," she said, eyes glimmering,"but your ears are."


Her tone rose with a playful lilt, laced with a subtle charm.



Isaac avoided her eyes, his gaze sliding downward-only to catch sight of something unintended. His pupils widened in surprise.



Verena, staying in the hotel room, was dressed in a thin robe. While she lay on her stomach on the bed,her movement caused the neckline to slip open,revealing a generous curve of her tender, rounded breasts.



Isaac's breath stalled. The image consumed his thoughts, pulling him back to the memory of last night-her warmth, her scent, the weight of her leaning against his chest.


Realizing where his mind was drifting, he frowned slightly, lips pressed tight as if to guard against temptation.



His Adam's apple shifted visibly as he tore his gaze away from the sight.



From the corner of his eye, he noticed Verena reaching toward the camera, as if trying to touch him through the screen.



In a low, husky voice, he asked, "What are you doing?"



Verena, bold as ever, answered without a trace of shyness, "I'm imagining touching your Adam's apple through the screen."



On his side, Isaac's head was tilted slightly upward,exposing the clean lines of his neck. His Adam's apple,prominent and smooth, rose and fell in view,tantalizing under her gaze.



Her straightforwardness left Isaac blushing,yet instead of discomfort, another thought slipped in-did she like it?



Watching her fascinated expression, he felt a quiet sense of peace. For a man like him, having something she liked was already more than enough. After a brief daze, Verena recalled something and said,"Oh, in a couple of days, it's time for your treatment again. I don't feel like going out lately, so why don't you come over instead? Just have your assistant bring the medical kit."



Isaac's expression stiffened for a beat, and then he nodded."Alright."



Seeing his shyness creeping back, Verena smoothly changed the subject.


She glanced behind him and asked, "Are you still working at this hour?"



Snapping back to himself, Isaac answered, "Yes."


"And have you had lunch?" she asked again.



He shook his head."Not yet."


Verena frowned lightly, her tone tinged with genuine concern. "Then eat something first, and get back to work afterward."



Her words carried the warmth of care.



Isaac looked at her deeply, his gaze softer than usual.He cherished such a warm feeling.


"Did you hear me, lsaac?" she pressed, seeing him lost in thought. He pursed his lips and answered gently, "Okay, I'll eat right away."


Satisfied with his compliance, Verena eased.



Before ending the call, she reminded him, "Remember,come to the hotel in two days. And don't go to the wrong place."


Glancing at the call duration, Isaac lowered his head and let out a quiet chuckle.



After a pause, he pressed the intercom. "Jacob, bring in the lunch."



A crisp "Yes" came through.


Soon after, Jacob entered the office lounge, carrying the meal.


Once he laid it out, lsaac took the fork and began eating.



Watching him, Jacob felt puzzled. Barely ten minutes ago, lsaac had dismissed lunch, claimning he wasn't hungry. What changed his mind so suddenly?



When the meal was done, Isaac returned to his desk."Jacob," he called.



"Yes, Mr. Bennett?" Jacob stepped forward. Flipping through a stack of documents, Isaac asked casually, "Isn't Willis Group opening a high-end club in the city center soon?"



Jacob blinked, momentarily taken aback, and then nodded."Yes."



Leaning back in his chair, Isaac tapped his fingers against the armrest in steady rhythm.



After a brief silence, his voice came slow and deliberate. "Tell Beckett the Willis club doesn't meet fire safety standards. It poses a major public hazard.He'll know what to do."



Jacob was stunned. Beckett Clark oversaw safety and enforcement.



At first, Jacob didn't quite grasp Isaac's aim. But once the order was spoken, clarity struck-lsaac was shielding his future wife.


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood. I'll contact Beckett immediately."




...



Beckett wasted no time. After receiving Jacob's message,he personally led a team to the site.


Sure enough, safety risks were found. The club was promptly sealed off.



By afternoon, the much-anticipated club was shut down before it could open.


When Alec heard, he nearly toppled from his chair.Rage and panic flooded him, his chest tightening with such force that he hurriedly swallowed a few pills for relief.



His brows knitted deep, his mind spinning in confusion.He had secured every connection, checked every detail before announcing the launch. Fire safety had been accounted for-so how could it collapse overnight?



The blow came like a thunderclap, leaving his thoughts in fragments.



Desperate, Alec snatched up his phone to call a friend,hoping for help-or at least guidance.



After three rings, the line connected.



"It's me, Alec," he blurted before the other could speak.


After a brief exchange of greetings, he rushed on,"Didn't I tell you a few days ago about Willis Group's new club? Out of nowhere today, we received an order to halt operations for rectification. Your network runs deep-can you find a way to help?" "Well..." the voice on the other end trailed, troubled With a sigh, he added, "Alec, it's not that I won't help.I can't. Beckett Clark himself intervened this time.Who dares go against him?"



Alec's face drained, his eyes tightening with dread.


"Alec, did you offend someone lately?" his friend speculated. Then he paused, thoughtful. "Wait. Aren't you supposed to be forming an alliance with the Bennett family? If that's the case,no one in Shoildon should risk targeting you. So how could you have provoked this? Besides, with Beckett on close terms with lsaac, he wouldn't normally deny you that courtesy."

###Chapter 55 Trying To Visit Barrie
At those words, Alec's eyes tightened in suspicion.Isaac-it could only be him!


In an instant, Alec grasped the truth, his body stiff and unmoving. Yes, without question, it was Isaac-it had to be.



The realization struck Alec that Isaac had made a move against the Willis family for Verena.


Yet what stunned him most was the speed of it. He had assumed it was only empty words, but lsaac had already taken action.


Dropping his elbows onto the desk, Alec buried his head in his hands, refusing to accept what was happening. More than ten years ago, on little more than a whim, he had poured in all his savings and struck gold with his investments. Wealth came overnight, yet he clung to the same business he had always known. In reality, no serious challenge had ever crossed his path.



For several years, the club had been his focus. He had poured his heart into it, only to watch everything unravel within hours. The Bennett family's pressure crushed his progress, forcing every plan to a halt. No -he had to find a way out, and quickly







Sometime after ten that night, a sleek black car rolled into the grounds of Willis Villa.



From the doorway, Laura watched Alec step out of the car while she reached for his briefcase. "Why did you come back so late tonight? Kaia and Luka finished their dinner long ago and are already asleep."



Normally, Laura paid him little attention, but tonight was different. Not bringing Verena along left her unsettled, and the unease made her unusually watchful.



"Are you hungry?" she asked, and then quickly turned toward the housekeeper. "Warm up the food."



"What's the use of reheating anything? Just the sight of you fills me with anger!" Alec barked.



Each time Alec dwelled on the company's problems that stemmed from Laura, fury surged through him Most men dreamed of marrying a virtuous wife, yet he was stuck with one who brought nothing but frustration and letdowns.



Laura's neck grew rigid under his shouting, and the smile on her face faltered. "Alec, why are you this upset?"



Alec's features contorted with rage. "You really want to know why I'm furious? If you hadn't picked a fight with Verena and cut ties with her, she wouldn't have run off, and Isaac wouldn't have shown up to demand payback! Because of you, our club that was about to open is now facing closure!"



"Closure?" Laura repeated, her brows knitting together in confusion. "What in the world is going on?"



After drawing several heavy breaths, Alec leveled a resentful glare at her. "Isaac sent his people to act on his command. He's backing Verena. That club was the product of years of my effort, and now, thanks to you,it's ruined."



Casting his eyes toward the living room,he asked,"Didn't you promise to apologize to Verena and bring her home? Then where is she now?"



Realizing there was no escaping the question, Laura averted her face with clear irritation.



"I went there,but she flatly refused to return with me.Instead, she summoned security and had me thrown out,leaving me utterly humiliated. I shamed myself for nothing. If you want her back so badly, then you go get her."


Alec had clung to the hope that if Verena came back, she might persuade Isaac on his behalf. Laura's words shattered that final chance, and his fury flared even hotter.



"Is your pride worth this much? Even now, you stay stubborn! Do you have any idea how much money vanished in a single afternoon? If the club stays closed,every last bit of our investment will disappear.Do you understand how many workers depend on us for their paychecks? When they come demanding their wages,then you'll learn what true humiliation feels like!"



To drive the point home, Alec made the situation sound even worse, hoping Laura would finally realize how serious things had become.



At last, Laura sensed the full weight of the problem,pressing her lips together to cover the panic stirring inside her. A spark of realization soon flickered in her eyes.



"Oh, of course!" Laura spun toward Alec, her earlier grim look replaced by sudden excitement. "How could we overlook something this important? Kaia healed Barrie's leg, practically giving him his life back! That was no small favor, and he owes us for it. With us in such dire straits now, how could he possibly refuse to help?"



The moment he heard her words, Alec felt a rush of relief, as if he had stumbled across a lifeline in the middle of his despair. Clarity washed over him at once.


With renewed energy, he exclaimed,"Yes,how could that slip our minds? Barrie treasures loyalty and gratitude. Since Kaia gave him such a favor, he'll be sure to repay it. Tomorrow morning I'll have the butler deliver a formal letter requesting an audience with him."



Early the following morning, Alec ordered his butler to take the letter he had prepared the night before straight to the Lyons family home.



Restlessly pacing through the living room, Laura murmured, "It's been so long since the letter was sent.Why hasn't there been any response?"



"Stop pacing back and forth in front of me. You're making me dizzy," Alec said with a frown from the sofa. "It hasn't even been that long since the letter went out. Sit down and be patient. Surely Barrie will want to read it thoroughly before responding, don't you think?"



Even as he spoke calmly, Alec's own nerves gnawed at him. He was more anxious than Laura and had already put business matters aside just to remain at home waiting for Barrie's reply.


Meanwhile, in the Lyons family's back garden, Barrie sat at a table enjoying breakfast, while his son Fletcher Lyons seized the rare chance to share the meal with him.



Their light conversation paused when the butler approached them.



Offering a slight nod to Fletcher, the butler handed Barrie a letter. "The chairman of Willis Group has written to you,requesting a visit."



"Alec Willis?" Barrie asked in surprise, taking the letter and scanning it quickly. "Our families rarely cross paths, so why is he suddenly reaching out to me?"


"What else could the reason be?" Fletcher remarked,handing Barrie a slice of cake. "Willis Group poured hundreds of millions into that club downtown,and just yesterday Beckett shut it down for failing fire safety regulations. He must be out of options and turning to you for help."



News of the closure had already spread through Shoildon like wildfire by yesterday afternoon.



Barrie, however, enjoyed the quiet of his own quarters in his old age and seldom paid attention to outside matters.



Setting the invitation down on the table, Barrie bit into the cake Fletcher offered. "How could a club of that size, backed by so much money, fail something as basic as fire safety checks?" Within business circles, greater sums of money always demanded stricter precautions. Everyone knew that being exposed by the simplest mistakes was the last thing they could afford.



Fletcher gave a knowing smirk. "Passing or failing safety checks depends entirely on Beckett."



Barrie dabbed his mouth with a handkerchief,confusion flickering in his eyes. "What did Alec do to offend Beckett?"



In on the truth, Fletcher shook his head with a faint smile. "It wasn't Beckett. The order came from lsaac."


Yesterday afternoon, when people close to Beckett asked about the details, Beckett openly admitted the command came from lsaac.



Had Isaac wanted his role kept secret, Beckett never would have revealed the truth.



By making it public, Beckett signaled that Isaac intended everyone to know he was the one behind Willis Group's club closure.



Fletcher's words only deepened Barrie's confusion."Isn't Isaac going to marry the Willis family's eldest daughter? Why would he act against them?"


Barrie struggled to make sense of it. Refusing to support his future father-in-law's business was one thing, but giving orders to sabotage Alec outright-what kind of logic was that?



Fletcher paused in thought,remembering when Slater had once said the Willis family's eldest daughter was unattractive and ill-tempered. He had scolded Slater then for spreading gossip, yet even now he couldn't help feeling pity for lsaac. Such a bright young man,but after that car accident...
###Chapter 56 Repaying Dr.Willis
With a quiet sigh, Fletcher guessed aloud. "Maybe Isaac is unhappy with his fiancée and feels powerless in this marriage arrangement. He could be using this as a chance to push the Willis family into canceling the engagement."



Having watched Isaac grow from a boy into a man,Barrie wore a grave expression.



At such a young age, Isaac had already lost his ability to walk and was now bound to a marriage with a woman he despised.



Not only did Isaac feel burdened, but the entire Lyons family pitied his situation.



Fletcher voiced his doubt next. "Alec needs to be sharper. Doesn't he check into relationships before seeking favors? Why would we interfere with someone Isaac is trying to deal with?"


After a short pause, he added, "Still, Alec isn't stupid.He rose to fortune almost overnight and built Willis Group into what it is today."


Following a moment of thought, Barrie said to the butler, "Get in touch with the Willis family and learn what you can."



The butler answered with respect, and then went off to search for the Willis family's number and place the call.



Inside the Willis Villa, Laura looked over at the wall clock. "It's already nine o'clock, and we still haven't heard back. Do you think Barrie is avoiding the trouble because he doesn't want to return the favor?"



Alec answered in a low, firm tone, "Nonsense! Barrie is known all over Shoildon for his integrity. You think everyone stoops to your way of thinking?"



Even as he mocked her, his eyes flicked to the clock,and his fists tightened.



The cup of coffee in front of him sat untouched,long since grown cold.



Truthfully, unease was gnawing at him.



His train of thought broke off when the landline suddenly rang



Alec and Laura froze in surprise, and then rushed toward the ornate round table to answer the call.


The screen displayed no name at all, only a short string of numbers. When Alec answered the call, he spoke cautiously."Hello, Alec Willis speaking."


On the other end, an aged, gravelly voice replied,"Good morning, Mr. Willis. This is Morris Fowler, the butler of MMr. Barrie Lyons."



At that, Alec looked over at Laura, and the nervous tension weighing on them both immediately lifted.


Alec answered warmly,, Mr. Fowler, I've heard of you. You've been with Mr. Lyons since your youth,skilled in so many things, and still impressive even in your sixties."


The praise flowed easily, masking Alec's eagerness beneath a layer of flattery.


"That's very kind of you, Mr. Willis." Morris, long used to such words, skipped over them and asked directly,"Mr. Lyons has seen your letter. What is the matter you wish to discuss with him?"


Laura, standing beside Alec, gave his elbow a small nudge, urging him to bring up the request without delay.


Still, Alec understood that men like Barrie had no patience for empty pleas without proper justification.


So,he chose to lean on sentiment and bring up Kaia's name.



"It's nothing too serious," Alec said with a gentle smile and a note of concern. "I only wished to ask how Mr.Lyons' injured leg is doing. The weather is cold now,and he ought to take care of his health."



Morris knitted his brows, puzzled by Alec's sudden concern over Barrie's condition.



At that moment, Alec let out a regretful sigh. "If I had realized sooner that my daughter could heal Mr.Lyons ' leg, I would have sent her years ago and spared him all that needless suffering."


Of course, Alec twisted the truth, fully aware that Kaia had not been capable of such work at the time.



That detail hardly mattered now. What counted was that he sounded sincere and that Morris remembered it was his daughter who had brought recovery to Barrie's leg.



In the end, the Lyons family remained indebted to the Willis family.



Once the call ended, Morris wasted no time and stepped quickly outside.



When Morris repeated Alec's message, Barrie grew quiet, lost in thought as he  considered the possibility.Dr.Willis had chosen to remain somewhat anonymous, revealing only her family name.



A moment later, Moris put forward a new idea. "That physician shared the surname Willis. Is it possible she's Alec's daughter, Mr. Lyons?"


Barrie's eyes brightened with understanding,his jaw slackening a bit. "My recovery hasn't been publicized.If this information reached them, there's a great chance Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter."


Turning his focus to Fletcher, he asked, "Can you tell me how many girls are in the Willis family?"



Knowledgeable about the household, Fletcher answered without hesitation, "They have two daughters. The older one is Isaac's fiancée. She grew up out in the countryside and reportedly didn't finish her last year of high school. The younger daughter is studying medicine and is said to be quite skilled."



Confirmation dawned on Barrie, and he smacked the table with a burst of excitement. "There it is! If the younger daughter's studying medicine, she must be Dr.Willis who healed my leg."



Determined, Barrie continued, "If Alec's daughter is the doctor who treated me, I owe her more than I can say. The Willis family deserves my help with their club problems-even if lsaac objects. Now, help me up!"Bracing himself with his cane, he insisted, "I want to speak to the Willis family myself. Take me inside."



The shared enthusiasm was clear as Fletcher quickly guided Barrie indoors.



Over at the Willis Villa, Alec felt surprised to hear the Lyons family calling back so soon.



As soon as he answered, an exuberant voice from the other end cut in before he could introduce himself."Mr. Willis, I owe you thanks. You've raised a remarkable and considerate daughter."



Though pride was unmistakable, Alec managed a humble reply. "Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Lyons.She certainly has a mischievous side."



Barrie responded warmly, "Don't sell her short, Mr.Willis. Your daughter is exceptionally well-mannered.It's a shame my grandson isn't good enough for her.Otherwise, it would be an honor if she joined my family."



Even though Alec heard Barrie's wish, he remained cautious about reading too much into it, focusing instead on the business at hand.



For Alec, the business matter came first.



Alec had only just begun to bring up the issue with the club when Barrie's strong voice interrupted him. "I'm aware of the problems regarding your club. Give me some time,and I'll take care of it."



Gratitude spread across Alec's features. "Your support means everything, Mr. Lyons. Thank you."


Without missing a beat, Barrie added, "Will you be available the day after tomorrow? If so, myfamily and I would like to pay a visit and show our appreciation."



Laura nearly let out a cheer, unable to contain her happiness.


Having one of Shoildon's most respected families come to visit would lift the Willis family's status to a new level.


Matching Laura's excitement, Alec nodded again and again, taking a deep breath to calm himself. "You are always welcome, Mr. Lyons. It's an honor for our family."



The phone call left Alec and Laura practically bursting with excitement, their energy lasting until Kaia finally returned from school later that day.


As soon as she stepped inside, Laura hurried over,cradled Kaia's cheeks, and planted a kiss on her forehead."You really are a wonderful daughter, Kaia.Every bit of love I've ever given you was worth it."

 ###Chapter 57 Don't Tell Me You Are Actually Jealous
Kaia's eyebrows knitted together,confusion flickering across her face. "Mom, what's gotten you all worked up?"


Laura could barely contain her excitement,her whole face lighting up. "You won't believe it-Barrie Lyons called this morning. He's not only stepping in to fix the club mess, but he said he'd drop by in two days to thank you himself for curing his leg!"


"Seriously?" Kaia blinked in surprise, and then broke into a wide, unstoppable smile. "He's coming here?"


Laura laughed and tugged her over to the couch."Why would I make that up? If you're doubting me,ask your dad."


Looking at Alec,Kaia immediately noticed the change.He seemed lighter, a genuine smile softening his features.


"She's telling the truth," Alec admitted, his tone gentle."Barrie couldn't stop praising you-said you're considerate, remarkable, and well-mannered."


Ever since Kaia's birth, Alec had considered her a lucky us charm. When fortune smiled on the family, he was sure she brought the blessing. That certainty faded over the years, but hearing Barrie's praise brought the old feeling rushing back.



To Alec, Kaia was the best thing that ever happened to them.



Laura squeezed Kaia's hand, still brimming with pride."And that's not all. Barrie even joked that it's a shame his grandson isn't good enough for you, or he'd love for you to marry into their family. That's how highly he thinks of you."



Compliments piling up, Kaia couldn't hide her delight.She smoothed her hair, chin tipping up with newfound confidence. "Honestly, I've never been short on admirers. If all my admirers from school lined up, we'd have a traffic jam on the block. And I'm no less than Slater. To say Slater is not good enough for me isn't exactly wrong."


Her playful confidence seemed to lift everyone's mood,leaving the whole house buzzing with pride.


"That's true," Laura said with a warm smile, reaching up to smooth Kaia's hair. "But keep this in mind-humility and manners go a long way, especially with families like theirs. They notice those things. When Barrie visits,be sure you look your best." Her mother's advice rang true, and Kaia knew exactly what was at stake. The Willis family and the Lyons family lived in different worlds, and she understood how much appearances mattered. "I get it, Mom. You don't have to worry. I'll keep my eyes and ears open,and I won't speak unless I need to."



Alec and Laura exchanged a proud glance, grateful for a daughter who never made life difficult.



Their thoughts drifted-almost involuntarily-to Verena.





Compared to Kaia, their other daughter always seemed determined to go her own way.



A complicated look passed over Alec's face. Only last night, he'd argued with Laura about bringing Verena home no matter the cost. Now, after the call from the Lyons family, he hadn't brought it up once. If Verena wanted to walk out of their lives, maybe it was time to let her.



Laura's happiness was impossible to miss-her smile stretched wide, pride sparkling in her eyes.



Why should she worry about Verena having Isaac? The Lyons family's support meant far more, and now their own future felt secure.



Even if the Bennett family was out of reach, Laura doubted Verena could cause trouble from a distance.



Feeling bold, she grabbed her phone and shot off a quick message to Verena.	"You're really underestimating both your father and your sister. Just because you have Isaac doesn't mean we're powerless.Don't count us out so quickly."



With a sigh, Verena gave a quick glance at Laura's message, her lips curling in a smirk.


Yesterday, Laura played the part of the doting,humble mother; today, she strutted around as if she ruled the world.If that wasn't a warning sign, Verena didn't know what was.



No response felt necessary. She locked her phone screen, dropped it onto the coffee table,and decided Laura's theatrics could wait for another day.


Half an hour passed before lsaac showed up at her door.



Jacob arrived just a step behind, setting the medical kit down on the table, eyes darting between his boss and Verena, as if waiting for a signal.


Verena flipped open the case, methodically checking every supply inside. "Jacob, you'll want to wait in the car this time. We might be a while."


Uncertain, Jacob lingered, looking to lsaac for guidance.



A brief silence hung between them before lsaac caught Verena's steady gaze, the intensity in her eyes making him look away



"You can wait outside, Jacob," Isaac said. "I'll call when we're finished here."



As soon as Jacob disappeared down the hall, Verena gently pushed Isaac's wheelchair into the bedroom.



Warm,floral notes filled the air, wrapping them both in a sense of quiet intimacy. Isaac's attention drifted to the neatly made bed, the memory of their night together flashing in his mind.



He could still recall how easily his hand had circled her slender waist-how small and delicate she'd felt,held close beneath the sheets.



Whenever she lay against him, it was as if she weighed nothing at all.



Every detail about her drew him in, except for that wild,unpredictable spirit that kept slipping through his fingers.



"Isaac."



A sudden rush of warmth danced along his ear as Verena's breath tickled his skin, making him go rigid Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac realized she'd come up behind him, her hands now resting firmly on his shoulders, her upper body pressed close.



He shifted, catching a glimpse of her elegant fingers,splayed over his shirt.


The moment sent a rush of memories through him-too vivid, too intimate. For once, the ever-composed Isaac felt thrown off balance.



"What..." His voice cracked,rough around the edges."Uh...what is it?"



Verena picked up on his nervousness with ease.


"Maybe I should be asking you," she murmured, her tone playful. "I must have said your name three times,and you didn't even blink. What's got you so distracted?"



Isaac fumbled for a reply. "It's nothing, just..."


She cut him off with a sly smnile, leaning in even closer, her words a secret meant only for him."Nothing? I'm guessing you were replaying that night in your head. The way you held my hand-how close we were?"



Her body pressed softly against his back, sending his pulse racing. So near, Verena could see the blush spreading across Isaac's cheeks and all the way to the tips of his ears.



"Relax, I'm just messing with you." Verena straightened, her hands slipping away. "Let's get started with your therapy."



Isaac's shoulders eased as he let out a shaky breath,looking every bit the guilty kid caught in the act.


Even now, her voice close to his ear kept replaying that night in his mind-the teasing, the laughter, and how powerless he'd felt against her charm.



Helping him settle on the bed, Verena carefully rolled up his shirt and reached for his belt buckle.



A look of alarm flashed across Isaac's face as he caught her wrists, voice a little breathless. "Wait-what are you doing?"



Tension rippled across his abdomen, muscles taut with anticipation and nerves.



With a calm glance, Verena answered, "I need to start your treatment."



Realizing he might be overreacting, he averted his gaze, his voice low. "I don't remember ever needing to undress for this before..." Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Things have changed. We used to focus just on your legs, but today's therapy targets a new area."



Color rose in his cheeks, but he still didn't release her hands. "Is that really necessary?"



"It is. I need access to your lower abdomen," Verena replied plainly.


For a moment, Isaac hesitated, clearly torn.



"Are you sure we can't do this another way?" he mumbled,almost hopeful.


She let out a gentle laugh,exasperation mingling with affection. "Isaac, trust me-if you want to get better,you'll have to let me do my job."



His hand still trapped hers, so Verena leaned in,locking eyes with him. "Are you planning to avoid intimacy forever, or are you actually going to let me help you?"



Heat rushed to Isaac's cheeks, and his grip slackened at once.



Taking the opportunity, Verena deftly unfastened his belt.



The faint click echoed between them, prompting lsaac us to snatch her wrists again, flustered. "I can handle this part myself," he muttered.



She let him take over, watching as his black trousers slipped just enough to expose his lower abdomen Quietly, Verena dipped her fingers into a jar of herbal ointment-a formula she'd painstakingly perfected these last few days, meant to target his condition.



His skin was hypersensitive to the touch, and even the cool, light pressure of her fingertips sent a shiver through him.



Verena leaned in close to make sure the ointment stayed put, the ends of her hair brushing his stomach and making him twitch with a mix of embarrassment and anticipation.



After smoothing the ointment, she rolled over a heat lamp,angling it toward him and switching it on.


While the medicine did its work, Verena crossed the room,picked up a small gift box, and carried it back to Isaac. Inside was a dark, elegant necktie.



"This is for you," she said, placing the tie in his hand.



It wasn't new-just something he'd left behind long ago in Clokron, after a night spent at her place when he refused to leave her side.



The night before, Gavin had managed to return the tie, slipping it back into Verena's hands.


Isaac turned the fabric over in his fingers,remembering how,at Fortune Garden Restaurant,he'd watched her tug the tie of the man she was with.



The color, the pattern-everything matched the one he held now.



The thought nagged at lsaac-had she given that tie to the man?



His gaze dropped, a faint frown shadowing his face



Even knowing the truth, he couldn't shake off the sting of jealousy.



Turning the tie over in his hands, he muttered, "You hand these out to everyone, or am I special?"



Verena caught the low rumble of his voice and looked over,brow raised. "What's that supposed to mean?"



He glanced away, voice even softer. "It's nothing.Forget it."



Verena's laughter was light. "You're seriously going to act like that? Why on earth would you think I'm giving ties to half the city?"


For a moment, Isaac stayed quiet, fingers tracing the fabric. Then, almost reluctantly, he spoke up."|saw you at the restaurant. The guy sitting across from you had a tie just like this. Did you give him one too?"



His last words sounded almost wounded-more boyish than he meant to.



Verena's smile widened as she leaned in, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Isaac, don't tell me you're actually jealous."

###Chapter 58 It Belongs To You Alone
Jealous?



Isaac's brows knitted faintly. He could not tell if what he felt was truly jealousy, yet every time he saw another man near Verena, a sharp pang twisted in his chest.



To make matters worse, Verena gifted him a tie that looked exactly like the one worn by that other man.


Isaac lowered his gaze, lips sealed in silence. Verena could see through him; whether he admitted it or not,there was a trace of jealousy in his heart.


She gently took the tie from his hand and explained patiently, "This tie was custom-made in Clokron There is no duplicate, no stock left behind.I asked my friend to bring it home for me, but finding it inconvenient, he casually wore it around his neck.That was the scene you stumbled upon in the restaurant."



Placing the tie back in his palm, she added softly,"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."


After all, the tie had always been his. Isaac, ever meticulous, had always worn ties designed by professionals with exacting care.


But since his memory still lay shrouded in amnesia,Verena left it at that, offering only a brief explanation.


Isaac looked down at the tie once more, her words echoing in his mind-"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."



What she had said so casually struck a deeper chord in him.



To Isaac, it sounded as if Verena had chosen it exclusively for him, a token meant to bind the two of them.



The thought stirred a sudden wave inside him, so strong he had to draw in a quiet breath to steady himself.



"Thank you," he murmured, a faint curve on his lips betraying his inner delight.


Verena caught his smile and tilted her head playfully."So, are you happy now? You're satisfied so easily,aren't you?"


Before he could reply, she leaned in and brushed a feather-light kiss across his cheek. "You're welcome.I'm just glad you're happy." 
Then, as though nothing had happened, Verena switched off the heating lamp, removed the ointment from his abdomen, and busied herself with quiet efficiency,leaving Isaac to wonder if that fleeting kiss had been real or merely an illusion of his longing



When the treatment was complete,Verena helped him sit upright and reminded him gently, "Don't take a bath once you're home tonight. If you feel uncomfortable, you may use a damp towel to wipe yourself down, but take care not to let water touch your abdomen."



Isaac nodded as he settled back into his wheelchair."Alright, I understand."


Verena didn't try to detain him further. Isaac called Jacob, who soon arrived upstairs and wheeled him toward the elevator.



...



Back at the Bennett residence, Isaac found Danica waiting on the sofa, her eyes fixed on him with a look of discontent.



From her expression alone, lsaac could already guess what was coming.


Sure enough, he had barely turned his wheelchair when Danica rose and demanded, "The Willis family's 
club was shut down. Was it your doing?"


Isaac stilled his wheels and answered without hesitation, "Yes. It was me."



Earlier,when Danica learned that someone influential had moved against the Willis family, she casually dispatched people to investigate-after all, the Willises were meant to become her in-laws.



To her astonishment, the culprit turned out to be none other than her own son, who had personally instructed Beckett to close the venue.



Danica was dumbfounded then, and now, hearing him admit it so calmly, her shock mingled with anger.


"Didn't you already agree to marry Verena? Why,then,are you still striking against the Willis family? Call Beckett this instant. He only listens to you. Tell him to remove the restrictions immediately and let the venue resume its operations."



"Impossible," Isaac rejected without pause. "I agreed to marry Verena for her sake, not for the Willis family.I acted because they bullied her first. Verena is my fiancée, and I will not stand by while she suffers."


His unwavering tone left Danica briefly at a loss for words. "So you're already protecting her to such an extent? Don't forget-even with a few quarrels,Verena is still their daughter, their very flesh and blood. By moving against the Willises now, outsiders will say you don't truly want this marriage, that you're creating excuses deliberately."



Isaac's eyes narrowed, his expression composed and unshaken by her arguments.


"Rest easy. I will not let her suffer. On our wedding day, I'll make sure everyone understands just how much I care for Verena."



His certainty both startled and unsettled Danica.



For the first time, she could see clearly that her son was deeply taken with Verena.



It wasn't his affection that disturbed her, but his disregard for the Bennett family's standing.


Verena,it seemed, was not the pliant woman Danica had imagined.


Unable to contain her anger any longer, Danica snapped, "And what do you expect to accomplish by this? Are you intent on dragging the Bennett family's name through the mud? Before the marriage arrangement, I promised the Willises certain benefits.Now, the wedding hasn't even taken place, the benefits haven't been granted, yet you've already struck at them. What will people say? That the Bennetts are ungrateful?" Danica's true concern was crystal clear-what others thought of the Bennett family. The Willis family's plight was merely secondary.



Isaac knew this better than anyone.



It was that very obsession with appearances that had driven her to arrange his marriage hastily, lest others discover the illnesses he carried beyond his crippoled legs.



His gaze turned cold as he answered slowly, "What others think is theirs to carry. I have no need to live by their judgments. All I know is this-if anyone dares harm the woman I care for, they must face the consequences."



Danica fell silent, stunned into speechlessness.


It was one matter for him to act against the Willises,but to shield Verena with such fierceness was another altogether.



Only then did Danica grasp that she had underestimated her future daughter-in-law. "People say Verena is a country girl, unsophisticated and harmless. Clearly, everyone was mistaken. She has tricks up her sleeve. In such a short time, she's managed to sway you enough to disregard your own family's reputation. It seems Bobby was right after all.I dismissed his words before,but now I see-if she can turn against her own parents, she will no doubt throw this household into chaos once she becomes your wife."



Danica paused,and then declared with iron resolve, "I arranged this marriage to secure a woman who would be compliant, one I could manage easily. Verena is nothing of the sort. Since you've moved against the Willis family, then so be it-we will cancel this marriage."



At that word "cancel," Isaac's head lifted sharply, his dark gaze locking onto hers.



Danica's heart gave a tremor under the weight of his eyes.



Since the accident, lsaac had rarely looked at her directly.



When speaking, he usually kept his gaze lowered,fixed on the ground.



But now-for the first time since that day-he looked at her straight on, and in his eyes burned a storm of anger.

Chapte 59 Danica Requested To Meet Verena
Isaac spoke with a voice as steady as stone. "I agreed to this marriage not for the sake of the Willis family,and certainly not for you. I did it only because it's Verena. Whether in the past or now, no one-not even you-can keep me from marrying her."


Danica's face darkened with anger as she warned coldly,"Do you truly believe I cannot stop you?"



Isaac's composure never faltered. "With your influence, you could end this marriage in a thousand ways. But Mother, if you dare to do so, then from this moment on, I will live without a mother."



His words struck like a hammer. Danica grasped the meaning and felt her heart reel in disbelief.



A storm of anger and astonishment surged within her.She looked down at lsaac, her frown deepening."Would you really cut the bond between us over a woman?"



From where he sat, lsaac heard her voice. His fists clenched and released, yet his tone remained calm. "lt isn't only about Verena. The instant you chose to harm her, you trampled on my feelings. And since you do not care for mine, why should I care for yours?"


Raising his voice, he commanded the butler, "Take me back to my room."


At once, the butler came forward and escorted him into the elevator.



Danica,left behind in the silence of his words, sank heavily onto the sofa. Her mind spun with disorientation.



Since the accident, she had never seen Isaac speak with such force. It was as though the man she once knew before the tragedy had returned.



Her frown deepened; doubt gnawing at her heart.


Was the marriage with the Willis family truly a wise arrangement?



As these troubled thoughts circled, a voice from the stairwell broke her reverie.



"I warned you Verena wasn't decent, but you wouldn't listen.And now look-she's driven my brother to this."Bobby leaned against the railing, arms folded, gazing down at Danica.



Still shaken by her clash with Isaac, Danica snapped,"Enough! Hold your tongue." Bobby gave a mocking scoff, pretending indifference.

"Doesn't matter to me."



With that, he turned and went upstairs.



Yet once alone in his room, Bobby unlocked his phone and fired off a message to "Verena". "Congratulations.You've finally earned my mother's dislike. She no longer agrees to this marriage, so stop dreaming about being Isaac's wife-stop dreaming of becoming Mrs. Bennett."



Though he had heard every word lsaac spoke downstairs, he still sent the message, hoping to unsettle that woman he despised.



He could not fathom how his usually sharp brother had fallen for such a facade.







Fresh from her shower, Kaia noticed the new message on her alternate account.


Her eyes lit with excitement, and pride flickered across her face.



She had done nothing, yet Verena seemed on the verge of being cast aside by the Bennett family.



Now, with the Lyons family backing her and Verena rejected by the Bennetts, Kaia felt her fortunes soaring higher than ever.


Smirking, she lifted her chin with arrogant grace and replied to Bobby, "Whether your mother approves or not doesn't matter, so long as Isaac does."



Reading the reply, Bobby's face darkened.


Her words dripped with arrogance,and yet-he could not deny the bitter truth. If his brother chose to rebel,even their mother could not stop him.







Meanwhile, as Verena prepared the herbal ointment for lsaac, her phone rang.



She glanced at the caller ID, her brows lifting in surprise.



Danica?



During their earlier arranged meeting, under Laura's subtle persuasion, she and Danica had exchanged numbers. But they had never spoken since, and Verena had nearly forgotten she had her contact.



Why was Danica calling now?


Curious, Verena answered with polite warmth. "Hello,Mrs.Bennett. This is Verena. How may I help you?" Before dialing, Danica had steeled herself to speak with severity.


Yet hearing Verena's voice-gentle, courteous,almost smiling-gave her pause.



How could one lash out at such composure?


Suppressing her misgivings, Danica forced a smile. "If it's convenient, let's meet. I'llsend the address."


Verena's brows knitted faintly. The only subject between them was Isaac.



And if Danica sought her alone, it could hardly bode well.



Even so, she had no intention of shrinking away.Rather, she wanted to know Danica's true purpose.


So she answered evenly, "Very well, Mrs. Bennett. I'lL see you soon."



After hanging up, Verena freshened up quickly and left the hotel to hail a cab.


Danica had chosen a stylish café, where soft jazz played and the air felt tranquil.


Once Verena confirmed her name, a server guided her to a reserved window booth. By the time Danica appeared with her assistant,Verena had already finished half her coffee.



Verena rose gracefully, offering a polite nod."Good day, Mrs. Bennett. It's nice to see you again."



In truth, Danica had arrived earlier but lingered outside for twenty minutes, waiting to gauge Verena's patience.



By rumor, a woman of Verena's temperament would have been restless by then.


Yet what greeted her was a composed, courteous young woman, whose manners could not be faulted.



This unexpected poise unsettled Danica, compelling her to look closer.



Verena wore a white wool coat over a soft turtleneck,paired with slim jeans that shaped her figure.



Her subtle makeup brightened her smile, softening her already gentle features. She looked approachable,even disarming


Danica sighed inwardly. Outwardly, Verena looked every bit the perfect daughter-in-law of the Bennett family-except for the suspicion that her heart hid deceit. Casting aside such thoughts, Danica sat and forced a faint smile before asking bluntly, "Did you instruct Isaac to move against the Willis family?"


Move against the Willis family?



Her words confirmed what Verena had guessed



So Isaac had already taken steps.



Was it because of what he had promised her that day?



A warmth stirred in Verena's heart, touched by the knowledge that, memory or not, lsaac had always stood by her whenever she was wronged.



Though he had never spoken of his plans, she could see the reason clearly.



When she told him she had been cast out of her family, Isaac had vowed to handle it for her.


She had not expected him to act so swiftly.
###Chapter 60 What Did My Mother Tell You
Verena never asked Isaac to move against the Willis family, but he only did it for her sake.


For that reason, she offered no denial and gave Danica a small nod. "In a sense, yes."


When Danica pressed her lips together, Verena added with a faint smile, "Still, I doubt you asked me here only to talk about this matter."


Her voice carried a steady calm, revealing her knack for anticipating others' intentions while keeping her emotions firmly in check despite the sudden probing.


This level of composure was exactly what Danica respected most when dealing with people in business.


Danica studied her for a long moment before laughing lightly. "I don't know what kind of dispute exists between you and your family, but since your marriage to Isaac is already certain, have you thought about how others will judge you if he acts against your family? And how they might criticize him?"


Though spoken indirectly, the meaning was clear to Verena. "Are you suggesting I stop him?"she asked Danica inclined her head, looking satisfied. "You're quick to see my point."


In her mind, Verena's words meant agreement,and she assumed Verena would soon persuade Isaac to relent.


Verena lifted her cup, breathed in the coffee's scent,and then set it down again before meeting Danica's eyes with a serene smile. "Thank you for saying that.But the fact you came to me shows you've already argued with lsaac about this. I understand your concerns, yet lsaac is acting for my sake. I would never be ungrateful enough to stand in his way. So I'm afraid I won't stop him."


Danica's expression tightened, doubt clear in her eyes.She suspected Verena was using lofty words as a mask,hiding her real intentionto weaken the Willis family.To her, it was astonishing that someone so young could already be this calculating.


Danica's fingers curled more firmly around the cup handle as she said, "I never expected you to be this stubborn. Keep in mind, if lsaac truly destroys the Willis family, you'll be left with nothing to depend on in Shoildon."



When she finished speaking, Danica searched Verena's expression for a flicker of panic. In her eyes, the Willis family had always been Verena's foundation, both before and after her marriage.


The mention of "depend" drew a hint of amusement from Verena. From the age of seven, she had lived without her parents' affection. Alec and Laura had left her in Shawna's care, offering her only the bare minimum,nothing more.



Her move to ShoiIdon had been for one reason alone,to tie her to the Bennett family. Every word they ever spoke to her revolved around praising Kaia and Luka while pointing out her shortcomings.



Depend? In truth, she had never once known what it meant to rely on her parents.



Verena kept her expression soft and steady, her tone balanced between humility and confidence as she replied, "You're reading too much into it. The Willis family has never been my foundation-neither in the past,nor now, nor in the future. The only support I've ever truly had is myself."



A light laugh slipped from her lips as she added, "No,that isn't entirely true. I have lsaac now as well."



Danica looked at her in open surprise. Sitting tall with her slender back straight, Verena spoke with a calmness and poise that carried quiet conviction,persuasive without the slightest hint of agitation.


During the entire ten minutes they spoke, Verena never once faltered, carrying herself with composed elegance and flawless delivery.



A flicker of surprise passed through Danica as she took in the depth of Verena's character. She had expected Isaac's wife to be pliable and easily managed,someone incapable of exposing his vulnerabilities after marriage. Yet what parent wouldn't feel pride in seeing their son matched with a woman both intelligent and beautiful?



With her feelings tangled, Danica lifted her coffee,drank slowly, let out a quiet sigh, and rose from her seat. "Forget it. I'm old now. There are plenty of matters I'd rather not get involved in. The two of you can manage your own business."


Verena rose as well, giving her a courteous smile."Goodbye, Mrs. Bennett."



While returning to the Bennett Mansion, Danica's assistant kept glancing at her from the front seat,clearly holding back his words.



Noticing his hesitation, Danica said, "Go ahead, say what's on your mind."



Given the opening, the assistant finally spoke his doubts. "Will you truly overlook the Willis family's troubles and allow Miss Willis and Mr. Bennett to act without restraint?" Standing behind Danica in the coffee shop, he had caught every word exchanged between the two ladies.



"Act without restraint?" Danica repeated with a faint smile, her gaze drifting out the window. "Isaac is nothing like Bobby. He never makes a move without certainty. We're only speaking of the Willis family. If neither lsaac nor Verena is concerned, why should I risk discord with my own son over them?"



Business had always been Danica's compass, and she knew well what truly mattered.


Still unsatisfied, the assistant furrowed his brows."Didn't you intend for Miss Willis to stop Mr. Bennett from striking against the Willis family? Why back away now?"



Danica gave him a brief glance before responding,"Do you think I care so little for lsaac? He is my son.I won't damage our relationship for the sake of outsiders. Meeting Verena was only to measure her attitude toward Isaac's actions against the Willis family."



Understanding dawned at last, and the assistant nodded slowly.



That exchange had shifted Danica's perception of Verena entirely. The young woman was neither gullible nor easily swayed, and she was nothing like the ignorant figure painted by rumor. Following his most recent quarrel with Danica, Isaac ordered Jacob to keep watch over her schedule,making sure Verena would not be dragged into anything troublesome. The moment anything unusual occurred, it was to be reported to him at once.



The instant Isaac learned that Danica had scheduled a private meeting with Verena, his gaze sharpened.Without hesitation, he opened his contacts and dialed the first name on the list.


The line rang over and over without response,and by the time he lowered the phone slightly, sweat had already dampened his palm.



Isaac ended the call and immediately tried again,repeating the attempt again and again, only to meet silence each time.



At that same moment, Verena stood in the hotel corridor, searching through her bag for her key when her screen lit up, showing a list of missed calls.



Looking closer, she realized there were eight of them,every single one from lsaac.



Without delay, she pressed to return his call.


Just as Isaac was about to leave the office, with his car waiting below, his phone began to ring.



He stopped his wheelchair at once, grabbed the phone,and asked directly, "What did my mother tell you?"


Verena pushed open her hotel room door, only to hear lsaac's voice come through, carrying a faint edge of anxiety.



After hanging the key on the back of the door, she sat down at the desk, surprised by his tone."You already knew?"


Isaac confirmed it without hesitation before asking her, "What exactly did she say?"



Verena caught the tension in his voice and let a playful smile spread across her face. "You've been that concerned about me? You actually called more than once. Were you planning to show up at the hotel if I didn't pick up?"
###Chapter 61 Going To See Dr. Willis




Verena let out a regretful sigh. "Had I known, I would have ignored the calls, just so you'd come seeing me."



Isaac felt a sharp tingle in his ears at the sound of her soft tone, yet his chest tightened with urgency.He swallowed before saying in a hushed, firm voice,"Verena, I'm asking you something serious."


Realizing his concern was genuine, Verena dropped the teasing and said reassuringly, "Relax, your mother only asked me out for coffee. She didn't make things difficult."


Isaac struggled to accept that Danica would call Verena out without some serious purpose. Her calm words only stirred up a storm of uneasy possibilities in his mind.



He hesitated, and then asked with deliberate seriousness,"Did my mother... tell you to leave me?"

For a split second, Verena stood speechless. It dawned on her that lsaac was probably imagining one of those soap opera scenes where the male lead's mother marched in, tossed a check on the table, and snapped at the female lead, "Take it and stay away from my son!"


She laughed lightly and teased, "Isaac, have you been glued to soap operas lately?"


The easy, genuine laughter spilling from her lips showed Danica hadn't upset her in the slightest.Seeing she was mocking him, lsaac rubbed his eyebrow and mumbled, "I don't watch that stuff."


It was true he never watched such shows,but his nerves often pushed his mind toward unnecessary thoughts.


Verena lowered her gaze with a smile. She hadn't expected Isaac to worry for her this deeply, even without remembering their shared past, and the realization left her quietly content.


Isaac finally exhaled, relieved that his mother hadn't given Verena trouble."By the way," Verena said suddenly, recalling something. "I was wondering if you noticed any changes in that area when you woke up this morning."


The sudden shift in topic left Isaac taken aback for a brief moment.



Realizing she meant his condition, he pressed his lips together before answering simply, "No."


Verena went silent at his reply. With his situation,there should have been at least some small sign after the first use of the herbal ointment. Why was there none at all?



She asked again, "Did you feel even the slightest burning sensation?"


Isaac felt a chill run through him at her careful question.


He answered quietly, "No."


The call fell into silence, and Verena's voice did not come through. The room around him was so still that he could almost hear the pounding of his own heart.


Frustration pressed down on his chest until it was hard to breathe. Clenching his jaw, he blurted out,"When you worked with other patients, did they see results after only one treatment?"


Verena's shoulders sagged as she gave a grave reply."Yes."


She picked up on the sudden quiet on the other end and could tell lsaac was starting to worry, so she chimed in to ease his mind, "You don't need to be anxious. Everyone's body reacts in its own way..."


With near desperation, Isaac asked, "Have you ever had another case with no response at all, the way l am now?"



Verena's brows drew together. The word "yes"hovered on her lips, yet she couldn't bring herself to lie to him.



Tightening her fist, she lowered her voice and said,"No." Isaac said nothing, completely tuned out from whatever Verena was saying on the other end of the line. There wasn't a soul he could turn to. A flood of emotions such as shame, fear, uselessness, and a rising panic twisted through him like thick vines,tightening with every passing second as a bitter taste crept into his mouth.



Isaac lowered his head, the corners of his eyes rimmed with red, tears shining but refusing to fall.Had he been a fool to hope from the very beginning?He had swallowed countless pills, endured needle after needle, even gone under the knife, and still nothing had changed. Maybe he should never have started this endless road of treatment at all.


To him, staying by Verena's side while bound by his condition felt like he was only holding her back.


Isaac lowered his gaze, forced down the tightness in his throat, and quickly said, "Sorry, I've got something to handle. I'll contact you another time."


Verena parted her lips to respond, only to be met with the abrupt busy tone on the line. ···


Inside the Lyons family home...


"Slater, get changed into proper clothes. Put on something formal," Barrie said as he poulled his grandson toward his bedroom.



Slater had managed only two bites of his banana when Barrie snatched it away and threw it aside.


He wrinkled his brow in puzzlement. "Why, Grandpa?Isn't what I'm wearing good enough? Who are we meeting that makes you dress so formally? You're even in a suit."



Ever since his retirement, Barrie had preferred loose,casual wear and rarely bothered with such formal suits.


When Barrie mentioned the meeting two days earlier,he had told Slater only that they would see someone today, but he never revealed who it was.


Seeing Barrie dressed up so seriously and calling for the entire family to join, Slater's curiosity grew  sharper.


Barrie kept tugging at his grandson's clothes as he explained, "We're going to meet your grandfather's lifesaver, Dr.Willis."


"Dr. Willis!" Slater's eyes sparkled, and he asked with excitement, "Why didn't you tell me before? Where is she living? Is she also in Shoildon?"


His excitement rang too loudly, and Barrie gave him a push into the room. "You'll know once we arrive. For now,get yourself ready."


After shutting the door behind Slater, Barrie turned and spotted Fletcher approaching with his wife.


Fletcher was dressed in a dark suit, while Marietta Lyons wore a coordinating outfit that made her look elegant and proper.


Barrie's eyes went to Fletcher as he asked, "ls everything prepared?"


Fletcher gave a confident nod. "Rest assured. Allthe gifts you requested have been arranged exactly as you wanted."


Barrie's face lit with satisfaction as he gave a nod of approval. Turning to the butler, he said, "Call the Willis family and tell them we're on our way."


With a slight nod, the butler said, "Yes." He then turned and walked inside to place the call.


The Lyons family's household was already full of movement, but over at theWillis Villa, the pace was even more relentless.


"Careful there, scrub the corners of that flower bed properly."


"Start on the stair railings-wipe them with a damp cloth first, and then dry them off thoroughly."


"Remove those coffee beans and replace them with the premium batch."


From the living room, Laura's voice echoed as she rattled off one order after another.


Even though the servants had already scrubbed the villa spotless the previous day, Laura demanded it be cleaned all over again.


"Laura." Alec came down the staircase while fussing with his tie. "Come see-how does this outfit look?Do you think the tie is too bold?"


Laura stepped over, fixed his tie with her hands, and smiled. "No, this looks refined. Today's just a private gathering, so there's no need to be overly formal."


Alec grinned in relief at her answer. "Good, good,then I'll wear this."


Laura, brimming with excitement, quickly asked,"And what about my outfit today?"


She stood there in a fine dress draped with an elegant shawl, radiating both affluence and poise.
###Chapter 62 Something They Both Cared About





At Laura's question, Alec broke into a hearty laugh,the creases around his eyes deepening. "You're absolutely dazzling."


When it came to something they both cared about,they looked like newlyweds still wrapped up in the glow of their honeymoon.


Both understood that today marked a turning point for their standing in Shoildon. After all, Barrie's decision to visit their home with his family was no ordinary honor.


Word in Shoildon never stayed secret for long, and they were certain the elite circles would soon buzz with news of this visit.



The butler approached quickly, voice laced with respect. "Mr. Willis, Mrs. Willis, I've just been informed by the Lyons family's butler that Mr. Barrie  Lyons and his household are already on their way."


Excitement flashed in Alec's eyes as he met Laura's gaze, and then motioned to the butler. "Quickly,make sure the refreshments are ready."


A slight furrow appeared on Laura's brow. "I'll see what's keeping Kaia. Why isn't she downstairs yet?"


Alec gave a quick nod. "Yes, bring her down right away."


They couldn't have been prouder of Kaia. Without her talent, a connection with the Lyons family-especially on such favorable terms-would have been unthinkable.


Clicking up the stairs in her heels, Laura's excitement got the better of her, and she pushed open the door without a knock.


"Kaia, why are you still dawvdling? Barrie and his family will be here any minute," Laura exclaimed.


As she approached the vanity, Laura's eyes gleamed with pride at the sight of her daughter.  Kaia wore a pale blue strapless gown draped with a white fur coat, her look both graceful and striking.


"My goodness, you'd outshine anyone no matter what you wore," Laura said warmly as she smoothed Kaia's sleek hair.


Lifting a perfume bottle, Kaia spritzed her wrist and dabbed it behind her ear, a smug smile tugging at her lips. "Mom, people have admired me since I was little. Haven't you gotten used to it by now?"


Laura's eyes shone with satisfaction. "Yes, yes, your beauty is endless. But hurry now. Barrie is an elder,and it wouldn't be right to make him wait."


With her chin tipped upward, Kaia muttered,"Alright."




Still, inside, Kaia dismissed Laura's caution. Elder or not, she had saved Barrie's life. Was there any need to tremble before him?


The man struggled with long-term illnesses, and she had practically pulled him back from the brink. Even if she carried herself with a touch of arrogance, who could fault her? Yet she understood why Laura pressed for humility-their family's position still couldn't measure up.







A sleek black vehicle belonging to the Lyons family eased around the bend and rolled into the driveway of the Willis Villa.



From the entrance of the main house, the Willis butler spotted the vehicle and hurried back inside to deliver the news.



With excitement in his voice, he announced to Alec,"The Lyons' vehicle has just pulled in-our guests are here."



Springing from the sofa, Alec turned to Laura on the sofa and Kaia, who had just stepped down the staircase. "Come on, let's greet Barrie and his family properly. We have to show them respect."


Laura rose to join him, but Kaia walked to the sofa and sat down, smoothing her hair with one hand and resting the other on her lap. "You two go ahead. I'l stay here."


Laura's face showed bewilderment, while Alec assumed Kaia was growing arrogant because of Barrie's regard for her.


With a faint scowl, Alec warned, "Kaia, this won't do.Even if you treated Barrie's leg, you must stilI act with humility before someone older."


Kaia pushed out her lower lip. "That's not what I meant, Dad. I just don't want it to look like I'm desperate to butter up the Lyons family. Go on without me.I'll wait here."


Though Alec felt like continuing the lecture,he cut himself short with the Lyons family at the door."Forget it," he muttered, striding outside with Laura.


Inside the vehicle, as the driver looked for a spot to park, the Lyons family of four carried on a lively conversation.


From the inside pocket of his suit jacket,Fletcher drew out a sleek black-gold card and looked at Barrie, saying, "Dad, I wasn't around when Dr. Willis  treated you, but Slater was inconsiderate and failed to thank her properly. Since we're going in person this time, I intend to do it right."


Slater immediately protested, his eyes flicking to the card. "Inconsiderate? That's unfair, Dad. If you want to thank Dr. Willis, money isn't the way. She's not like the others-she's more like those legendary doctors from novels who couldn't care less about riches.Grandpa once tried to offer her a generous sum. She turned it down, saying she'd been paid her fee and didn't need anything else."
###Chapter 63 Dr. Willis Is Alec's Daughter





Slater let out a dreamy sigh. "If Dr. Willis actually liked me, marrying her would be a good choice to thank her properly."


Laughter erupted from Barrie as he turned to Slater and said, "That's not going to work on me. I'm wise to all your frivolous behavior, you brat. There's no way I'd let Dr. Willis end up upset."


Slater grabbed at his chest with an exaggerated look of pain. "Grandpa, how could you accuse me like that?"


At that moment, the driver pulled the car to a stop and swung open the rear door.


Marietta reached over with a smile, giving Slater a pat as he sat by the door. "That's enough nonsense.Out you go." Slater straightened up and unfolded his long legs as he climbed out. When his eyes landed on the building ahead, a strange familiarity hit him,especially when he spotted the fountain close by.



Assuming his memory hadn't failed him, he was pretty sure he had seen that same spot before in one of Kaia's posts online.


Slater blinked in shock. "What are we doing at the Willis family'shouse?"


Barrie leaned against his cane with a chuckle. "You mean you didn't know? Dr. Willis is Alec Willis'daughter."


Slater froze in astonishment. "Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter?"


The Willis family had two girls. One was Kaia, the one he was familiar with.



The other was Verena, who had only just come back from the countryside.


Since he already knew Kaia, that left only one possibility...


Hold on a second!


Could the eldest daughter of the Willis family, the one who had come back from the countryside,actually be Dr.Willis?


Slater's mind spun in a storm of disbelief,overflowing with exclamation marks and question marks.


If Dr. Willis truly turned out to be Verena,then he had already badmouthed her more than once behind her back.


Impossible! Anyone who had spoken ill of Verena must have been spreading lies.


Slater resolved on the spot that he had to apologize to Dr. Willis without delay.


"Mr. Lyons, at last you've arrived." A lively male voice cut into Slater's thoughts, and when he lifted his head, Alec and Laura were already waiting near the car."You're looking as strong and spirited as ever, Mr.Lyons," Alec said to Barrie with a broad smile.


Barrie chuckled in good humor. "That's kind of you,but I'm getting on in years-I can't go anywhere without this cane."


Fletcher stepped forward, offering his hand. "Mr.Willis, I've heard a great deal about you."


A spark of surprise flashed in Alec's eyes-this was the CEO of the renowned Avalon Group, a man he seldom had the chance to meet. Yet today, Fletcher was greeting him with such warmth.


Alec clasped his hand without hesitation. "I've long wanted to meet you, Mr. Lyons. It's truly a pleasure to at last."



Laura reached for Marietta's hand with familiar warmth, speaking as though they were longtime acquaintances. "So the final scarf from S&F found its way to you, Mrs. Lyons. It suits your delicate skin beautifully. I'm glad it wasn't mine-it would have been wasted on me." This was Marietta's first time meeting Laura, and she thought her manner a touch excessive.


Even so, because Laura was the mother of the doctor who had saved Barrie, Marietta let the familiarity pass without complaint.


With a pleasant smile, she answered, "I actually own another scarf just like this one. If it pleases you, Mrs.Willis, I'll have it sent over."


Laura gave no clear response but shifted the subject toward Slater instead. "Slater really is impressive. It's no wonder the girls in Shoildon admire him so much."


Caught off guard by the mention, Slater cast Laura a conflicted glance. If Dr. Willis ever learned the things he'd said about her, the shame would be unbearable.


He came to a firm conclusion that he needed to apologize before she learned the truth on her own.Lost in thought, Slater gave a half-hearted greeting to Laura and said, "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Willis."


Slater kept stretching his neck, trying to get a glimpse into the house, and Alec caught on right away. With a teasing grin, he said, "Slater, looks like you're pretty eager to catch sight of my daughter,aren't you?"


A faint flush crept over Slater's cheeks as he rubbed the back of his head. "I guess I am a little eager."


Naturally, his nerves were high-after all, he had spoken poorly of Verena more than once, and the weight of guilt pushed him to hurry with an apology.


Watching the young man's flustered behavior, Alec gave a satisfied nod.


Inside, Laura was thrilled, convinced that Slater's blush was proof of affection for Kaia.


He might not hold the same brilliance as the Bennett brothers, yet the Lyons family's influence in Shoildon could not be questioned.


Should Kaia marry Slater, his straightforward personality would ensure he remained completely under her sway.


And with Kaia credited for Barrie's recovery, the Willis family's standing in Shoildon would be unshakable.


Holding back her rising joy, Laura said brightly,"Enough waiting outside, let's head in."


The moment the words left her mouth, Slater bolted straight inside.


Pointing at Slater's back, Barrie murmured,"That boy never knows how to slow down."


Alec, aware of Slater's eagerness to see Kaia,chuckled and said, "He's still young-recklessness suits him."


Inside the house, Slater spotted Kaia seated quietly on the sofa.


Kaia's eyes caught his; she smiled softly and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.


Instead of greeting her, Slater began pacing about,stretching his neck as though hunting for someone.


Puzzled, Kaia's brows furrowed as she asked,"Slater, what are you trying to find?" He shot her a quick look but kept silent, still scanning the room.


His indifference deepened Kaia's frown, a trace of irritation flickering in her gaze.


This time, her voice sharpened as she repeated, "Tell me, what exactly are you searching for?"


Finally stopping, Slater turned to her and asked directly, "Where is your elder sister?"


Verena?


A flicker of disdain crossed Kaia's expression before she smoothed it over.


Sitting upright, she replied with a sharp edge, "She isn't home."


Confusion clouded Slater's face as his brows drew tight. "Not home? What reason would she have to be away?"


Watching his obvious concern at the mention of Verena, Kaia's irritation flared, and she snapped,"She's hardly that important. Why should it matter whether she's here or not?"


Slater's tone sharpened as his voice rose. "Of course it matters. The reason we came here today was to meet your sister. How could you say she isn't important?"


His words echoed across the living room, reaching Barrie, who was just stepping through the doorway.


With two firm taps of his cane, Barrie's stern voice cut through the air. "Slater, lower your voice. Where are your manners?"


Slater cast a frustrated glance at Kaia before leaning close to Barrie and whispering, "Grandpa, Dr. Willis isn't here."



Dr. Willis? Alec and Laura, standing near Barrie,caught the words clearly.


A sharp pang of unease struck Alec the moment he heard it.



Laura, on the other hand, brushed it off and beckoned Kaia to her side. Pulling her daughter close, Laura smiled warmly at Slater. "You really do spoil my Kaia. She's still in medical school, not yet a doctor. But she's bright and skilled, and if your grandfather ever needs medical help,you can count on her."

###Chapter 64 A Misunderstanding




Kaia had basked in praise all her life, yet today's compliment struck her heart like a long-awaited triumph.


It felt sweeter than all the others, a mixture of joy and relief, as though she had finally found a steadfast ally in Barrie. She even wondered if those rich ladies who once looked down on her for her modest background would still dare to sneer.


Her heart fluttered, but on the surface she wore calm composure.


Stepping forward with a gentle smile and a well-mannered tone, Kaia addressed Barrie.


"Indeed, Mr. Lyons. I heard before about your serious leg ailment. Had I known earlier that the herbs and supplements I prepared could help, I would never have waited until your son and daughter-in-law's wedding anniversary to send them. I would have delivered them right away, sparing you so much pain."




Her lips curved gracefully, yet she remained unaware of the strange looks exchanged among the Lyons family at her words.


Barrie's brows drew together, his gaze shadowed with regret.


Like fire erupting from a mountain, Slater burst out."Herbs and supplements? What are you talking about? My grandfather's leg was healed through Dr.Willis' careful treatment, step by step. Stop dressing yourself in borrowed robes! Those so-called herbs and supplements you speak of were passed on to the servants the very night they arrived."


He paused, and then shot Kaia a scornful glance."So you really believed it was you who cured my grandfather's leg?"


The mockery was sharp, and the Willis family's faces turned ashen, drained of color.


The truth was plain: Kaia had not cured Barrie. It was nothing more than a misunderstanding.


The Willis family had clung to the false notion that a few boxes of herbs and supplements could undo decades of suffering. They had mistaken wishful thinking for reality.


Alec looked at Kaia with a heavy expression, the weight of disappointment clear in his eyes.


Kaia herself stood pale and shaken, disbelief flickering across her face.


Her brows trembled as she recalled the sight of Verena at Barrie's residence that evening.


Could it be that Verena was the very Dr. Willis they now spoke of? The healer who had restored Barrie?


Kaia's heart resisted the thought. To her, Verena had only learned a few skills from a self-taught practitioner in the backwater place.


Yet reality pressed in-uncomfortable, undeniable.They shared the same surname, and Verena had indeed been at the Lyons home that evening. The thought made Kaia's chest tighten; her hands clenched so hard that her nails cut into her palms.


If Verena truly was the one who healed Barrie,Kaia resolved to bury it deep.


Even if she had to swallow her pride and shoulder the blame herself, she would never allow the Lyons family to find out Verena was the Dr. Willis they spoke of.That, she decided, was a price worth paying.


Biting down hard on the inside of her cheek, Kaia forced herself to bow before Barrie.


Her voice trembled wvith contrition. "Mr. Lyons, I truly apologize. After I sent the gifts, I saw Slater's post online and mistakenly believed I had been the one to cure your leg. It was my mistake, and I am deeply sorry."


From their exchange, Barrie pieced together the truth.




Though disappointment touched him, his good manners kept his face composed. He gave Kaia a measured glance but withheld any reply. Instead, he sighed softly and turned to Alec."Mr. Willis, since Dr. Willis isn't here, let's not trouble you further."


Then, signaling to Fletcher and the others, he added,"Let's head home."


Embarrassment weighed heavily on Alec, but he still had one matter he dared not leave unspoken.


With a forced smile, he followed and said, "Mr. Lyons,about the club..."


Barrie, without turning, raised his hand in dismissal."Mr. Willis, not today. There's no need to see us out."






The ride home was cloaked in silence.


Slater leaned his arm against the window, his brows drawn as he wrestled with his thoughts about Dr.Willis' whereabouts. He hadn't seen her since she completed the final treatment for his grandfather.


He had hoped to thank her face-to-face, but today's visit had been fruitless. Her phone was disconnected, the number invalid.


Oddly enough, he felt a trace of relief that the Willis family had mistaken Kaia for the healer. At least that proved Dr. Willis wasn't one of them-just a woman who happened to share the surname.


And since Bobby's influence had long soured his opinion of the Willis family, Slater found comfort in that fact.


Fortunately, Dr. Willis had no ties to them at all.
###Chapter 65 Seeing Isaac





Inside the Willis Villa, the family gathered in the living room.


On the couch, Alec, Laura, and Kaia sat in tense silence, shame and irritation plain on their faces.


What had begun as a hopeful plan had collapsed into disaster. The problem of the club remained unsolved,and worse, they had made a fool of themselves in front of the Lyons family.


The more Alec dwelled on it, the harder it became to restrain his temper.


His gaze fixed on Kaia, stripped of the warmth it once carried.


"Do you see what mess you've caused? You rushed in without knowing the truth and snatched the credit for yourself. A little praise has gone to your head, and now you believe you're brilliant, don't you? Did you really think a handful of herbs and supplements would heal Barrie's leg? How unfortunate that I have such a stupid daughter."


Running a hand through his hair, Alec let out a sharp breath before saying firmly, "This won't work. We must bring Verena back at once-she's the only one who can fix this. Laura, tomorrow you'll apologize to her properly and make peace with her."


Laura's face darkened at his demand. The memory of her last humiliating apology was still raw, and she had no desire to suffer through it again.


Unable to stomach Kaia's humiliation, Laura snapped back, her voice laced with sarcasm. "You never fail to strike when the timing hurts most, Alec. What kind of father tears down his own daughter like this? You were the one praising Kaia's wit before, and now you turn against her. None of us could have foreseen this outcome. She only wanted to help you,even if she was reckless about it. You claim she isn't clever-are you saying Verena is any better? They're both your children, so if blame is handed out, it should fall on both. At least Kaia doesn't drag trouble into this house." 
Laura let out a bitter laugh and added sharply, "And donn't forget the reason the entertainment venue was closed in the first place. That's on Verena, the one who grew up in the rural backwater under your mother's care."



The moment Verena's name was spoken, Alec froze as a sudden idea surfaced.


He realized then why Barrie had confused Kaia with the doctor who treated his leg-the physician carried the same last name, Willis.


Back in the countryside, Verena had actually practiced medicine.


A startling possibility formed in Alec's mind.


For a few moments, Alec said nothing, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. Finally, he turned to Laura and asked, "Could it be that the doctor Barrie spoke of was Verena?"



The question caught Laura off guard, and her expression  faltered with shock. After a pause, she murmured, "That would be too much of a coincidence, wouldn't it? Are you saying Verena might have that kind of ability?"


The couple looked at each other, uncertainty weighing heavily in their eyes, while Kaia sat frozen,staring at them without blinking.


Kaia couldn't shake the sting of Alec's harsh words as they echoed again in her head.


She balled her fists,and the bitterness in her eyes revealed just how deeply her resentment ran.


As Alec and Laura spoke, a sobering truth dawned on her.


She understood then that her ambitions would only come to life if she carved her own path.


In Laura's eyes, her worth lay only in how much honor she could bring to the Willis name.


No matter the gentle tone or the outward kindness,when it truly mattered, Laura always placed Luka above Kaia.



She k<new the family fortune was destined to end up under Luka's control.


Alec measured his children by usefulness alone,giving approval only to the one who could profit him most.



When she pictured Verena marrying into the Bennett family, jealousy burned hot inside her chest.


It was for that reason she couldn't stomach the idea of Verena living happily.


What she feared most was being branded the most worthless member of the family.


Her cheeks quivered as she forced a smile, and then she turned to Alec and Laura. "Dad, Mom,really?Verena never even made it into college. Everything she knows comes from tagging along with some backwoods healer in the countryside. Even top specialists failed with Mr. Lyons' leg. If I couldn't treat him, then Verena definitely couldn't either."


Laura, who had wavered a moment ago, quickly found comfort in Kaia's reasoning. "Kaia's right.Verena doesn't have that kind of talent. She never studied in college, and she's never even touched proper medical training. At best, she knows how to treat a cold. The name Willis is too common; it could be anyone else. You're just clutching at straws, Alec."


She shot him a sharp glance, her tone cutting.


Nothing seemed more ridiculous than thinking Verena was the doctor responsible for Barrie's recovery. Her bragging about being a Pine Hill University graduate was just as laughable.







Once he got home, Slater immediately picked up the phone, eager to unload the day's fiasco on Bobby.


"You won't believe what a ridiculous thing happened today, Bobby. Can you even guess?"


His voice rose with energy. "We went to meet Dr.Willis. But when I got there, I realized it was Kaia's family. For a moment, I thought, wait-could this Dr.Willis actually be that Verena Willis I've never met?And then you won't believe what followed." At the sound of Verena's name, Bobby leaned in,eager. "So what happened?"


With a chuckle, Slater shook his head. "Verena wasn't there, but Kaia was. The funniest part? She actually convinced herself she cured my grandfather's leg. As if! Dr. Willis has nothing to do with their family, let alone being Verena. They thought Kaia was the doctor. Can you believe that?It's laughable."


Kaia's name didn't hold Bobby's attention, so he brushed right past it.


He smirked at Slater. "You can't be serious. How could anyone even compare my perfect sister-in-law with that sharp-tongued Verena? Come on, they're nothing alike. No way Dr. Willis is her."


At that very moment, Verena-the one they were talking about-sat at the desk in her hotel room.


Piles of paperwork lay before her, most of it business carried over from abroad.

 
When the last page was in order, she rolled her neck, flexed her wrists, and glanced at the time on her phone.


It struck her then that lsaac hadn't reached out since their last conversation, and each time she tried calling, his assistant had picked up instead.


Their most recent talk about his health still lingered in her mind; his tone had been heavy, as if weighed down by feelings he couldn't voice.


She wondered if he had slipped back into overthinking everything.


The decision came quickly-she had to go see him in person.


Acting on impulse, Verena swapped into fresh clothes, took her keycard, and headed down to the hotel's underground garage.


Waiting for her in the dim lot was her newly bought silver-gray car.


She slid behind the wheel and drove straight toward the Bennett Mansion. 
When she arrived at the mansion, she parked stepped out, and walked up to the front gates.


Andres Cruz, the Bennett butler, appeared from inside and asked with courtesy, "Miss, may I ask who you're here to visit?"


She greeted him with a calm smile. "My name is Verena Willis. I've come to see lsaac."



The mention of her name made Andres pause, his eyes narrowing as he studied her carefully.


What he saw was a young woman whose gaze carried warmth and quiet composure.


The poise in her manner, coupled with her quiet elegance, clashed sharply with the cold and selfish reputation the rumors had spread.


Years of experience told Andres right away that such rumors about her were nothing more than empty talk.
###Chapter 66 Committed Myself To You





Andres smiled at Verena. "Please allow me to go in and announce your arrival, Miss Willis."


Verena gave a slight nod. "I appreciate your help."


Andres turned, entered the house, and went upstairs,halting before lsaac's door.


He knocked twice-silence answered.


He knocked again, yet the room remained still.


Just as he raised his hand to try once more, a voice,cold as steel in winter, cut through the silence. "Who is it?"



The words were few, but the chill in them pierced like ice.


Andres instantly sensed Isaac's fou mood.


With due respect, Andres answered, "Mr. Bennett,Miss Verena Willis is here to see you. She's at the gates. Shall I invite her in?"


Verena?



She was at the gates?


Isaac's head, which had been bowed low, suddenly lifted, his gaze locking on the closed door before him.


He had spent the whole day in that room, doing nothing but staring at his crippled state.


When Verena's name was mentioned, his heart thundered, and then clenched painfully as if gripped by an unseen fist.


At that moment, he understood his feelings with painful clarity.


He liked Verena-and he knew she felt something for him,too.


Yet he also knew that no emotion ever sprang up without roots.



He admired her character, treasured the way shetreated him differently from how others did to him.


He liked her gentle, intelligent manner, the kind that drew admiration wherever she went.



But what about him? What reason could she possibly have to love him?


He was a man bound to the wheelchair,shackled by personal challenges. What could she see in him besides his name and background?


It wasn't that lsaac lacked self-respect; it was that her sudden affection felt too abrupt, too fragile.


If his legs could ever be healed, he would not mind her initial intentions.


But that hope was a distant star-barely within sight.


What right did he have to expect Verena to stay with him for a lifetime?


The weight on his chest felt like a millstone,suffocating him with every breath.


He lowered his head again, eyes shimmering faintly,  his throat swollen with unshed words, each one painful to release. "Tell her I'm already asleep."


Andres caught the strange note in lsaac's voice.Though he longed to persuade him, experience told him not to meddle.


So he simply nodded. "Got it, Mr. Bennett. I'll inform Miss Willis right away."


As Andres' footsteps retreated, Isaac closed his eyes, battling the storm of bitterness within.


His hands, resting on his useless legs, slowly curled into fists.



They trembled under the strain, veins rising against the skin.



After a long struggle, he resisted the burning urge to call Andres back and let Verena in.


Before Andres could head downstairs with the message, Bobby appeared and blocked his way.


Andres turned, puzzled. "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?" Moments earlier, Bobby had been on the phone with Slater. Heading for water, he had spotted Andres outside his brother's door.


He had approached, overheard their exchange, and quickly muttered to Slater, "Something urgent has come up-we'll talk later."


He had cut the line without waiting for an answer.


Stopping Andres, Bobby threw a glance at lsaac's firmly closed door before asking quietly, "Is Verena outside?"



Although uncertain why Bobby brought her up,Andres nodded honestly. "Yes, she is."


Bobby broke into a sly grin. So Isaac had finally seen Verena's true colors.



"My brother's clearly awake, yet he tells you to say he's asleep. Do you know what that means? It means he's tired of her and doesn't wish to see her. Unless absolutely necessary, he won't even give her the time of day. That's why he made up an excuse to avoid her." Wearing mock regret, Bobby leaned closer and whispered, "Just go to the gates and tell V/erena straight out that my brother doesn't want to see her,and she should leave."



Andres frowned. Something about Bobby's reasoning felt wrong.


He hesitated. "Mr. Bennett, isn't that a little improper?"


"What's improper about it?" Bobby clicked his tongue. "Andres, you're old enough to know when to adapt."


Seeing Andres still uneasy, Bobby thumped his chest confidently. "Just do as I say. If anything comes of it,I'll take responsibility."


Andres finally yielded. "Alright. I'll follow your instructions, Mr. Bennett."


As Andres walked downstairs, Bobby whistled lightly and strolled back into his room.


Outside, Andres bowed slightly and, as Bobby had ordered, told Verena, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis. Mr.Bennett said he doesn't want to see you. Please leave."



Verena's eyes narrowed. She didn't believe Isaac had uttered those words.


Then again... perhaps he had. Isaac was not one to speak harshly, but in a moment of despair, he might say those words to turn her away.


She remembered the hoarseness in his voice that day on the phone, and a sharp sting pricked her nose.


Blinking, she steadied herself and looked at Andres."Forgive me, but I must intrude."


She slipped past him and dashed into the house.


As she passed, Andres heard her murmur, "I want to hear lsaac say it himself."


Still stunned, Andres watched her pause midway and ask, "By the way, which room is Isaac's?"


Faced with her resolve, he recalled Isaac's strained tone and pointed upstairs. "The room at the far left on the second floor."



Verena smiled gratefully. "Thank you."


She hurried upstairs and found the room.


Knocking firmly, she called, "Isaac, open the door!"


Inside, Isaac's spine went rigid, but he made no move, thinking his ears deceived him.



"I'm Verena, Isaac. Open the door." Her voice was muffled by the heavy wood, but it carried through.


Slowly, Isaac lifted his head, eyes fixed on the sliver of light beneath the door, as if confirming reality.


His room was dark, and the faint glow outside cast a small shadow.


Verena was truly there.


She was at his door.


Isaac dropped his gaze again and said nothing.


Verena, realizing his deliberate stillness, spoke firmly. "lsaac, have you forgotten everything we talked about? Just because you face difficulties, you retreat? You think by shutting me out, I'll simply give up?"


Isaac's eyes stayed locked on the faint shadow beneath the door. He longed to tell her to leave,yet his throat closed with emotion.


Before her, he could not summon a single harsh word.




Verena stood before the sealed door, her gaze steady, her tone unwavering.


"Listen to me, Isaac. I've already committed myself to you. If you won't open this door, then I'll wait right here.I can outlast you, no matter how long it takes."
###Chapter 67 Do You Truly Have The Heart To Wound Me





Committed herself to him...


When lsaac heard those words, his heart tightened suddenly, a sharp pang cutting through his chest as though something inside was being torn apart.


He remembered Verena once telling him, "You're the only one I choose."


Wherever, whenever-she had always given him a clear, unwavering answer, with the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.


Verena was braver than him, carrying a courage he could only admire from a distance.


Isaac's fingers curled slightly, his Adam's apple rising and falling as he swallowed the bitterness that pressed at his heart.


With a faint push, he rolled his wheelchair forward.  Verena caught the sound of wheels moving and knew at once that Isaac was coming to open the door.



She let out a small sigh of relief.


Click!



The door swung open from within.



"Isaac,you-"


"You should leave now." Isaac cut her words short before they could fully form.



Frowning, Verena lowered her gaze to him.


There he sat, in his wheelchair, hands gripping the wheels, head bowed, his back slightly hunched.


Loneliness and desolation clung to him like a shadow.



Staring at his lowered head, Verena spoke with quiet firmness. "If you've got something to say, then look me in the eye when you say it."



Isaac's hands tightened on his lifeless legs. With visible effort, he raised his heavy eyelids. The door stood open, letting the light from the hallway spill in, faintly brightening the darkened room.


At the doorway, Verena stood outlined in that light,her hair shimmering as strands caught a golden glow.


She looked radiant, like the sun breaking through on a winter morning-so dazzling that lsaac longed to draw near and hold on.


His Adam's apple moved again. Forcing calm into his tone, he spoke softly. "Yes, I am retreating. As you said, my condition has made me timid. But the reason I chose to let you go... is because I've come to realize many things."


Verena pressed on, her voice steady, "And what things are those?"


Meeting her gaze, Isaac deliberately said in a distant tone, "You know I'm crippled, unable to father a child. Yet you still insist on marrying me, on loving me. Isn't it because of my family background and power?" With those words, he lost the courage to keep looking at her. He deliberately turned his wheelchair away.


He expected her anger-expected her to flare up, to lash out at such a cruel accusation. But silence followed instead.



Isaac wondered, was she too furious to even speak?


Of course. What girl wouldn't be offended when accused of such motives?


His jaw tightened, a suffocating ache spreading in his chest, as though the very air threatened to choke him.


In truth, he wanted to tell her he loved her, regardless of her intentions.


But deep down, he felt he did not deserve her.


Hearing his words, Verena chuckled lightly, her understanding of him sharp enough to pierce straight through his disguise.


She could tell in an instant when his words were  deliberate, not genuine.


Smiling faintly, she said, "You're saying all this just to provoke me, hoping I'll walk away without looking back, and never reach out to you again, isn't that right?"


Isaac froze, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.After all those words, wasn't she supposed to be furious?



Why...was she smiling instead?


She stepped closer with light movements, stopping behind him.



Then she wrapped her arms around his neck,bending down to embrace him.


"Your words cut deep, Isaac. But tell me-are you really willing to let it end like this?"


Her lips nearly brushed his ear, her voice low, tender,yet deliberately stirring. "Do you truly have the heart to wound me, to drive me away, let me belong to someone else-hold another man, kiss him, and be with him as I am with you?"


Her hand glided to his face, fingertips grazing his skin before lingering on his burning earlobe.


Her voice was gentle, yet her words carried the sting of a blade wrapped in silk, slicing him little by little.


Isaac's breath hitched. Each word weighed on him like chains.


Did he have the heart to do such a thing?


No...he did not.



Even the thought alone was enough to drive him to madness.



Verena tilted her head, watching his jaw tremble, his eyes rimmed in red.


Through his lashes, his dark eyes shone with wetness-like he had been holding back tears.


Her heart trembled at the sight, and she tightened her hold on him, her voice now soothing as a lullaby."Then let go of these needless fears, Isaac.Please?"  Her lingering voice brushed against his ear, sending warmth coursing into his once-cold limbs.


Being held so tightly from behind-this was a feeling he had never known before.


And though a trace of the night chill still clung to Verena,Isaac felt warmer than ever.


It was as if his restless heart, long wandering,had finally found a harbor where it could rest. 
###Chapter 68 Shackles





Isaac longed to nod and agree with Verena, to promise her that he would try to let go of his fears.


Yet deep down, he knew such a promise was a lie he could never keep.



His worries were not idle fancies-they were storms that lived within him.



His life had veered off course in that single heartbeat of the car accident.


Even now, he could still see it clearly: his father lying in a pool of blood, that dreadful sight engraved in his mind like a scar carved in stone.



His father had shielded him, and before darkness swallowed him, lsaac heard the frantic cries of strangers.



"This young man's legs are bleeding heavily!" "If the ambulance doesn't come soon, he'll lose both legs!"


"Forget the legs-if he survives, it will be a miracle."


"How pitiful!"


The voices grew faint as lsaac sank into unconsciousness.


When his eyes opened again, an entire month had slipped away.


He woke beneath a stark white ceiling, the pungent sting of disinfectant filling his lungs, his dizzy head throbbing in protest.


His lips were parched, the corner of his mouth cracked and raw. He moistened them with his tongue, intending to rise from bed for a sip of water.


But as he threw aside the covers, a chilling realization struck-his legs refused to obey.


Frowning, he pushed himself up with his arms,summoning every ounce of upper body strength to move. The bandages around his head were blotched with blood, and sweat trickled down his jawline as his trembling arms bore the strain.


Still, his legs lay motionless, as though they had been erased from his body.


At that moment, Isaac sensed the cruel truth, though his heart refused to accept it.


Clutching the edge of the bed, he tried to roll off. But after lying still for a month, his body was too frail.He collapsed to the floor, knocking over the glass of water on the nightstand.


The glass shattered, and his palms pressed into the shards. Crimson spread across the pale floor in an instant.



The sight tore open an old wound-his father's bloodied face on that fateful day.


Isaac choked back a sob, not from the sting in his hands, but from the lifeless weight of his legs.


His face drained of color, sweat soaking his hospital gown.


The most terrifying part was this: all his strength had been spent simply getting out of bed, and now he could not move at all.


Blood streamed from his palms, yet his lower body lay unresponsive, a dead weight.


For the first time in his life, Isaac tasted the bitter truth of helplessness.


"Mr. Bennett!" The door flew open, and a young man in a caregiver's uniform froze in shock.


He quickly set down the basin of water he carried and rushed to lsaac's side.


Danica had hired him as Isaac's private caregiver. He had only stepped out for a moment, never imagining disaster would strike in those few minutes.


He pressed the call button and struggled to lift Isaac back onto the bed.


Moments later, a doctor strode in, followed by two nurses. "Mr.Bennett, you're finally awake," the doctor said with a relieved smile.


The nurses worked quietly, tending to his wounds and wrapping his hands in bandages.


Isaac leaned against the headboard, jaw clenched.


He closed his eyes halfway and asked in a hoarse voice, "Doctor, how long until my legs recover?"


"Well..." The doctor hesitated, regret darkening his face. At last, he sighed. "At present, it's unlikely they will recover."


Isaac's chest heaved, emotions surging like a storm.His eyes snapped open. "What did you say?"


The doctor lowered his head, his compassion plain.


Isaac stared blankly, unable to move, unable to breathe. At last he muttered, "I want surgery. Do the surgery...please, do it."


"Mr.Bennett, the surgery was performed a month ago. Your legs are in the best state they can be." "I want surgery! Do the surgery again!"


Deaf to reason, Isaac flung back the covers,attempting to rise.


"Hold him down! Quickly!" the doctor barked.


The two nurses and the caregiver pinned Isaac back to the bed.



"Isaac!" Danica burst into the room, breathless from rushing over. Seeing her son restrained, she turned to the doctor in alarm. "Dr. Loftus, what's happening?"


Alick Loftus pursed his lips, answering gravely, "Mr.Bennett has just woken up. He cannot accept his condition and is emotionally unstable. Please, Mrs.Bennett, talk to him."


Danica nodded, her voice soft but firm. "I understand. Thank you."


With her consent, the doctor signaled the others,and they quietly left the room.


Now only mother and son remained. "Isaac, you're finally awake."


Danica stepped forward, stroking his hollowed cheeks. Her nose reddened, tears brimming.


Isaac turned his bloodshot eyes toward her, his voice broken."Mom...I want surgery."


He was pleading like a child. Danica's heart twisted,but she forced herself to speak the truth. "Isaac, the doctors operated the day of your accident. But the nerves in your legs were too severely damaged...This is already the best they can be."


"No. My legs will recover. I want surgery. I want surgery." His words spilled out like a chant, as though repeating them could rewrite fate.


"Isaac, calm down first."


"My legs will get better. My legs will get better." He tried to get up again, his body trembling, his voice unrelenting. Danica reached to hold him back, but he pushed against her.


"My legs will get better. My legs will..." Smack! The sharp crack of a slap rang through the air.





Danica drew in a deep breath, raising her voice to break through his delusion.


"They will not recover. Dr. Loftus is the most trusted doctor in this field. The fact that your legs weren't amputated is already a blessing. You'll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair."


Boom! Isaac's mind went blank, his heart collapsing into silence.



In that instant, he tasted despair as bitter as gall.


"And what about Dad?" The question slipped from his lips-the question he had feared since waking.


Danica's face faltered, grief and resentment flickering in her eyes.


At once, Isaac understood.


He sank back onto the bed, his gaze empty, staring at the ceiling as though carved from stone. 
The room fell still, silence weighing heavier than words.





Danica's heart trembled at the hollow look in his eyes. Panic clawed at her-had her words broken him completely?


Regret surged through her chest. She softened her tone, whispering, "Isaac, if the doctors here can't help, we'll seek treatment abroad. There may still be hope."


Isaac shut his eyes, retreating from memories too heavy to bear.


For six long months, the greatest doctors had failed him.



Each time, he clung to the hope of a miracle, only to have it shatter in his hands.



He dreaded the thought of Verena in aother man's arms, yet he lacked the courage to gamble on chance.



She had told him she was seventy percent certain of success.


But what of the other thirty percent-failure, ruin,despair?




She had healed two others with similar impotence,yet unlike them, lsaac's body betrayed no sign of progress.


Those twin burdens-his crippled legs and impotence-clung to him like shackles, binding him to despair.
###Chapter 69 Familiar Profile





Isaac felt crushed under the tangle of emotions inside him, the pressure on his chest stealing the air from his lungs.


His hand lifted slowly, fingers curling around Verena's wrist as he spoke in a low voice."Verena,I need time. My life isn't like other men's. I'm crippled,and worse, I can't even give you what a husband should. I don't know what my future holds. If I never recover, asking you to stay with me would be selfish."


He understood it wasn't only unfair-it was dangerous. The deeper their bond grew, the harder it would be for him to walk away later compared to now.


Verena caught on to his meaning at once. Memories of her work in the operating room filled her mind-every surgery began with patients or their families signing consent forms, documents filled with warnings of potential risks.Even when the procedure was simple, people would dismiss it lightly, insisting it was only routine, that nothing would go wrong.Yet deep down, no one was ever truly calm. Faced with the list of dangers,families always imagined the worst. Nobody wanted to be the unlucky one, the tragic exception.


No one else could ever feel the same dread or grief for the patients and their families. To outsiders,surgery appeared ordinary. A person went in, came out in one piece, and life moved along as if nothing had happened. But until it was their turn, no one really knew what that fear felt like.


And Isaac's situation wasn't routine at all-every specialist had told him he couldn't be cured.Expecting him to believe in her felt like asking too much,especially since even she wasn't fully certain.


A sigh slipped from her lips as she sank to her knees beside him, her eyes locked on his with quiet determination. "Isaac, I'll wait. But I need you to let me try. I'll give everything I have to treat you. Until the day I admit defeat, don't speak of leaving me.Those words cut too deeply." Her fingers tightened tenderly around his hand. In a hushed tone, she asked, "Do you honestly want to see me hurt like that?"


When Isaac lowered his gaze, he met her clear,unwavering eyes-gentle yet unyielding in their stubborn resolve.



It struck him then that he was powerless against her;the smallest glimpse of vulnerability from Verena shattered all his resistance.


His mouth opened as if to speak, but no words came,leaving him in silence.







Instead of heading back to her hotel after leaving the Bennett Mansion, Verena steered herself toward a bar.


Sliding onto a stool at the counter, she ordered herself a drink.



The liquor scorched her throat, yet her thoughts lingered only on lsaac's wordless face, the memory pressing on her like a stone.


Shoildon's most popular bar surrounded her,boasting the best sound equipment and state-of-the-art lights.


Thunderous metal beats rattled the walls as streaks of dim neon washed over the crowd.


On the pulsing dance floor, beautiful men and women moved with wild energy, fueling the electric atmosphere.


Weighed down by family troubles, Kaia chose to blow off steam by going out with her friends.


Once she'd danced with a string of men and worked up a sweat, she waved her friends off and sank into a seat with a drink in hand.


While tipping her glass back, her eyes drifted toward the counter across the room.


Her eyes narrowed as she spotted a familiar figure-Verena.



Was she alone? A sly smile curved Kaia's lips. With Verena here, she had the perfect outlet for the grudges from home.


Clutching her drink, Kaia started toward the counter with deliberate steps.


Halfway across, she caught sight of a man slipping onto the stool next to Verena.



Kaia halted, folding her arms with a smirk, eager to see what scene would play out.


Perched on her high stool, Verena drained the rest of her glass in a single gulp, coughing as the burn clawed at her throat.



"So it is you, Verena." A warm, clear voice sounded from the seat next to her.



When she turned her head, she found Gavin, sharp-featured and smiling faintly, seated beside her. She frowned. "Gavin, you came here too?"


Gavin poured more liquor into her glass and teased lightly, "What's wrong? Only you get the right to drink your troubles away?" At his words, Verena let out a small laugh. "Then tell me, what are your troubles?"


Instead of answering, Gavin angled his face away,frustration written across his expression, refusing to speak.


Watching him clam up, Verena had little trouble figuring it out. Gavin had wealth, success, and family behind him, so what else could drag him to a bar but heartbreak?


Remembering the reason for his return, Verena ventured a guess. "She hasn't answered you, has she?"


Gavin hesitated, and then gave a short, dismissive scoff. "Close enough."


Shifting the focus, he asked, "What about you?Who's got you drinking tonight?"


Her turn came, and the question caught her off guard. Staring into her glass, she admitted quietly, "I went to see lsaac today. He told me he wants to end things. Gavin's brow furrowed. "He used to dream about marrying you, didn't he? Why would he suddenly back out? And aren't you two already planning your wedding?"


She took a slow sip, a bitter smile tugging at her lips."He doesn't remember me. He remembers everything else-but not me."


One eyebrow lifted in shock. "Why not just tell him the truth about what you two had?"


She shook her head, a sigh slipping out. "That would only make things worse. I met him in Clokron, and his family knows nothing about me. A few of his friends do,but they've kept quiet out of worry for his health.His mind must have buried me on purpose, shutting me out as a way to shield himself. It's his illness pushing me away."


Deep down, she sensed that Isaac still cared, but not with the same strength as before. He had chosen to erase their memories because facing her after learning the truth of his condition was unbearable.His heart couldn't let go of her, but his mind had made the choice for him.


For that reason, Verena had never rushed to tell him everything. Besides, love couldn't be forced. If he learned their shared past from her mouth, it would feel like listening to someone else's story. The story only mattered if he recalled it on his own.


Her narrow shoulders sagged as she tipped her glass back and drained it.


By the time their talk dragged on, she'd lost track of how many glasses she'd had. The liquor only magnified the sorrow she'd been holding back, until she slumped forward on the counter, her eyes dazed and unfocused.


Seeing her unravel like this for the first time, Gavin reached over and patted her back, bending close so his voice could rise above the blaring music. "Don't worry. He loves you too deeply for it to disappear.Memories have a way of returning."


From across the room, Kaia's eyes went wide. She fumbled for her phone and quickly snapped photos of Verena with Gavin. At last, she thought smugly, that shameless Verena had given her something to use against her.


With a curl of contempt on her lips, Kaia snapped three shots, each framed to make the moment look far too intimate.



Just as she was about to hunt down lsaac's number and forward the pictures, she froze, recalling how fiercely he had once stood up for Verena. To Kaia,he was nothing more than a besotted fool.


After weighing her options, she chose Bobby as the better target and attached a sly message. "Curious about what Verena's been up to?"


Bobby already carried resentment toward Verena,and if he saw her leaning close to another man in a bar...


The idea lit a sly spark in Kaia's eyes. Even if Verena clawed her way into the Bennett family, her days there would be anything but smooth.


Satisfied with herself, Kaia slipped back into her seat,lifted her drink, and settled in to watch the storm she 
had set in motion.


Just as Bobby stepped out of the shower at the Bennett Mansion, three photos from Kaia popped up on his phone.


One glance left him frozen in surprise.


Bathed in neon light, the pictures revealed a man and woman seated at the counter with their backs to the camera. The man's features were hidden, but the woman leaned forward, her profile faintly visible.


Bobby's brows drew together. Could that really be...Verena?


His gaze locked on the curve of her back and the glimpse of her profile, a jolt of recognition striking him hard. He had seen her before-it was almost like looking at Dr.Willis.
###Chapter 70 Something Extraordinary





Good heavens! Could it truly be Dr. Willis?


The thought struck Bobby like a bolt out of the blue,leaving him utterly dumbfounded.


He enlarged the photo again and again, scrutinizing every detail with disbelief. Though the picture was taken from behind, he was convinced that the woman Kaia mentioned-Verena-was none other than Dr.Willis.



There was no point wasting time guessing.He would uncover the truth once he went to the bar.


Without wasting a moment, Bobby called Kaia, his excitement barely held in check.


On the table, Kaia's phone lit up. When she noticed his name on the screen, the corners of her lips curled into a satisfied smile.


She answered leisurely, pressing the phone to her ear, her voice sweet and composed."Hello?"


Before she could say anything further, Bobby's anxious tone rushed in. "Kaia, which bar is she at?Send me the address this instant."



Kaia complied without hesitation, forwarding the location to him. "Done. Check the message."


Bobby gave the address a quick glance, hurriedly changed clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed downstairs. His voice was edged with urgency as he gave instructions. "You're still at the bar, right? Do whatever it takes to keep Verena there. Don't let her slip away. I'm on my way."


The tremor in his voice revealed how unsettled he truly was.


Kaia, however, felt a surge of satisfaction.


Clearly, Bobby was desperate to catch Verena in the act.


If Bobby confronted her, Verena's proud and unyielding nature would ensure an inevitable quarrel. And should someone "accidentally" record the spectacle in that bustling bar, word would spread like wildfire. Alec and Laura would not only be crushed by Verena's disgraceful behavior but also feel deeply humiliated.


In that moment, Kaia would shine as the only daughter worth relying upon.


As for the Bennett family, no matter how much lsaac might shield Verena, if both Danica and Bobby turned against her, then-even if shemanaged to marry into the Bennett household-her life would be nothing but walking on thorns.


In every sense, it was a plan that killed two birds with one stone.


Her eyes glittered with a triumphant gleam,her smirk impossible to conceal.


She added softly to Bobby, "Of course. I'm not just helping you. She's still my sister, and I don't wish to watch her stumble down such a foolish path."


Bobby dismissed her pretentious words without comment and hung up, tossing his keys to the driver."Aurora Bar. Quickly!"


The driver caught the keys and bowed his head respectfully. "Yes, Mr. Bennett."


Moments later, they were on the road, the car speeding through the night.


Bobby's abrupt hang-up did not bother Kaia in the slightest. She was already savoring the image of Verena's downfall, and the mere thought was intoxicating.


Meanwhile, in the back seat of the car, Bobby kept staring at the photos Kaia had sent, each passing glance strengthening his conviction-Verena was Dr.Willis.



Nervous sweat dampened his palms.


Unable to contain his emotions, he dialed Slater.


After a few rings, the call connected.


An irritated voice greeted him. "Really, Bobby? Do you ever check the time before calling?" Anyone woken from a dream would sound irritable.


Yet Bobby paid no attention to Slater's annoyance,blurting out his excitement. "Listen, Slater! You won't believe this. I've stumbled on something extraordinary. Verena might actually be Dr. Willis!"


At first, Slater thought Bobby was merely ranting and was ready to snap back, but the next words left him stunned.



"What nonsense are you spouting at this hour? Are you sure you're alright?" Slater chuckled in disbelief."I was at the Willis residence just days ago and eliminated that possibility with my own eyes. And now you expect me to believe Verena is Dr. Willis?What is this, some kind of early/ April Fool's prank?"


Bobby, anticipating his skepticism, swiftly forwarded the three photos.


"I'm not joking. I'm on my way to the bar right now.These were just taken. Look carefully at the woman-this is no mere coincidence."



Slater opened one of the pictures absentmindedly- aordinary and froze.


For a long moment, silence reigned, until Bobby,thinking the call had dropped, called his name.Suddenly, a startled curse burst from Slater's lips.


"Good heavens! That silhouette, that profile-it does resemble Dr. Willis." Slater zoomed in repeatedly,nearly convinced it was her.


After all, someone with Dr. Willis' elegance and striking figure was far too rare for mere chance.


Bobby arched a brow. "See? I told you l wasn't spinning tales."


Slater leapt out of bed. "Where are you now? Wait for me-I'm coming to0."


Bobby glanced out the window. "I'm just passing your street. I'll pick you up."


Slater hurriedly threw on some clothes. "Fine. I'll be waiting downstairs."


When the call ended, Bobby clutched his phone tightly, his chest swelling with a storm of emotions. If Verena truly was Dr. Willis,then all this time he had been speaking ill of her... Oh no!


Inside the bar, Kaia brushed off the advances of a few men and declined her friends' invitation to dance.


She remained seated, her gaze locked on the two figures by the counter, as if afraid they might vanish should she glance away.


As she sipped her drink, her eyes lingered on Verena with a mocking glint.


Across the room, Verena still leaned against the counter, unresponsive, while Gavin wore a troubled look. It was clear that none of his comforting words had reached her.


He scratched his head and finally offered, "Verena,believe me. With the way lsaac feels about you,he can't possibly cast you aside for good. You just need to raise the stakes, and he'll surely return to you."


Verena, drunk and weary, lifted her heavy head, her voice raspy. "Raise the stakes? I can't bring myself to pressure him. And I've already raised them enough by claiming I would be with other men if he let go,yet he still forced himself to ask me to leave."


Gavin clicked his tongue and leaned closer, lowering his voice. "You still don't understand. Men may act tough, but when it truly matters, they discover their limits. Words alone won't break him-you need action. Give me your phone, I'll help you."


Before Verena could object, Gavin had already taken her phone, unlocking it with her fingerprint. He opened the camera, leaned in close, and with a sharp click, captured a picture of himself beside her-her face and his half-body illuminated by the colorful lights of the bar.


The photo radiated an intimacy that words alone could not conjure.


Verena snatched her phone back, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. "What do you think you're doing?"


"Helping you raise the stakes, of course," Gavin replied, his tone brimming with strategy. "Here's what you'll send: type 'I'm drunk. Are you certain youdon't want to come pick me up?'-and attach this photo."
 
 ###Chapter 71 It's Working





Verena's thoughts were a little clouded, though she hadn't entirely lost her clarity.


She understood full well what Gavin's words implied.After lingering on the photo for a moment, she opened the chat app and began typing a message to Isaac.


As her fingers flew across the screen, Gavin leaned closer, stealing a glance. He broke into hearty laughter, teasing, "Well, who would've imagined Dr.Willis had such a sly streak?"


He said this because Verena had embroidered the story, making it appear even more dramatic than Gavin's original version.


Verena only smiled faintly in reply to her friend's playful remark.


Then she carefully reread the message she had drafted. "Isaac, your attitude today really wounded me. I'm drunk now. Are you sure you won't come to get me? If you don't, I might just do something reckless."



Content with her words, she pressed send-and attached the photo as well.


Placing the phone face down on the counter,Verena told herself that if lsaac refused to show up, she would indeed act recklessly. She didn't mind barging into the Bennett Mansion again, determined to "torment" him with her presence.


Meanwhile, inside the Bennett Mansion, the door at the far end of the second-floor hallway remained firmly shut. The room lay wrapped in darkness. The bed was untouched, and the curtains were left open,allowing a narrow stream of moonlight to spill onto the floor.


By the window sat lsaac in his wheelchair, staring into the night with a distant gaze, utterly lost in thought.


The window wasn't completely closed, and the cold wind crept through the gaps. Outside, tall trees swayed, their shifting shadows crossing his face, deepening the lonely silhouette he cast.



Isaac hadn't known restful sleep for nights on end.Each time he lay down, memories surged like an endless reel: the sight of his father bleeding after the accident,the weight of his own disability, the torment of his dysfunction, and the thought of Verena-forever beyond his reach. He could only endure the endless nights until dawn, and then bury himself in work to silence the torment.


All at once, the phone on the small table beside him buzzed twice.


At such an hour, he hadn't expected a message from anyone.


His fingers twitched, and Verena's image leapt instantly to his mind.


He picked up the phone, and at the sight of her name,his brows drew together.


Opening her chat, he scanned her words, his eyes narrowing at once.


Below the message was a selfie she had sent.


The neon lights behind her revealed clearly that she was in a bar.


Her cheeks were flushed, her lips tinged with a deep rose, and her bright eyes blurred slightly, carrying the disarming charm of intoxication.


The scene struck him like déjà vu-he had seen her drunk before in that hotel, and he recognized that look. By her side was a man, his face concealed,but his broad shoulders and attire betrayed his gender at once.



The word "reckless" from her message rang in his head, and a sharp ache spread across his temples.His thoughts darted back to that night in the hotel,when she had kissed him while drunk. Would she repeat such recklessness with another man?


The pain in his chest was like a knife's thrust, forcing him to cut short the images before they spiraled further. He realized then how fragile his composure truly was. Just the sight of a man leaning near her in that picture was enough to rouse a storm of jealousy.If his mind ran loose, he knew he could lose all reason.



Isaac's eyes fixed on the photo, his once calm features darkening, his gaze cold and sharp as if he could pierce straight through the figure partly captured in the frame.


Reason told him this was the moment to step back,yet his heart was deaf to such counsel. Fire burned in his chest, and with a bitter smile, he admitted he had once again surrendered to her.


"You promised me time to think. And this... this is your idea of patience," he murmured bitterly.


Consumed by jealousy, he could no longer think straight. His voice broke into a roar. "Andres, prepare the car!"


At once, Andres approached the door, asking respectfully,"Mr.Bennett, where shall I take you?"


Isaac froze briefly, realizing Verena hadn't shared the bar's address.


His throat tightened. With trembling fingers, he hurriedly dialed her number.


Back at the bar, Verena and Gavin were deep in conversation when Gavin motioned to her phone and said with a sly grin, "See? It's working. Amnesia or not, Isaac is still lsaac."


Verena's eyes lit with sudden joy as she picked up the phone and answered.


Before she could utter a word, Isaac's low, strained voice surged through the receiver. "Where are you?"


Just as Verena was about to reveal her location,Gavin leaned in mischievously and spoke in a hushed tone near the speaker. "Hey, beauty, are you alone?"


Verena shot him a sharp look, while Gavin only raised his brows knowingly and spread his hands.


Catching on quickly, Verena pressed her lips together and answered, "Yes, I'm alone."


The playful exchange was the last straw for lsaac. His hand clenched the phone so tightly his knuckles turned pale, his voice taut with urgency. "Verena,where are you? Tell me now."


Before she could respond, Gavin plucked the phone from her hand and switched it off.



"What are you doing?" Verena demanded, frowning.


"This," Gavin explained calmly, setting the phone aside, "is how you force a man's hand. A desperate bid to win you back. We'll make sure he never dares push you away again."


Verena blinked, turning over his words, and realized they weren't without reason.


Back in the mansion, lsaac froze as the line went dead. A sudden rush of panic seized him, and he quickly dialed again.


"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.Please try again later," the mechanical voice repeated.


His jaw tightened, his brow furrowed deeply. He redialed again and again, only to hear the same response.


For the first time in his life, Isaac cursed aloud. The thought of Verena being drunk and exposed to unwelcome advances was unbearable.


In desperation, he dialed Jacob. The assistant answered at once.


Without giving him time to speak, lsaac ordered hurriedly, "Check the photo I just sent you. Find the bar. Quickly."


On the other end, Jacob opened the photo, his memory sparking-he had visited that very bar before.
###Chapter 72 What Are You To Him





The moment the car slowed, Bobby and Slater flung the doors open and sprinted toward the bar.


Bobby went ahead and shoved open the heavy soundproof door. A blast of music crashed into them,while colorful lights flashed across the crowd of customers.



Inside, the lighting was low, yet they spotted Verena right away at the counter across from the entrance.


Verena leaned against the counter in a slump, her face tense with discomfort. The sharp smell of alcohol filled her nose, and her stomach turned uneasily.


She made an effort to sit upright and muttered a few broken words under her breath.



Gavin thought she was talking to him, so he bent closer. "Huh? What's wrong?" he asked. Verena eased off the stool with a faint scowl. "think... I'm gonna be sick," she whispered.


The blaring speakers drowned her words, so Gavin leaned even nearer. "What did you say?"


"I said I'm gonna vomit!" Verena shouted in his ear,gagging as soon as the words left her mouth.


The meaning finally clicked, and Gavin grabbed hold of her arms. "Whoa, easy! Please, don't ruin my clothes!"



From where Bobby and Slater stood, the scene looked different. They saw her slip from the stool,and before she could walk away, a man across from her pulled her into his arms. His back faced the door,his face hidden, his wide shoulders in plain sight.


Exchanging a sharp glance, Bobby and Slater narrowed their eyes and edged closer.


Then Verena lifted her head. When they caught her face clearly, both men froze. It really was Dr. Willis!


Bobby's eyes stretched wide, and he grabbed his head with both hands. He had told himself in the car to be ready, yet standing here in front of her was still too much. Thinking about it had been one thing.Seeing it unfold with his own eyes was something else. He could hardly process that Verena was Dr.Willis, and every cruel word he had hurled at her before now echoed in his mind.


No one could have imagined it. The woman he had despised and tried to push away with all his might was the same one he secretly wished would join his family as his sister-in-law. The thought left him feeling completely ruined.


Heat crept across Bobby's face in raw embarrassment. It was a good thing Dr. Willis didn't know he was Isaac's brother. If she'd known the man she once saved was the same one who'd gone on to treat her so coldly, and that he was her future husband's brother, she wouldn't have hesitated to slap him.


His lips parted on reflex, but not a sound came out.The idea of lsaac  tearing into him was terrifying enough, yet remembering the cruel things he had spat at Verena made him feel like ending himself was not far-fetched.


Beside him, Slater stood frozen in the same shock.The words "holy crap" lit up in his head like a neon sign. His jaw dropped so wide it could have fit an egg, and he gawked at Verena in disbelief. After all the times he had brushed aside the possibility, here it was-the truth. Dr. Willis truly was Alec's daughter.What a pointless chase that had been.


Since her call to Bobby earlier, Kaia kept flicking her eyes toward the bar's entrance, worried she might miss his arrival.


When Bobby entered with Slater at his side, Kaia's lips curled into a smirk. She hadn't expected him to bring company, but the thought pleased her. The more people around, the better the show would be.


Kaia rose to her feet, prepared to greet them, yet froze when she realized they had both come to an abrupt halt.


Tracing Bobby's gaze, Kaia spotted Verena in the arms of the man at the counter. The dim glow madethe scene appear almost intimate, like that of a couple.


A spark of excitement flickered in Kaia's eyes as she took in the sight. The timing couldn't have been better. With Bobby watching it unfold for himself, he had no choice but to believe Verena was disloyal.


Trying to hide the grin tugging at her lips, Kaia rushed to Bobby's side and clung to his arm. "Mr.Bennett,Verena..."


Bobby didn't so much as look at her and brushed her aside with a sharp wave. "Step away, don't get in my line of sight."


Her voice broke off in shock. She pressed her hand to the spot where he had shoved her and asked in disbelief, "Mr. Bennett, why are you..."


His sudden wide-eyed stare toward the counter drew her eyes in the same direction. There she saw Verena pressed close against the man, his head angling down for a kiss. They were kissing right there.


Gavin caught Verena every time she lurched forward, struggling desperately to steady her. Her body sagged uncontrollably, and after fighting the urge for several moments, she lost the battle.


Clutching his arm, she shook her head in weak defeat. "I can't do it anymore, Gavin. I really feel like I'm going to be sick."


Panic made Gavin's voice spill out in a rush as he tried to lead her forward. "No, no, Verena-Dr.Willis!Just a little longer, please. I'll get you to the restroom right away."


Before he could even finish the words, a sharp draft of air swept behind him. He moved on instinct,shifting sideways and turning to look, but he wasn't fast enough. A fist slammed straight into his face.The sudden sting forced him to drop Verena as his hand flew to his eye, and he stumbled several steps back in pain.


With no one steadying her, Verena reeled backward and braced herself against the counter. Her vision blurred, her mind foggy from drink, and she could hardly process what was happening. By the time she focused again, she saw Gavin pinned hard against the floor.


On top of him, Bobby straddled his chest and drove his fists repeatedly into Gavin's face.


Bobby's teeth clenched in fury, his voice tearing out of him with every blow. "You dared to touch my future sister-in-law? You think you can bully Dr.Willis? I'll beat you down for this, you bastard!"


The alcohol clouded Gavin's mind, and being attacked so suddenly left him dizzy and lost. Instinct alone guided him as his hands gripped Bobby's shoulders, flipping him over in a burst of strength to fight back. The struggle turned into a messy tangle on the floor, fists flying without thought. Even when they rolled apart and pushed themselves back to their feet, the fight refused to end, their bodies crashing against each other in unrelenting anger.



Slowly, Verena's senses sharpened, and she finally realized that Gavin had been dragged into a full-blown fight. When she saw Bobby about to slam a punch toward Gavin's stomach, panic shot through her. She darted forward and threw herself in front of Gavin, arms spread wide. "Touch him again and I swear I'll call the police," she shouted.


Slater, who had stood frozen for too long, finally snapped out of his shock. He rushed forward to grab Bobby's arms, pulling him back even as Bobby strained to lunge forward again. "Bobby, get a hold of yourself! Calm down!"


From her spot a short distance away, Kaia kepot her eyes fixed on the chaos with growing confusion.This was not how she had imagined the scene at all.Instead of turning his anger toward Verena, Bobby had attacked the stranger with a fury that carried the unmistakable air of a man protecting his own family.


The sound of Verena's voice made Bobby freeze,his eyes widening at her in disbelief. Did she actually threaten to call the police on him, just to protect this man? Did that mean she truly had something to do with him? For a brief moment, Bobby couldn't decide which version of Verena was real. Was she the refined,thoughtful Dr. Willis? Was she the arrogant woman who acted superior and lectured him in those messages? Or was she this woman standing here,entangled with some questionable man?


His brows drew together in puzzled frustration, and Bobby asked, "Dr. Willis, why are you protecting himm?Why would you help a man like that? What are you to him?"


Verena's gaze lingered on Bobby, and in that instant she remembered-he was the same boy she had pulled from a wrecked car.


Her lips parted as if to answer, but a heavy surge of nausea climbed up her throat and stopped her short.


She leaned her elbow on the counter and propped her head, her face twisted slightly in discomfort as she stared back at Bobby. "You jumped in and attacked my friend without reason. Naturally, I have to step in for him."


Kaia broke through the crowd in a hurry and called out,"Verena."


One eyebrow arched, and Verena shot Kaia a glance that carried more indifference than interest.


From the tone Kaia used and the timing of her arrival,Verena immediately sensed there was trouble stirring beneath the surface.



Sure enough, Kaia's expression tightened, arranging itself into a mask of false concern, as if to say she was only trying to help. She spoke with mock indignation. "How could you treat Bobby so harshly just because of another man? He's Isaac's younger brother,you know."


Because the bar thundered with noise, everyone had to raise their voices to be heard.


Kaia placed heavy stress on the words "another man," practically shouting them as if she wanted the entire room to notice, deliberately drawing attention to Verena's supposed closeness with Gavin.


Bobby's head turned instinctively toward Verena at Kaia's words, his eyes narrowing with suspicion as he studied her face.


Right at that moment, a violent churn rose in Verena's stomach. She clamped a hand over her mouth and lifted her other hand, signaling for them to stop.


"Wait a second," she remarked, before turning quickly and hurrying toward the restroom.
###Chapter 73 Dr. Willis Is Single





After Verena left, the group sank into silence.


"Oh." A playful voice broke through the hush.


Bobby, Slater, and Kaia all turned to Gavin, confusion written across their faces.


Gavin touched his throbbing lip, forced a crooked smile, rolled up his sleeves, and fixed his eyes on Bobby. "So-you're Isaac's brother, are you? Well, I'm not one to let debts linger. That punch you gave me earlier... I believe it's time the scales were balanced,don't you think so?"


Without another word, Gavin lunged and threw a punch.


Bobby realized too late; the blow landed squarely on his cheek.


Already irritated by Kaia's sharp remarks, Bobby's temper now ignited like dry tinder struck by flint. He ground his teeth. "You think justice is that simple?You hit me, and I'll see to it you pay the price."


With that, Bobby kicked at Gavin.


But Gavin was ready, stepping aside with ease.


Bobby, unfazed, balled his fist again, swinging with renewed fury. The two men collided once more, fists flying in a storm.


Slater, the only one clinging to reason, pushed forward to break them apart, his hand reaching for Bobby's shoulder. "Stop it, enough! Didn't you hear?He's Dr. Willis' friend, don't-ah!"


His cry tore the air. Bobby's punch, dodged by Gavin,had landed squarely on Slater's face instead.


Slater felt fire blaze through his left eye. Wincing, he steadied himself and reached for Gavin. "We're on the same side-stop this, stop-damn!"


He cursed under his breath, staggering back, his right eye already swelling into a dark bruise.


Seeing another punch aimed his way, Slater barked, "Damn it! If I'm the one getting hit, then I'm hitting back!" He tightened his fists and retaliated.


And so, the three of them spiraled into a chaotic scuffle.


The bar's patrons, well-accustomed to such nightly storms, paid little mind. Some even watched with mild amusement, as if the brawl were nothing more than tonight's entertainment.


"Look at that-people with disabilities come to bars too?" A woman's mocking voice cut across the noise.


Heads turned toward the entrance. There, half-shadowed beneath dim lights, sat a man in a navy trench coat, confined to a wheelchair yet radiating a presence that made the air heavier. His features were veiled, but his authority was unmistakable.


"Would you believe it? Still comes to a bar for fun despite the chair," someone scoffed.


"Keep your voices down," another muttered. "Didn't you notice the men behind him? Those aren't just bodyguards-they're wolves in suits." As if to prove the point, one towering figure in a black suit turned his gaze their way. His eyes, sharp as blades, sent a chill through the crowd, and in an instant, the onlookers fell silent, retreating into their drinks and dice games.


Kaia heard those patrons' words and turned toward the door. Her brows drew tight. Could it be lsaac?


Soon, her suspicion was confirmed-lsaac was indeed here, and the sight left her cold.


Isaac, for his part, paid no heed to the whispers. He'd heard too many to care. His thoughts clung only to Verena. His eyes, cold and unwavering, swept ahead -where three figures wrestled by the counter.


The bodyguard closest to lsaac caught sight of one of the fighters and leaned in, his voice low. "Mr.Bennett, isn't that your brother up ahead?"


Isaac swept his gaze across the room. Verena was nowhere in sight, yet one jacket among the three brawlers was all too familiar-it matched the photograph Verena had sent him earlier. His eyes narrowed, a shard of cold light flickering within. "Break them apart," he ordered, his tone like steel.

"Bring me the man in the brown jacket."


The bodyguard bowed slightly. "Yes, sir."


The fight was stillraging when Bobby lifted his leg to strike Gavin again-only to find himself hauled into the air by his collar,feet kicking helplessly.


Slater lunged at Gavin, teeth bared in desperation,but he too was seized by the collar, dangling as though gravity itself had forsaken him.


"Hey! Who the hell-" Bobby's curse halted the moment his eyes rose to the man holding him.Recognition lit his face. "Oh, it's you, Hawley! You came to back us up!"


Slater, too, recognized the bodyguard instantly-Hawley Aston, the Bennett family's most trusted guardian. A surge of relief and confidence flooded both men. Surely Hawley would deal with Gavin on their behalf.



Yet their hopes dissolved in an instant. With effortless strength, Hawley held them aside as if they were no more than rag dolls. He tossed Bobby and Slater away without ceremony, and then turned on Gavin. Before Gavin even grasped what had happened,Hawley had lifted him off his feet and carried him off like a hawk clutching its prey.


Gavin thrashed in resistance, but against a former mercenary like Hawley, his struggle was as useless as a moth battering against glass.


Hawley stopped before Isaac and spoke with military crispness."Mr.Bennett, I've brought him."


Isaac's hands tightened on the armrests of his wheelchair, his voice colder than the bite of winter."Where's Verena?"


Before Gavin could shape an answer, Bobby burst forward, seizing the chance to complain. "Isaac, it's this man! You must let Hawley teach him a lesson. He didn't just hug your future wife-he kissed her!I saw it with my own eyes!"


In his rush, Bobby twisted the truth, confusing wanted to kiss with kissed-yet in his mind, both sins weighed the same. Gavin was guilty either way. Isaac's grip hardened, his gaze cutting into Gavin like twin blades.


Gavin opened his mouth to deny, but then paused.He recalled his exchange with Verena. He had already done enough to stir lsaac's jealousy; now he wished to test whether lsaac's trust in her ran deeper than suspicion.


Drawing himself upright despite his bruises, Gavin smoothed his dlisheveled clothes and spoke with calm, deliberate poise.


"So what? Dr. Willis is single. A gentleman has every right to pursue a lady. The way I pursue her is my affair. As long as Dr. Willis herself raises no objection,the rest of you-who matter little in this-have no right to pass judgment."
###Chapter 74 Jealousy





Gavin's words sliced through lsaac's chest like a thousand unseen blades, as though each syllable tried to pierce the very core of his heart. Jealousy swelled inside him, a black hole swallowing the last fragments of reason, leaving only darkness in its wake.


Isaac fixed his eyes on Gavin, his memory sharp as ever. Even beneath the bruises that marred Gavin's face, he recognized him-the same man who had once sat across from Verena at Fortune Garden Restaurant.



Just friends? The thought rang hollow. Could such closeness truly be brushed off as mere friendship?Ha-people often doubted whether men and women could walk that line without stumbling. Now, the answer seemed clear: no.


Though Isaac could not untangle the truth in Gavin's words, Bobby's account of Gavin's earlier behavior toward Verena was already more than enough to inflame him.


Isaac's eyes blazed with jealousy and deep-rooted anger, a storm begging to be unleashed on Gavin.


Bitterness, regret, envy-one after another, the feelings circled him like vultures, tearing at his sanity without rest. His sharply cut jaw clenched tight, and his gaze gleamed with the ferocity of a predator,coiled and ready to strike.


His voice struck like ice against steel as he demanded, "Who gave you permission to touch her?"


Gavin flinched beneath that piercing gaze, fear chilling him for a heartbeat before his easy mask returned.



He laughed lightly, feigning ease, tilting his head in mock amusement. "Ah, Mr. Bennett, you have quite the sense of humor. Didn't you turn Dr. Willis away yourself? Or are you forbidding her from developing feelings for someone else?" Developing feelings?" Isaac echoed, teeth clenched, his face clouding like a storm on the horizon.


Gavin, savoring the chaos, decided to pour oil onto the flames. "Truth be told, I've admired Dr. Willis for quite some time. She isn't only beautiful-her mind and skill are rare treasures. Now that she's said she's single, tell me, what man wouldn't seize such a chance? Don't you think so, Mr. Bennett?"


Every word Gavin spoke was a spark to lsaac's fury.His eyes narrowed, cold as frost. This man knew his surname-his very identity. That could only mean Verena had spoken of him. But what had she said?That he had driven her away step by step? That he had rejected her until she stood alone, ripe for another's pursuit?


Isaac lowered his gaze, fury shadowing his brow, but sorrow weighing heavier. That little deceiver-only hours ago she had promised to wait, to give him time. Yet within the span of a night, she called herself single to another man. Isaac suspected Verena had done it on purpose. She was a sly fox, skilled in the art of reverse psychology,weaving snares with calculated ease. And yet, he had walked into her trap willingly-for the mere thought of it being true was a burden too heavy to bear.


Meanwhile, Verena had rinsed her face after vomiting and stepped out of the restroom, only to find Gavin restrained by a burly man. Before she could ask,Gavin's mocking words floated to her ears.


Her brows drew together in mild annoyance. What nonsense was he spouting this time?


She moved closer, nudging him lightly on the arm."What exactly are you rambling about?"


Caught off guard by her return, Gavin's face twisted as if his good intentions were being misread.Leaning close, he whispered, "Don't spoil it. I'm helping you."


Still lightheaded, Verena tilted her head, murmuring back, "Helping me with what, exactly?"


They bent toward each other, whispers passing between them, their closeness resembling cO- conspirators plotting a secret pact.


From a short distance, Isaac's hand clamped the armrest so hard that his knuckles cracked audibly.


That nearness-heads brushing, hair mingling-drove him to the edge. Jealousy slithered through his chest like venom, slow yet merciless, pushing him toward the brink of collapse.


He fought to hold back the rising tide of fury, his voice finally breaking the tension-low, steady, and edged with fire. "Verena."


###Chapter 75 Don't Bite





Bobby and Slater dared not meet Isaac's eyes. They felt like strangers at their own table, out of place and unable to grasp the gravity of the moment. So, they simply melted into the background, hoping not to stir the storm.


Kaia had drifted several steps back, anchoring herself at the farthest corner. The scene was slipping beyond her expectations, and her palms grew clammy with nervous sweat.


When Isaac called her name, Verena turned. Beneath the flickering lights, she caught the raw fire of jealousy burning in his eyes. Her own gaze softened,and she offered him a quiet, reassuring smile.


His arrival was both foreseen and unforeseen. She had expected him to come, yet not with such speed,as though he had raced against time itself.


When he saw Verena rooted in place, Isaac's browsknitted faintly. His voice dropped low. "Come here."


Verena had just gathered herself to step forward when Gavin's hand clamped onto her shoulder.


With a cold snort, he sneered, "Mr. Bennett, do you think this is fair? You pushed Dr. Willis away, and now you want her back. You think you can just cast her off when it pleases you and summon her when it suits you? Why should she bow to your whims?"


Isaac did not waver. His eyes locked on Verena,desperate to catch even the smallest ripple of emotion.



Yet, Verena's calm gaze met his without a word.


Her eyes were so crystalline that lsaac felt his very thoughts laid bare under their clarity.


All that had unfolded left him in dread. He could not stomach the image of Verena with another man,nor endure even the thought of her sharing closeness with someone else. The mere notion that another might desire her gnawed at his soul with claws of jealousy.  
Torn between insecurity and jealousy, it was jealousy that rose triumphant. He no longer cared for frailties of body or shadows in his mind. All he craved was Verena by his side. With her, everything else could fade to dust.



Those watching expected Isaac, stung by Gavin's barbed words, to turn away in anger.


Instead, he bowed his head and murmured, "I was wrong. If you will not come to me... then I will come to you."



He steered his wheelchair forward, halted before Verena, and reached for her hand. His eyes lifted to hers. "Will you come back with me?"


His heart thudded wildly, his expression taut with fear that she might never forgive him for the wounds he had carved with cruel words.



Verena studied him. His eyes, deep as hidden waters,his voice tinged with plea, and the tremor at the end of his words betrayed his unease. She could never resist him when he softened. She knelt, wrapped her arms around his neck, and whispered, "Isaac, Gavin only wanted to mislead you.He already has someone he loves, and so do l. We merely crossed paths here by chance. I told you before, as long as you turn back, I will always be here -my word unbroken."


The last line was a mirror of his own promise to her,now returned like an echo.


Isaac gazed at her. Her eyes were brimming with tenderness, as though her pupils held a sky littered with stars. His heart melted.


His throat tightened as he asked in a husky voice,"Then...will you come with me?"


A playful curve touched Verena's lips. "I've been waiting for you to come and fetch me."


His taut expression eased, and at last, a faint smile broke across his face.


Verena guided Isaac out of the bar. Once they entered the car, the driver and bodyguard moved to join them, but Isaac stopped them. "Wait outside for a while. I have something to discuss with my fiancée."



They exchanged knowing looks and nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."


They withdrew, granting the couple their privacy.


Isaac raised the half-lowered window and turned toward Verena's sparkling eyes.


Her smile warmed him like sunlight breaking through clouds.



Her hand still rested in his, and Isaac's thumb traced gentle circles on its back.


"Why are you so happy?" he asked softly.


Verena shook her head, her cheeks tinged pink from drink, her eyes glistening. Her voice stretched languidly. "I like it when you call me your fiancée.Say it again."


It dawned on Isaac then-she hadn't fully sobered.


The heater hummed. She had shed her coat, now clad in a blue cashmere sweater and fittedjeans that framed her figure with effortless grace.


His Adam's apple bobbed, his chest heaved, and his eyes grew heavy with unspoken longing.


He drew her hand gently, pulling her closer, and then folded her into his embrace.



His breathing deepened as he whispered again,"Fiancée...my fiancée."


From the instant he had seen her at the bar, the urge to hold her close had burned within him, though circumstance had forced restraint.



Caught unawares, Verena tumbled against his firm chest.



"Isaac, you-" Before she could finish, his lips hovered close, his intent unmistakable.



Startled, she pressed her free hand against his shoulder. She had just thrown up earlier.


The subtle fragrance on her was broken, and Isaac glanced at  her delicate hand holding him back. His lashes lowered as he blinked slowly.


"Why push me away?" His tone carried grievance,like a child robbed of his cherished toy.


Verena's hand slipped down as she explained gently,"It's not that. I just... threw up."


The implication was clear-she feared she might not smell pleasant.


Isaac blinked, briefly stunned.


"You rinsed your mouth?" he asked.


Verena nodded. A small smile touched his lips.


"Then it's fine," he murmured, leaning in once more.


Realizing he was serious, Verena pressed against him again, pleading softly, "No, not now. We'll have plenty of chances later, won't we?"


Isaac's gaze lingered on her reddened lips, his Adam's apple rising, his eyes sliding down her delicate neck. They narrowed with a heat that defied words. As Verena leaned back in persuasion, her slender neck arched, exposed in the dim glow.


"Fine, no kissing," Isaac conceded. Yet before she could relax, he suddenly drew her onto his lap,seating her astride,face to face.


Startled, Verena gasped, only to hear him murmur,"This much is allowed, yes?"


"Mmm..." she groaned faintly.


His warm lips brushed her neck, sending sparks that raced down her spine.


Before she could recover, he nibbled lightly at her skin, part playful, part possessive.


"Isaac..." Verena clung to his shoulder, her body trembling as sparks coursed from her back to her mind, leaving her weak and pliant against him.


In the dim light of the car, Isaac lifted his head at the sound of her voice. "What's wrong?"


His breath skimmed her chin, light as a feather,stirring her heart with an aching itch. Her cheeks flushed, she pinched his burning earlobe and murmured, half-coaxing, half-complaining,"Don't bite."



"Alright, no biting," Isaac agreed at once, and then lowered his head to press his lips to her collarbone.



His tongue traced her skin, slow and deliberate, his lips drawing firmly at intervals.



It was no bite, yet it unsettled her far more.



Outside the car, the driver and bodyguard exchanged looks. The driver squinted toward the vehicle.



"Did the car just move?" the driver muttered.



The bodyguard, sharp-eyed from years as a mercenary, gave it a glance. "No."



The driver frowned. "Strange. They sent us away,and it's been so long-yet no sign of movement?"



The bodyguard pressed his lips together, impassive."Better not to meddle in Mr. Bennett's business.Orders are orders."
 
    


Inside the bar, after Verena left with Isaac, the group stood rooted, still reeling from the turn of events.


No one had expected it to end this way.


Bobby and Slater traded bewildered looks. "What just happened?" Bobby asked, baffled.


Slater shrugged, palms up. "Don't ask me. I'm just as lost."



Seeing he had no role left to play, Gavin decided the night had reached its end. All he wanted was sleep-and a clear head in the morning.



He chuckled dryly and told the two, "I'll settle today's account with you later. I'm leaving."


It sounded less like farewell and more like a verdict.


As Gavin's figure faded into the distance, Bobby's mind turned over the events. Something didn't add up. Gavin hardly seemed invested in Dr. Willis at all-and he knew she was Verena, Isaac's fiancée. Then the realization struck like a bolt. Bobby's eyes widened. He hadn't connected Verena and Dr. Willis because Kaia had once said in their group that Verena was unattractive.



He turned sharply toward Kaia and demanded,"Didn't you tell us before that Verena wasn't attractive?"



He frowned. Was this what Kaia had called unattractive?



Slater too shot her a questioning glance.


Kaia froze where she stood, as though her shoes had been nailed to the floor. She had been so eager to expose Verena's supposed flaws that she had forgotten the last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena's true beauty.


Kaia's face drained of color in an instant.
 ###Chapter 76 Warning





Kaia stiffened under the sharp stares of Bobby and Slater, a shiver crawling up her spine.


Her lips quivered as she forced herself to defend."When Verena first came to the city, she didn't care much about appearances, and she wasn't as attractive as she is now. When people in the group chat asked me about her, I just said she was alright.I never called her ugly. Those rumors were made up by others.How can you pin that on me?"


She tried to sound reasonable, as though she were the victim of false blame, but panic pressed at her chest.



Bobby caught every crack in her story and gave a slow, mocking grin. "Do you think I'm that easy to fool? If it were my sister, I'd never stand by while outsiders insulted her. And you expect me to believe Verena could ever be described as just 'alright'?Even without effort, she outshines most. If the gossip 
didn't come from you, then why didn't you step in to stop it? Tell me, Kaia, are you really acting like a sister here, or were you quietly pushing this along?"



His relentless questioning tore through the fragile wall she'd tried to build.


Kaia's throat tightened, and she squeezed her fists to stop her nerves from showing.


"Mr. Bennett, you're being unfair. Verena is my sister,and I would never scheme against her. The reason l stayed quiet was..."



Kaia's words faltered, and she scrambled to justify herself. "Because explaining would only spark more fighting, and that fighting would spread even further.I didn't want all of this trivial gossip reaching Verena and upsetting her."



"So you think it's nothing serious?" Bobby's tone cut like a blade as his eyes narrowed. "Accusations of falsifying her degree, being selfish, arrogant, and unrefined-are those trivial to you?"


His voice dropped lower, leaving no room to escape. 
"Kaia, stop pretending. You dragged me to this bar tonight because you wanted me to see Verena with another man and stir up trouble. You wanted her branded as unfaithful so her reputation would crumble. After that, you expected me to bring the story back to lsaac or my mother. And while lsaac might keep calm, you know my mother's nature. If she believed what she heard or saw, she'd make Verena's life miserable the moment she married into our family. You'd just stand there and watch it unfold,pleased with the chaos. Isn't that the truth?"


Kaia's lips parted, but not a single defense came out.Every accusation matched the thoughts she'd buried inside. Beads of sweat gathered on her forehead,her legs turned to jelly, and the color drained from her face. The carefully polished image she had fought so hard to maintain in high society was the last thing she wanted to see crumble.



Bobby shot her a frigid look and spoke with unwavering firmness. "I don't care if it's jealousy or something else driving you, but this ends here. From now on, watch yourself and stop creating problems. If you insult my future sister-in-law again, you'll regret it."


The exchange left Slater stunned. The idea that someone could despise her own sister to this degree was beyond him.


Disgust flickered across his face as he glared at Kaia."Back at the Willis Villa, when I mentioned Verena,your outburst suddenly makes sense. You can't handle seeing her shine. And if memory serves me right, you even bragged that a few random supplements you tossed together healed my grandfather's leg. The more I think about it, the funnier it sounds."



Heat rushed to Kaia's cheeks, and she sank her teeth into her lip, furious that he had stripped her bare so mercilessly.



A sharp laugh escaped Slater as he moved closer,towering over her. "Let me clear things up for you.The one who healed my grandfather was indeed from the Willis family, but it sure wasn't you. It was Verena.Your sister. Shocking, isn't it?" Kaia had long wondered if Verena was responsible for Barrie's recovery. As long as no one confirmed it,though, she clung to the fantasy that she might guess wrong.


That fantasy shattered the instant Slater spelled it out. The truth gutted her. Why Verena of all people?She had no prestigious training, only the rough skills of a countryside healer. Kaia, on the other hand,studied medicine at a renowned university. How could Verena possibly have better medical skills than her? The thought was unbearable.



Color drained from her face, and her legs buckled as she stumbled backward.



Earlier, she had barely kept her lies afloat. Now, with Slater's brutal words cutting deeper than ever,her last defenses collapsed. Broken and humiliated,she spun on her heel and rushed out of the bar in near hysteria.







The Willis Villa still blazed with light, though the night had slipped wvell past midnight.

 In the living room, Laura sat curled on a sofa,clutching her phone. She had dialed Verena again and again, each call met with silence, yet she refused to give up.


Since the club incident, Alec had buried himself in work at the company and rarely came home.


Whenever he did stop by to grab something, Laura tried reaching out. Sometimes she got nothing more than a cold stare. Other times, his foul mood exploded, and he berated her as an unfit mother who couldn't even get her own daughter to answer the phone.


The bitterness she carried threatened to spill over,but she swallowed it back. If the family was going to have any future, then she had no choice but to bow to Verena.


Isaac dropped Verena off at the hotel, and then instructed the staff to prepare something to clear the alcohol from her system. He didn't leave until she had finished it.



Sleep tugged at her eyelids, and she made no effort to ask him to stay.


The stench of liquor clung stubbornly to her, so she dragged herself into the bathroom, craving the relief of a hot shower.


As her clothes came off, the mirror betrayed her with a glimpse of several crimson marks scattered along her collarbone and neck. Isaac used to leave those when they were together in bed...


The memory seared her cheeks red. She slapped them lightly, desperate to stop her mind from straying down that path.



A sudden vibration rattled against the countertop,pulling her attention to her phone.



Laura's name flashed on the screen, and without hesitation, Verena hit decline.


When the call cut off, the display lit up with more than twenty missed calls-all from Laura.


The reason behind Laura's relentless attempts had been clear for days now.Verena decided she had no energy to deal with it.She either silenced the phone or flatly rejected the calls.



With the phone tossed aside, she stepped beneath the running water.


Meanwhile, Laura heard nothing but the busy tone and exclaimed through clenched teeth, "Ungrateful brat!"


Her temper nearly drove her to hurl the phone across the room.



Days of unanswered calls had left her feeling insulted and powerless.



Across town, Kaia stumbled out of the bar and into a taxi. Life felt as though it had slipped out of her control, and her empty eyes reflected the chaos as she numbly pushed open the front door upon arriving home.



The sound reached Laura, who turned toward the entrance. The moment she saw Kaia step inside, her face lit up with sudden hope, as though salvation had walked in.


"Kaia, you're finally home." She rushed over,consumed by her own worries, oblivious to Kaia's ashen face and hollow expression. "I need you to do something for me."
###Chapter 77 Stop Mentioning Her In Front Of Me





Laura let out a quick explanation, her voice sharp with irritation. "I tried calling Verena again, and she hung up on me. That ungrateful girl refuses to let go of her grudge. I've already dialed her number more than twenty times, yet she still won't answer. I don't think I can bring myself to keep trying anymore."


Before Kaia could get a word in, Laura grabbed her hand with a smile and added, "But you're not like me.You're her little sister, and you've never given her a reason to be upset. Verena won't turn against you.Besides, you've always been clever with words and know how to win people over. So why don't you call her? Use a softer tone, say something nice, and ask her to talk Isaac into sparing us. After all, the two families will soon be tied together by marriage, so shouldn't we leave some space to work things out?"


The stress of the situation had already stolen Laura's  sleep for several nights.


Caught up in her own plotting, she didn't even notice the dark look tightening Kaia's features.



Kaia cut her eyes toward Laura, her jaw rigid with frustration. Just hearing Verena's name was enough to make her want to crush her, let alone lower herself to beg for Verena's mercy.



Her eyes burned with a bloodshot glare, and the fury rising inside her roared to life.



Snatching her hand free of Laura's hold, she burst out in a trembling voice, "Verena, Verena, Verena!What makes her so special that everyone keeps talking about her? The others are obsessed, Dad is too, and now even you! Ever since she showed up, all of you only see her. Do I even count as your daughter anymore?"


The living room went still for several seconds,her voice echoing off the wide walls.


Her words quivered, her tone almost breaking apart.  Laura froze, startled by the sudden fury, her smile stiff and unnatural.



Kaia had always been spoiled, but she had also been mild and obedient since she was young. Laura had never once seen her younger daughter rage with such raw anger.


Laura's face filled with shock as she asked, "Kaia,what has gotten into you?"


Kaia balled her fists, drew in a sharp breath,and spoke through clenched teeth. "I don't want to hear Verena's name again. Stop mentioningher in front of me."



She pushed past Laura without another glance and stormed upstairs to her room.



Laura stood frozen in place, truly stunned by Kaia's outburst, her eyes fixed blankly ahead as she struggled to recover. Something about her younger daughter felt changed, though she couldn't pinpoint what it was. All she knew was that Kaia no longer seemed like the girl she used to be. ···


Slater came back home from the bar that night and made his way directly toward Barrie's quarters.


He was eager to share with Barrie everything that had unfolded earlier in the day.



Surprise flickered across Slater's face when he saw the back garden still lit up, since Barrie was usually in bed by this hour.


When he drew closer, Slater spotted Barrie seated at the patio table, joined by Fletcher and Marietta.



Taking a seat beside them with a confused look, he asked, "Dad, Mom, why are you still awake?"


"You rascal, finally back from your outings."Marietta's tone carried mock annoyance, yet her eyes brimmed with affection. As she reached out to smooth down Slater's untidy bangs, she explained,"We were having a discussion with your grandpa."



Even though Barrie kept to himself most of the time,Fletcher and Marietta often turned to him for advice  whenever company matters grew complicated.


"Oh, I get it." Slater showed little interest in the details of their talk, but he straightened his posture and said firmly, "It's good you're all here together.I have something very important to tell you."
###Chapter 78 You've Got More Than One Daughter





Fletcher burst into laughter the moment he heard Slater speak. "And what could be so important for you?"


Slater let out a click of his tongue, pretending to be wounded. "Dad, you make it sound like l've got nothing better to do than fool around."


With his smile lingering, Fletcher asked, "Alright then,what's this big secret you're keeping?"


Slater rubbed the back of his neck, hesitating before admitting, "Fine, maybe it's not exactly the kind of thing you'd call big."


That confession made his parents and grandfather laugh even harder.



Straightening up, Slater spoke with a sudden gravity."But what I'm about to say will definitely surprise you."


The laughter faded at once, and every eye turned toward him in expectation.


Slater leaned in a little, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. "The doctor who cured Grandpa's leg, Dr. Willis, is actually Alec's daughter."



Shock rippled across the table, leaving them speechless for a moment.



Barrie narrowed his eyes, the astonishment written clearly across his face.



Fletcher's gaze met his wife's, both of them struggling to believe what they'd just heard.


Marietta leaned forward, doubt filled her voice."Slater, are you absolutely sure? When we visited the Willis family, they told us Dr. Willis wasn't Alec's daughter. Why are you saying otherwise now?"


Slater chuckled at her skepticism. "Mom, that day only Kaia was at home. Naturally she wasn't the doctor. Remember, the Willis family has two daughters."


Her words trailed cautiously. "So you mean..."


"Yes," Slater confirmed, his eyes gleaming with admiration. "The real Dr. Willis is Kaia's elder sister,Verena Willis."


Barrie remained silent, lost deep in thought as the revelation settled over him.



Fletcher frowned in doubt. "You mean the one engaged to lsaac? She doesn't seem to have a favorable reputation. Maybe Isaac's dislike for her is what drove him to strike at the Willis family and stir up all this trouble."


Stories about Verena had already reached Fletcher's ears. What he'd heard wasn't just unfavorable-it was downright disgraceful. Still, as a well-educated man, he chose his words cautiously to leave her some dignity.


Slater's voice rose in protest. "Not have a favorable reputation? That's all Kaia's doing. You don't know how conniving Alec's younger daughter is. She's a compulsive liar who floods the internet with her nonsense, trying to ruin Verena's name. She tells everyone Dr. Willis is unattractive, arrogant,dishonest, and useless."


He then turned toward Barrie and said, "Grandpa.Mom and Dad haven't met Dr. Willis, but you and l have. Do you honestly think Kaia's smears make sense? Just her looks alone-how many women in Shoildon can match her? And her personality? She's gentle to the core. As for her skills, they're beyond doubt. Anyone bold enough to operate on you has to be at a professor's level at least."



Barrie sat in silence, his expression serious as he reflected. Rumors had never mattered to him anyway.All that counted was that Dr. Willis had proven herself to be one of the best physicians in Clokron.


Slater leaned forward, continuing firmly, "And let's clear up another falsehood. The talk about lsaac being unhappy with her? That's absolute nonsense."



Thinking back to what he'd witnessed earlier atthe bar, Slater allowed a smile. "If anything, Isaac looks more than pleased with Dr. Willis."


Fletcher's expression tightened with uncertainty."SO everything I've heard about her...are you saying none of it's true?"



Slater thumped his chest with confidence. "That's right, Dad. You can believe me-those stories are nothing but gossip."


Marietta leaned in and asked sharply, "Then tell us,how exactly did youlearn all this?"


Every eye at the table shifted to Slater, waiting for his explanation.



Slater went on to recount what had unfolded earlier that night.


When he finished, the group grew quiet until Barrie finally let out a weary sigh. "What are we supposed to make of this? Should we still be stepping into Alec's club issues?"



After a moment of thought, Barrie tapped his cane against the ground, his thick white brows knitting ìtogether. "Alec is Dr. Willis' father, and Dr. Willis herself saved me. If that's the case, I can't simply turn a blind eye."



Fletcher noticed the hesitation in his father's voice and spoke carefully. "Dad, if Isaac moves against the Willis family not because he dislikes Verena, then he must have another reason. Why don't we ask Beckett to hold off on shutting down the Willis Group's club for a couple of days? We can wait until we hear Isaac's side before deciding what to do. How does that sound?"



Barrie rolled the bead at the top of his cane between his fingers, and then gave a firm nod. "We'll do it that way."



The following morning, inside the CEO's office at Willis Group, Alec sat behind his desk. Days of sleepless nights had left him thinner, with heavy shadows beneath his eyes. He looked more exhausted than ever.



Before one crisis calmed, Bennett Group swooped in and took several key projects right out from under him.



Problems were piling up everywhere, and Alec struggled to keep the company afloat.


By dawn, he was already on the phone, calling old partners and anyone with influence still left in his contacts. Whether it meant leaning on friendships or lowering himself with flattery, Alec refused to miss a single chance to fight for Willis Group's survival.


Alec forced a stiff smile as he spoke into the phone."Have you eaten yet? If not, let me treat you. And if meeting is a hassle, I can always send breakfast over."



The voice on the other end was rude. "Forget it, Mr.Willis. Let's not waste time. If this is about your club,then don't bother calling again."



A twitch crossed Alec's face. "We've been partners before. Couldn't you at least-"



The call cut off before he could finish.


"Hello? Hello?" Alec pressed the phone back to his ear, but the line was dead. HHe tried calling back, only to be ignored.


Even those who once called themselves friends wanted nothing to do with him when things turned bleak.



His complexion drained, Alec quickly moved to dial the next number.


"Hey, are you free this week? Let's grab a meal. Pick any place you like-"


The voice on the other end cut him off, speaking briskly. "Alec, don't bother with small talk. I know the issues of your club have got you stressed, but there's nothing I can do."


His knuckles tightened on the edge of the table."When you launched your company, I was the one who stood as your guarantor. Now that Willis Group is in trouble, you can't just turn away like this."


The man on the other end answered, "Of course l remember what you did for me, Alec. But things are different now. Beckett is carrying out lsaac's orders.l may know Beckett, but not nearly well enough to sway him."


Alec heard the dismissal beneath the polite tone.Realizing there was no use dragging it out, he muttered a few half-hearted thanks before hanging up.


A wave of anxiety gripped Alec so tightly that his vision blurred, and he quickly reached for a bottle of pills, forcing a few down.


Just then, his phone buzzed. For days he had been the one dialing number after number, so the sight of an incoming call felt almost strange.


Without bothering to check who it was, he snatched up the call.


"Alec, I've got some good news for you," a cheerful voice remarked.



Hope flickered in his chest as he asked quickly "What news?"



"You've been worried about your club being shutdown, right? I had a friend close to Beckett dig around, and they just told me the Lyons family stepped in. They convinced Beckett to ease up and lift the lockdown for now."



Shock and joy hit Alec all at once, and he shot to his feet. "The Lyons family? Are you sure this is solid?"


"Of course. You think I'd play around with something like this?" The caller reassured him.



The certainty in the voice left Alec convinced. The problem wasn't gone completely, but for now,he had some breathing room. At least Isaac hadn't slammed the doors shut permanently in one decisive move,which was exactly what Alec had been dreading.



Relief spilled out of him in a long exhale. "You're right, I overreacted. Thank you for this. I owe you a big meal soon."


After ending the call, Alec pressed his fist against his forehead, confusion creeping in. He had thought the Lyons family wanted nothing to do with him, maybe even held a grudge. So why step in now? Whatever their reason, he knew he needed to call them himself-both to thank them and to understand what game they were playing.


Alec dialed the Lyons family's private number.


Inside the Lyons residence, Slater was halfway through breakfast with Barrie when the house phone began to ring.



"Who's calling so early?" Slater murmured as he tore off another bite of bread.



The butler checked the screen and answered, "It's Alec Willis."



Slater arched a brow, already guessing the reason behind the call.


"Hand it to me," he said, reaching for the phone.


Barrie shot him a warning look. "Slater, don't fool around."



"| won't," Slater assured quickly. "But Alec deserves to hear the truth." With that, he accepted the phone and hit the answer button. Alec's voice came through, formal and steady. "Good morning. Is Mr. Barrie Lyons available?This is Alec Willis, CEO of Willis Group."


Slater leaned back in his chair, answering casually,"My grandfather's right here. Say what you need-he can hear you."


"Alright," Alec replied, hesitation creeping into his tone. "A friend told me the lockdown on our club was lifted for now. Did Mr. Barrie Lyons make that happen?"



Slater straightened his posture, responding clearly,"Yes. My grandfather did intervene."


Alec opened his mouth to thank Barrie, but Slater cut in before he could. "If you want to thank someone,thank Dr. Willis. You're fortunate to have such a daughter."


A small crease appeared between Alec's brows. Dr.Willis...


The thought slipped out before he could stop  himself. "Could it have been Kaia..."



"Hold on!" Slater chimed in sharply. "Don't go assuming Kaia is the one behind everything good.Last I checked, you've got more than one daughter."
###Chapter 79 Unbelievable Facts





Slater spoke plainly, and Alec immediately sensed the weight behind his words. A deep crease formed between his brows as a startling thought struck him -could it really be Verena?


Silence lingered on the line, and Slater could almost hear Alec wrestling with the idea.


A sharp laugh carried through the phone as Slater chimed in, "Come on, Mr. Willis. You've already guessed it. The truth is exactly what you're afraid of.It wasn't Kaia who healed my grandfather's leg. It was Verena Willis. If you're desperate to hand out thanks, direct them to your eldest daughter instead of pretending Kaia deserves the credit."



Normally, Slater wouldn't waste his time picking apart a wealthy family/'s private squabbles. But when it came to Dr. Willis, he made an exception.


Hearing that name spoken with such certainty jolted 
Alec. It was as if someone had splashed ice water over him. His hand clenched the phone so tightly that it shook.


Disbelief twisted his mouth as he muttered, "No...that can't be right. Verena? How could that be possible? Isn't this some mistake? She grew up tucked away in a forgotten little town, learning scraps of medicine from a village doctor. Don't tell me she was capable of curing a condition even the top hospitals couldn't fix. That's absurd..."


"What nonsense about some village doctor and a few scraps of medicine?"


A flicker of amusement crossed Slater's face at Alec's refusal to accept the obvious. No matter how plainly he laid it out, the man clung to denial like it was a lifeline.


A harsh laugh slipped out, dripping with contempt."So that's what you've convinced yourself of? Just idle gossip picked up from people who don't know the first thing about Dr. Willis? I've heard those stories too, but they're nothing but blind ignorance. The real irony is this-those strangers have an excuse. You don't. You're her father, and yet you can't even name a single skill your daughter has. Tell me, Mr. Willis, what kind of father looks away so carelessly?"


Without pausing for an answer, Slater pressed harder, his voice as sharp as glass. "In Shoildon,everyone's heard the praises sung for Kaia. They boast about her spot at the nation's top medical university, her studies under a famous professor. But here's what no one talks about. Back in Clokron,years ago, Verena was the lead surgeon who opened my grandfather's chest and gave him a new heart.That's the woman you've been overlooking."


Alec's eyes widened in disbelief. Surely this couldn't be real.


In his sudden panic, he stumbled backward,bumping into his chair before collapsing into it.


His brow furrowed deeply as he blurted out, "That makes no sense. Your grandfather's heart surgery was far too dangerous for any local doctor to even consider. How could Verena have handled something like that? And wasn't she always stuck back in our hometown? When did she even have the chance to go overseas?"


The questions spilled out one after another, directed at Slater, but just as much at himself.


Finding Alec's frantic denial almost entertaining,Slater chuckled. "Mr. Willis, she's your daughter. If you don't even know what she's capable of, why on earth would I be the one to tell you?"


Without another word, he ended the call.


A flat tone rang through Alec's ear as the line went dead. He stayed frozen for a long moment, phone pressed against him as if hoping the voice would return.


Finally, he slammed the device onto the desk,dropped his elbows to it, buried his fingers in his hair,and bowed his head low. Everything he thought he knew about his eldest daughter had just unraveled.

 
Only then did it hit him-he had lived like a man walking blind. He had never truly tried to understand Verena. Before she was seven, he and Laura had spent most of their time away working, coming home only on holidays, treating family time like a rare luxury. When she reached that age, Kaia was born,and his business took off, pulling his attention even further away.


As the years went by and the family finally settled in Shoildon, Kaia quickly became the apple of their eye.Then Luka was born, completing the picture-perfect family of four. With a cherished son and a celebrated daughter, Verena became little more than a shadow.


When they did call her, the conversations were shallow, filled with praise for Kaia's kindness or Luka's cleverness, but never once did they ask Verena about her own life.



The memories twisted his expression into something bitter and pained. His chest tightened with the weight of it all.


He remembered bringing Verena into Shoildon, only to hear Laura constantly boast of Kaia's brilliance while treating Verena like a burden. As he thought back now, Verena must have seen the absurdity of it all, standing silent while her own mother dismissed her.


And yet, minutes ago, Slater had revealed the truth-that the daughter they ignored, the one pushed aside, was the very doctor who had performed a heart transplant and restored Barrie's health.


The blow landed harder than he could bear, and Alec struck his forehead with a clenched fist.


Regret poured through him, thick and merciless, as though something priceless had slipped forever from his hands.







After Kaia's explosive outburst the night before, she had gone out of her way to avoid her mother.


Confusion lingered at the back of Laura's mind, but she was far too distracted to think about it.


Her attempts to reach Verena that day had failed one after another, each call ending without an answer.


The irritation gnawed at her until her body felt heavy with fatigue.


Later, after rinsing off in the shower, she sat before her vanity, smoothing skincare across her face while deciding she'd try Verena's number one final time before turning in.


The sound of the door unlocking startled her just as she reached for her phone.


When she looked over, Alec stepped inside, and her surprise slipped into her voice. "Alec? What brings you home tonight?"


Not once since the closure of the club had he returned during the evening.


Alec offered no reply. Instead, he set his briefcase down and sank heavily onto the sofa in their bedroom.



Laura walked toward him cautiously. "Did you have dinner yet? I can ask the staff to fix you something if you haven't."


His head moved in a firm shake, but his lips remained sealed.



It took her a moment to realize that his silence wasn't ordinary. As she drew closer, she caught sight of the storm clouding his features-his forehead creased,his brows drawn into a knot, and faint new lines had carved themselves into his skin.


Being someone who knew how to read faces, she lowered her tone and asked carefully, "Alec, what's happened? Did more trouble come up with the club?"


His answer came slowly, his voice heavy with exhaustion. "No. That part's been taken care of."



Laura didn't catch what he'd mumbled, so she leaned in."What was that?"



Alec finally raised his eyes to meet hers. "The matter with the club-it's been taken care of."



For a second she just stared, stunned, before her whole face lit up. "Are you serious? That's incredible

 news!"



She slipped onto the sofa beside him and clasped his arm."Then why do you look like the world's ending?You nearly gave me a heart attack with that expression."


No hint of joy touchned Alec's face. His hands dug into his knees as he murmured darkly, "It was Verena who solved it."



Shock flickered across Laura's eyes, but it quickly melted into smug satisfaction.


"Hmph. That ungrateful girl. I thought she'd abandoned us altogether since she ignored all my calls. But clearly she's worried about her future with the Bennett family and realized she still needs our backing."



She brushed her fingers through her hair with a self-satisfied air.since she showed some sense this time, I'll overlook her rudeness and pretend she never avoided me."


Alec turned his head sharply, shooting her a look. The way Laura spoke of Verena carried such disdain it was as though the girl were something dirty clinging to her shoes.


That tone stirred a memory in Alec. Years ago, when he had tried to bring his mother and Verena from their small rural town to Shoildon, Laura had stopped him every time with one excuse after another.


She had said, "They're comfortable with country life.City living would only trouble them." Then, another time, "We're too busy with work, and Kaia and Luka need us. We don't have the energy to care for them too." And finally, "Verena's a country girl.People here would only look down on her." Only now did it hit him -those excuses had never been truths, just deliberate barriers she put up.



The more he thought about it, the hotter his anger burned. If not for Laura's schemes, Verena would have been here years ago, and by now she might already hold a place of honor in Shoildon society.And the Willis family's standing might've skyrocketed. With that bitter realization weighing on him, Alec jerked his arm free from her grasp and leveled a cold stare at her. "Don't fool yourself. Verena didn't directly step in. The problem was resolved because she once gave Barrie a new heart and healed his leg.Barrie stepped in for her sake."


Laura shot to her feet, her eyes wide. "What did you just say?" 
###Chapter 80 We Owe Verena





Laura's shock quickly turned into outright denial.She shook her head again and again, blurting, "No, that's impossible! Verena never even went to college. She only learned a little medicine from a village doctor.There's no way she could carry out a surgery like that. Alec, you don't really believe Verena can slice someone open and cure them, do you?"



Every timne Verena's name left Laura's mouth, a glint of scorn flashed in her eyes.



Annoyance rising, Alec slammed his fist against the coffee table, his expression severe. "Slater himself confirmed it, and Barrie heard every word when l spoke with him. Do you understand who the Lyons family is? Do you honestly think they would bother lying to us?"



Laura faltered, her lips trembling. "That has to be a joke,right?" Deep down, she still clung to disbelief.


Alec lost his temper when he saw she'd rather dismiss it as a joke than admit Verena's skill.


He shot to his feet, pointing a finger right at her face as his voice boomed, "Do you realize how terrifyingly powerful the Lyons family is? Compared to them, our family is nothing less than ants underfoot. They wouldn't waste their time deceiving us!"


The sound of his voice reached her,low and steady,and it struck something final in Laura. Whatever comforting lie she'd been clinging to slipped through her fingers.


Verena's strengths weren't the problem. What unsettled her was the truth buried beneath it all. She had placed all her hopes in the wrong child. The daughter she'd cherished, praised, and protected with everything she had turned out to shine far less than the one she'd cast aside. And now, to recognize Verena's worth felt like dragging her own failures into the light, like confessing she'd been blind all along.


Her knees gave out, and she sank into the sofa, Her mind suddenly recalled her conversation with Verena when she'd just arrived in Shoildon, before the Bennett family ever met her.


Back then, afraid Verena would humiliate her without a proper degree, Laura had ordered her to lie to the Bennett family, to say she was a graduate of Acorith College of Medicine. But Verena refused, boldly telling them she came from Pine Hill University instead.



The memory of her own face, flushed with fury and disbelief at that time, came rushing back. Yet now...


Her fingers dug into the armrest as she forced the words out. "Could it betrue... that Verena really did graduate from Pine Hill University?"


The name alone made Alec's breath catch. His head buzzed as he stared at her in shock.



"What are you talking about? Say it clearly!" His eyes widened, and he gripped her shoulders hard,demanding, "When did she ever tell you she was from Pine Hill University? Why didn't you tel: me something so important earlier?"


Alec's grip bit into Laura's shoulders, sending pain down her arms, but the weight of his questions made panic burn far more than the ache.


"... when she first mentioned it after coming to Shoildon, she sounded like she was making up wild stories, so l dismissed it. And honestly, even if I had told you then, you wouldn't have believed a word of it either."



Rage twisted through Alec, his teeth grinding hard.He shoved Laura aside and hissed through clenched jaws. "Foolish woman!"


Without another word, he stormed straight toward the study.


Inside,Alec dropped heavily into the office chair, his brow locked in a hard knot. For the first time, he saw how blind he had been to his eldest daughter. Verena had never concealed the truth, but their arrogance had kept them from seeing her worth. They had brushed her off as useless, refusing to hear her out. Gossip spread outside, painting her as selfish and deceitful, and he let it seep into his own mind. Time after time, he blamed her in his mind for disgracing the Willis family, even regretting her return. And when Laura had driven her out, he had let it happen without protest.


A long sigh escaped him as he buried his face in his hands, guilt pressing down until it was almost unbearable. Everything he had worked for could have been within reach if only he'd shown Verena a fraction of care. Instead, he had destroyed it with his own hands.



Then his thoughts snagged on a new question, and his movements stilled. Where had all those rumors about Verena come from? Hardly anyone had known of her existence before. Why would strangers target her so viciously?


Lifting his head, Alec reached for the computer with trembling fingers.


He dug into the night, searching relentlessly, until one group chat screenshot stopped him cold. His fists curled tight as he enlarged the image to be certain.



The chat was filled with the wealthy young people of Shoildon.


But what froze his blood was the familiar profile picture attached to one of the names. His own younger daughter, Kaia.


A bitter laugh pulled at his mouth, sharp with disbelief. The girl who had always acted gentle and dutiful was in fact the one who had started all the rumors about her sister.


The realization churned his stomach with fury, and for a moment, he wanted nothing more than to confront her. But sanity clawed him back. For now,making peace with Verena mattered most. As for Kaia-her reckoning would come later.


After Alec stormed away, Laura lay restless in bed,unable to find sleep. When she finally turned over with the thought of making warm milk, a shadow by her bedside jolted her into a scream. Her hand flew to the lamp switch, flooding the room with light, and she froze once she saw who it was.



"Alec, you nearly gave me a heart attack." She pressed herself against the headboard, trying to steady her breath.


His eyes lingered on her in icy silence. The longer he stared, the more unsettled she felt, until at last he spoke. "We owe Verena. Tomorrow, you're coming with me to give her a proper apology."






At the Bennett Mansion...


Flat on his back, Bobby held his phone above him,staring at his chat with Verena.


His thoughts tangled as he scrolled through their conversations, every word stirring an unease he couldn't shake. The way Verena wrote, the tone-he couldn't help but picture Kaia behind the screen.


Then it struck him like a blow. "That's right... Kaia was the one who gave me Verena's contact."


He bolted upright, clawing at his hair in frustration. 
How could he have been so gullible? Kaia was never reliable-half her words were lies. Yet he'd swallowed them whole without a second thought.


If Dr. Willis and Verena were one and the same, but he somehow had both numbers, then one of them had to be fake.



Determined to clear it up, Bobby snapped a screenshot of Verena's profile and forwarded it to the Dr. Willis account, adding a question: "Dr. Willis, is this one yours, too?"


The reply came quickly. "No."


Bobby dropped his phone and buried his face in his hands.


Damn it. That meant the Verena he had been messaging all this time was most likely Kaia pretending.


For the first time, doubt gnawed at his own intelligence. Knowing Kaia's talent for scheming, he had still sided with her against her sister without once checking the facts. What an idiot he had been. Even if he hadn't said those cruel things directly to the real Verena, it didn't erase the truth-he had spoken ill of her.


And worse, in his petty attempts to oppose her, he had made himself look utterly foolish.


The more he replayed it all, the heavier the shame sat in his chest, until he wanted to tear his hair out.


No, he couldn't let it end this way. He had to talk with Verena and explain, to show her he wasn't the complete fool he had acted like. She had to see he wasn't beyond saving.


No wonder Isaac had lost his temper with him every time he spoke ill of Verena.
###Chapter 81 A Meeting Between Bobby And Verena

Bobby leaned over and grabbed the phone he had tossed aside earlier.

His thumbs began flying across the keyboard.

Verena sat at the hotel room desk, wrapping up her work when her phone vibrated once.

One glance at the screen showed a message from Bobby.

"Dr. Willis, are you free tomorrow morning? I need to talk to you about something important. Can I come by?"

Curiosity flickered across Verena's face. The truth was, she and Bobby weren't close enough for private meetings yet.If anyone else had sent that message, she might have told them to text her or just call. Still,Bobby wasn't just anyone-he was lsaac's younger brother. Spending time with him felt a little like previewing her future family.

Her lips curved into a small smile as she responded, "Sure, let's have breakfast together."

That single reply had Bobby grinning from ear to ear, his excitement practically spilling over. Without hesitation, he snapped a screenshot of the chat and forwarded it to Slater.
"Look at this! Did you see that? My future sister-in-law literally said she's taking me out for breakfast!"Bobby wrote.

Slater responded immediately, "What the hell, man? Tell me the truth-what did you do to Dr. Willis?"

Instead of answering, Bobby fired off a cute nodding emoji to Verena, and then ignored Slater completely,enjoying how worked up his friend would get.

A moment later, he hopped off the bed and pulled open his closet, already thinking about what to wear.Meeting his future sister-in-law deserved nothing less than a strong first impression.
The following morning arrived. With his schedule lighter than usual, Isaac asked the driver to take him straight to Verena's hotel.
Only a couple of days had passed since they'd seen each other at the bar, but for him, it already felt far longer.
When they neared the hotel, Isaac had the car stop at the restaurant nearby.

He remembered Verena once mentioned that this place served a great breakfast.

Rolling himself inside, Isaac was quickly greeted by a waiter who guided him to a quiet corner and placed a menu in his hands.
His eyes skimmed the list of dishes, but before he could order, a voice drifted through the partition. "Dr.Willis, I'm not late,am l?"

From the other sidecame Verena's gentle reply. "No, I just arrived."

Isaac's fingers curled against the menu. Bobby... with Verena? Why were they meeting?

A frown creased his forehead as confusion settled in.

Noticing his silence, the waiter leaned in and suggested politely,our signature breakfast might interest you."
Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac closed the menu and lowered his voice. "I'm sorry, something urgent came up. I'll have to leave."

Unfazed, the waiter kept his professional smile. "Of course. We'll be happy to serve you next time."

As Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit, he glanced sideways. Through the semi-transparent partition, he caught sight of Bobby and Verena seated across from one another.
His gaze lingered on Bobby, dressed in a sharp suit with neatly styled hair-a look he rarely bothered with unless the event demanded it.

Though Isaac's face stayed composed, his eyes stayed fixed on the pair. They were completely absorbed in conversation, never once noticing him watching.
lsaac's hands pressed harder against the wheels before he pulled his eyes away and rolled out of therestaurant.
Once he was back inside the car, the driver glanced at him through the rearview miror. "Mr. Bennett, shouldwe go straight to Miss Willis' hotel now?
Lifting his gaze only slightly, lsaac gave him a faint look before turning toward the window. "No. Take mehome."
Their eyes met briefly, and the driver shivered, though the car's heater was running strong.He quickly nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."
Moments later, the car pulled away from the curb and left the restaurant behind.
Verena cut into her breakfast, noticing the young man across from her stealing quick glances
Bobby nearly got caught and ducked his head at once.
A laugh slipped from Verena as she asked, "Why are you sneaking looks at me like that?
She added playfully, "Don't tell me it's because l skipped makeup today and look awful.
Bobby shook his head with force. "Not at al! My perfect sis... um... Dr. Wilis, you're honestly the mostbeautiful woman l've ever met- swear l'm telling the truth!"
The words "perfect sister-in-law" nearly spilled before he bit down and stopped himself.
Verena hesitated for a moment, and then let a small smile form. "| believe you." For a few seconds, Bobby couldn't take his eyes off her. Her quiet warmth left him feeling guilty
Inside, his thoughts spiraled. This was the same woman he had gone out of his way to reject, yet she was sokind, so patient-and she had even saved him. Stil, he had slandered her to her future husband and mother-in-law. What kind of monster did that make him?
at most In his mind, a shadowy figure seemed to hover above, tallying up every one of his mistakes. Groaning, Bobby dragged his hands through his hair as his face turned bright red right there at the table.
###Chapter 82 Was The Patient Actually Isaac


With his jaw tight and shoulders squared, Bobby forced himself to meet Verena's gaze, drawing on every ounce of nerve he had left.

"Dr. Willis, I owe you the truth." His expression was grave. "The real reason I came here today was to apologize."

Verena didn't stop to react, but a brief flicker of surprise passed over her striking features as she kept eating.

"I made a mistake before," Bobby admitted, voice steady but regretful. "I judged you unfairly and repeated things I shouldn't have. For that,I'm sorry."

Her brows lifted as she glanced at him. "Oh? And what exactly did you say about me?"

The question broke open the dam, and Bobby's words spilled out faster than he could stop them.

"Let me explain," he began, leaning forward as if pleading his case. "When I first learned you would marry Isaac, I figured I'd ask your sister Kaia about you. But before I even got the chance, I saw a group chat where people were already gossiping about your looks. I thought to myself that Isaac deserved someone with good looks. Right at that moment, Kaia chimed in, implying that you were unattractive and bad-tempered."

He paused briefly, glancing at V/erena's unreadable face, and then went on. "After that, she made you out to be a clueless country girl who never went to college and didn't belong in the city. J-ater, when she sent a surveillance video to the group chat, we were convinced you had plotted to ruin her appearance."

Bobby hurried to add, "But now I know Kaia twisted everything on purpose."

A long breath slipped from Bobby as his shoulders sank. "At the time, I honestly believed you were that kind of woman. I couldn't stand the thought of someone like that marrying Isaac, let alone becoming part of our family. That's why I went behind the scenes and reached out to Kaia. She didn't want youin Isaac's life either, so we teamed up to break off the engagement. But I let myself get played. Kaia handed me an  account and told me it was yours. She pretended to be you and chatted with me using that account.In those conversations, she painted you as loud, crass, and completely unfit. That's where my opinion of you came from, and I texted back a lot of harsh words. It was only last night that I confirmed that account wasn't yours at all."

Some wounds, he knew, didn't heal just because excuses were offered.
"Dr. Willis, I truly regret it," Bobby pressed on, his lips tightening. "I let myself be deceived by Kaia, believed rumors without checking facts, and ended up hurting you."
His head dropped, shame pushing his gaze to the table. "What's worse, I repeated her lies to lsaac and my mother, exaggerating them just to sabotage your engagement.I went too far."
His voice dwindled until it was barely a whisper, his forehead nearly touching the table as the weight of his guilt bore down.
The restaurant stayed quiet, every word sinking into Verena's ears. For a moment, she was surprised-but then her lips curved into a small, almost amused smile, as though she were unbothered.

"Kaia never had a good word for me from the start," she said evenly. "So it doesn't shock me that she spread rumors."

Bobby's head jerked up, brows furrowed, his voice rising. "You're not angry?"

His desperation was plain, his sincerity almost painful, but Verena only smiled and shook her head gently."Why waste energy on people who don't matter? The only thing that matters is that Isaac trusts me."

There was no bitterness in her voice, only a quiet grace that left her looking composed, untouchable, and dignified.
Unlike Kaia's bitter description of her, Verena showed none of that smnall-minded spite, which left Bobby feeling ashamed of himself.

Heat climbed across his face and neck until even his ears flushed red.

Clutching the edge of the table, his knuckles taut, he blurted, "Dr. Willis, I've said awful things about you to both lsaac and my mother. l tried in every way l could to tear the two of you apart. You have every reason tohate me. lf it helps, you can hit me or yell at me-'ll take it, as long as it eases your anger.. as long as youdon't despise me forever.
The remorse in his voice was impossible to miss, though Verena remained calm, her anger nonexistent
"There's no need for that," she replied with quiet seriousness. "People are complicated, and it's natural tohave selfish thoughts, You judaed me throuah Kaia's words, and that was your mistake, but it doesn't shockme."
Her eyes softened as she continued, "Still, Bobby, since l'll be your sister-in-law, let me remind you ofsomething: never rely on gossip to define a person. You only understand someone through time and youiown judgment."
She turned her gaze aside, a faint laugh threading through her words. "And lsaac? From the very start, hisfeelings toward me haven't changed. That means whatever you told him didn't shake him. in fact, youhelped without meaning to-you tested his loyalty for me.
Her remark carried a touch of humor.
The warmth in her smile made Bobby's heart stumble. The way her entire presence shifted when she spokeof'lsaac-so gentle, so genuine-explained everything. Of course she was the right match for lsaac.
But her lightness only deepened his shame. That was real grace, the kind he lacked. Compared to her steadiness, Bobby felt like a clumsy child, painfully immature.
Overcome with embarrassment, he lowered his head again until his forehead nearly touched the table.
Verena'watched him with amusement, and a sudden laugh slipped out.
For the first time, she thought lsaac's younger brother was oddly entertaining-enough to stir a small envyin her heart.
Then Bobby jerked upright, as though struck by a thought
"Oh, right!" he eclaimed. "Dr. Wilis, when you said you were treating a patient with leg paralysis at Slater's place-was it actually lsaac?" When she nodded, his eyes lit up. "So tell me, how is he now? Can his legs really recover?"Verena answered plainly, "it's still the beginning of treatment, so there's no final conclusion yet. But restassured, l'll give it everything l have."
Remembering how she had restored Barrie's leg, Bobby felt certain she could do the same again. Herpromise eased him instantly, and the weight pressing on his chest finally lifted.

###Chapter 83 Where Did You Go
After everything was made clear, Bobby and Verena ate their breakfast in silence.
Though Bobby still carried a trace of awkwardness and shame, sharing a private breakfast with his flawless sister-in-law felt like standing face-to-face with a childhood idol. Naturally, he was thrilled. Once he returned, he would surely brag about this encounter to Slater.

When breakfast was done, they went their separate ways.
Verena returned to the hotel, while Bobby drove back home.

The moment he stepped into the living room, Bobby caught sight of Isaac sitting squarely on the sofa,positioned directly toward the entrance, as though he had been waiting.
A flicker of surprise darted through Bobby's mind. At this hour, Isaac was usually buried in work at the company-why was he still at home?
Before Bobby could open his mouth to greet him, Isaac spoke first. "You're back."
Bobby's lips parted but froze midway, as though strung with silent questions. Had he heard correctly? Isaac showing concern for him? That was something new. Isaac had never cared about his comings andgoings.Even if he stumbled home at dawn after a wild night, Isaac never uttered a word. So why now...
Bobby shifted uneasily, stealing a glance outside as if expecting the skies themselves to signal an unusual omen.

Snapping out of it, he asked carefully, "Isaac, did you need something from me?"
Isaac's gaze lingered briefly on Bobby's overly formal suit, and then slid away. Without answering directly,he gestured at the seat beside him. "Sit."

Bewildered, Bobby obeyed.
Isaac lifted a cup of coffee from the table, his fingers curving in a deliberate grace. He blew across the Fun Merge surface, took a sip, and lowered his eyes. The rising steam blurred his vision, pricking faintly at his eyes.
After a pause, Isaac asked in a voice that seemed calm, almost casual, "Haven't seen you at the company lately. Something troubling you?"
Unlike Isaac's steady tone, Bobby's heart lurched. Troubling him? If Isaac ever discovered that each missed day at the office was spent dealing with his fiancée, Bobby's life would not be worth a dime.
Wanting no part in that danger, Bobby shook his head with all the force he could muster. "No, no, no,nothing at all."
He dared not even entertain such thoughts anymore-better to bury them where they belonged.
Isaac rested his fingers on the table's edge, tapping lightly. Each hollow thud sounded like a slow drumbeat.His gaze lifted, calm but probing.

"Out so early today. Where did you go?"

Bobby felt another chill crawl down his spine. What kind of perilous question was this? Why was Isaac cornering him with words that felt like a knife's edge between life and death?

Thinking of the harsh remarks he had once made about Verena, Bobby dared not confess he had just met her.

Scratching his head, his face flushed crimson, he stammered, "Just... personal matters. Isaac, please don't ask."

If Isaac pressed further, Bobby would have no courage leftto face either him or Verena. After all, hadn't he once warned that if Isaac truly married Verena, he would regret it? And yet-ironically-the one regretting now was him. Wasn't this like swallowing his own pride wwhole?
Bobby's halting reply was a far cry from his usual lighthearted manner.
Isaac's tapping ceased. He studied Bobby's awkwardness-the reddened face, the restless hands.

He knew Bobby's character too well, as his brother had stuck close to him since childhood.
And this expression-lsaac had seen it once before, when Bobby first entered high school and secretly admired a girl.

The resemblance now was uncanny.

Suddenly, Isaac remembered Bobby's strong opposition to his relationship with Verena. And considering his own condition now...

Isaac's Adam's apple shifted as he clasped his hands on his lap, his voice turning grave. "Bobby, I've always told you: the things you should not do, never do; the thoughts you should not harbor, never let them take root; and the desires you cannot force, never force. Before you act, you should consider whether your action will wound others."

The abrupt weight in his tone left Bobby startled. But he quickly concluded Isaac was simply scolding him for his past recklessness. With a forced cheer, he nodded. "I understand. I'l remember your words."

Isaac's brows drew together slightly as he searched Bobby's eyes, as though confirming his sincerity. After a long moment, he looked away, expression unreadable.

Silence thickened across the room.

Bobby admired Isaac more than anyone, yet feared him more than anyone too-especially when he wore that calm,impenetrable mask.

The stillness pressed in, leaving Bobby restless beneath its weight.

Feigning ease, he rose to his feet. "Isaac, if there's nothing else, I'll head to my room."

As he watched his brother's retreating figure ascend the stairs, Isaac narrowed his eyes.

Moments later, his cold voice drifted through the room. "Andres, prepare the car."



After breakfast with Bobby, Verena returned to the hotel and immersed herself in her work.

She was carefully sorting through her materials when the doorbell rang. A flicker of curiosity flashed in her eyes. Not long ago, she would have immediately thought it was isaac. Butever since Laura's uninvited appearance, she could not be sure whether the visitor was friend or foe.
Marking her place on the document, she rose to open the door
The instant the door swung open, a firm hand seized her wrist, and before she could draw breath, she waspulled into lsaac's lap,
Startled yet delighted, Verena gasped, "What are you-mph!"
Her words were swallowed by the cool press of his lips
He guided her hand to his shoulder, circling her waist with one arm, while his other hand skillfully turned the
wheelchair into the room and shut the door with finality.
The entire movement flowed with unbroken rhythm, not a beat wasted.
Though startled at first, Verena quickly melted into his embrace, her arms winding around his neck as shereturned his kiss.
It was urgent, yet tender, stirring a hunger that grew the more she yielded
lt was less a kiss than a search for solace.
Looking down from where she sat, Verena saw him gazing upward, lips pressed with unwavering devotion.lsaac parted her lips, gently catching her tongue between his teeth, drawing from her a shiver and a faintwhimper before he let go
The room was warm with the hotel's heating, and Verena, having come in from outside, wore only a light outfit.
Breaking from her lips, saac lowered his head, his nose brushing against her collarbone and bare shoulderHer slender frame and loose clothing made her seem even more delicate, as though one careless breathmight shatter her.
He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, and then stiled-calming himself as though resisting the pull of impulse
###Chapter 84 Let's Register Our Marriage Tomorrow

In Isaac's eyes, his action was born of jealousy. Utterly absurd.

Yet he had to admit to himself, the green-eyed monster had taken hold of him. He envied his own younger brother, of all people.

Bobby possessed the kind of background and capability that matched his own, along with the advantage of a strong and healthy body. Standing side by side, Bobby seemed far more fitting for Verena. Any woman weighing her options would almost certainly pick Bobby. And yet...

Isaac's arms tightened, holding Verena as though she were his anchor in a storm.

He would never permit anyone to steal her away-not even his own brother. That was a line he could never allow to be crossed.

His lashes, thick and unyielding, drooped and brushed against Verena's skin, leaving her itching, while his uneven breaths fanned over her bare shoulder, summoning tiny goosebumps.

Verena instinctively drew back her shoulders, her slender fingers tracing idle circles in his hair.

Her voice, husky yet soft, broke the stillness. "Isaac, you're different today... what's troubling you?"

She knew him well enough to sense it. That kiss earlier had not belonged to the lsaac she had grown accustomed to after his memory loss. Something had stirred him.
Isaac raised his head and brushed her lips with his own, his breath deep, steady, almost deliberate. Instead of replying, he countered, "Do you have feelings for me?"
His tone was serious, the kind of question not asked in passing.

Verena's lips curved faintly, her eyes carrying quiet mirth. "Why such a sudden question?"

The light in Isaac's eyes dimmed; her answer had evaded him. With deliberate care, he tilted her chin upward,his gaze lingering on her lips-rosy, moist, and impossibly tempoting. Narrowing his eyes slightly, his breath deepened. "Forget it," he murmured. "Whether you do or not, it's
enough that l love you."
And before another word could rise between them, he kissed her again.
This time, it was no gentle touch. He claimed every breath she drew, fierce and demanding, as though he
could tether her soul to his.
He held her so tightly their chests pressed together, each heartbeat a drumbeat of longing. Every motionevery inhalation revealed the cracks in his armor-his deep-rooted insecurity.
At last, their mingled breaths slowed, and silence reclaimed the room.
Verena, lips tingling and numb, gasped for air, her chest heaving before she steadied herself.
When she had gathered her composure, she gently lifted lsaac's head from her shoulder. "lsaac, truly...
what's happening with you?"
At first, she was only curious about his unusual behavior. Now, she needed an answer.
Isaac lowered his gaze, unwiling to unveil the truth. "it's nothing," he said softly. "Jjust some work matters
wearing me down."
His eyes glimmered faintly as he spoke, and Verena frowned. She could see right through it
Work matters wearing him down? For lsaac, who thrived on work like air? That excuse wouldn't convince asoul.
Her lips pressed into a thin line. "You...
Before she could continue, lsaac cut across her words. "Because of your family affairs, our marriage wasdelayed once before."
She blinked, unsure why he suddenly raised the subject, And then he declared, "Let's register our marriagetomorrow."
Not a request. A decision carved in stone. Verena studied him in disbelief, searching for a trace of jest-there was none.
"So suddenly?" she asked.
At that, a flicker of unease flashed through his eyes, his voice stiff. "You don't want to?"
Though caught off guard by his abruptness, once she collected herself, she nodded. "Of course I do."
The following morning, Isaac was already waiting outside Verena's hotel.
After dressing and gathering her documents, she was about to leave when a message from him lit up her phone: "Remember to bring the documents."
Ever since leaving her the previous day, he had been sending the same reminder, as though chanting a mantra, terrified she might have second thoughts.
Standing by the elevator, Verena typed back, "I know. If you scroll through our chat, you'll see you've reminded me more than twenty times already."
When she stepped outside, a black car waited by the roadside.
The driver, spotting her, hurried forward to open the door.
Verena offered a smile of thanks. Once she was seated, Isaac's first words were, "The documents?"
Half amused,half exasperated, she pulled them from her bag. "Why don't you hold onto them yourself?"
He accepted them, and only then did his tension seem to dissolve, a faint smile tuggingat his lips.
The car rolled forward toward the courthouse.
Isaac picked up her ID card, eyes resting on the photo. ID pictures often betrayed their owners-washed-out faces,awkward expressions. But hers was different. Her features were refined, her complexion smooth as porcelain. Dressed in a black jacket, she looked spirited, though the fit was slightly oversized, broadening her shoulders unnaturally-a borrowed garment, no doubt.
His gaze lingered. Verena noticed. Did he remember something? "Something on your mind?" she asked.

Isaac lifted his head, earnest as ever. "Very beautiful."
Verena blinked, taken aback, and then tilted her head. "That's all?"

Sensing her dissatisfaction, he hesitated before adding, "I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you."
Her laughter slipped out softly. He hadn't remembered the past. She nodded, saying nothing more.
Isaac frowned, unsure if her reaction was delight or disappointment.
She turned her gaze toward the window, catching sight of the card in his hand. That very card had been obtained under his insistence. On that day, she'd shown up in only a white blouse. Because ID photos required dark clothing, Isaac had wordlessly stripped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Seeing him scrutinize the photo a moment ago, she had thought he might have recalled a fragment of that moment.But perhaps... memories required patience.

Soon, the car drew to a stop before the courthouse.

They got out, Verena pushing his wheelchair forward.
Inside, the hall was quiet, with few people about. Following the staff's guidance, they filled in their forms.

Just as the final step approached, Isaac caught hushed voices behind him.

"Isn't it strange, marrying a man with a disability?" a man whispered.
His companion nudged him sharply, murmuring, "Shh, they'll hear you," before the two stifled laughter.
###Chapter 85 Public Declaration


Verena bent down beside Isaac, brushed a quick kiss across his cheek, and teased, "Snap out of it, dreamer.We're almost up."

The sound of her voice pulled him from his drifting thoughts, and when he turned toward her, a quiet smile spread across his face.

Their paperwork was finalized soon after.

An attendant handed over their marriage documents, and the pair left the courthouse with them clutched in their hands.

Verena lifted her copy proudly and nudged Isaac to raise his as well so they could snap a picture together.

Grinning brightly, she announced, "From this moment on, Mr. Bennett, you belong to me as my husband."

A strange haze lingered over Isaac as they left the courthouse, the reality of it sinking in slowly.

Everything felt unreal until Verena's playful declaration grounded him. Maybe their choice had been sudden,but there was no part of him that regretted it.

His head dipped, and a genuine smile curved his lips.

When he looked back up, Verena was already tapping away on her phone. He chuckled and asked, "What are you plotting now?"

Verena held her phone close to his face with a sly grin, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I'm telling the world,obviously."

On the glowing screen was her newest post: "Married to Mr. Bennett," with the proud photo of their marriage documents beneath it.

There was a light in Isaac's eyes, warm and full, and his chest tightened with something sweet, as if his heart had softened into syrup, slow and thick and impossible to resist. Pointing at the screen, he cleared his throat lightly. "Mind sending me that picture?"
Catching his meaning at once, Verena slipped the phone into her pocket, her expression deliberately puzzled. She pretended to frown and asked, "And what exactly do you need it for?"
The question caught him off guard, though it only took a second to realize she was toying with him.
A faint blush touched his face as he blinked and answered softly, "I want to post it myself."
His words slipped out so softly that the awkwardness in his tone was impossible to miss.
Heat rushed to Isaac's ears, and the sight of it sent Verena into a fit of laughter she couldn't contain.
She slipped behind him, leaned close enough for her breath to brush his ear, and whispered, "I already sent it over. Take a look at your phone."
Then, without waiting for a response, she gave the wheelchair a gentle push forward.
Pulling out his phone, Isaac saw a fresh notification waiting for him with her name attached.
Since he had silenced his device earlier in the courthouse, the message had gone unnoticed until now.
Tapping it open, he found the photo she had taken, and for the first time, he composed a social media post of his own.
His update read, "Fromn this moment, Verena, I am your husband."
The photo of their marriage documents stood proudly beneath the words.
Within moments, Shoildon's upper circles lit up with activity.
In the exclusive chat for the Shoildon's socialites, screenshots of Isaac's post spread like wildfire.
"Kailee, didn't your husband just strike a deal with Bennett Group? Were you aware of this?"
"You're kidding!"
"The Bennett family announced an alliance not long ago, and now they're officially married? That was fast!"
The chat turned into chaos, so much so that Kailee White's reply vanished under the flood of messages.

It wasn't until after the group chat was temporarily muted by the administrator that the group members noticed her reply. "I'm not really sure. My husband told me the wedding got pushed back, but obviously there's more to it than that."

When the group chat was unmuted again, the flood of messages started all over.

Inside the group chat for Shoildon's businessmen, new messages popped up one after another.

"Anyone else see the news about Isaac tying the knot?"

"I did! Thought my eyes were playing tricks from staring at reports all day."

"His decision makes no sense to me."

"Didn't he just move against the Willis family? I figured the wedding was canceled-so how did the registration suddenly happen?"

"The Willis family doesn't measure up to the Bennett family at all. Their eldest daughter is just a puppet.No way Isaac would want her."

"You're getting it wrong. The fact that he posted the marriage himself proves he values the Willis family's eldest daughter."

Meanwhile, in the wealthy young people's group chat, Isaac's post was screenshotted and sent around nonstop.

Shock filled the thread, with half the group dropping nothing but strings of exclamation marks.

"Kaia, can you believe it? Verena actually signed with Isaac!"

"Are my eyes broken,or did that really happen?"

"The girl from that nowhere town actually managed to land him."

"A country nobody ended up as Isaac's wife, and I can't even figure out why. What do I lack compared to her? And of all things, this is the very first post he's ever made! Ugh!" "Doesn't matter. She's probably nothing special to look at."

"Can you believe it? The golden boy ended up picking that woman. What a disgrace!"

Kaia scrolled through the flood of messages without typing a word.

Reading the insults aimed at Verena should have thrilled her, but Isaac's public declaration gnawed at her pride. Rage flared so strong she nearly hurled her phone, because deep down she knew lsaac was serious about this marriage. The certainty of it ate her alive with jealousy.

Across the chat, Slater's eyes narrowed as he read the comments, and he blurted out, "Unbelievable. Kaia's lies really kicked up a mess. How dare they drag Dr. Willis through the dirt?"

Closing the app with finality, Slater wasted no time and dialed Bobby directly.

The line connected before the first ring even ended.

"I'm losing it right now!" Slater exclaimed.

"Me too!" Bobby's voice echoed his frustration in perfect sync.

"Tell me, are wegoing to defend our goddess or not?" said Bobby quickly, his words tumbling out in a rush.

Slater didn't hesitate. "Damn right we are. Every single one of those people trashing Dr. Willis is going to regret it. And Kaia? She won't get away with it either."

Bobby's tone sharpened. "So, what's the plan?"

"Simple," Slater retorted. "Didn't you brag yesterday about snapping that gorgeous side profile of Dr. Willis?Hand it over. I need it now."

Bobby had guarded that picture the day before, brushing off Slater's demands. But now that it could serve a purpose, he sent it without complaint.

The moment the photo appeared on his screen, Slater's fingers flew across his keyboard, hammering out the words for a bold social media post.

"People keep underestimating Verena, but I've had enough of the nonsense. Time to clear the air. The truth is simple-Dr. Verena Wilis was the one who healed my grandfather's leg. Kaia's claim that she did itherself? Utter fiction. And honestly, who in their right mind would fall for such a lie?
Let's be real--those who act like fragile saints in front of others often have the darkest secrets. Reputationmatters, and l don't need to explain further. This so-called kind and gentle girl? She slanders her own sisterspreads lies, and pretends she's innocent, Tell me, Kaia, doesn't your conscience scream at you?Here's another thing. Some of you have been calling Verena unattractive, unpolished, just a country girwithout brains or background., Yet world-class specialists failed to solve my grandfather's condition, and shepulled it off. Does that sound lilke ignorance to you? Don't make me laugh. And about her looks-there's nodebate. Take one glance at this photo and you'll understand exactly why l call her a goddess."Slater attached the stunning side-profile shot of Verena and, with no hesitation, pressed the publish button
###Chapter 86 i'm Not Buying That Story
When lsaac announced his marriage online, it had already sent shockwaves through high society, setting off
a flurry of excited chatter among the elite.
So the moment Slater made his own post, the conversations exploded without missing a beat
"Wow, can you believe this?"
'ls this actually happening, or did someone mess up the details?
'I'm so stunned by this announcement, l almost dropped my phone!'
"ls something in the air today? lsaac just posted about his wedding, Kaia's innocent act got blown apart, andthe truth came out that Verena puled off a miracle for Barrie's leg. it's like every secret dropped at once!"
"Hold up, you're saying Verena really fixed Barrie's leg?"
"For ages, everyone claimed nothing could be done for Barrie's condition. Who knew Verena had this kindof talent?"
"Hang on, let's not overlook what's right in front of us. Take another look at that photo-is that reallyVerena? ls this the 'just alright' girl Kaia talked about? lf that's 'alright, sign me up!"
"Anyone calling Verena 'alright' clearly needs their eyes checked. Kaia must not have been payingattention."
'Now it all makes sense. No matter what rumors people spread about Verena, saac never budged. lf i foundsomeone with her looks and ability, i'd want to marry her, too!"
'So if that's how things are, then Kaia's been misleading us the whole time. Someone who can cure Barriecan't be just a small-town practitioner. On top of that, Verena is obviously gorgeous, and Kaia tried to makeus think otherwise. And honestly, who believes Verena never went to college? i'm not buying that story at
all "Imagine a sister starting rumors about her own family. It's wild how you can think you know someone and be so wrong!"

"Damn! I just remembered something huge!"

The comment sections exploded with replies, filled with question marks and demands for more information.

"Come on, out with it! Don't leave us guessing!"

The message came through instantly. "Didn't Kaia claim in the group chat that Verena was pretending to be a Pine Hill University graduate, calling her a liar? Now, with everything coming to light, it really makes you wonder who's telling the truth. If Verena managed to cure Barrie, maybe she did graduate from Pine Hill."

People jumped in, agreeing right away. "Honestly, you might have figured it out!"

Scrolling through Slater's post and the flood of incoming comments, Kaia felt her mood sour instantly.

By choosing to share it online, Slater had dragged her into the spotlight and left her to face the fallout like a criminal paraded before a crowd.

Every secret she'd tried to keep was now exposed in front of everyone, and Kaia, whose pride relied so much on her reputation,could barely stomach it.

Slater's decision to air the truth so brazenly left her in disbelief, her dignity stomped on in public.

Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles paled, resentment flaring in her eyes despite the color draining from her cheeks.

A sudden string of notification chimes interrupted her thoughts as so-called friends reached out.

Each message she read stung a little more, reminding her how quickly these people clung to whoever seemed powerful at the moment.

"Did you see what Slater posted? Is it true or not?"

"You weren't jealous enough to start rumnors about Verena, were you?"

"Why haven't you said anything about Slater's announcement, Kaia?" Kaia clenched her teeth so tightly the grinding noise cut through the silence like a warning.

The ones who once rushed to praise her, clinging to thin friendships and chasing approval when they believed she had saved Barrie, had now changed their tune the second things went wrong. Not one of them stayed loyal. They were nothing but hypocrites dressed up as friends.

Anger surged through Kaia as her grip tightened around her phone, her entire body shaking. The fury boiled over, and she snapped, "You wretches!"

Without a second thought, she shut off the screen and threw the phone to the floor with as much force as she could muster.
###Chapter 87 Come In And Take A Bath


Kaia's chest rose and fell in sharp bursts, every breath ragged and loud. Fury widened her eyes, and her fists clenched so tight that her nails pierced skin she no longer felt. The fire in her gaze burned far hotter than any pain her body registered.

Hatred thundered inside her, echoing like a storm without end. Verena's name pounded through her mind-over and over, relentless.

Each repetition carried the same venom, as though uttering the name alone could erase Verena from existence. It was always the same. Whenever Verena entered her world, something precious was stolen away.

Her hatred had no limits.

Verena had stolen their parents' attention with ease. Verena had been the one to heal Barrie's injured leg.Verena had won Isaac's affection without even trying, while Kaia had hidden her love for him for years. Why had he given his heart so freely to her rival? And now, Slater's defense of Verena's reputation had sealed her humiliation, parading Verena's brilliance while reducing Kaia to a pitiful joke.

A wave of helplessness swept over her, and she collapsed onto the bed, clutching the sheets with desperate strength.

Her teeth sank into the inside of her lip, the sting of blood flooding her mouth with bitterness.

Through the rage, her eyes gleamed with a dangerous resolve. She would never surrender.

If Verena's claim to fame was curing Barrie's leg, so what? Against Evelyn Rowe,the world-renowned medical legend, Verena's so-called brilliance would crumble.

Wendell had assured her that when Evelyn arrived at Acorith College of Medicine to give a lecture, a seat would be kept aside with her name on it.

No price was too high, and no effort too great-Kaia had resolved that she would claim the role of Evelyn's final apprentice. Once that happened, she would shine across the medical world just as Evelyn had. And really, what did Verena's degree from Pine Hill University matter then?

Bloodshot eyes gleamed with obsession, and Kaia's lips stretched into a smile that carried nothing but malice.



Her mind spun with ambition. Years of training under Evelyn would give her the credentials to pursue a doctorate at PineHill University itself, and the glory of being Evelyn's chosen student would crush whatever spotlight Verena held.

Kaia muttered to herself, "Those mocking me today will kneel and beg for my recognition someday."

.-.

Isaac slipped his phone into his pocket after uploading the post.

Verena guided him into the waiting car. The driver swung the door closed, climbed into his seat, and opened his mouth to ask for directions when Verena spoke first. "Take me back to the hotel, please."

"Understood," the driver replied with quiet respect, turning the wheel as the car eased onto the road.

From the back seat, Isaac's voice cut through, edged with the faintest irritation. just registered our marriage, and you still want to return to the hotel?"

Anyone else might have missed the shift in tone, but the driver had worked under him long enough to notice.

Without hesitation, he pulled over and stayed silent, making himself invisible.

Isaac pressed into the seatback, his eyes settling on Verena. His brow creased, and the hand on his lap tightened into a fist.

Amusement flickered across her face, and a laugh slipped free. That tiny habit of his, clenching his hand whenever anger or frustration stirred, had never left him, not even after losing his memories.

Isaac's eyes narrowed the moment her laugh rang out. To Verena, his look carried a silent protest that said, "We're already married, and you're still planning to walk away? Given my state,how could you laugh at me like that?"

Her amusement faded quickly as she steadied herself against the seat and leaned in toward him. "The registry gave us papers, yes, but that isn't a wedding. If I moved into your house right now, it wouldn't sit right.What would your mother think of me?"

Those words, full of reason rather than rejection, softened the edge of his mood.

His gaze dropped, taking in the liveliness of her expression. Almost without thought, he reached up, lifted her chin lightly, and said with a teasing curve of his lips, "So you're worried about my mom's opinion?"

The gesture caught heroff guard, leaving her lips parted in brief surprise.

Recovering quickly, Verena flashed a sly smile, her eyes glinting with playful charm. "Of course I am.Caring about her means I'm caring about you."

Her tone was bright, the kind of sweetness that tugged at his chest as if daring him not to give in.

Isaac fixed his eyes on Verena, the look heavy with curiosity that burned deep. Her playful manner was obvious, carrying the edge of a flirt. Could it be that beneath all the things she held close, there was also a real place in her heart for him?

Realization struck him hard, a rush of warmth igniting beneath his calm exterior. She cared about him-enough to care about how his family might see her.

The thought amused him, and his eyes gleamed with quiet laughter.

He let go of her chin and turned toward the window, pressing his fist lightly to his lips as though that could keep the laugh inside.

Verena tilted her head, catching the smile he couldn't quite hide. With a playful poke at his arm, she said,"Why bother holding it back? If you're happy, then laugh. Don't make me drag it out of you."

His lips betrayed him, curving upward even as he tried to resist.

Clearing his throat, Isaac caught her hand before she could poke him again. His voice lowered, tender but firm."What happens in my home is up to me. No one else gets a say. When you're with me, don't waste a thought on my mother or anyone else. Do as you like."

After a sort silence, his voice shifted. "Forget it. I've got a place in the Seraphina Villas. I live there alone.How about coming there with me?"

Traditional expectations never carried much weight for Verena. Since the papers were already signed,sharing a home seemed natural. MMore importantly, she had something planned for him tonight.

Her decision came after a moment's thought. "Alright, but we'Il need to swing by the hotel first. I want to grab mythings."

Seeing her agree instantly eased the tension in Isaac's mood.

"Good," he said with a short nod before turning forward and instructing the driver. "Take us to the hotel first."

The driver acknowledged the order and guided the car smoothly into the traffic.

Back at the hotel, Verena packed while the staff gathered her luggage and brought it downstairs.

Her belongings were simple-a single suitcase and a few pieces of medical equipment.

With everything loaded into the trunk, the driver pulled away, steering them toward Seraphina Villas.

Located in the finest district of Shoildon, the villa sat quietly apart from the city's noise, an oasis surrounded by luxury.

The room carried an understated sense of luxury, and the wide spotless windows, gleaming in the light,revealed the touch of frequent professional care.

"If something about the place bothers you, let my assistant know. Adjustments can be made anytime," Isaac said evenly.

Verena turned back to him with an easy smile. "That won't be necessary.It already feels perfect to me."
 
Then her expression shifted with sudden curiosity. "Where's the bathroom?" Isaac pointed casually toward the hall. "Straight ahead, then left."

He directed her to the guest bath, assuming she would prefer more space before settlingin fully.

With a small nod, Verena carried a bag toward the bathroom, its contents hidden from his view.

Alone in the living room, Isaac poured himself a glass of water and drank slowly. Minutes passed in silence,and he finally leaned forward to call out when her voice drifted from behind the bathroom door."Isaac,come in and take a bath!"
###Chapter 88 Kiss Me If You Want


A sharp clink rang out as Isaac's grip slipped, sending the glass tumbler toppling onto the coffee table with a noisy crash. Water splashed out, soaking into his trousers and leaving a dark, unmistakable patch.

Color rushed to Isaac's cheeks as he scrambled to retrieve the glass. He cleared his throat, pretending nothing was wrong, and answered Verena, "N-no, that's alright. I'll take a bath on my own later."

Marriage paperwork might have been finished, but that did not make it easy for lsaac to let go of his self-doubt or bare his vulnerabilities so quickly, even for something as simple as a shared bath.

The house wNas quiet, which made it easy for Verena to catch every/bit of the scene outside the bathroom.

A suspicion grew in her mind that lsaac had missed her meaning entirely, and she decided to have some fun with him.

Moving toward the bathroom door, she folded her arms and leaned against the frame. Her lips curled in a teasing smile as she watched him closely, her eyes bright and mischievous.

"Isaac, the bath is ready. We just got married today, and you're already planning to leave me hanging? Isn't that just a little bit heartless?" she said, her voice softening as she stretched out the last part like a playful complaint.

From the very beginning, Verena always seemed to know the perfect way to keep him off balance. That was what Isaac believed.

Isaac knew his own body's limits better than anyone. Even though Verena had seen the damage to his legs countless times, he still felt uneasy about letting her see all of him. There was more to it, too. Living with the reality of his condition, he dreaded the idea of exposing his physical shortcomings, especially when it came to intimacy. The thought only deepened his sense of shame.

"Isaac, come on, don't leave me waiting. The water is going to turn cold soon. Are you really going to let me shiver in here?" Verena called out, her tone playful yet persistent. Refusing her seemed impossible, but Isaac wanted to protest. Looking up, he caught sight of her open expression and gentle concern in her eyes. In that moment, every argument vanished, and he realized there was no way he could turn her down.

Isaac set his jaw, drawing in a breath for courage, and guided his wheelchair toward the bathroom.

Verena caught sight of him coming closer, one eyebrow arching upward while her lips curled into a mischievous grin.

When Isaac rolled inside, the scent of herbs greeted him, sharp and comforting. Steam drifted above the bath,hinting at the heat within.

For a moment, Isaac stared in confusion, and then the truth dawned on him and his cheeks reddened in embarrassment.

"Is this for treatment?" he asked, his voice quiet.

Laughter sparkled in Verena's eyes as she nodded, her face all wide-eyed innocence. "Of course. What else did you think I asked you to comein here for?"

Isaac's ears burned as he pressed his lips together,staying silent.

Amusement flickered in Verena's expression as she circled behind him, her arms slipping around his neck.Cool fingertips crept under his suit jacket, stopping at the first button of his shirt, playing with it teasingly.

A gentle chill passed through the thin cotton and settled on Isaac's chest, sending his Adam's apple moving up and down as he swallowed.

Every muscle in Isaac's body tensed, his neck stretching as he tried to block out the cold touch against his warm skin.

Verena leaned in close, her lips grazing the edge of his ear as she spoke with a light laugh in her voice."Surely you didn't think I invited you in here for something romantic, did you? Isaac, I just moved in, and you're already misbehaving?"

The first button was undone, and her hand inched further, starting to undo another button, but Isaac caught her hand and pulled her down so she landed squarely on his lap.

"Enough, Verena. You have to stop teasing me," he said, his breath growing heavier, voice low and warning.

Finally, seeing his face flushed and serious, Verena softened.

Her forehead rested gently against his as she whispered, "You don't need to hold back, Isaac. Kiss me if you want. It'll help you heal, you know."

No explanation was needed. Isaac understood perfectly what she meant about his health.

Isaac's grip tightened around her wrist as he brought his other hand up to cradle the back of her head.Suddenly, he leaned in, his lips claiming hers in a kiss that started soft but quickly grew deeper.

Before long, the bathroom was filled with the sound of their breathing, each moment more heated than the last.

After what felt like ages, quiet settled around them.

Breathing hard, Verena slumped against his shoulder, her mind spinning with disbelief. She had only told him not to hold back his feelings-she hadn't expected him to take her so literally.

Isaac's arms slid around her waist, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head, eyes lowered in affection.

Once she gathered herself, Verena moved to help Isaac out of his clothes, supporting him as she guided him into the waiting tub.

Steam rose from the water, which was tinged with the rich brown color of medicinal herbs, hiding anything beneath the surface from view.

That detail allowed Isaac a moment of relief, easing some of the self-consciousness he felt.

After soaking in the bath, heat colored Isaac's cheeks and sweat clung to his skin.

Verena lifted him gently, wrapping him in a soft robe as he reached for the wheels of his chair to leave.She placed a gentle hand on his arm to stop him.

"Hold on, you're not done yet. The herbal bath is just the start. You need a massage next, and after that, a special treatment. Let's begin with your legs."

Taking a seat nearby, she loosened the robe and began working her hands over his legs, her fingers skillfully pressing and kneading each spot.

Her touch moved up from his ankle, pausing at key points that might help his body heal and regain strength.

Even though his legs were numb, watching her careful, attentive movements made Isaac's throat tighten, his Adam's apple moving twice as he gripped the sides of the chair.

Sweat dotted his forehead by the end of the massage. Once finished, Verena rolled his chair toward the elevator and together they rode upstairs.

As the doors opened, she glanced his way and asked, "Which one is our room?"

Hearing her say "our room" sent a small shock through Isaac. The simple words made it clear-she had no plans for separate bedrooms.

A subtle smile threatened to break through Isaac's tightly closed lips. Her words made it clear she had forgotten his warning from the very first day they met. Deciding not to bring it up, he chose to let it slip from his mind as well.

A nod toward the far end of the hall signaled the answer. "Our room is at the very end," he remarked.

Verena, walking just behind him, missed the way happiness flickered across his face.

They entered together, and Verena moved quickly to help lsaac onto the bed before reaching into her medical kit for a set of needles, ready to begin the special therapy.

Throughout the treatment, she checked in as always, asking him what he could feel.

As usual, Isaac shook his head. However, this time, with warmth lingering from the herbal soak, he failed to notice the faint burning that flickered through his legs.

Once the last needle was removed, Verena neatly packed away her tools.

Isaac grabbed his phone. A glance at it revealed a long list of missed calls waiting on the screen.
The number surprised him-more than a dozen, and every one came from Bobby.Isaac's brow creased as he stared at the notifications
Opening the chat app, he found message after message piled up from Bobby, nearly twenty in all. Each onerepeated the same thing: "You and Dr. Willis got married!"
Isaac pressed his lips together again, puzzled by Bobby's excitement over the news.Casting a look at Verena, lsaac's eyes danced with amusement as he typed his reply to Bobby, "She's yoursister-in-law now. You'd better get used to it."
Bobby could hardly believe what he was reading. lsaac was clearly acting smug about itDeciding to push back, Bobby responded deliberately, "Not happening.Two words summed up his rebellious mood. Only behind the safety of the screen could Bobby get away withthat attitude. Deep down, he knew his place-timid in person, but unexpectedly daring when hiding behind screen.
###Chapter 89 Let's Sleep


As evening drew its curtain, a family helper arrived to prepare dinner. After the meal, she quietly tidied the kitchen and slipped away.

In the master bedroom stood a computer desk, a perfect spot for working before drifting into dreams.

Verena held two books on neurology, their spines bent and corners worn-clear footprints of constant use by their owner.

Pointing toward the desk, she asked softly, "Isaac, may l use your computer?"

Isaac,leaning against the headboard with a book in hand, nodded with calm ease."Suit yourself."

Verena answered his nod with a smile, and then seated herself at the desk, meticulously sorting out medical cases akin to lsaac's condition.

Time ticked away unhurriedly, the room hushed except for the rustle of turning pages and the steady tapping of keys.

Isaac's book lay open on the very first page, while the sound of flipping paper came from Verena's corner.

His gaze lingered on her back, absentminded, as though his thoughts had wandered far.

The house had a proper study, yet she had chosen to remain here, in the same room with him.

He sat reading at the bedside, while she worked earnestly within his sightline.

The moment carried the air of a dream-a fleeting glimpse of what ordinary couples might call daily life,something Isaac once thought beyond his reach.

And yet, by grace or chance... the quiet murmur of paper and the rhythmic clatter of keys testified that it was no mirage.

A faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes softening as they rested warmly on Verena. Just then, Verena stretched her arms overhead, stood up, and was about to turn around.
Startled, Isaac, as though caught red-handed, dropped his gaze and buried himself in the book, pretending to read.
Fresh from her plunge into intricate medical notes, Verena failed to notice Isaac's sudden shift in demeanor.
Rubbing her neck, she murmured, "I'Il go take a shower. If you're tired, go ahead and sleep."
"Okay," Isaac replied quickly. Only after his word left his lips did he realize she had already stepped into the adjoining bathroom.
Take a shower...
Soon after, the steady sound of water reached him.
A thought flared in Isaac's mind, and with it came a rush of heat; his ears burned crimson.
He couldn't help the imagination. Until now, no one else had ever set foot inhis private bathroom.
And now... someone who stirred his heart had entered.
The rooms at Seraphina Villas were smaller than those at the Bennett Mansion. On this quiet night, the sound of running water seemed as though it poured right beside him.
He could even picture whether Verena was rinsing shampoo or washing with body wash each time the water paused.
Isaac swallowed, closed his eyes, drew in deep breaths, and then exhaled slowly befóre reopening them.
He looked down again, only to see the corner of his book crumpled, though he couldn't recall when his hand had done it.
Then,without warning, the bathroom door swung open, and steam drifted out like a light veil.
Verena emerged, her hair already dried. Silken strands cascaded down her back, and she wore a light set of pajamas.
Carrying a fresh fragrance with her, she walked to the bed. Isaac drew in another breath, realizing only now how agreeable his own body wash smelled.
"You're still awake? What's so captivating in that book?"

Her voice reeled him back from his thoughts. Isaac looked up to see Verena leaning forward to peek at his reading.

As she drew closer, he hastily smoothed out the wrinkled page with his hand.

Her slight bend brought her long hair spilling over her shoulders, brushing against his nose, her breath warm upon his arm-sending an involuntary shiver through him. Isaac had never been this near to another woman,nor had he felt a tension that strung every nerve taut.

Abruptly, with a snap, he shut the book.
"Oh, nothing special-just skimming. Let's sleep," he said quickly, placing the book on the bedside table before lying flat, steadying himself with both hands.

 ###Chapter 90 How Many Relationships Have You Been In Before
Verena arched an eyebrow in slight puzzlement, brushing the thought aside like dust on a shelf.
She slipped into bed from the far side, switched off the lamp, and asked lightly, "I've grown used to sleeping with a night light on. WouId that bother you?"
She knew Isaac never minded a light in the past, but that was before memory loss rewrote parts of him.Since time had passed, she thought it wise to confirm whether his old habits still held.

Isaac paused, caught unprepared by her question. Darkness had always been his ally; when waking from a nightmare, the blackness convinced him the terrors were nothing but shadows that would scatter with the dawn.

After a brief silence, his answer came low and steady."I don't mind."
"I guessed as much." Verena's brows lifted as she smiled and lay down beside him.

The heater hummed, filling the room with warmth. Their clothes were light, and when Verena shifted, Isaac's arm brushed against the lingering heat of her body.
The mingling of coolness and warmth made for a paradoxical harmony that unsettled him.

His breath caught; he fixed his eyes on the ceiling, lying still as if life had pressed pause.
Though his body was stiff, his thoughts tumbled restlessly.
The girl he cherished lay right beside him.

He could feel the delicate press of her fingers against his arm and inhale the faint fragrance of her hair.His throat worked, his teeth bit the inside of his cheek, and his breathing grew heavier without his notice.Seeing his blank gaze pinned to the ceiling, Verena understood his unease. With playful intent, she propped herself on her elbow, leaned closer, and asked, "Can't sleep?"
Her hand came to rest on his chest, her forehead brushing his chin, her breath fanning gently as if testing
his composure.
That sudden nearness made lsaac hyperaware-the warmth and softness pressing into him turned everybreath into a labor.
Awkward tension crept between them
When he still offered no reply, Verena reached to caress his cheek tenderly. "Why so quiet?
Her palm, soft as velvet, stroked his face as though he were a treasured companion.
Isaac lowered his eyes to study her intently
He was a storm of nerves, yet she was calm, almost serene.
Any ordinary girl, lying so close to someone she admired, would flush or falter.
But Verena remained composed.
Even sharing a bed, she carried herself with poise, still teasing him without hesitation.
To lsaac, it hinted at someone well-versed in matters of love.
A frown touched his brow as a sudden realization struck-he had never once asked about Verena's romanticpast.
At first, he found it needless. After al, their union began from mutual interests of their families
But now, curiosity gnawed at him.
Instead of replying to her teasing, lsaac murmured, "Can l ask you something?'Verena's eyes lit with interest. "Of course."
He hesitated inwardly. Would prying into her past make him appear insecure?
Would she mistake him for being improper, too narrow-minded?
And yet silence felt unbearable. She was not only the woman he liked but also the one he called wife.

He could not pretend indifference.

After wrestling with himself, he finally asked, hesitant yet firm, "Verena... how many relationships have you been in before?"

The room slipped into silence.

Isaac's fists tightened, a sheen of sweat dampened his palms. His gaze locked on her as though his very heartbeat awaited her reply.

Regret pricked him instantly-what if she disliked the question?

Catching his solemn expression, Verena chose to break the tension with a touch of humor. She teased lightly, "Three or four, maybe."

###Chapter 91 First Love

"Three or four?" Isaac repeated,a hint of disbelief making his voice climb.
His reaction gave away just how startled he felt.
Verena,quick to read between the lines, caught on to his question before he even finished asking about her dating history.
Jealousy had always been Isaac's trademark.
Choosing mischief over honesty, Verena decided to play with him, curious about what emotions she might stir up.
She watched as his brow knitted in disbelief, fighting back a smile while she kept the game going.
With a breezy nod, she replied, "That's right." She tossed in, almost carelessly, "But none of them lasted long. They were just temporary flings."
Isaac was shocked. Temporary flings! Did that mean those past relationships never mattered to her? And was he, in her eyes, just another fleeting chapter?
The thought left Isaac torn-on one hand, he was relieved there hadn't been real feelings before him; on the other, he wondered if she'd ever allow herself to care deeply for anyone at all.
And given his condition, he was unlike any of her former boyfriends.
He felt his eyes sting, turning his face away so she wouldn't see the emotion.
For a few moments, neither of them spoke. Verena looked up just in time to notice him angled away, hair falling over his eyes and hiding what he felt.
Knowing how possessive he could be, she could guess he was sulking.
Even so, she acted as if nothing was wrong, biting her lip and leaning gently into his arms. "Does it bother you that I've dated around?"

Her words came out fragile, as if she'd just been wounded.

A tight line formed across Isaac's mouth as he held back whatever he wanted to say.

Though he was the one hurting, all it took was that soft hint of pain in her voice for his heart to melt.

Something about it only drew him in closer.

Isaac wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, and his slightly trembling hands gave away the storm he tried to hide.

He rushed to reassure her before she could misunderstand. "No, that's not it. It's all about jealousy, and I'm jealous because I care about you-that's all."

For the first tie since his memory loss, Verena heard him put his feelings into words, jealousy and all.

His love ran deeper than she'd ever guessed.

Warmth flooded her chest, and her lips curled up in a tender smile."I get it," she whispered.

After a quiet pause, Isaac rested his chin on her shoulder and, unable to hold back, asked in a stubborn whisper, "So, none of those men ever truly mattered to you?"

Hearing the caution in his voice made Verena laugh. "I was only messing with you. There weren't three or four relationships at all."

The admission caught Isaac off guard. He'd braced himself for the worst, but as her words sank in, his tense expression softened, and relief washed over him.

A quiet joy spread through him, deeper than he expected-he couldn't keep from feeling pleased inside.

That was when it hit Isaac just how much he wanted Verena all to himself.

But the happiness was short-lived.

Meeting his gaze with a secretive smile, Verena continued, "Actually, it was just one." She let the words hang, the look in her eyes loaded with meaning. Isaac, caught up in the revelation, missed the nuance completely.

Stunned, he could only process the reality-one relationship, not several. That single truth struck him harder than any number ever could.

Having one person who mattered most changed everything.

His mood dropped, and his reply barely carried above a whisper. "Was that your first love?"

She let her fingers wander gently across his brow, tracing down to his temple, answering softly,"You could say that."

A flicker of memory crossed her features. Teasing, she added, "We never made it official, but the feelings were always there."

Those words-feelings always there-stuck with him.

Sadness clouded Isaac's eyes. Bitterness burned at the back of his throat, a tightness settling in his chest.

He couldn't help but wonder: if fate had brought them together sooner, would she have ever belonged to someone else?

Maybe, if they had met earlier, they would have been each other's only love.

But he knew there was no changing the past.

An ache flared in his chest, spreading like wildfire, and his limbs turned heavy.

He tried to play it off, muttering, "Alright, I get it," before falling silent and convincing himself he'd let it go.

Sharing abed with a woman, a light still burning, was a first for him-and surprisingly, it brought comfort.

He expected unease, but sleep came easily. For once in a long time, nightmares left him alone.

Verena woke with the sun, freshened up, and noticed Isaac stirring. She crossed the room to offer him a hand out of bed. Catching her by the wist, Isaac gently stopped her. "Don't trouble yourself, Verena. I'll have Jacob help me instead."
He couldn't stand letting her see any sign of weakness.
Typically,Jacob arrived a good thirty minutes before Isaac woke, always sanding by to help him out of bed and handle the morning routine.
"You might have to adjust today," Verena said with a gentle smile. "Jacob's waiting downstairs. I asked him to giveus some space this morning."
A flicker of surprise crossed Isaac's face. Before he could speak, she added in a soft, reassuring tone,"We're married now, Isaac. Let me take care of you."
Her kindness made his heart flutter.
Suddenly, the shadows of her past didn't matter so much. Whatever love she'd known before didn't change the fact that he was the one sharing every sunrise with her now.
She helped him into his wheelchair, waited while he got ready, and then guided him toward the elevator so they could head downstairs together for breakfast.
Midway through their morning, Isaac's phone started ringing-Cayden's name lit up on the screen.
Isaac didn't bother stepping away and took the call with Verena nearby. "Morning, Cayden. What's going on?"
On the other end, Cayden's enthusiasm was hard to miss. "Isaac, you won't believe what I just learned. After Slater made that post, I contacted the Lyons family. Turns out, Verena really did fix Barrie's leg! Who knew she had it in her? She really did graduate from Pine Hill University after all."
Cayden let out a happy laugh. "Looks like everyone who doubted your choice owes you an apology.Your wife is a real gem."
The pride in Cayden's voice was unmistakable.
Isaac found himself grinning at the mention of "wife," a new lightness filling his chest. His mood visibly brightened.

Across the table, Verena spread jam over her toast. Isaac couldn't stop looking at her, lost in thought until she noticed and glanced his way, confused.

He shot her a warm smile and answered Cayden, "Told you, she never needed to pretend."

Verena, seeing he was on a call, simply took a slow bite, her curiosity unspoken.

Sensing Isaac's protectiveness, Cayden admitted, "Alright, I take back what I said before. If Verena can heal Barrie's leg, she's more capable than any of us gave her credit for. Makes me hopeful about your own recovery."

Isaac's reply was soft and noncommittal."Mm."

A beat later, Cayden's excitement bubbled up again. "By the way, Stevie's back from Clokron this afternoon.He wants to take us out to dinner tonight to celebrate his return. Leonardo will join us, too."

###Chapter 92 | Want To Hide You
Stevie Wagner had been rooted in Clokron ever since high school.

Meanwhile, Cayden and Leonardo Gibson had remained in Shoildon, while lsaac had only returned from abroad half a year ago.
Once upon a time, the four of them were inseparable-bright stars sharing the same sky. Yet now, as lsaac lowered his gaze to his legs, a faint sorrow flickered in his eyes. Of them all, he alone felt out of step, a broken chord in their melody.

A gathering? Since the car accident, he had avoided every private get-together. Outwardly, he wore indifference like a cloak, meeting curious stares-subtle or direct-without flinching. But deep within, he could not fool himself; he knew he no longer stood shoulder to shoulder with the others.

Isaac opened his lips, prepared to decline his friend's invitation.

But Cayden, reading his thoughts, sighed gently and said, "We're friends-true friends, unlike anyone else.And besides, didn't you just announce your marriage online yesterday? Such joy ought to be shared.Shouldn't you celebrate with those who care for you?"
Isaac's brows eased slightly, his gaze drifting toward Verena across the table.

Sensing no objection, Cayden pressed on, "If your wife is willing, bring her along to dinner."
That single word "wife" stirred Isaac. The furrow at his brow finally loosened.

Shifting his phone aside, he turned to Verena and asked, "A friend of mine is returning to the country this afternoon. Tonight, we're holding a small dinner for him. They all know about our marriage and would like to meet you. Will you come with me? If gatherings make you uneasy, just say so. I won't mind."

He hesitated ever so slightly before adding that last line, and in his tone, a cautious undertone lingered.
He watched her quietly, as if bracing for her reply, yet secretly hoping for something more.
 Verena caught te weight of his emotions and sighed inwardly. Time and hardship truly reshape a person.The once proud, unshakable Isaac now wore his sensitivity like a fragile shield.

She refused to let this softer side of him be overshadowed by doubt, so she flashed him a bright, easy smile and agreed without hesitation, "Of course-no problem at all."
Isaac froze for a heartbeat, and then a smile tugged at his lips.
After breakfast, Isaac left for the office, while Verena retreated to the bedroom, immersing herself once again in her medical books.
By six in the evening, Isaac returned to Seraphina Villas to collect her.
He waited in the living room until the crisp click of high heels drifted down the staircase.
Glancing up, his eyes lit ever so slightly.
Verena descended gracefully, draped in a champagne-colored coat over a beige dress. Nude heels gave length to her step, and with today's careful touch of makeup, she seemed sculpted with elegance.
"Lost in my beauty?" she teased, waving her hand in front of him.
Isaac caught her hand, and before reason could intervene, the words slipped out. "I want to hide you."
Verena's lips curved into a playful smile. Leaning closer, she whispered against his ear, breaking the spell,"Careful-locking me away is a criminal offense."
Caught off guard by her comment, Isaac was momentarily stunned before he laughed and said, "I was just joking."
They exchanged a glance and both smiled.

...
As night fell, Shoildon's streets bloomed with light. In the city center, a restaurant glowed beneath warm yellow lamps, its sign reading "Bronze Rose."
Inside, rustic charm met refinement, while bursts of laughter from a private room carried into the hall. "Stevie, after all these years, still no wife?"
"I've been buried in work, you know that."
"Work? More likely you just can't decide which lady to bring back."
Their teasing drew a ripple of laughter.
The man at the head of the table-the star of tonight's gathering-was none other than Stevie Wagner.Clad in a light suit, his cheeks flushed crimson under their banter.

His eyes flicked toward the black velvet box before him. Clearing his throat twice, he steered the talk elsewhere. "By the way, what's the story with Isaac's social media post? We never even heard he was dating, and suddenly-he's married?"

###Chapter 93 What's The Deal With His Wife


"Also, what's the deal with his wife?" Stevie added.

Though he had been living abroad, distance hadn't cut him off from the whispers back home.

He had caught fragments about Verena, yet the full story still eluded him.

Cayden exchanged a meaningful glance with Leonardo, who gave a small nod, urging him to speak.

Scratching his head, Cayden said frankly, "It's a marriage arranged by their families."

In their circle, family-arranged marriages were as ordinary as breathing.

What sounded absurd to outsiders was, in truth, business as usual for people of their standing.

Stevie gave a slow nod, and then pressed, "When did they meet?"

Cayden took a sip of coffee before replying, "If memory serves, about two months ago."

"Two months ago?" Stevie's voice sharpened. He reached for the box on the table, rolling it between his fingers with unease.

That necklace-Isaac had asked him to commission it more than half a year ago, a gift intended for the girl he fancied.

Yet before fate could take its course, Isaac had suddenly returned from overseas and entered an arranged marriage instead.

So what now? Hand the necklace over or keep it hidden?

What a tangle!

Stevie's thoughts spun like a compass without a north. How had he landed in such a muddled drama?

As he wrestled with it, the door to the private room swung open. "Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, this way, please," came the clear, melodious voice of a waitress.
At the sound, all three men instinctively looked up.
Their eyes flickered past Isaac but settled-unanimously and inevitably-on Verena.
Cayden had seen her before, though then she'd worn casual clothes and almost no makeup.
But today was another story. She was carefully dressed, every detail considered.
His gaze lingered longer than he realized.

For Leonardo and Stevie, it was their very first glimpse of her, and they were caught unprepared-left momentarily stunned.

The champagne-colored wool coat skimmed gracefully over her frame, her hair spilled like silk across one shoulder, and her smile, though faint, carried warmth. In her eyes glimmered a touch of cool reserve,paradoxically making her all the more approachable, as though the frost concealed an unspoken fire.
Among the three, Cayden was the first to recover.
He stood up with a ready grin. "Come in, take a seat. We've been waiting. You owe us a drink later."
Leonardo followed quickly, returning to his senses.
Stevie sat anchored at the head of the table, with Cayden and Leonardo on his left. The right side remained vacant.

As Verena wheeled Isaac closer, Stevie, like a man concealing a guilty secret, hastily'scooped up the box on the table and slpped it into his pocket.
It was the very necklace Isaac had once commissioned from the famed designer in Clokron, Sophia Dixon.But just as the necklace was finished, lsaac had suffered his accident, and Stevie-bound by work confidentiality-had been unable to reach anyone.
When his duties were done, he'd meant to hand it to Isaac in person.
Who could have foreseen how much would unravel in the meantime?
Now, with circumstances as they were, presenting the necklace felt utterly out of placeStevie pushed the box deeper into his pocket, securing it as though to bury his own uneaseVerena guided lsaac to the chair beside Stevie, and then bent gracefully to drape a blanket over lsaac'slegs.
The simple gesture made the three men exchange glances-admiration and quiet surprise glinting in their
eyes.
Of everyone at the table, Verena was the stranger.
And yet, in front of his closest companions, lsaac clasped her hand. His voice softened, carrying both prideand warmth. "Allow me to introduce my wife, Verena."
At once, Cayden rose with an easy laugh, extending his hand. "Dr. Willis, who would've thought that the nexttime we crossed paths, you'd already be my best friend's wife? l hope you won't hold a grudge for my pasimissteps."

###Chapter 94 Was This Really How Arranged Matches Worked
With a gentle smile, Verena took Cayden's hand and held it firmly. "Dr. Moore, you only had Isaac's health in mind.Why would I take offense? There's nothing wrong with being careful."
Leonardo also stood up to greet her. "My name's Leonardo Gibson. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."He carried himself with a maturity that gave him a steady presence.
A faint smile touched Verena's lips as she inclined her head in response. "Nice to meet you, Leonardo."
Afterward,Leonardo chuckled and tapped the shoulder of the man at his side. "Here's the star of tonight's gathering-Stevie Wagner, back from his time overseas."

Caught off guard, Stevie froze for a second, and then jumped to his feet in a hurry. "Hi, Verena. I'm Stevie Wagner.Glad to meet you."

The words spilled out in a stiff rush, and his jerky movements made him look like a clumsy puppet, which drew laughter from the others at the table.

"You're still terrible at meeting new people, Stevie," Cayden teased with an easy grin.
Stevie's hand went to the back of his neck, and his reddened face gave him the awkward air of a shy student.

Reaching out without hesitation, Verena returned his handshake and smiled warmly.good to meet you as well."

Soon afterward, the servers brought in the dishes, and the four old friends slipped into lighthearted conversation.

The talk about a drinking penalty was nothing more than Cayden joking, since everyone knew lsaac's health didn't allow him to drink.

For the most part, Verena ate quietly, though she joined in whenever the topic turned toward her.  The three men filled the air with lively chatter, while Verena and Isaac focused on their dishes and, almnost in unison, served each other food.

Their hands paused when they realized what they'd done. Their gazes met for a heartbeat, and then both lowered their eyes and laughed softly.

The trio across from them couldn't miss it. They traded looks, each one buzzing with unspoken meaning.
Stevie leaned back with suspicion clear on his face. Was this really how arranged matches worked? First the blanket, and now sharing food? That level of closeness seemed far too much.

Cayden turned toward Leonardo, clearly searching for an answer.
Instead of helping, Leonardo only lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, as if to say he was just as clueless.When the meal was nearly finished, Verena rosefrom the table and excused herself to the restroom.

No sooner had she left than Stevie edged closer to Isaac and murmured, "I almost kept this to myself, but since you commissioned it, I'll hand it over."

Both Cayden and Leonardo stayed wrapped up in their own conversation, too distracted to notice the quiet exchange happening beside them.

Isaac's gaze dropped to the black velvet box that Stevie was holding out.
"What are you talking about? When did I ever commission this?" he asked with confusion.

Believing Isaac had forgotten, Stevie explained patiently, "It was a month or two before your accident. You called me and said you were chasing after a woman you truly loved, and you wanted me to find someone who could design a necklace just for her."
His expression softened as he continued, "Things didn't go as you hoped, but you already paid for it. What you choose to do with it now is up to you."

With no room for refusal, Stevie pressed the box into Isaac's hand.

Isaac froze, his gaze fixed on the box for what felt like ages, bewilderment and astonishment flickering in his eyes. A woman he had truly loved... had there ever been one? Stevie could be reckless and unpredictable at times, yet he wasn't the kind of man who would deceive himn, much less make light of something so serious.

Trying to force the memory to surface, Isaac furrowed his brow. Yet the harder he searched, the emptier his mind became. When had he ever been in love with a woman? Why couldn't he remember a single detail?

Shaking his head firmly, Isaac pushed the thought aside. "No. I never asked you to order this."

Stevie froze in disbelief, his voice pitching higher. "Isaac, don't mess with me. I've still got the proof of that transfer."

Opening his banking app, he shoved the screen toward Isaac and said with a teasing grin,"Look at this.Did you really forget? You wouldn't stop saying she was the only one for you."

The record left no room for doubt.

Meanwhile, Isaac's thoughts were completely blank.

Verena's cheerful voice chimed in as she walked back toward the table, "What are you two whispering about?"

Isaac's shoulders tensed. On instinct, he slid the small box into his pocket.

Stevie parted his lips, ready to brush it off, but Isaac interjected quickly, "Nothing important. I was just asking about his time overseas."

With an easy smile, Verena accepted the answer. "Alright then, carry on."

Stevie snapped his mouth shut and shot lsaac a side glance. Quick thinking, he thought. Isaac always managed to cover himself well. Still, the man hadn't actually asked him anything about life abroad.

By the time their gathering wrapped up, the clock had already passed ten.

It was late when they finally reached home.

Verena slipped into the bathroom for a shower, while Isaac wheeled himself quietly into the study.

Taking out the box, he lifted the lid. Resting inside was a crystal necklace, its flawless shine revealing a piece of craftsmanship far from ordinary.

Instead of admiring it, Isaac sat there frowning. If Stevie's story was real, how could he have no recollection at all? If he'd once been in love with someone, he would have told the girl honestly before agreeing to the marriage arrangement with the Willis family. Responsibility wasn't something he ever avoided. Yet his mind offered nothing, not even a trace of memory. And still, Stevie had no reason to lie. Between the bank record and the necklace, the evidence couldn't be denied.

Isaac pressed his hands over his face, and then stared blankly at the ceiling. Confusion clouded his eyes,and not even he could piece it together. He understood he should be honest with his wife about matters of the heart, yet he couldn't bring himself to let Verena see this strange part of his past.

Morning arrived, and Isaac left for work earlier than usual. Verena also rose at dawn, enjoying a rare stretch of quiet while tending to the flowers in the garden.

That calm was soon broken, as uninvited visitors showed up without so much as a warning.

The housekeeper, Rhonda Walker, hurried across the garden and called out, "Mrs. Bennett, your parents have arrived. They're waiting in the living room."

Verena's face remained calm. She had already expected this moment would come.

"Alright. Go on back to what you were doing," she replied evenly.

Rhonda gave a quick nod before returning to her chores.

Setting the pruning shears aside, Verena let out a faint sigh and headed toward the living room.

She hadn't even stepped inside when Alec's voice drifted out.

"Luka had a sudden fever the other day, so it delayed us. Now that we're finally here, be sure you speak nicely,alright?"

Laura seemed to grasp the seriousness this time. With less of her usual bite, she bobbed her head quickly."I get it, I get it. Don't worry. With the two of us together, she's coming home."

Leaning casually against the doorframe, Verena crossed her arms and studied the couple lounging on the sofa. A bitter smile tugged at her lips. Their little act could rival any Shakespearean performance, and real life seemed to be their favorite stage.
She stood tall and called out, "Why are you here?"
Her cold tone sliced through the room, and Alec and Laura instantly forced smiles as they rose to greet her."Oh, Verena, I've missed you terribly!" Laura exclaimed.
To Verena, the words dripped with hypocrisy. She couldn't help but think Laura ought to fear divine punishment for such insincerity. Then again, someone like her clearly had no conscience to trouble her.
Laura reached for her hand with false affection. "You've gotten thinner."
Verena pulled her hand away without a word and calmly wiped it clean with a tissue.
Their smiles faltered. Laura's eyes flashed with anger, though she quickly masked it.
Acting as if he hadn't noticed, Alec kept a gentle expression. "Please don't be upset with us, sweetheart.Just come back home with us. I'm begging you."
His voice cracked as though he might break down in tears, and his eyes glistened with sorrow.
Compared to Laura, Alec's performance nearly fooled Verena-it was that convincing.
Verena crushed the used tissue in her hand, and then tossed it into the trash with deliberate aim.
"Sweetheart?" Her lips twisted into a sharp smile as her gaze hardened. "What gave you the idea I was that close to you?"
###Chapter 95 Their Love Was Unreliable And Transient
Alec caught the sting of sarcasm in Verena's words, his facial muscles twitching as though struck by asudden chil. Though embarrassment gnawed at him, he stubbornly wore a mask of kindness and sincerity.
"Verena, l know why you refuse to come home. That troublesome girl, Kaia, has been spreading rumorsabout you, making others whisper behind your back. l am well aware of all the bad things she has done toyou."
At that moment, Laura didn't bother to shield her once-cherished younger daughter. She quickly nodded inagreement. "Exactly! Your sister is reckless and immature. Once we return, we'll make sure to discipline herproperly."
With a thunderous expression, Alec unleashed a torrent of harsh words at Kaia. "| never imagined that giricould wear suc a convincing mask, Before we brought you back, she always seemed obedient. But themoment you appeared, her narrow heart was laid bare, and now she has become nothing more than ajealous villain.
Seeing Verena remain silent, Alec assumed he had struck a chord, Pretending to wrestle down his anger, hesoftened his voice as though offering comfort. "Verena, don't worry. When you come home with me, !'lmake sure to give her a stern lecture right in your presence, and she will apologize."
Like actors reading from the same script, Alec and Laura steered the conversation until Kaia bore the fullblame for拓 every wrong.
Vena dar eyes stayed fixed on them, her gaze as cold and sharp as a blade, carrying disdain and achilling detachment.
In that moment, she finally understood the roots of Kaia's hostility
The love Alec and Laura dispensed was like shifting sand-unreliable and transient, here one moment andgone the next.
When Verena had first arrived in Shoildon, everyone treated her as a simple country girl, looking at her with indifference.

Alec and Laura were no exceptions.

In their minds, her worth was limited to one thing-replacing Kaia to marry Isaac, thereby completing a marriage of convenience with the Bennett family.

So when Kaia aimed her arrows at her, even though Alec and Laura knew the truth, they turned a blind eye.

Even when quarrels broke out between the sisters, their instinct was always to shield Kaia first.

But times had changed.

Now they realized that, beyond the marriage arrangement, Verena had other values greater than Kaia's.With thatrevelation, they shifted their stance with practiced ease-flattering Verena, appeasing her, and harshly chastising the very daughter they once swore to protect.

Their love was indeed no more solid than smoke in the wind.

No wonder Kaia felt fear and insecurity. She dreaded that Verena's appearance in their lives would steal what little affection remained in their parents' wavering hearts.

Thus,she tried every trick in the book to push Verena away.

Growing up under such a roof, Kaia was, in Verena's eyes, both pitiful and pathetic.

"You two truly are willing to stop at nothing to get what you want." The mocking smile on Verena's lips faded, replaced by sheer disgust in her eyes. "Words like insincere and filthy fall short of describing you.You're not bringing me back to the Willis family for my sake. You only realized the closure of the club was Isaac standing up for me. Then, when you saw Slater's social media post clearing my name,you finally understood I hold value-considerable value. That's why you're now willing to disparage Kaia just to win me back. If not for these two incidents, no matter how much Kaia wronged me, you'd still be twisting yourselves to cover for her instead of pretending to fight for me. Kaia turned out this way because of you both."

At those words, Alec and Laura were visibly flustered.
###Chapter 96 Just You And Me

Alec reacted swiftly, clutching his chest with theatrical flair. "Verena, how could you see me in such a light?I am your fath..."
Verena cut him short. "You two have been unsettling me for quite some time. I have no interest in watching your little play. Rhonda, please show them out."
Without granting them another glance, Verena turned on her heeI and made her way upstairs.
Rhonda stepped forward and spoke with a touch of awkwardness. "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, please leave."
The villa was Isaac's property, and Alec and Laura knew better than to stir up trouble or drag Verena down as though it were their own household.
They exchanged a fleeting look-frustration written plainly on their faces-yet, swallowing their pride, they had no choice but to retreat in defeat.
The uninvited visit spoiled Verena's mood for gardening, so she drifted into the study in search of a book.As she settled into the chair, her eyes caught a black velvet gift box tucked beneath the desk.
Curiosity tugged at her; she reached for it and gently lifted the lid.
Inside lay a delicate women's necklace.
A flicker of surprise crossed Verena's eyes, and then softened into a smile.    
Had Isaac prepared this for her?
Was there a hidden occasion she had overlooked?
She quickly checked her phone's calendar. Valentine's Day was far ahead, and her birthday had long since passed.
Unable to unravel the mystery, she closed the box and quietly set it back in place.
 She resolved to wait and ask him when the time came. Yet,after that day, Verena found herself watching and waiting for lsaac to offer the gift, but time slipped by,and he never did.
Her curiosity gnawed at her like a silent pest.
One evening, as she sat before the vanity, she remarked casually, "Isaac, don't you think my neck looks rather bare? My outfit doesn't seem to shine as much."
Hearing her, Isaac lifted his eyes from the documents in his hands to glance at her.
She wore a fitted top with a V-shaped neckline, her hair swept into a bun, leaving her graceful neck exposed.
Isaac shook his head, answering with calm honesty, "Not at all. It looks beautiful."
Verena paused, realizing he had missed the hint, and pressed on. "Don't you think a little addition would make it look even better?"
Isaac blinked,momentarily taken aback, before asking in earnest, "What shouldladd?"
Verena almost blurted out "a necklace" but held her tongue.
At first, she had thought he was keeping a surprise from her, but now it seemed he had completely forgotten about the necklace she had discovered.
She only shrugged with a light smile. "Never mind. It's nothing."
With that, she let her hair fall loose and rose to take a shower.
Isaac, however, sat puzzled, murmuring under his breath, "Is she upset?"
He replayed her words in his mind, pondering them until the realization struck-her gentle hints were a plea for a gift.
Reaching for his phone, Isaac dialed his assistant. "Jacob, there's an auction at the Shoildon Art Center tomorrow, isn't there?"

The following morning, just before leaving for work, Isaac told Verena, "I'll come home early tonight and take you out for dinner."
"With your friends?" Verena asked, assuming it was another of his social gatherings.
Isaac shook his head, his gaze bright with anticipation. "Just you and me."
"I see." Verena teased, tipping his chin with her finger and a playful smile, "A candlelit dinner, then?"
A soft gleam of mischief lit up her beautiful eyes.
Isaac's cheeks warmed, and moistening his lips, he gave a quiet
.--
By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, they arrived at a fine restaurant.
It was elegant, refined, with a violinist weaving tender notes into the air.
Once Verena settled into her seat, Isaac slid a black velvet box across the table.
"I saw this at the auction and thought it would suit you. I hope it pleases you."
Verena's lips curved into a smile-so hints did bear fruit after all.
But when she opened the box, her expression faltered for the briefest moment.
Inside lay not a necklace, but a silk scarf.
Isaac noticed her hesitation and asked, his voice cautious, "You don't like it,Verena?"
Verena concealed her inner bewilderment, her lips curving into warmth. "I like it very much. So long as the gift is from you,I cherish it all."
###Chapter 97 Tattoo
Verena was a bit confused. isaac did not hand her the necklace he had kept in the study. instead, he choseto buy her a scarf.
But why?
Verena trusted him enough to believe he wouldn't allow another woman into his lifeShe reasoned that perhaps the necklace had been meant as a gift for a relative.Leaving her guesses aside, Verena rose, moved before lsaac, and knelt down. "Would you mind helping mewith this?"
"Alright." lsaac took the scarf, folded it with care, and wrapped it softly around her neck, tying it into a neatbow.
Verena remained kneeling before him, and naturally, his gaze lowered.
When they entered the restaurant, Verena had removed her coat, showing a slightly loose sweater beneath.
As she bent, the collar slipped a little, uncovering the elegant lines of her collarbones.
Just as lsaac was about to shift his gaze away, something caught his eye and made him freeze.Beneath her collarbone, close to her heart, was a tattoo-a single initial, ".."
isaac's expression faltered, his brow knitting
Who did that "|" belong to?
He recalled her mention of a first love, and it felt as though someone had struck his chest with a heavy blow.it seemed she had not erased her first boyfriend from memory.Verena had once confessed they had loved each other deeply Though she had called it the past... if it were truly just history, if every feeling had faded, who would still carry a tattoo carved for an old flame?
Keeping an initial etched into one's skin surely spoke of lingering affection.
And the truth stood plain-the mark remained, unremoved, near her heart.
Did she still think of her first love?
Isaac fixed his gaze on the black letter, frozen, his breath catching in his throat.
A tide of jealousy surged within, leaving him suffocated.
If anyone had the right to ask about it now, it was him.
Yet his broken body made him feel unworthy even of jealousy.
If fate decreed he never recovered, and she had not truly fallen for him, would that not, in its twisted way, be better?
His mind drifted back, retracing every step of their journey.
And then a troubling thought struck him-her affection had come so suddenly.
Were her feelings for him real, as she claimed?
If so, why bear another man's mark still? Did her heart continue to wander back to that shadow?
"Is it not done yet?" Verena's gentle voice shattered Isaac's reverie.
He lowered his lashes, hiding the storm in his eyes."It's done."
Verena glanced at the scarf and smiled. "Thank you. It's beautiful."
Isaac forced a faint, stiff smile. "I'm glad you like it."
He chose not to ask about the tattoo.
Or perhaps, he lacked the courage to do so. Verena returned to her seat, brushed her fingers against the scarf at her neck, and thought of the necklaceshe had glimpsed in the study.
Her curiosity lingered, yet she trusted lsaac had his reasons and chose silence.They ate quietly, each prisoner to their own thoughts
At Willis Villa...
since the day Slater posted that clarification, Kaia had shut herself inside her room, refusing to step out.
der phone buzzed from time to time, pricking at her nerves.
very call that came was either meant to mock her or to sneer with false sympathy.innoyed, Kaia switched her chat app to Do Not Disturb, but she dared not do the same with her number, forear she might miss something vital.
et every ring seemed only to draw so-called friends eager to witness her fall
efore she could calm herself, the phone rang once more.
lready agitated, she tore several pages from the book in her hand, unable to hold her temper.
he picked up the phone, meaning to turn it off, but her hand paused at the sight of the caller ID.
was an international call.
drian?" Kaia frowned, whispering in disbelief. "isn't he in Clokron? Why would he call now?"en Slater's post came to mind, souring her face. Could Adrian Carter have heard and joined the chorus ofckery?
... he had been in Clokron for years. He couldn't possibly be so quick to hear gossip.
er a breath of hesitation, Kaia answered.
vely mal闬寡 鬢釡揄凑oice burst through. "Kaia, guess who?" Not knowing if he was aware of her plight, Kaia kept her composure and smiled faintly. "It's Adrian."
She seized the chance to probe. "Aren't you busy? What made you call?"
"I just got back from Clokron," Adrian replied warmly. "I's been ages since we met. Don't you miss me?Won't you join me for a meal?"
At the mention of meeting, Kaia's instinct was to refuse, fearing he might know about the post and wish to ridicule her face-to-face.

But just as she prepared to decline, a spark lit in her mind.
Of course!
Adrian had just returned from Clokron, and he too was a graduate of Pine Hill University.

Her heart leapt with sudden excitement. "Adrian, I've missed you. How time flies! It's been so long I nearly forgot-what year was it you went abroad?"
Adrian,thoughtful, gave her the year and sighed. "Hard to believe i's been seven years."
Kaia made a mental note and replied, "It really has been a while. Adrian, are you free tomorrow? Let's meet in the afternoon. It's on me."
Adrian agreed without hesitation. "Alright."
Feigning busyness, Kaia said, "Adrian, I have things to attend to. Let's talk more tomorrow."
Whenthe call ended, she opened her door and walked downstairs, intent on finding Laura to ask something.But as she reached the staircase, voices rose from the living room-Alec and Laura were quarreling bitterly.Kaia halted,listening.
Laura's voice seethed with resentment."Verena, that ungrateful girl, is too petty! Even when we begged her,she still refused to come home. How can she hold grudges against her own parents?"
Alec snorted, pointing a trembling finger at her. "This is your doing. You knew she was sensitive, yet you provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side.
###Chapter 98 As If Victory Was Already Hers


Shock rippled through Laura as her gaze landed on Kaia, who had rushed to stand between her and danger.

A look of astonishment crossed Alec's face; Kaia's sudden intervention had clearly caught him off guard.

Even so, Alec refused to show a hint of embarrassment at the situation. His hands clasped behind him; his stern demeanor remained unchanged.

After a moment, Laura shook off her shock, stepped forward, and drew Kaia close in a tight hug. She let her frustration spill out at Alec. "How long will this go on, Alec? Ever since Verena came here, this family has been falling apart. I've tried everything-I've humbled myself, lost my pride, and still, nothing changes. If that's how it is, I'm done. From now on, you deal with it."

She didn't wait for a response. Laura led Kaia away and guided her upstairs.

Inside Kaia's bedroom, Laura gently traced the outline of Kaia's puffy cheek, sorrow filling her eyes. "Why would you throw yourself in the middle of that? You know your father's temper."

Kaia knew firsthand how harsh Alec could be. Yet, unlike him, Laura's care was real-she was the one most likely to soften if Kaia reached out.

Laura would stay by her side, no matter what Alec chose to do for his own benefit.

Kaia couldn't afford to lose both, so she kept one close just in case things fell apart.

Kaia took one look at how Laura reacted and figured stepping in had been the right call.

Tears pricked Kaia's eyes, and her nose tingled as she sniffled. "If I hadn't gotten between you, you'd be the one hurting, Mom. I just couldn't let that happen."

Laura's own tears threatened to fall, but she managed a warm,gentle smile.silly girl. At least I know all the love I gave you wasn't wasted. Let's do something about that swelling."

She soon returned with ointment in hand. Dipping a swab into the cream, Laura carefully applied it to Kaia's face. The sting made Kaia flinch, but she didn't regret standing up for her mother.

Trying to ease the tension, Laura spoke softly. "Try not to blame your father. He thinks he's protecting us.The club's closure has kept him up every night."

Kaia's eyes, still red, met her mother's. She nodded quietly."|get it, Mom. I'm not mad at him. Maybe Verena didn't help us because we never really included her. Honestly, I'd feel out of place too."

That confession made Laura pause for a beat.

She hadn't forgotten the scandal stirred up by Slater's post about Kaia. But seeing her daughter's sincerity,Laura dismissed the incident as unimportant.

Her voice was calm. "We gave her a home and every chance to succeed. She's got no reason to resent us."

A faint smile touched Kaia's lips as she changed the subject. "Mom, do you remember when Verena took her college entrance exams?"

While tending to Kaia's cheek, Laura's thoughts wandered back to Verena's school days. She hesitated,recalling, "You know, I don't think she actually sat for the exams. Why are you asking?"

Kaia's eyes reflected regret as she spoke. "Everything that's happened to Willis Group is really on me. When Verena first came home, I was afraid of losing your affection, so I kept my distance. My mistakes led us here,and I want to make things right. I also need to learn about her history-maybe then I can fix what I've done.Don't worry, Mom. I'll talk to her and ask her to stop targeting us."

Laura reached over, pride shining in her expression. "You're being so thoughtful, Kaia. That makes me proud. Your father will be pleased when he hears this." After thinking for a moment, Laura recalled the timing. "It was the year Luka got seriously ill. Seven years ago."

The moment Laura mentioned the year, Kaia nearly leapt from her seat.

That put Verena in Adrian's graduating class.

In her mind, Kaia quickly connected the dots. provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side. Adrian passed the phone back and shrugged. "That's not for sure. The university is massive, and each department is full of students. There's no way to know everyone in your year."

Noticing the disappointment on Kaia's face, Adrian tried to reassure her. "Let me reach out to a buddy of mine-he knows more schoolmates than me."

Grateful for the offer, Kaia nodded. "That would help a lot. I'll send you her picture right now."

Adrian forwarded the photo, and then quickly dialed his friend.

"Wesley, I just texted you a photo. Take a look-do you recognize this girl from back then?"

On the other end, Wesley Seymour's voice sounded rough, like he'd just woken up after a wild night. "Give me a sec."

A few moments ticked by before Wesley let out a low whistle. "Whoa, where'd you get a stunner like this?"

Rolling his eyes, Adrian clarified, saying, "She's not someone I know personally. I'm asking for a friend."

Wesley's enthusiasm faded. "Ah, I get it. Sorry to disappoint, but she doesn't ring a bell."

As Adrian hung up, Kaia leaned in, anxious for the answer. "Did he recognize her?"

He shook his head. "Nope. If a girl like that had been around, especially with my friend's reputation, he would have noticed her for sure."

Hearing this, Kaia felt a surge of satisfaction she hadn't experienced in ages.

Even if Verena truly healed Barrie, a lie about her academic background would stick like a stain that couldn't be washed away.

All Kaia needed was a sliver of doubt-a few hundred people out of a thousand-casting shadows on Verena's story.

As for a grand wedding? What a joke.

Verena wanted to marry into a rich family smoothly? Things weren't going to fall into place that easily.

If Verena's secret came out on her wedding day, it would be the perfect scandal.

A sly smile curled on Kaia's lips, her confidence blooming as if victory was already hers.

###Chapter 99 Verena's Love Life


Leaning in a bit, Kaia asked, "So... that means she wasn't a Pine Hill student, right?"

Adrian paused, clearly thinking it over. "I can't say for sure. My friend's got connections everywhere, but the campus is packed with gorgeous women-he couldn't know all of them."

Then he turned the question back on her. "Why are you so interested in this girl, anyway? Is she that important?"

Kaia said quickly, "She is-honestly, it's crucial. Adrian, you're plugged in with so many people. Could you help me dig up more about her?"

He mulled it over before giving a nod. "Alright, here's what l'Il do. I'Il contact someone from school and see if they can send over our med school's complete roster from that yea. We'll check for her name."

Relief filled Kaia's voice. "That's really helpful,Adrian. Thank you!"

Meanwhile, at a Shoildon restaurant, two men sat facing each other in a private dining room, deep in business talk.

One, older with silver streaks at his temples, watched everything with alert, calculating eyes-the look of a seasoned executive.

Across from him, a younger man in a wheelchair hid every thought behind a calm, unreadable face.

Rising from his seat, the older man-Jeffry Turner-offered a hand and an overly polite smile. "Mr. Bennett,Turner Group is honored to join forces with your company. Here's to a thriving alliance."

Isaac waited, his eyes resting on the outstretched hand just long enough for Jeffry's smile to falter, before finally accepting the shake.

"To a thriving alliance," Isaac replied evenly.

Jeffry's smile quickly returned as he straightened. "Well, I'll get out of your hair now, Mr. Bennett. Wouldn't want to take up more of your valuable time."

Right on cue, his assistant hurried over to hold the door as Jeffry left.

As soon as they were gone, Jacob, who had been standing quietly behind Isaac, couldn't help but remark,"That Jeffry is slick. He's always out for his own interests. If he didn't have that tiny link to your mother,he'd never land a partnership like this."

Isaac let out a small, knowing laugh, hands folded in his lap. "After forty years in the industry,Jeffry knows the game. He won't lift a finger unless there's something in it for him first."

Jacob nodded, impressed. "You always stay three steps ahead, Mr. Bennett."

Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit. "Let's get back to the office."

Out in the hallway, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar face.

It was Gavin-Verena's friend who had just returned from overseas.

He started to call out, maneuvering his wheelchair forward, but at that moment, a young woman emerged from the elevator.

Gavin greeted her wvith a bright grin and gently guided her into another room.

Jacob inclined his head, quietly pressing, "Mr. Bennett, the elevator is ready for you."

Isaac looked at his assistant and replied, "Go on ahead, Jacob. Wait for me downstairs-l've got something to do first."

Without questioning further, Jacob nodded. "Of course,sir."

Isaac steered himself down the hall, stopping right outside the room Gavin had entered.

He waited patiently, letting the minutes pass. At last, about thirty minutes later, the door swung open.

Gavin, heading out toward the restrooms, froze when he spotted Isaac waiting. Surprise flashed across his face."Were you waiting for me?" Isaac met his gaze and gave a quiet nod.

Gavin instantly guessed this wasn't a chance encounter-and he doubted Isaac was here to invite him to a meal.

He cut straight to the point. "This is about Dr. Willis, isn't it?"

Isaac offered a slight nod, admitting, "You and Verena go way back. I'd like to understand her history."

Gavin narrowed his eyes, his mind quickly turning. He recalled his last talk with Verena at the bar and knew Isaac's memory was patchy at best. Was this sudden interest in Verena's past because something had changed between them?

A flicker of anticipation shot through Gavin. "Alright-let's find a spot to talk."

As they headed down the hall, Gavin sent a text. "Ran into someone. I'll be a while, wait for me."

Reaching the end of the corridor, he stopped and faced Isaac. "Go ahead-whatever you want to know, just ask."

Isaac hesitated, fingers tightening against his wheels. He wanted to hear about Verena's past, to piece together the woman he was falling for, but doubt crept in.

Was it right to probe into her life without telling her? The urge to know more fought against the worry that he might be crossing a line, and the uncertainty made him pause, caught between curiosity and concern.

Thoughts spun through Isaac's head, emotions tangled in a silent war. In the end, after a long pause, he couldn't bring himself to do something that might upset her. He let out a quiet breath and said, "Never mind,it's not important."

Gavin's eyebrows shot up in protest; he was not willing to let it go that easily. "Seriously, Mr. Bennett? You waited outside my room, guided me here to talk, andI even texted my friend to hold off for you. Now you say it's not important? Are you having a laugh?"

Isaac didn't elaborate, simply nodded and said, "Sorry."

Gavin huffed but decided to keep the conversation going. Leaning against the wall, he crossed his arms and put on a thoughtful face. "Alright, if you're not talking, l'll take a stab at it myself. What could possibly have you so curious about a woman's past? Let's see..."

Drawing out his words with a mischievous glint, Gavin asked, "This is about her love life, isn't it?"

Isaac met Gavin's eyes, a cold spark flickering in his own, but said nothing.

The look on Isaac's face told Gavin he'd hit the mark, and his joking manner instantly faded. He straightened, saying in a more serious tone, "Okay, you don't have to say it. You're curious about Dr. Willis'romantic past."

For a moment, Gavin hesitated. He remembered Verena's words about keeping Isaac's memory loss under wraps for the time being-it might complicate things if he found out.

Still, as far as love went, Verena's history only included Isaac.

So,how should he phrase it... Suddenly, an idea struck Gavin.

With a sly grin and a bit of theatrical flair, Gavin said, "Dr. Willis once had someone who chased after her with everything he had. This guy was completely devoted-he learned to cook just so he could make her different meals every day. And you know what? She ignored a whole parade of impressive admirers just to be with him. They were everyone's idea of the perfect couple..."

Isaac broke in, voice cool and measured. "Did his last name start with an 'I'?"

That question threw Gavin for a loop. An "I"? Why ask that?

Hold on a second!

Gavin remembered seeing a small tattoo just beneath Verena's collarbone: a single letter, I.

It had been a topic of teasing before, and Verena claimed it stood for lsaac-something Gavin and the others had never let her live down.

Realization dawned. Isaac must've seen that tattoo and thought it was connected to the man in her past.

The pieces fit, and Gavin barely managed to hide his amusement. This could get interesting.

###Chapter 100 Are You And Isaac Keeping Secrets From Me


Gavin couldn't forget the punch lsaac's brother had landed on him in that bar. Since the younger brother had stirred up trouble, wasn't it only fair that lsaac, as the elder one, carried some of the blame? And besides, Verena had been insistent-Isaac must never learn the truth about his memory loss.

Gavin convinced himself that what he was about to tell Isaac was for his own good.

Holding that thought, he swallowed his amusement and gave a small cough before saying,"Well,you can think that way. After all, one of the initials of his name is indeed T."

The remark offered little clarity, and the mischief in his tone was obvious.

Isaac felt his heart sink, and as if punishing himself, he asked, "Were they truly in love?"

Enjoying the tension, Gavin leaned into the story. "Deeply! That man adored Dr. Willis, and she nearly gave up everything for him."

At those words, Isaac lowered his eyes. Verena almost sacrificed everything for another man? The woman he knew was rational and steady. Without powerful feelings, she would never have risked so much.

A hollow laugh escaped him.

In that moment, Isaac realized he was torturing himself. Knowing she had once given her heart away,he still insisted on uncovering the details. Hadn't he vowed to only care about her present and her future? For now,it was him by her side, not that man. Whoever he was, he belonged only in her past.

Isaac gripped the wheelchair tightly, his restrained voice edged with self-mockery. "I don't want to hear any more. I don't want to know."

He turned the chair and rolled into the elevator.

Inside, with no one else around, Isaac bowed his head. His back curved slightly as a wave of helplessness washed over him. He already knew Verena had loved someone before, yet he still couldn't stop himself from digging into what should have been left alone.

In the reflection of the elevator's mirror, Isaac caught sight of himself and let out a faint, crooked smile. He had waited outside Gavin's room for so long, obsessed with digging into her past. Was it just jealousy fueling him, or did he secretly doubt that Verena could ever choose a man like him?

How could a woman who once loved so fiercely move on so quickly? And this time, the person she chose wasn't even an ordinary man. For her to accept everything about him without question, she must have had her own reasons.


...

Since the day she started living with Isaac, Verena made it her routine to check on his health every single day.

Over the last few weeks, she noticed that her treatments were beginning to stimulate his nerves. The changes weren't striking, but they were still far better than before.

Her priority now was to get control over her shaking hand so she could schedule Isaac's surgery as soon as possible.

To practice, Verena asked someone to bring her a lab mouse. She laid out the surgical tools carefully and carried the animal into the study.

With gloves pulled on and a mask covering her face, she stared at the scalpel waiting on the tray, and her mouth went dry.

She swallowed,lifted the scalpel, and waited, holding it tightly without moving for a long moment.

When no response came, Verena finally let out a breath of relief. To her gratitude, her right hand held steady.

With a spark of confidence returning, she pinned the sedated mouse in place and guided the scalpel with her right hand, the sharp edge gradually slicing through the thin layer of skin.

But the moment her cut reached the abdomen, her fingers began to shake uncontrollably. Her grip tightened around the handle as she struggled to keep it from slipping.

Sweat dampened her forehead. When the tremor finally lessened, she forced herself to continue the operation.

When the scalpel pressed into the organs, a wave of dizziness struck Verena, coldness creeping up her spine until it spread through her whole body.

A memory burst before her eyes-Shawna lying on the operating table, suffering and frail, while she stood frozen with a scalpel in her hand, unable to save her. She had been forced to watch as her grandmother slipped away.

Verena's breathing grew shallow and uneven, her chest rising and falling as she fought to take in air.She told herself this fear had to be conquered, that she needed the strength to lift the scalpel again.

Clasping her right wrist with her left hand, Verena forced her body to remain steady.

Dissecting a lab mouse was considered the easiest procedure for any medical student.

In the past, she had been able to complete one in under five minutes.

On this day, nearly forty minutes dragged by.

Weakness set into her limbs as she leaned against the wall, her complexion pale and her eyes blank as they settled on the scalpel she still held.

Her trembling hadn't stopped, and during the procedure she had nearly sliced into the mouse's organs.

It ended up being the poorest operation she had ever performed.

Not long after, Stevie arrived unexpectedly.

Rhonda, the housekeeper, noticed him and said politely, "Please wait here. I'll let him know."

Stevie motioned for her to stop. "No need. Just keep doing your work."

Then he yelled toward the upper floor, "Isaac, come down here! There's another thing I need to give you." The noise carried through the house, prompting Verena to step out of the study. She went downstairs, saw Stevie standing in the living room, and answered, "Isaac isn't here."

When Verena appeared, Stevie froze in place, unable to react at first.

It was obvious he had forgotten that Isaac already had a wife.

Awkwardness flickered across his face. Then, his eyes fell on the scalpel in Verena's hand, the fresh stain of blood making it all the more unsettling.

He edged back a step and murmured, "Verena, what are you..."

"It's nothing," Verena said quickly, slipping the scalpel behind her back.

There was no way she wanted Isaac to hear about her struggles in surgery, not when it could shake his confidence even further.

Her eyes shifted to the object Stevie was holding, and she redirected the moment. "Isaac isn't home right now.Is that meant for him? Leave it with me, and I'll make sure he gets it."

Realizing what he had in his hand, Stevie hurried to tuck it behind his back."NO,really, it's nothing important. I'll hand it to him myself; no need to bother you."

The evasion didn't escape her. Verena arched a brow and asked,"So it's something I shouldn't see? Are you and Isaac keeping secrets from me?"

Stevie stiffened, biting down on his words. Fine. That was between husband and wife-he wasn't going to get dragged into it.

He set the item down on the table and remarked, "I'll just leave it here. Goodbye, Verena."

Turning on his heel, he bolted from the house as if something was chasing him.

Verena's gaze lingered on the small box on the table, her mind unsettled. What could possibly make Stevie this tense?

"Rhonda, please carry this up to my room," she said evenly. "Of course," Rhonda replied at once.

Upstairs, Verena washed her hands thoroughly with disinfectant before sitting at her desk and lifting the lid of the small box. Inside lay a ring.

Between her fingers, she held a rose-shaped diamond ring-her favorite flower crafted in stone.

Her gaze shifted to the inside of the band, where the letter"E"had been engraved.

It was the initial of Evelyn-her other name.

A ring.

A necklace.

Stevie had just returned home.

And she recalled Stevie mentioning he hadn't spoken to Isaac for nearly eight months.

In that moment, the truth dawned on her. These pieces must have been prepared for her by Isaac before his memory loss.

At the same time, Stevie rushed away from the house and pulled out his phone to call Isaac.

"Isaac, I screwed up badly. Please don't be angry. I had no idea your wife was living with you. When I came by with the gift, I accidentally gave her the ring you bought for another woman."

Isaac's voice hardened. "What did you just say?" He pinched the bridge of his nose, not bothering to inquire about the ring. He added, frustration thick in his tone, "You never fail to mess things üp."

The call ended before Stevie could argue.

Back at his desk, Isaac clasped his hands together, elbows braced on the surface, and lowered his head. A nervous weight pressed against his chest; he was worried Verena might misunderstand when she saw the ring.

Raising his voice with authority, Isaac instructed, "Jacob, get the car ready."
###Chapter 101 A Ring


Soon after, the car rolled to a halt outside the villa.


Jacob assisted Isaac out and into the wheelchair,but before he could offer any more help, Isaac propelled himself ahead.



Inside the house, Isaac scanned the living room, but Verena was nowhere in sight, so he went straight for the elevator and made his way up to the second floor.


He found the bedroom door ajar and entered without hesitation.


Inside, Verena sat in an office chair, her attention buried in a book. When the sound of wheels reached her,she glanced over and greeted him. "Back so soon,Isaac?"



Her composure gave nothing away, as if the day had been utterly uneventful.


If not for the box sitting next to her hand, Isaac might have believed Stevie's earlier call was just a trick of his imagination.



Tension showed in Isaac's grip on the armrests, his eyes clouded with worry. Regardless of her feelings for him, Isaac didn't want any confusion or distance between them.



He didn't know if Verena had already peeked inside the box or how he'd explain the necklace and the ring.



After an uncertain pause, he finally asked, keeping his voice gentle, "Did Stevie stop by today?"



Each word was measured, his gaze watching Verena for any flicker of a reaction.



Noticing his barely concealed nerves, Verena offered a small, knowing smile. "He did," she replied evenly.


"Did he mention anything to you?" Isaac pressed,unable to hide his concern.



A wave of unease swept over him-what if Stevie had revealed more than he should in front of her?



Only after the words slipped out did Isaac realize he was being obvious.



He looked away, his lips pressed thin, unable to meet her gaze.



Verena,amused by how unsettled he seemed, let a playful spark light her eyes.



She leaned her cheek into her palm and answered with an easy drawl, "Nothing much." Just as Isaac began to relax, she added, unhurried and soft, "But he did leave something behind-said it was for you."



A knot formed in Isaac's throat, and a flash of panic flickered in his dark gaze.



Choosing to ignore his unease, Verena casually lifted the box from the table, popped open the lid, and knelt down at his feet.



She smiled at him, twirling the ring in her fingers."Isaac,who knew you had such a romantic streak? You really didn't need to go to all this effort. Next time you have a gift for me, just hand it to me yourself.That means more to me than anything."


For a heartbeat, Isaac was too startled to respond, and then he realized her mistake. "Actually, I..."



Verena cut him off, her eyes shining as she studied the ring. "This is wonderful, Isaac. Thank you."


She tilted it closer to the light, admiring the design."The diamond was carved into the shape of a rose,right? It's gorgeous."



Her joy was so bright that Isaac's protest faded away.He found himself unable to break the moment.


He only wished her happiness could last like this. As he fell silent, Verena arched a brow and extended her hand,holding the ring out to him."Will you do the honors?"



He accepted the ring, and although his movements were stiff, he slid it onto her finger.



But before the ring made it all the way, Verena pulled her hand back. "Wait, Isaac. Isn't this one a little loose?"


His hands went still, and for a moment, he drew a blank, frozen by uncertainty.



A wave of nervousness hit him, stronger than anything he'd felt before-a childhood fear of being caught red -handed.



Verena's tone shifted as she inspected the band. "Hold on, what's this?" She peered closely. "Check out the inside-there's something carved in here."


She lifted the ring to his eye level. "Look, the letter 'E.'"



Her gaze sharpened with suspicion. "What's that supposed to stand for, Isaac? There's no 'E'in the initials of my name."
###Chapter 102 She Won't Suffer Any Injustice
When Verena pressed for an answer,Isaac was left speechless.



He wanted to clear things up, but couldn't find the words-after all, he had no idea what the engraved "E" actually meant himself.



He met her gaze, his face blank, lips parting as he stammered, "I..."



Nerves crept into his voice, so faint it nearly vanished between them. Sensing his unease, Verena decided not to push any further. She suddenly raised her voice in mock realization. "Oh! That makes sense now!"



Isaac blinked, watching as her eyes danced with mischief. "'E' must be for the last letter in 'LOVE,'right? Isaac, I never guessed you'd be so clever about this stuff!"



He was still frowning, about to say more, when Verena closed the distance and kissed his cheek. "It's a wonderful present-thank you."



Joy lit up her eyes, and her voice came out in a gentle hush. Isaac caught the glow in her smile, held back what he was going to say, and let the mystery behind the letter "E" stay just that.



He offered a smile in return, even if it felt a little stiff."If it makes you happy, that's all that matters."



...



At Bennett Group, after wrapping up a meeting,Isaac made his way back to his office, where Jacob appeared at the door with a gentle knock.


"Yes?" Isaac replied, his thumbs pressing lightly at his temples, eyes closed as if collecting his thoughts.



Handing over the phone, Jacob reported, "Mr.Bennett, you missed a call from Mr. Barrie Lyons about ten minutes ago."


Isaac's eyes opened and he nodded, replying, "Thank you."



With the office empty once more, Isaac dialed Barrie's number.



It didn't take long for the line to connect, Barrie's raspy voice coming through. "Isaac, is that you?"


"It's me, Mr. Lyons." Isaac's tone was respectful. "How have you been these days?" Barrie, always fond of Isaac's manners, let out a soft chuckle. "I'm doing well, thank you."



After a brief exchange, Barrie's voice turned serious."Isaac, there's something I need to ask you."



"Go ahead," Isaac replied.



"Did you tell Beckett to close Alec's club?" Barrie asked directly.



A brief flash of uncertainty passed through Isaac's eyes. Barrie rarely involved himself in affairs outside his own business; today's call was a clear break from the norm.



He answered honestly, "I did."



"But why?" Barrie's question carried both confusion and concern. "Isaac, I'm not trying to interfere, but Dr.Willis is not just Alec's daughter-she's also my savior.Now that her family's in trouble, I can't simply look away. I know you're a fair man, so I have to ask-did Alec wrong you in some way? Otherwise,why would you move against the Willis family?"



His voice softened, almost pleading. "Your wedding to Dr. Willis is just around the corner. If word gets out,people will talk-they'll say you hold a grudge against your fiancée's family, or that you're trying to humiliate her. Alec may have his faults, but he's still her father. No matter what's happened, targeting her family this way only breeds bitterness between you two."



Listening,Isaac realized why Barrie had reached out.



He replied with genuine appreciation, "Thank you for caring about Verena, Mr. Lyons."



He continued, voice steady, "Alec's never slighted me personally. But he's wronged my wife-and that's all that matters to me. Any so-called bitterness isn't a concern. I've always been open with Verena about my actions against her father."



Barrie fell silent, confusion written on his weathered face.



Was Slater right? Was Isaac truly this devoted to Verena?



Could it really be that the entire Willis family faced Isaac's wrath because they had crossed Verena?



Barrie found himself at a loss, unable to make sense of Isaac's motives.



When the silence stretched, Isaac decided to close the conversation. "Don't trouble yourself about the club,Mr. Lyons. I'll make sure it's taken care of."



He added with quiet confidence, "And as for the person who saved your life-rest easy. I'll make sure she won't suffer any injustice."
###Chapter 103 Revenge Plan
Isaac's blunt response left Barrie with nothing more to say.



Letting out a quiet sigh, Barrie replied, "Alright then,I'll stay out of it."



He ended the call after that.



Still holding the phone, lsaac ran his finger slowly along its edge as Barrie's words echoed in his mind.



Barrie had made a point-since his wedding to Verena was just around the corner, it would be unwise to stir up unnecessary attention. The issue with Alec's club could wait until the ceremony was over.



As the upcoming wedding crossed his mind, lsaac's hand paused, and a flicker of determination lit his eyes.



Before, he might have left every detail in someone else's hands. This time was different. It was his marriage to the woman he loved, and he wanted to shape it himself. He intended to be part of the planning, to make sure Verena had a wedding that was unforgettable and uniquely hers.


With that decision firm in his mind,Isaac set his phone on the desk and reached for the office phone."Jacob,step in for a moment."



Within minutes, Jacob knocked at the door and came inside.



"Mr. Bennett, what do you need from me?"



"I want you to contact the wedding planner and set up a meeting for this afternoon. I'll be discussing the details with them directly."


"Yes, sir. Wait, what?" Jacob blinked at Isaac, unsure if his ears had deceived him. Danica had dismissed the wedding arrangements as something minor, ordering that the planner's outline be followed without interference. It seemed almost unbelievable that Isaac had summoned him just to announce that he wished to go over the wedding arrangements with the team himself. Isaac taking such a deep interest in the wedding was something he didn't see coming.


Noticing his hesitation, Isaac asked, "Did I say it unclearly? Should I repeat myself?"



The question was plain, without a trace of force behind it.



Jacob shook his head at once. "No, Mr. Bennett, I understand. I'll reach out to them right away."


Isaac inclined his head. "Good. I appreciate it." For a moment Jacob just stared. The small smile forming on lsaac's lips stripped away the usual distance and sternness that always surrounded him.



In that instant, Isaac looked more like a man basking in the joy of marriage than the cold figure people rarely approached.


Jacob almost couldn't believe it.







Days had slipped by since Kaia last saw Adrian, and she still had no word on the investigation she'd asked him to pursue.



Her patience snapped, and she typed out a quick message. "Adrian, are you free to meet this afternoon at the usual place?"



Silence stretched for five minutes, which was out of character.



Normally Adrian replied immediately,or at the very least within a few minutes of hearing from her.


It took nearly thirty minutes before her phone buzzed with his short reply. "Alright."



Kaia blinked at the one-word reply, startled by how blunt it was. Adrian used to jump at any excuse to talk to her, worried he might lose the chance if he didn't.


Still, she pushed the thought aside. What mattered most now was finding out if Verena really had a degree from Pine Hill University-or if she had faked it.


That afternoon, Kaia showed up thirty minutes early,just as she had before.



When Adrian finally arrived and sat across from her,Kaia leaned in eagerly. "Adrian, how did it go? Did you uncover what I asked about?"



Instead of answering right away, he studied her with an unreadable look.



In the past few days since his return, he had heard from friends about the things Kaia said in the group chat and the social media post Slater had written. Piece by piece, he had managed to put the whole story together.


Long ago,his parents had worked with Alec, and from their very first dinner, Adrian had fallen for Kaia.Even after moving abroad, his feelings hadn't changed, and the moment he came back, she was the first person he contacted.



In his memory, Kaia had always been gentle and kind,but the things he learned about her left him shaken.



His fingers locked tightly together on the table as he finally spoke, his voice weighted. "Kaia, just tell me the truth. Verena's your sister, isn't she?"


Her smile stiffened at once. Adrian added, "So why are you digging into her past? Do you plan to expose that she never graduated from Pine Hill University? Were you going to announce it at her wedding?"


His stare cut into her, sharp and unrelenting, carrying the unspoken accusation that she was far from the innocent woman she pretended to be. To him, she looked calculating, even ruthless.


Kaia's first instinct was to deny it, yet she forced herself to stop hiding and face it head-on.


"So you already figured it out." She dropped the act and admitted bluntly, "Yes, that's my plan. Because I can't forgive her for stealing everything that should've been mine!"



Adrian's brows drew together, his face dark with concern.



Kaia grabbed his hand and held on tightly, her eyes brimming with tears. "Adrian, I need your help. I've been against Verena for a reason. She hurt me in ways you don't know, and I want what's fair."


Her voice broke as she continued, "From the very first day she came into my life, she struck me just to prove she was in charge. My parents turned a blind eye, hoping she'd marry into the Bennett family, so they ignored my pain completely."


Looking up through wet lashes, she locked eyes with him. "Adrian, do you think I enjoy doing this? My parents only care about Verena now. If I don't fight back, I'll end up with nothing at all."



Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, her sobs breaking her words.



The sight tore at Adrian's heart. This was the girl he had admired for years, and seeing her cry shattered his anger toward her.



He squeezed her hand with quiet reassurance, his voice softening. "Kaia, I'm sorry. I judged you without knowing the truth. I let rumors cloud my view of you,and I shouldn't have."



Seizing the moment, Kaia nestled against him,her tone carrying a wounded softness as she pleaded,"Adrian,I need your help."


Feeling her cheek pressed to his chest, Adrian stiffened,his mind going blank for a moment.


After collecting himself, he lifted a hand and gently patted her back. "Alright.I'll help you."


Out of his sight, a smile tugged at Kaia's lips. His response made it clear-whatever he uncovered couldn't have favored Verena.



Even if Verena had managed to fix Barrie's leg, it could easily be dismissed as luck. That alone didn't prove she had a degree from Pine Hill University.


Adrian exhaled slowly, pausing before putting a little space between them.



From the chair beside him, he picked up a folder and handed it over. "This is the complete student list from every department that year. I checked through it several times, and Verena Willis doesn't appear anywhere."


Looking down at the folder, Kaia's face lit with satisfaction. It was exactly what she expected.



In her eyes, Alec and Laura had always been opportunists; if Kaia herself had inherited their traits,Verena was bound to be the same.



Kaia's eyes glimmered with pride. She would make sure Verena face shame and rejection before the whole world on her wedding day.
###Chapter 104 A Devoted Husband
 Both Slater and Bobby clearly thought the world of Verena, didn't they? Kaia seethed inwardly.Slater even went so far as to post on social media to mock her,just todefend Verena.



Kaia wondered how their faces would look when Verena's lie was exposed on her big day.



As soon as she got home, Kaia wasted no time sharing her discovery with Alec and Laura. "Dad, Mom, you've both been fooled by Verena. She never graduated from Pine Hill University. I'm telling the truth. I had it checked-her name doesn't exist in their records."



Laura's eyeswidened in disbelief. "Whatare yousaying?"


Alec, on the other hand, barely flinched.



He shot Kaia a measured look, reading her intentions with practiced ease.


With a dismissive snort, Alec stood up from the couch."You really expect me to believe you just like that?Even if Verena lied about her education background,what difference does it make?" He stepped closer,his words deliberate and heavy. "I'm telling you this, Kaia: I won't allow you to drag our family's reputation through the mud. There won't be any scenes at Verena's wedding. Try anything, and you'll answer to me."



With his warning delivered, Alec turned away and headed upstairs without another word.



The real reason Alec wasn't in a rush to look into Verena's education background was simple-she was his own child. If this got out, the Willis family's standing would take a hit, and so would his personal reputation.



Years spent building his public image couldn't be risked now.



Laura, who had started to question further, caught sight of Alec's stern face and thought better of it.


She gave Kaia's arm a gentle squeeze and murmured,"Your father's under a lot of stress lately. Don't add to it."



She then followed Alec up the stairs.



Left alone in the living room, Kaia stared after her parents as they disappeared from view. Her hands curled into fists, trembling from frustration. She held still for a moment, and then let out a laugh laced with sarcasm.



Once again, they were talking down to her like she hadn't heard it all before.



Ever since her name had been dragged through the mud online, Alec hadn't openly confronted her, but the cold shoulder was unmistakable. He kept his distance,barely even speaking.



Kaia knew he was biding his time, waiting for the club mess to quiet down before finally dealing with her.



All her effort to uncover Verena's secret had been a desperate attempt to win back their approval.



If nothing else, she wanted Alec and Laura to see she was not the one deceiving them-it was Verena.



Yet the only thing she received for her effort was a stern warning not to ruin her sister's wedding.



He cared so much about appearances that he'd do anything to prevent Verena from being shamed in public.



But what about the humiliation she had suffered?


All those people from their social circle had shown up just to see her fail-had Alec ever once stepped in to defend her?



Why should she be expected to protect his dignity, or Verena's, when no one ever shielded hers?


Absolutely not.



Kaia made up her mind right then: she had no intention of following his orders.



They could have their turn on Verena's wedding day -let them feel the sting of embarrassment for once.







That morning,Jacob arranged a meeting with the team from the wedding company.



After finishing a meeting at Bennett Group that afternoon, Isaac left for his appointment with them.



News that Isaac would be handling wedding details himself had the entire staff buzzing with anticipation;everyone waited out front, eager to make a good impression.



A sleek black limousine glided to a stop moments later.



Lined up in neat rows, the staff gave respectful bows as the manager hurried forward, anxious not to miss a beat. Once the vehicle was parked, Jacob assisted Isaac into his wheelchair.



With practiced hospitality, the wedding company manager greeted Isaac warmly and escorted him into a private VIP suite.



Inside, the walls were filled with displays-photographs of famous weddings, wealthy couples,and global icons, all serving as inspiration.


Isaac took a measured look around before letting his attention drift back to the task at hand.



Isaac didn't have to say a word-the manager picked up on his lack of enthusiasm for the wedding styles displayed around them.



She brought over a stack of thick albums and set them down with a soft thud. "These were put together by well-known designers from around the world, Mr.Bennett. You're welcome to flip through them, and if you've got something else in mind, I'd be happy to hear it."



Isaac turned a few pages, and then looked up and set the record straight. "My opinion isn't the one that matters."



Catching on immediately, the manager replied, "So,it's the bride's wishes we'll follow, correct?" A faint light flickered in lsaac's eyes, and a subtle smile touched his lips. "Exactly."



A few young employees nearby exchanged whispers,clearly smitten.


"Wow, Mr. Bennett always seemed so distant, but he's actually so sweet to his wife."


"When I got married, my in-laws made every choice.I couldn't stand anything they planned. Hearing this just makes me jealous."



"If only I could meet someone like him..."



The manager was quietly impressed-the Bennett Group CEO was actually a devoted husband.



Maintaining her professionalism, she pressed on, her voice friendly. "What sort of wedding does your bride envision? Does she have favorite flowers, or a particular style-maybe classic, rustic, or romantic?"



Isaac opened his mouth to answer, but the words never came.



Only then did it hit him-he had no idea what Verena actually liked.


Setting the album aside, Isaac told the manager, "I'm sorry. I'll need to check with my wife before making  these choices."


The manager blinked, caught off guard for a moment,but quickly composed herself. "Of course, Mr.Bennett. Please take all the time you need."



Pulling out his phone, lsaac found Verena's number and called her directly.



Meanwhile, several staff members nearby traded whispers, the mood shifting from admiration to skepticism.


They were holding a wedding ceremony, but the groom didn't know his bride's favorite things.How strange.



Speculation buzzed through the room-maybe lsaac wasn't as devoted as he seemed.



Was it just for show?



Across town, at Seraphina Villas, Verena enjoyed a peaceful afternoon, tending to the plants with a rare lightness in her step.



When her phone vibrated, she wiped her hands,checked the screen, and grinned. She answered it and spoke cheerfully. "Hey, honey! Worn out from work?Need your sweet wife to give you a boost?"


She didn't realize Isaac was nowhere near his office. The playful endearment made Isaac's heart skip, and he tightened his grip on the phone, clearing his throat before replying, "I could use that."


Regaining focus, Isaac moved to his rea reason for calling. "Can I ask-what's your favorite flower?"


Verena arched a brow,half-expecting he was planning a surprise bouquet.


Catching sight of the ring on her finger, she smiled to herself and answered,"Roses."



Isaac, so wrapped up in worrying about the ring's origin, hadn't even noticed the rose-shaped diamond on it.



He continued, "What sort of style do you prefer for an event-romantic, classic, or maybe rustic?"



Verena paused, surprised that picking flowers came with so many options.


Stll, she answered honestly, "Romantic, I think."
###Chapter 105 Miranda Brown
 Following that phone call, Verena realized Isaac hadn't sent her any flowers.


She couldn't help but wonder if he was secretly planning something special for her.


Curiosity tugged at her about whatever "surprise"Isaac might be plotting, but Verena chose not to bring it up.



She figured the truth would reveal itself soon enough.



Time sped by as the wedding approached, and suddenly it was just one day before the ceremony.



Verena scrolled through her contacts, only to remember that most of herclosest friends either lived overseas or were already settled down with families.


Every detail for the big day was set, except for the bridesmaid, a worry that had lingered for days.


Over breakfast, Verena looked at lsaac and asked,"Did you already pick your groomsmen?"



Nodding,Isaac caught the worry in her voice and quickly assured her, "Don't stress about it. If we need to, we can always hire professional bridesmaids." Verena answered without much thought, "Alright."


Even so, a part of her still wished her dearest friends could stand by her side for the wedding.



Just then, the sound of her phone buzzing snapped her out of her thoughts.



Verena answered the call without glancing at the screen.



"Verena! Seriously,what is wrong with you?"



A blast of noise from the other end nearly made Verena's ears ring, forcing her to hold the phone at arm's length.



Recognizing the voice, she asked, "Miranda? What's going on?"



Miranda Brown's frustration was obvious. "Are you kidding me right now? My best friend's about to walk down the aisle, and I have to find out from Gavin, of all people? Do you even consider me your friend anymore? If I hadn't caught up with him, I'd still be clueless. So, were you really going to keep me in the dark forever?"



Back in college at Pine Hill University, Miranda and Verena had met at a campus mixer. Even though Miranda majored in Computer Science and Verena was  in a different department, the two quickly became close friends.



Miranda had become the CEO of a famous global tech company,recognized all around the world.



After Verena came back home, their demandng jobs made it hard for them to keep in touch.



Realizing she should have reached out to her close friend, Verena offered a regretful explanation. "I just thought you had so much going on at work, and l didn't want to bother you. Besides, the wedding's pretty far from you, and I figured it'd be tough for you to come all this way."



Miranda let out a loud scoff. "Don't give me that excuse! No amount of work would ever keep me from your wedding!"



A laugh slipped from Verena before Miranda continued,"I already grabbed the first available flight,and I'm at the airport now. Unless something goes wrong, I'll be back in the country tonight. And just so you know, I'm officially claiming my spot as your bridesmaid. You promised, remember? No backing out now."



Miranda was a bundle of restless energy, yet she and Verena had one majorthing in common-they were both devoted to their work. No matter the occasion, Miranda would tackle every deadline before making time for anything or anyone else.



Verena honestly hadn't imagined Miranda would drop everything and fly across the globe just to stand beside her as her bridesmaid.



A wave of gratitude warmed her, and she broke into a gentle smile. "Of course you'll be my bridesmaid.Travel safe, okay?"


Miranda answered, "Got it. I'll see you tonight!"


When the call ended, Verena found herself grinning,her spirits noticeably lifted.



Across the table, Isaac couldn't help but hear every word,thanks to Miranda's booming voice.



He glanced up and asked, "Was that your friend calling from overseas?"



Verena nodded, still smiling."Yeah, she'll be here by tonight."
###Chapter 106 Encounter At The Airport
At 6:00 PM, a sleek black car waited near the entrance of Shoildon Airport. Kaia sat in the front passenger seat,eyes glued to her phone,while Adrian kept watch over the flow of people spilling out of the airport.



Eventually, Kaia set her phone aside and glanced over."Adrian, how much longer until your friend shows up?We've been here almost thirty minutes."



Earlier that day, Adrian's friend had called to say he'd be flying in tonight and wanted to catch up over dinner. Coincidentally, Kaia had invited Adrian out for a meal as wvell.


Trying to play fair, Adrian considered asking Kaia to join them, though he worried she might not be interested. In the end, he explained the situation,politely turned her down, and left the decision up to her.



To his surprise, Kaia didn't mind at all. She even volunteered to tag along to the airport and welcome his friend together.



Adrian couldn't have been happier. The woman he cared about was open to blending into his circle of  friends, so he didn't hesitate to bring her along.



Adrian glanced at his watch. "Not much longer now.The flight should land in about ten minutes."



He turned to Kaia, checking on her. "Are you hungry?Want me to grab you a snack while we wait?"



Her lips curved into a warm smile as she shook her head. "Don't worry about me, Adrian. Let's wait until your friend arrives; then we can all eat together."


Inwardly, Kaia admitted she'd never be this patient if it weren't for the fact that Adrian's friend was also a Pine Hill University top student.



Watching Kaia's gentle, easygoing personality,Adrian's heart twinged with emotion. She must have been through a lot, or she wouldn't be so invested in going against Verena.



Adrian's thoughts were interrupted as he looked out the window and noticed a familiar figure. Wait, was that...



He squinted, fixating on a spot near the terminal doors.Gliding through the crowd was a striking woman,her white suitcase rolling behind her. Her height and effortless poise made her impossible to miss.



In a heartbeat, Adrian knew who she was. Miranda?She was back in town too? "Adrian. Adrian?" Kaia called Adrian a few times, but he didn't seem to hear her. She followed his line of sight and spotted the woman he couldn't take his eyes off, a fashionably dressed, confident young woman.



Even though Kaia understood Adrian cared about her,watching him get so absorbed by another woman's presence, especially one so beautiful, sent a small pang of discomfort through her.



She quickly masked her feelings, placing a light hand on his shoulder and putting on her most pleasant tone."Adrian, you can't seem to look away from that stunning lady.Is she your friend?"



"Huh?" Adrian glanced over, understanding that Kaia was referring to Miranda, and offered an awkward smile. "Not exactly. Someone like her is way out of my league."



"Way out of your league?" Kaia echoed in disbelief."Adrian, don't sell yourself short. You're one of the best people I know."



Adrian explained, "We actually attended the same university and even majored in the same field, but she was a year ahead of me. She made a name for herself early on, and everyone in our department admired her.During my freshman year, she gave an unforgettable seminar that really inspired us. Now, she's the CEO of  AuroraNexus, which is a huge name in tech."



"AuroraNexus?" Kaia repeated, her eyes widening in awe. "That's the sixth-ranked conglomerate in the world,right? And she's so young,too!"


Her amazement drew a small,proud nod from Adrian."Exactly. That's why l've always looked up to her.She's honestly extraordinary, proving that women can excel just as much as anyone in the tech industry."



As the words "AuroraNexus CEO" echoed in Kaia's mind, a new idea started to take shape. If she managed to build a solid connection with someone of this woman's caliber, the thought of crossing the Bennett family or even Alec and Laura wouldn't bother her in the slightest.


After composing herself, Kaia offered to Adrian,saying, "If she means so much to you,why not take this chance to say hello?"



Adrian rubbed the back of his neck, looking a little embarrassed. "Truth is... we aren't exactly close.Wouldn't it seem odd to just walk up and greet her out of the blue?"



"Come on, why not?" Kaia encouraged him. "It's not every day you run into someone you admnire so much.You'll regret it if you don't at least introduce yourself.Besides, we're only going to say hi, not intrude on her  time."



Adrian glanced at Miranda, who was steadily making her way toward them. He hesitated, but Kaia's enthusiasm finally won him over.


He swung open the car door and stepped out. "Alright then, let's go say hi."



A bright smile lit up Kaia's face as she hurried after him.



"Hey,Miranda!" Adrian called out as he hurried over to Miranda.



Miranda paused, turning to see who was calling her name, her gaze settling on Adrian with a hint of curiosity.



Face-to-face with someone he admired, Adrian felt all his confidence drain away, rubbing his head with a shy grin.



"You're back in town, Miranda? I was your junior at the university."



For a split second, Miranda's face went blank as she studied Adrian. A flood of confusion rushed through her thoughts. Who on earth was this guy? Frustrated,she realized she had absolutely no memory of him.



Still, Miranda kept her composure and greeted him with a practiced, pleasant smile. "Yeah, what a small  world. It's been ages, hasn't it?"



Adrian's eyes widened in surprise. "So you actually remember me, Miranda?"



Of course, Miranda had no clue who he was,but she couldn't bring herself to admit it and risk offending him.


Miranda let out a friendly laugh, improvising smoothly."Outstanding people are hard to forget. And who could overlook such a bright, promising junior?"



Adrian hadn't expected Miranda to speak so highly of him, leaving him both stunned and thrilled. For a moment, all he could do was stand there grinning like an idiot.



While Adrian and Miranda slipped into conversation,Kaia stood quietly at his side, slowly realizing they'd forgotten all about her.


Kaia had more on her mind than a simple greeting.



She tugged gently at Adrian's sleeve, turning an enchanted look on Miranda. "Adrian, your senior is gorgeous! I can totally see why you look up to her."


It was at that moment that Miranda realzed Kaia was right there with them. After all, who didn't enjoy hearing a compliment about their appearance?



Miranda's polite smile was replaced by a look of  genuine happiness.



"You sure know how to make someone feel special.Those compliments could lift anyone's spirits."Miranda glanced at Kaia, and then shifted her gaze to Adrian,her eyes now holding a hint of playful meaning.



Kaia shook her head, still beaming. "I mean every word.You really are stunning. The moment you walked through the crowd,you caught my eye."


Adrian caught Miranda's expression and quickly stepped in with introductions. "Miranda, this is my neighbor,Kaia."



Miranda shifted her focus back to Kaia and smiled warmly. "Well,you're absolutely lovely yourself."



As she spoke, she pulled her phone out of her bag to power it on.



Kaia was genuinely impressed by how down-to-earth Miranda was. For someone leading such a massive company, she was refreshingly approachable and kind.



The moment her phone flickered to life, Miranda saw a flood of missed calls from Verena.



A jolt of panic hit Miranda. Shoot, she'd completely forgotten to turn her phone back on,and Verena had been trying to reach her over and over.
###Chapter 107 Are You Nervous
Not wanting to keep Verena waiting, Miranda grabbed her suitcase and got ready to head out. "Let's catch up another time. Dinner's on me when we meet again."



Kaia chimed in with a cheerful grin, "Oh, there's no way we can let you pay, Miranda. You're Adrian's senior, after all. We should be the ones treating you.Why don't you share your number with us? That way,we can plan something when you're free. We won't keep you any longer-looks like you've got somewhere to be."



Adrian's eyes widened in surprise as he glanced at Kaia,clearly moved by her efforts.



He hadn't expected Kaia to go this far just to snag his idol's contact details.



Miranda, meanwhile, was caught off guard by Kaia's directness.



Her offer had just been a polite gesture, never expecting them actually to take her up on it.


Now that the subject was out in the open, it felt awkward to turn them down. She figured she could always come up with an excuse to cancel later if she needed to.



"Alright,sure."



Miranda rattled off her phone number, and Kaia repeated it back to make sure there were no errors.With that settled, Miranda headed out.


Kaia's grin wouldn't quit; she'd actually gotten Miranda's number.


As the head of one of the world's most powerful companies, Miranda was hardly the type to hand out her number carelessly. Kaia figured that, on top of her connection through Adrian, Miranda must really want to be friends with her.



At the thought of it, Kaia's confidence soared.She felt ready to take on Verena.



If she could build a connection with someone this influential, then even if her parents turned their backs on her, Kaia believed she'd still have a future ahead.



One thing was certain: no matter what happened,she'd never end up worse off than Verena.



Outside the airport, a sleek silver-gray car sat parked by the curb. A young woman in a wool coat leaned against the car,looking relaxed.



Verena's eyes stayed glued to her phone, scrolling absently as she waited.


Miranda spotted Verena instantly after stepping out of the airport.



Dragging her suitcase, she rushed over and wrapped Verena up in a big hug.


"Verena, I've missed you like crazy!"


Right as Verena was about to redial Miranda's number,she found herself nearly tackled by an overenthusiastic Miranda.



So much excitement poured out of Miranda that she put most of her weight on Verena, forcing Verena to brace herself to stay upright. Miranda's arms clung so tightly around her neck that Verena almost gasped for air.



With a quick shove, Verena finally freed herself,taking a deep breath.



She couldn't help but scold, "Why are you still so wild?You should at least try to look the part of a CEO once in a while!" Miranda,never one to care about appearances,tossed an arm around Verena's shoulders and lifted Verena's chin with her fingers. A playful grin tugged at her lips as she teased, "Oh, Evelyn! You get prettier every year. Don't make me beg for a kiss."



Verena laughed and gave Miranda a gentle nudge on the head. "Cut it out! We're not overseas anymore.Don't call me Evelyn here."



Miranda nodded, glancing around as she whispered with a hand over her mouth, "You're right, that name's off-limits here. Fame brings its own headaches,huh?You're talented, so people line up for your help, and a few just to stir up trouble. Feels like you need bodyguards at this point. Trust me, I get it."


Verena just shook her head with a smile and gestured to the car. "Come on, let's go."


Miranda tucked her suitcase into the trunk and hopped into the passenger seat, ready for whatever came next.



"So, what's the plan? Are we heading to your place?"Miranda asked.



Before Verena could reply, Miranda continued, "How's life at home? Are your parents and siblings nice to you?"



After all these years, Miranda had uncovered every  secret and subtle dynamic within Verena's complex family.



Verena navigated through traffic, only answering once they merged onto the main road. With a light laugh,she replied, "Honestly? Things are a mess. We've cut ties."



"What?" Miranda was well aware that Verena wasn't close to her parents, but she never imagined things would fall apart this badly.



"Was it really necessary to go that far?" she asked,her voice dropping.



Both hands tightening around the wheel, Verena kept her gaze straight ahead, her face unreadable. "I'm not the cold one here--it's them. My parents only saw me as a way to climb up the social ladder. All they ever did was use me. My siblings are no better. They've always targeted me. Of course, I wish I had a real family,but not like that."



Miranda focused on the word "targeted," puffing herself up like a bodyguard. "You mean they went after you? Tell me what happened! Next time I see them, I'll set them straight, just watch."



She flipped her hair back, putting on a show like she was ready to march right up and defend Verena.



As the car rolled to a stop at a red light, Verena  reached over and flicked Miranda on the forehead."You're sweet for offering,but really,I can deal with it."



Miranda knew her friend didn't like people meddling in her private business.



Letting out a sigh, she finally backed down.



With the green light, they rolled forward, city lights blurring past.


"So, if you've cut your parents out, where are we actually going?" Miranda wondered aloud.


Verena shot her a playful look. "What, you think just because we're not headed to my parents' place, we've got nowhere to go? I'm about to get married-the bride's supposed to leave from her own home, right?No way I'm staying at a hotel or crashing at the Willis place. I bought myself a villa. That's where you're staying tonight."



Isaac had offered to let Verena use one of his houses for the occasion, hoping to make things easier on her.


But Verena turned him down. She wanted her wedding to be special, something unforgettable, not just another event.



Besides,she'd already hung Shawna's memorial photo in her new place. Home was wherever Shawna's spirit lived.



Miranda let out a low whistle and flashed a dramatic thumbs-up. "Only the legendary doctor,Evelyn,could just buy a villa in Shoildon like it's no big deal. No wonder you're such a hotshot!"



Verena just shook her head, unable to keep a straight face. "Come on, cut it out. Last I checked, you're the CEO of AuroraNexus. Who's richer, really?"



They hadn't seen each other in ages, so the drive to the villa was filled with laughter and stories.



Once they arrived, the maid had already prepped a warm meal. After they'd eaten and both had a shower,it was close to midnight.



Never one to change, Miranda insisted on squeezing into Verena's bed after drying off.



Verena made a show of complaining, but the truth was, she was glad to have her best friend by her side.


As the night quieted down, Miranda reached over and poked Verena's arm. "Tomorrow is your big day. Are you nervous?"



The bedside lamp bathed the room in a gentle,golden glow, making the whole scene feel soft and serene. Verena spent a few seconds gazing up at the ceiling before giving a slight shake of her head. "Honestly? I'm not sure."



It was the truth; she genuinely didn't know.



By all logic, nerves shouldn't have even crossed her mind. She'd already weathered more trials than most people could imagine.


Still, the thought of tomorrow sent her pulse into overdrive, fluttering in a way she wasn't used to.


For a split second, lsaac's face drifted through Verena's thoughts.



Was Isaac feeling the same?



Would Isaac be lying awake, nervous about tomorrow,too?



"But what about-"



Buzz...Buzz...



A sharp buzzing sound cut Miranda off.



Verena glanced at her phone on the nightstand and instantly broke into a soft smile at the name lighting up her screen.



Clutching her phone, she slipped out of bed. "Give me a sec,Miranda. I need to answer this."



Miranda just waved her hand dismissively, grinning. "No need to explain. Your face says it all. It's your man,isn't it? Go on, take your call."
###Chapter 108 Are You Lonely And Restless
That morning, before lsaac had left for the office,Verena had told him she would be staying at her new villa with her friend for the night.


She hadn't expected him to call at such an hour.



Verena darted to the open-air balcony to answer,her lips curving playfully. "We really do share a telepathic bond,don't we?"



Isaac had been lying in bed for quite some time, but sleep refused to come. He picked up a book from the bedside table, turned its pages, and stared at the words for nearly half an hour-yet not a single sentence sank in. Every page only mirrored Verena's face.



After wrestling with his thoughts, he finally chose to call her. He hadn't truly hoped she would pick up, yet,to his surprise, she did.



Leaning back against the headboard, Isaac sounded a little taken aback. "Were you thinking of me too?"



Verena didn't reply directly. Instead, she parried with a question of her own. "And you? What was it tha  kept me in your thoughts?"


As her voice poured through the receiver, Isaac absentmindedly toyed with the corner of his book. "I was wondering if you were nervous."



Resting against the railing, Verena smiled."Funny,my friend just asked me the very same thing."



His curiosity sharpened. "And what was your answer?"



She dodged again, throwing the ball back into his court."Are you nervous?"



Isaac didn't chase her evasions. He let the silence stretch a moment before admitting with a faint smile,"A little."



Verena's grin grew wider at his words, echoing her own heart, her eyes shimmering beneath the bright moonlight.


She teased him lightly, "It's all right. If nerves get the better of you tomorrow, just hide behind me. I'll take the lead. I don't mind being the woman who calls the shots."



Her cheerful laughter rippled through the line, and Isaac couldn't help but be carried along by her joy.


After a spell of lighthearted chatter, Verena grew playful again. "So, how's it going without me tonight? Darling,are you lonely and restless?"



Suddenly,silence fell.



Verena frowned, thinking he might have hung up,but a glance at the screen showed that the call was still connected.Why no sound?



At last, after a good ten seconds, Isaac's low voice reached her. "Tomorrow night, I won't be."


He knew full well she didn't care for him as much as he longed for, but still he couldn't resist her teasing and sweet words.



Before Verena could gather her thoughts, he added,"Get some sleep. Goodnight."



It wasn't until the busy tone echoed in her ear that she snapped back to herself. Wait... what had he just said?Tomorrow night, he wouldn't be.


With her cheeks burning, Verena pressed her hands to her face, wondering if those bold words had truly come from Isaac. Since when had he grown so smooth-tongued?



Meanwhile,Isaac lowered his phone and placed a palm over his chest.



The simple question Verena had tossed at him had sparked a blaze there, and the fire refused to die down.  What unsettled him most was his own heartbeat,hammering so hard it seemed almost loud enough for her to hear.



In those long seconds of silence, he truly feared that Verena might have caught the frantic rhythm of his heart.



He sat still against the headboard,waiting for the storm in his chest to quiet.



The room was utterly silent.



Then, after a long pause, his voice-low and hoarse -slipped into the stillness. "Calm down...stop beating so fast."



Otherwise,the groom who stood before her tomorrow would look less like a young man in love and more like a weary,worn one.







The next morning, Verena finished breakfast with Miranda, just as the makeup artists arrived promptly at seven.



With their skilled hands, Verena and Miranda changed into their wedding gown and bridesmaid dress.



Miranda gave Verena a long look, admiration sparkling in her eyes. "Girl, you look breathtaking." Verena raised a brow and shot back with candor,"You're just as breathtaking."



Each woman had her own artist, which sped up the process considerably.



The villa had been transformed the day before-balloons brightened the ceilings, roses lined the paths,and every corner seemed drenched in festivity.



In the middle of this, Gavin arrived.


"You're here so early?" Verena asked in mild surprise.



Pouring water into their glasses, Gavin answered, "Of course. I'm here to back you up."


"Did you bring what I asked for?" Miranda pressed.


"Wouldn't dare forget it." Gavin slipped a small folded piece of paper from his jacket and handed it to her.


Unable to move much while her makeup was underway, Verena glanced at Miranda through the mirror."What is it?"



Miranda's reflection offered only a mysterious smile."You'll find out soon enough."



That smile set Verena on edge. With such secrecy,trouble was sure to follow. By nine, both were ready.



Since the wedding gown was cumbersome, Miranda helped Verena upstairs to the bedroom,with Gavin trailing behind to carry the train.



The three chatted until Miranda checked the time."The groom should be here any minute. Gavin, go see if they've arrived."


"On it." Gavin nodded and stepped out.


Moments later, he burst back in, excitement spilling over as he shut the door.



"They're here! Just reaching the front gates!"


Hearing this, Miranda swiftly pulled Verena's veil over her face.



Then came footsteps outside.


Three sharp knocks, followed by a lively voice."Beautiful bride, we've come to take you to the ceremony. Come with your handsome groom!"



Verena immediately recognized Stevie's tone.



The groomsmen joined him, chanting in chorus,"Beautiful bride, we've come to take you to the ceremony.Come with your handsome groom!" Miranda called back through the door, "The bride won't walk out so easily. Not a drop of sincerity yet,and not even a glimpse of her."



As she spoke, Gavin braced himself against the door.



Stevie,prompted by Cayden, bargained from outside."At least let the bride say a word to the groom!"



Verena chuckled quietly, imagining Isaac keeping his silence,letting others do the clamoring.



Miranda crossed her arms with a smirk. "We're the bride's guardians today. If you want her voice, you'll have to get through us first."


"Guardians or not, at least let us see the bride!" Slater demanded,pounding the door.


"Exactly, this isn't fair," Bobby chimed in.



Gavin loosened his grip, leaning casually against the frame.



Half in jest, he said, "Bobby, this door won't yield so easily. I still remember those punches you gave me last time. Unless Isaac makes it up to me, neither he nor you will see the bride."


Verena knew Gavin was bluffing; he wouldn't truly bar the way. Besides, the groomsmen would find a way  around it, so she stayed quiet.



Miranda, however, blinked in surprise and turned to Verena. "Hold on-what's this about? Gavin got beaten up?"



Her tone grew excited.


Verena chuckled. "I'll explain later."


Just then, Isaac's amused voice sounded from the other side. "I'll compensate-with interest."



Something thin and rigid slid under the door.



Gavin bent to pick it up and blinked. It was a bank card.



"Wow, that's generous!" Gavin exclaimed,stunned."I was only teasing; no need for lsaac to get so worked up,right?" ###Chapter 109 So Cheesy



Miranda's eyes went wide as she glanced at Verena."Is your man really that desperate to see you?"



Verena let out a laugh. "Yes. Now quit stalling and let him through."



Miranda threw on an exaggerated pout, pretending to be jealous. "Alright, alright, you're already taking his side."



Gavin accepted the bank card-a token of the groom's sincerity-and hurried to open the door.



The moment the door swung open, Isaac rolled his wheelchair into the room at top speed, his groomsmen hustling in right behind him.


Verena sat at the edge of the bed, every inch the flawless bride,her gown flowing gracefully around her,and her makeup so impeccable that it captured everyone's attention.



Bobby was the first to find his voice, openly awestruck."Seriously, Verena, I've never seen a bride look this stunning."


Slater clutched his chest like a lovesick fool, sighing dramatically. "Man, I really blew it. I should've had the guts to chase after you when I had the chance."



Bobby shot a look at Cayden and the others, smirking."You guys hear that? Somebody needs to teach this guy a lesson."



The celebration brought out everyone's playful side,even Cayden and his friends, who were usually the picture of maturity, jumped right in to join forces with Bobby,grabbing Slater by the arms and giving him a round of playful kicks.



The room erupted in laughter and good-natured chaos, the air buzzing with excitement.



Off to the side, Miranda and Gavin couldn't help but crack up at the spectacle.



Isaac spared a glance for the rowdy crew behind him,and then focused all his attention on Verena, seated on the bed.



His favorite people were right there, but the woman he cherished most was front and center.



Even if her heart wasn't fully his yet, Isaac was grateful for this moment. He made a silent promise that he'd do whatever it took to earn her love.



Amid all the laughter and commotion, Isaac slowly rolled his wheelchair toward Verena. He stopped right in front of her, holding out his hand "Verena, come with me."



With a warm smile, Verena started to reach for him,but another hand caught hers first.



"Wait a second."



The room went quiet as every man turned to look.Verena and Isaac both glanced up at Miranda.



A puzzled look crossed Verena's face. The thought flashed through her mind that Miranda was gearing up to put lsaac on the spot.



Isaac shot Miranda a slightly puzzled look, recognition flickering in his eyes.



Wasn't that Miranda Brown, the CEO of AuroraNexus?



They'd met once at a party, and Isaac always kept track of impressive young leaders.



So this was one of Verena's friends?



Noticing Isaac's stare, Miranda shot back a fierce glare,her inner monologue snapping, "Yeah, I know l'm good-looking. No need to gawk."



Pushing her thoughts aside, Miranda set her jaw and addressed Isaac directly. "You've cleared Gavin's hurdles, but you haven't even faced the bridesmaid's  challenge yet."


Familiar with Miranda's knack for stirring up trouble,Verena reached over and squeezed her hand."Miranda,please, don't start any trouble now."



Miranda was gearing up for a comeback when a calm,deep voice broke in. "Alright. Tell me what it'll take to pass."



Miranda's lips curled into a sly, mischievous grin at Isaac's response.


From somewhere seemingly out of thin air, Miranda pulled out a folded slip of paper, smoothed it out, and handed it to lsaac.



She held up a finger with mock seriousness. "Here's the deal. Read every single word on this page, no skipping,no editing. Then you're good to go."



Bobby and the rest of the crew crowded in for a peek,each of their faces morphing into various stages of disbelief as they scanned the text.



Bobby gave his scalp a good scratch. "Oh man,this is so cheesy!"



Slater tried not to laugh. "This is giving me secondhand embarrassment."



Leonardo eyed Isaac, clearly concerned. "Does Isaac even know how to say stuff like this?"


Cayden nudged Stevie, giggling.an you picture Isaac actually reading this out loud?"



Stifling a laugh behind his hand,Stevie chimed in on Cayden's comment, "If he read that out loud, then the mysterious, stoic image I had of him would be completely ruined."



The whole conversation floated over to Isaac, but he didn't flinch. He simply gave the paper a scan,taking the challenge seriously.



Seated opposite Isaac, Verena couldn't make out what was written on the paper. The comments from Bobby and the rest only deepened her sense of dread.



She tugged on Miranda's sleeve, unable to hide her curiosity. "What did you write?"



Miranda just grinned, keeping it mysterious. "You'll find out soon enough."


Isaac finished reading, and then lifted his eyes, a small,knowing smile playing at the corners of his lips.



This was nothing he couldn't handle.



He turned to Verena, his tone soft and full of warmth."Verena." Verena's attention snapped to Isaac, curiosity piqued.



"Starting today, you're my wife. And from this moment on, I swear I'll stick to the 'seven secrets of a happy marriage.'"



A puzzled look flickered in Verena's eyes.



Isaac leaned in a little closer, gently taking her hand and flashing a laid-back grin. With a soft, playful tone,he recited. "Number one: Always tag along when my wife heads out. Number two: Listen up whenever my wife gives an order. Number three: Agree, even if my wife's in the wrong. Number four: Stand by patiently while my wife gets ready. Number five: Don't blink when my wife goes shopping. Number six: Keep my cool whenever my wife's mad. And number seven: Never, ever forget my wife's birthday."



A chorus of "Whoa!" echoed through the room.


Bobby called out, "Isaac, that was seriously so cheesy!"



As soon as lsaac finished, the groomsmen burst into laughter, hooting and hollering like a bunch of monkeys.



Verena couldn't stop herself from laughing, her giggles slipping out before she could even try to hide them.She never would have guessed Isaac, usually so reserved and proper, could pull off something this cheesy with such an easy smile.



Miranda was nearly in tears from laughing so hard,fanning her cheeks as she declared, "Okay, you win!Go on, your bride's waiting."
###Chapter 110 Alumna



At Miranda's words, the group of friends and family gathered close, surrounding Verena and Isaac as they descended the grand staircase.



The newlyweds got into their wedding car, followed by a convoy so long it seemed to stretch like a dragon across the road.



The ceremony unfolded at the ShineHaven Grand Hotel.



"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the bride and groom!"



With the emcee's booming voice, a waiter pushed open the heavy doors. Verena wheeled Isaac along the plush carpet, entering slowly as dreamy,romantic music floated through the air.


The vast hall glittered under the lights. Every table flanking the carpet was filled to capacity. Petals blanketed the floor, fresh roses adorned the room,and reporters stood in neat rows, waiting for the perfect shot.



The splendor and romance were just as Verena had always pictured. Halfway down, Isaac turned his head slightly and asked in a quiet tone, "Are you satisfied?"



His question struck a chord in Verena, making her suddenly realize something. She asked, "So you planned all this? No wonder the roses are everywhere.You called last time because you didn't know what l liked."



Isaac gave no clear answer-neither a nod nor denial.



Leaning in, she whispered at his ear, "I'm more than satisfied."



The tender moment between them was immediately captured by cameramen nearby, and naturally, the guests noticed it too.



In a corner, Kaia stared at the couple on the carpet,her fists clenching tight. Verena's every move was like a calculated step on a chessboard-she had crushed Kaia into the mud, leaving her ridiculed, while she herself soared to the summit of admiration, bathed in envious stares.



At last, Verena and Isaac reached the stage. After completing the formalities, the emcee raised his microphone toward Isaac. "Now, we invite the groom to recite his wedding vows."



This,in fact, was Isaac's own request. Taking the microphone, Isaac turned to Verena and spoke steadily. "Before I met you, I never imagined loving anyone so deeply. After meeting you, I never imagined loving anyone else. From this moment forward,you are my wife-sharing both my triumphs and my trials. I hereby declare half of my personal assets will belong to you. Your thoughts are my thoughts; your opinions, my opinions. Whoever disrespects you, disrespects me."



Verena hadn't expected such a vow. Isaac was never one to flaunt wealth or status, but this was clearly his proclamation to Shoildon's elite-that he cherished her as his wife and demanded their respect.



Her eyes brimmed with tears. Bending down, she slipped the ring onto his finger.


"I've heard your vows. I'll be the best wife I can be,and together we'll walk hand in hand through every season of life."



Their smiles met like sunlight breaking through clouds.


When Isaac finished, a stir rippled across the hall.



Everyone present understood-the first half of Isaac's vow was meant for Verena, but the second half was a declaration to the entire gathering, perhaps even to the city itself. And when Isaac openly promised to transfer half his personal fortune,shock spread like wildfire.Aside from Bennett Group,he held countless enterprises-wealth others couldn't amass in generations. And yet,he offered it away so easily?



"Wasn't it said Isaac despised this marriage and even struck against Willis Group? How could he give away such a fortune? Is that what dissatisfaction looks like?"



"Yes, that was the rumor. What's the truth here?"


"But if he truly loves Verena, why move against Alec -her own father?"



As the murmurs swelled, Alec's and Laura's faces turned pale.



At one table, Luka chewed his food carelessly,muttering, "Isaac must be out of his mind."



Kaia's fury mounted; she ground her teeth,clutching her glass until her knuckles cracked.



At another table, Barrie gazed at the couple on stage with a face full of quiet satisfaction.


After the ceremony, Isaac and Verena changed their attire and began making the rounds, toasting guests.



From the sidelines, Kaia seethed as she watched the couple,glowing with joy amid the crowd. She ground her teeth in resentment. Why? Why should Verena have both Isaac's love and devotion? The thought gnawed at her like a stone in the shoe.She could not accept it.



Thinking of her plan, Kaia let out a cold scoff. Verena could laugh all she wanted now. The higher she was lifted, the harder she'd fall. When she shamed Isaac before all of Shoildon's elite, Kaia wondered if Verena could still keep that smile.



From across the room, Slater, while chatting casually,caught sight of Kaia's bitter expression-as though she were hatching a plan.



Excusing himself, he approached her with a glass of wine in hand.



Without concealing his bite, he asked, "Jealous,seeing Verena happy despite all your schemes?"



Kaia shot him a glance, lips curving. "Yes, I'm jealous."


With that, she swirled her wine and turned away as though dismissing him.



Slater blinked, expecting venom but receiving composure instead. Something felt wrong.



His frown deepened-was Kaia truly plotting something? Meanwhile,Kaia,glass in hand, drifted toward a cluster of elites, taking up a spot easy to overlook. She and Verena had fallen out, so Verena surely wouldn't toast her directly. But the couple couldn't skip the others,could they?



And so it happened-Verena and Isaac drew near.



After toasting a few acquaintances, Adrian took a glance at Kaia and suddenly stepped forward, raising his glass before Verena.



"Mrs.Bennett, I hear you're also a Pine Hill University graduate. What a coincidence. Congratulations, my alumna."



Verena looked at Adrian, sensing his hostility,and asked curiously, "Alumna?"



Adrian replied with a smile, "Yes, I'm a Pine Hill University graduate, too. But it's a pity-a gorgeous fellow student like you attended university in the exact same year as me, and yet l've never once caught sight of you or even heard a peep about you."



His words carried an implication that made others feel there was more to it.


Just then, a young woman burst from the crowd,seizing Verena's arm. "Verena, it's really you! I never thought you'd do so well-marrying into wealth!" she exclaimed.



Verena looked at her in puzzlement. "You are?"


"Don't you remember? We studied at the same community college, old schoolmates. We even joined activities together. Back then, we always joked you'd land a rich husband because of your beauty. And now you really have!" Her voice rang loud and clear,drawing attention all around.Gasps spread through the hall.



"What's going on?"



"Wasn't Verena a Pine Hill UJniversity graduate? How does community college come into it?"



"It must be false. Why would lsaac marry someone from a community college?"


"But first it's Pine Hill, then community college-what's true anymore?"



"What's to doubt? Likely she lied, ashamed of her education."



Listening to the murmur, Barrie's eyes narrowed.Leaning on his cane, he asked Fletcher, "Who's behind this trick?"



Fletcher scanned the room,replying,"I'll find out." Meanwhile, Verena, still held by the woman,stood calm as a lake untouched by wind, her face betraying no ripple of emotion.



Isaac, however, fixed Adrian with a cold stare, his thoughts running deep as the tide.
###Chapter 111 Allow Me To Introduce Myself As Your Senior

The entire hall remained alive with murmurs and hushed conversations.



"Everyone was fooled by the Wills family's trickery,weren't they? I doubt the Willises ever thought their secret would be dragged into the light in such a humiliating fashion."



"That's the reason people dismiss Verena as nothing more than a small-town girl. Dishonesty clings to her,and no one can tell anymore when she's lying or telling the truth."


"The Willis family has brought disgrace on themselves. Their lie about Verena's educational background was exposed at the wedding, and the shame doesn't just stain Verena. It smears the entire family name." "Climbers like them never shed their rough edges.They lack refinement, and their children carry the same flaws."


"Willis Group's standing in the business world wil surely take a blow after this."


"Bankruptcy seems to be where this family is headed now."


Every whisper around Laura pierced deeper, and the words "climbers" and "boankruptcy" stripped the color from her cheeks. Right then, her hatred for Verena festered, though her resentment burned even hotter for the one who had chosen to expose Verena's lies.


Anger coursed through Alec as well. His cheeks flushed red, his mouth pressed shut, and his eyes glared with fire.


While Laura drowned in humiliation, Alec sensed something deeper. He remembered Kaia claiming Verena had lied about her education a few days earlier.The thought made his chest rise sharply. Even if Verena had never gone to Pine Hill University,even if the lie was true, humiliating her before everyone was still cruel. The shame didn't fall on Verena alone but smeared the Willis family as a whole. He had warned Kaia not to create trouble during the wedding, but she ignored him and brushed aside his words.


His temper pushed him toward confronting her,though he forced himself to hold back and wait for events to unfold.


Grinding his teeth, Alec wrestled with his anger and fought the urge to shatter the wine glass in his hand.


Bobby and Slater listened to the crowd, and the worry on their faces grew clearer with every word.


With a deep frown, Bobby looked at the strange woman, baffled. "Who let this woman in? What on earth is going on? How can someone just barge into the wedding?"


Slater looked just as stunned. Remembering the bitterness on Kaia's face from their earlier talk, a  thought struck him, and he blurted out, "Wait, could that lunatic Kaia be behind this?"



Bobby's face hardened as he seized Slater by the collar. "What did you just say about Kaia?"


Caught off guard, Slater stammered, "I don't know for certain, but let's go find out."


Spectators crowded around Verena, and the number of onlookers swelled as more pressed in to see the scene.



Isaac glared coldly at Adrian, about to speak, when Verena laid a calming hand on his shoulder.


When Isaac lifted his eyes to her, Verena answered with a tranquil smile that told him she could manage it herself.


At her signal, Isaac gave a slight nod.


Through the throng, Verena directed her gaze straight to Kaia standing at the rear.


Verena's eyes glinted with cold detachment as they  locked with Kaia's taunting grin.


Turning her attention back to the woman in front of her, Verena remarked deliberately, "You say we went to the same community college. So tell me, which one? Where is it? And what year was | supposedly admitted to that college?"


Step by step, Verena advanced as she spoke, her composed manner pressing heavily on the woman before her.


The woman had only been told to repeat the prepared lines, with no real details to rely on.


Unease spread across her face as her eyes flickered nervously, and she blurted out, "It was Lanteglos Community College, and you attended college in 2014."


At the reply, Verena let out a light, careless laugh.11SO1Lanteglos Community College, 2014..."


After a brief pause, she shifted her gaze to Adrian."This man claims he went to the same school l did.  Strange, isn't it? On my wedding day, without me inviting anyone, two supposed alumni just happen to show up."


With a faintly amused smile tugging at her lips,Verena went on, "I never said which year I attended university, yet you insist we were classmates. Tell me,sir, what year did you attend university?"


Verena's pointed words tied Adrian to the woman,hinting at their collusion. The logic held, because Verena had not revealed the year she attended university, leaving no reason for Adrian to know it.


The reaction unfolded as expected, with the crowd looking puzzled and unable to make sense of the situation.


Adrian understood that the ruse could not last, since their arrival looked far too coincidental. Still, that meant little to him, because his only aim was to expose Verena's lie, no matter whose plan it had been,


Without hesitation, he answered, "I attended university in 2016, majoring in Computer Science."


"2016," Verena repeated softly. "That explains why you've never heard of me."


A calm smile spread across Verena's face as she spoke with deliberate clarity. "Since you're unfamiliar with me, allow me to introduce myself as your senior.I am Verena Willis. I was admitted to Pine Hill University in 2015, majoring in Clinical Medicine."


The specifics left Adrian stunned for only a moment before Verena added, "As it happens, one of my friends was also in your department. I'll call her over,and she can explain just how large Pine Hill University is, with so many students that not knowing a name is hardly surprising."


Right then, Miranda came back from fixing her makeup behind the scenes. Spotting the cluster of people, she caught bits of the ongoing talk as she approached.


When she saw Verena trapped in the crowd, Miranda forced her way forward and asked, "What's  happening here?"
###Chapter 112 Genuine Graduate Of Pine Hill University
"There you are, I was about to call you," said Verena as she turned to Miranda. "This man insists he's from Pine Hill University, yet strangely, he acts as though he doesn't even understand how vast the campus is.He claims not knowing me is proof I never graduated from there. And before I had the chance to respond,another woman jumped in, saying | was her classmate at some community college. Can you step in and confirm that I truly graduated from Pine Hill University?"


With wide eyes, Adrian fixed his gaze on Miranda."Miranda?"



The thought that Miranda could really be Verena's friend was something he struggled to accept.


The moment Miranda appeared, the distinguished guests grew restless. The younger heirs were too inexperienced with family businesses to recognize her. The older executives had dealt with overseas corporations for years, so they knew who she was right away.


A wave of astonishment rippled through the crowd.


"That's Ms. Brown!"



"Hasn't she settled overseas? What's she doing here?"





"Hold on, is Verena's friend actually Ms. Brown?"


"Could Ms. Brown really have come all this way just to attend Verena's wedding?"


"Who is this Ms. Brown anyway?" one of the newly rich businessmen asked in confusion.



"Are you serious? You don't know who she is?"someone nearby responded. "Surely you've heard of AuroraNexus,"



"Of course, everyone knows it's the sixth largest conglomerate in the world." "Her full name is Miranda Brown. She graduated with honors from Pine Hlill University and today she's the CEO of AuroraNexus."



"What? She's that young?"


Someone else shook his head with a sigh of respect."Her age doesn't mean a thing. Her ability is far beyond anything we could ever compete with."


By listening carefully to Verena, Miranda caught on that Adrian and the woman were intentionally stirring up trouble for Verena.


Miranda laid a protective hand gently on Verena's shoulder.



"So, the claim is that Verena didn't graduate from Pine Hill University, isn't it?" she asked, throwing a glance toward Adrian. "Showing off about schools may not be admirable, but certain truths must be made clear. Otherwise, there will always be people ready to misjudge and belittle my closest friend."


Miranda fixed Adrian with a cold look full of disdain. "Listen closely. Verena is a true graduate of Pine HHill University. She's not only my fellow alumna but also my dearest friend. If you dare to look down on her,you insult me as well. If you stand against her, then you stand against me."


The moment she finished, the crowd erupted into a stir.



The intent of Miranda's words was unmistakable.She was openly pledging her support for Verena, and by tying their friendship to Pine Hill University, she hinted that Verena could never have been a mere community college graduate. Without that shared background, Verena would never have even crossed paths with her.


"Could Verena actually be a graduate of Pine Hill University?"


"If Ms. Browvn herself says so, then it has to be true."


"Then how do we explain those two who came forward before?" "I think this must have been part of a setup!"


As Miranda's declaration sank in, the elite guests broke into murmurs among themselves.


The ones who didn't know the truth of the matter were quickly influenced by the opinions and gestures around them.



Slater and Bobby had never doubted Verena, so the question of her degree barely crossed their minds.What they were truly trying to take in was the shocking revelation about Miranda.


Slater blinked hard, snapping his mouth shut before blurting out, "Unbelievable, the stunning bridesmaid we were talking to is really the CEO of AuroraNexus!"


Bobby looked just as bewildered. "Who could have guessed?"


Laura gripped the hem of her dress with force, a wave of relief washing over her at the news that Verena was cleared. Thankfully, that troublesome girl wouldn't be pulling them down. Yet as Miranda's  words lingered, an unspoken regret flickered in her gaze. Verena truly had luck on her side. Had she realized just how capable Verena was, she never would have treated her so poorly.


The moment Miranda came into view, Alec pushed himself up sharply from his chair. Hiseyes narrowed,uncertain if he was seeing correctly, but the whispers around him confirmed she really was the CEO of AuroraNexus, twisting his expression into something conflicted.



"We're glad to hear your daughter's name has been cleared, Mr. Willis. You must be relieved."


"That's right, Mr. Willis. You absolutely need to uncover who attempted to ruin such an important event."



The businessmen's demeanor flipped in an instant.Only minutes before, they had kept their distance from him because of Verena, yet now they forced smiles and lifted their glasses as though none of it had ever happened.  Alec didn't wish to answer, but with a rigid smile, he responded, "Of course, certainly."


While the words left his mouth, Kaia's remarks from a few days ago echoed in his head, and a sudden realization struck him.


Kaia's complexion turned ghostly, her lips fading into a purplish hue as allvitality drained from her.


From within the crowd, she felt the change in the air and stumbled backward a few steps, her legs trembling so badly she nearly collapsed.


Her retreat continued, yet her gaze clung desperately to Verena.


"Why?" Kaia asked, her voice so faint she could barely hear it herself.


Nothing could explain how things had ended up like this. Miranda was meant to be Adrian's connection,not Verena's. After all the effort Kaia put in to get Miranda's contact information, finding out now that Miranda belonged firmly on Verena's side felt like a  cruel twist.



The disappointment was suffocating. Why did Verena find everything so easily, while Kaia was left empty-handed, no matter how hard she tried?
###Chapter 113 Kaia Was The Mastermind
Kaia burned with anger, desperate to demand an explanation from Verena for the cruel deception. Why go through the trouble of pretending to be useless,only to throw the truth back at her in the most humiliating way?


Her parents said Verena quit school. They insisted she was undereducated. Yet now she stood as a proud graduate of Pine Hill University, linked arm in arm with the CEO of AuroraNexus. The whole thing felt like a bitter joke.


Even so, Kaia swallowed her rage. She lacked the standing to challenge Verena, and she knew it. The odds were stacked against her, so she used the growing commotion as cover and started edging her way out of the crowd.


All the while, Slater never took his eyes off her. The instant he noticed her retreat, he closed the distance in a few strides, caught her by the arm, and smirked."Cause a scene, then think you can just slip away?Not so fast," he said.


Her panic had already left her unsteady, and his sudden grip knocked the strength out of her legs.She lunged for the table tokeep herself upright,but in doing so, she yanked the tablecloth down. In an instant, she landed on the floor as glasses toppled and wine splashed across her. Humiliation soaked her more deeply than the red stains on her dress.


The shattering glass silenced the room, every eye now locked on her.


From across the hall, Adrian rushed forward the moment he saw her fall. He bent down quickly and reached for her arm. "Kaia, are you hurt?" he asked,worry etched in his voice.


Verena watched from her corner, idly swirling her wine with a satisfied smile tugging at her lips. "So,this gentleman has ties to my sister. That explains why he went to such lengths to accuse me," she said, her tone sharp enough to cut through the air.


Adrian's hand faltered, his words dying before they could leave his mouth.



Verena's pointed remark left no room for doubt,forcing everyone around them to face the truth.


Whispers filled the air as curious glances turned toward Adrian and Kaia, and the tension grew heavy.


Meanwhile, the woman who had earlier boasted about being Verena's old schoolmate began to inch backward. Hoping to avoid notice, she slipped toward the edge of the crowd, praying to vanish before anyone thought to question her again.


The moment she tried to slip away, Verena's sharp eyes caught her, and she yanked her back to stand face-to-face with Kaia.



Kaia had stirred up trouble for her time and again,and Verena was determined not to let her escape the consequences this time.


With a tone as sharp as ice, Verena sneered,"Who put you up to this? Who told you to drag my name through the dirt?"


Her questions were aimed at the woman, while her glare stayed locked on Kaia, a chill radiating from Verena's eyes with every word.


The woman cast a nervous look at Kaia, her expression torn between fear and loyalty, but her lips stayed tightly sealed.


That silence only hardened Verena's resolve. She twisted the woman's wrist until a cry of pain broke free.



"You heard what everyone said earlier," Verena remarked, her voice cutting through the crowd."My closest friend happens to be the CEO of AuroraNexus. Think about it. Do you really want me as your enemy-or someone far less powerful?"


Isaac, watching from the sidelines, felt a deep crease form in his brow. A wife should lean on her husband when things turn ugly. Yet in this moment, Verena chose Miranda instead of him. Shouldn't hebe the  one she trusted most?


His gaze dropped, frustration weighing heavily in his chest.





The name AuroraNexus alone made the woman pale -that was why she had tried to flee earlier. Although she didn't know the company, the wary glances from the wealthy guests had told her she had picked the wrong target. She had realized Verena was not someone she could afford to cross.


Fear loosened her tongue at last. "I'll confess! I'll confess!" she blurted out, her body trembling.


Backing away, she pointed toward Kaia, stammering,"It was... Miss Kaia Willis. She ordered me to ruin your wedding. She said to claim you came from some unknown college like me. She promised one hundred thousand dollars once I finished the job."


Gasps rippled through the hall, and the guests quickly began whispering among themselves.


"So Kaia was the mastermind all along." "How could she do this to her own sister on her wedding day?"


"You must not know their story. They were raised apart, so there's no bond between them. Kaia probably wanted to drag Verena down below her."


"That's right. And don't forget Slater's post. Every rumor about Verena's so-called fake background and her supposed arrogance came straight from Kaia.Let's be honest-none of us even knew Verena before this, so who else could dig up those details besides her own family? Kaia clearly doesn't care about her sister. She just wanted to destroy her."


Color drained from Alec's face as the crowd whispered around him.


Nearby, a few of the city's elite couldn't resist piling on.


One of the influential men clicked his tongue and sneered, "At the end of the day, this is nothing but family shame.Having sisters who turn on each other says a lot about the way the Willis family raised astermind them."


Another man barked out a laugh. "Raised them?More like trained them to compete in secret and choke on jealousy."


"Ha-ha..." The group around them erupted in laughter, their voices echoing with cruelty.


Pain twisted inside Alec as their mockery cut into him like blades. His hands clamped down on his knees,but the pressure in his chest left him struggling to breathe. He couldn't stand the humiliation a second longer.


On unsteady legs, Alec rose and strode toward Kaia.


The gossip unsettled Laura, and she hurried after him. "Where are you going?" she asked, her voice tight.


Alec shot her a cold look. "To clean upo the disaster,"he said flatly.


Forcing his way through the gawking crowd, Alec stopped in front of Verena. He straightened his back and addressed the guests with a heavy voice. "Everyone, my younger daughter's reckless behavior caused tonight's chaos.I ask for your understanding and hope you'll forgive her."



Then he addressed Verena, saying, "Your sister humiliated you on a day meant for joy. I'll be taking Kaia home, and I promise she'll answer for this."


Kaia's arm was seized in his grasp, and he pulled her harshly toward the exit.


Behind them, Laura rushed forward, Luka following right after.


Adrian's body tensed at the sight and he started to move, but a voice stopped him cold. "Mr. Carter."


Adrian turned around immediately, only to meet Isaac's unyielding gaze, sharp enough to pin him in place.


Isaac didn't have to stand to make people uneasy.Just sitting there, he carried himself with a quiet authority that kept everyone on edge.


Adrian remembered his father's warning well-Isaac Bennett never forgave insults and carried a reputation for decisiveness.


The thought left Adrian uneasy, and he swallowed hard before asking, "What do you need from me?"


Isaac raised his chin and spoke coldly. "We're not finished here. Your father and I have always kept our business apart, and l've always seen him as a man who deserves respect. I won't move against the Carter family because of your actions today. Still,you crossed a line. Shouldn't you be offering my wife an apology?"


Miranda's presence made Adrian think twice, and the realization hit him-she would never align herself with someone undeserving. If Verena lacked integrity,Miranda would never have called her a friend.


That clarity pushed Adrian to bow his head before Verena. "Mrs. Bennett, I acted poorly. It was a careless mistake, and I hope you'll pardon me." No trace of forgiveness showed in Verena's eyes.After a short glance, she spoke evenly. "Whatever connection you may share with Kaia, let me offer you this-be mindful of the company you keep, or you'll bring harm not only to others but to yourself."
A slight pause followed before her smile returned."And since you were never invited tonight, Mr. Carter,I'll have to ask you to leave."
The whispers around the room grew louder, and embarrassment weighed heavily on Adrian. He mumbled another apology, and then walked away with his head lowered.
###Chapter 114 Are You Let Down By Me
By the time the last guest left and the wedding wound down, the clock had already pushed past ten.


Once they returned to Seraphina Villas, both Verena and Isaac showered. Later, Verena settled at her vanity, carefully going through her skincare routine.


When Isaac wheeled himself out of the bathroom,she helped him ease onto the bed so he could rest.


His eyes swept the space around him. Festive decorations filled the bedroom, new linens brightened the bed, and above the headboard,a framed wedding portrait stared back at him.


Every detail pressed the same truth into his mind-this was their wedding night.


A sudden tension crept into his expression, his lips pressing thin as unease clouded his gaze. Tonight should have been the night for intimacy,but his condition made that impossible.


His gaze dropped to the new blanket covering his legs.


When Verena finished her routine, she noticed Isaac's slumped posture and troubled face.


Confused, she walked over, took his face between her hands, and tilted it up. "Why the long face?Today's supposed to be a celebration. Smile for me,"she said softly.


Her skin carried the faint fragrance of her lotions,and Isaac breathed it in as he murmured, "Are you let down by me?"


Verena frowned slightly. "Let down? What are you talking about?"


It took him a moment before he confessed, voice low."We're married now. This is supposed to be a romantic night for intimacy. But with my health...I can't give you what you deserve." Before he could say more, Verena cut him off with a laugh. "Honestly, who still clings to that idea? Just because it's our wedding night doesn't mean we have to do anything. And between you and me, I'm exhausted after the long day. I don't think either of us has the energy for more."


She leaned closer, pressing her forehead against his."So quit worrying. I'm fine with things just as they are."



A faint twitch passed through Isaac's brows as he dropped his gaze, his eyes settling blankly on the deep red of Verena's lips.


Did she truly mean that... or did she simply not want any real intimacy with him?


Would her answer be the same if the man before her wasn't him but the first love she once cherished?


That thought looped in lsaac's head until the pressure in his throat forced him back into the present. No-that wasn't right.


Verena belonged to him now, his wife by choice and by law. Not even the shadow of the man she once adored could take her away.


"Are you getting drowsy?" Verena asked as she suddenly let go of him.


Isaac blinked a few times, forcing the conflict from his expression so she wouldn't catch on.


He gave the smallest shake of his head. "Not exactly."





Her gaze lingered on him, and a sly smile tugged at her lips. With one finger, she traced down the edge of his collar until it hooked around the final button."Then maybe we ought to find something else to pass the time."


A pulse throbbed against his temples, and for a moment he had no words.


Hadn't she just said she was too exhausted for anything? Why change her mind so suddenly?


Before he could voice the question, Verena hopped from the bed with a burst of laughter. "Never mind.You don't need to give me an answer.Since you've got too much on your mind to rest, I'll just give you another treatment session instead. Wait here-I'll fetch the medical kit."


Not giving him the chance to argue, she darted out of the room and soon came back with the slim medical case in hand.


Isaac remained slow to react until the first silver needle pierced his skin, sending a sharp jolt along his nerves.



So this was what she had meant by "something else"-it was tending to his health.



**.


At the gates of Willis Villa, the car rolled to a stop.Alec climbed out first, dragging Kaia behind himas her cries of pain cut through the night, proof of the strength in his grip.


Startled by the sudden uproar, Laura and Luka exchanged uneasy looks. Snapping at the servants who lingered nearby, Laura yelled, "What are you standing around for? Leave at once!" Luka, however,hurried after Alec to see what was happening.


Seething with rage, Alec dragged Kaia into the living room and shoved her forward with such force she stumbled.


Thrown off balance, Kaia nearly crashed to the floor.


"Dad..." Kaia called out, but a sudden slap cut through the air and struck her cheek hard. The sound rang out, sharp and unforgiving. Her face flushed with heat as pain rippled through her in an instant.


With his hand still trembling, Alec jabbed a finger toward her, his voice rough with fury. "I told you not to cause trouble at Verena's wedding. You didn't listen. Now you'll pay for it."

 
Panicked, Kaia spun to run upstairs, but his hand caught her hair and yanked her backward.


Fueled by anger, Alec dragged her down and threw her onto the sofa, his palm striking her again and again before she could even raise her arms.


Her ears rang until the room seemed to vanish, tears spilling over bruises as her hair tangled wildly across her face.


Laura and Luka burst in at that moment, horrified by the sight.


Laura rushed forward to seize Alec's arm, while Luka bent to help Kaia up from the cushions.


When Kaia finally lifted her head, her face was so swollen and bruised Luka could barely recognize her."Kaia..." he whispered in shock.


Seeing her daughter's condition, Laura's voice cracked as she screamed, "Stop, Alec! Stop it before you kill her!"


Alec's chest rose and fell heavily as he wrenched his arm free , shoving Laura aside so she collapsed to the  floor.



"Kaia ended up like this because you kept shielding her. Do you even see what we've done? We've seriously offended Verena and the entire Bennett family. If you keep standing up for her, she'll drag this whole family down with her."


His voice thundered through the house, each word ringing in Laura's ears. Fear gripped her so tightly her teeth chattered, and though she wanted to defend Kaia,she knew Alec spoke the truth.


The Bennett family was far beyond their reach.


And Verena had become someone they could never afford to cross.
###Chapter 115 I'm Still Crazy About Him

Luka wasn't troubled by Laura's worries. His mind was fixed on the fact that his sister had been brutally beaten.


When Alec's fists tightened and it looked like he might lash out again, Luka stepped between them,placing Kaia behind his back. "Dad, don't do anything rash! Please try to calm down. I get that you're furious, but we need to find out the truth first.There's a real chance Kaia's being framed here-someone else might be behind this..."


Kaia cut him off, her voice clear. "No. I'm the one who did it."


Lying to Alec would only make things worse. She was done pretending.


With her face red and swollen, Kaia glared at her father, her eyes burning with resentment. "What now? You planning to kill me or something? Your entire life revolves around keeping up appearances.You never cared about any of your daughters, not really."


Her words struck Alec like a slap, landing exactly where it hurt most.


His features twisted with rage, and he spat out,11|S that so? Then I'll do as you say-I'll beat my ungrateful daughter to death right now."


Before he could lift his hand a second time, Laura and Luka stepped in and held him back.



"Get your hands off me! Let go!" Alec yelled;his voice rough as he fought against the two holding him down.



Kaia flashed him one last look of defiance, pushed herself up from the sofa, and bolted for the door.Alec's voice chased her down the hall. "If you're so bold, don't ever set foot in this house again!"


Without the slightest pause, Kaia bolted from the villa. She raced out into the open, but in a place this  remote, there wasn't a taxi in sight.


Her breath came in ragged gasps as she finally slowed, her chest burning.


At least her phone was still with her. With trembling hands, she dialed Adrian.


"Kaia?" The sound of his voice felt like a lifeline in a storm.


Her words broke apart as she said, "Adrian, my father nearly beat me to death. I just managed to get away,and I have nowhere to go. Can you come for me?"


Adrian's reply was hesitant. His mind flashed back to Isaac's warning at the wedding.


With his father still holding the reins of the family business, Adrian had no room for error-especially now, with every move being watched to gauge whether he was fit to take over. Crossing Isaac could cost him more than pride. It could put the entire company at risk.


The silence stretched before Adrian finally spoke, his voice low. "Kaia, I'm sorry. I just can't step in this time."



The line went dead.


The steady beep on the other end left Kaia frozen,her mind reeling with disbelief.


He had never once gone against her wishes-Adrian had always done as she asked.


How could this be happening?


Desperate, she dialed his number again, but this time, all she reached was his voicemail.


Kaia's fingers clenched the phone so hard, her knuckles lost all color. Though her teeth had broken the skin on her lip, she didn't feel a thing.


Numb to everything except the burning hatred that filled her chest, she pinned all the blame on Verena.


In her mind, Verena was the one who had driven everyone she loved far away.


A sudden crack of thunder tore through the sky,and within seconds, the rain came down in sheets,giving her no time to find shelter.


Drenched to the bone, Kaia's hair clung to her skin and her makeup ran down her cheeks, leaving her looking like some haunted specter in the downpour.


Thunder rolled again, louder this time.


It wasn't until that moment that Kaia thought to find Cover.



The storm made it almost impossible to see, and after a few steps, she lost her footing, tumbling into a puddle and scraping her hands and knees. Rainwater mixed with fresh tears on her face, hot and cold running together.


Blood welled from her scraped skin, and as she watched it trickle down, Kaia's eyes turned glassy and red, veins standing out.


It hit her then-she truly had no one left. She was utterly alone. The day after the wedding, Verena found a message from Miranda waiting-she was asking if she could drop by and spend some time together.


Reluctantly leaving her bed, Verena freshened up and went downstairs, finding Isaac already at the breakfast table.


With a warm smile, she said, "Good morning."


Isaac looked up, a faint smile on his lips. "Why not sleep a little longer?"


The maid handed Verena a slice of toast, and she replied, "A friend's dropping by today."


"Miranda, right?" he guessed.


She gave a brief nod.


Breakfast had barely ended when Miranda appeared.


After a quick nod in Isaac's direction, she led Verena upstairs without another word.


Miranda wandered through the master bedroom,taking in every detail before giving an approving sigh. "Nice place. It's your favorite theme."


Spotting the crisp new linens on the bed, she shot Verena a playful grin and nudged her.11SO,did you have fun last night?"


With a sharp glare, Verena snapped, "Don't pretend you don't already know."


Only Miranda had been entrusted with Isaac's secret,so her teasing was all in good fun.


Laughing, Miranda held up her hands. "Okay, I'll drop it."





Meanwhile, Isaac was downstairs flipping through the business section of the newspaper. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the maid making her way toward the staircase.



"Where are you headed?" he called out.


Pausing with polite composure, the maid said, "I'm on my way to deliver a fruit platter to Mrs. Bennett and Miss Beckett." Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair over. "I'll take it. Let me bring it to them myself."


It seemed only right for him to look after his wife's guest.



Upstairs, Miranda and Verena were deep in conversation when Miranda suddenly grinned as a memory popped into her head. "Hey, what about your first boyfriend? You were so head-over-heels,always saying he was the only one who had your heart. He seemed flawless-so what went wrong?Why did it end?"



Just as Isaac lifted his hand to knock, Miranda's words from inside caught his ear.


His hand paused, hovering in the air, a surge of nerves making him hesitate.


For a moment, he worried what answer might come,even as a part of him held out hope.


He wished more than anything to hear what his heart longed for. A beat later, Verena's answer came through the door,light and teasing. "I could never forget him. I'm still crazy about him, to be honest."


Miranda burst into laughter, shaking her head."You're impossible!"


Their giggles echoed in the room, and Isaac's heart fell as he listened from the hallway.


Dropping his gaze, he turned his wheelchair from the hallway and headed into the elevator, descending to the lower floor.


After the laughter faded, Verena's tone grew earnest."If I'm being honest, my first love is lsaac. But he doesn't remember any of it now."
###Chapter 116 What Do You Want
 "What? Isaac?" Miranda's voice shot up before she quickly covered her mouth,lowering her tone. "Does Isaac even know that your very first love was him?"


Verena shook her head gently. "He doesn't know at all. His memory has gaps, and if I suddenly revealed the truth, it might weigh too heavily on him in his current state."


Drawing in a steady breath, she shrugged lightly. "It's alright. There's no rush. After all, we're married now,and I'll help him rediscover me bit by bit."


Miranda paused, and then nodded. With Isaac by Verena's side, there was time enough for memory to return.


"But tell me-can lsaac's condition actually be cured? It's not that I doubt you. Your skills are remarkable, but there are exceptions to every rule.What if he never recovers?" Verena, sensing her friend's worry, spoke with calm assurance. "Don't trouble yourself. I'm confident in his case. I've been treating him with traditional remedies and therapy-methods that restore balance from within. Once the risks are lowered, we'll move on to surgery, which will greatly raise the chances of succesS."


At the mention of surgery, Miranda's mind went back to that late-night call after Shawna's passing, when Verena had confessed her right hand trembled every time she held a scalpel.


She had recognized then that it was more than physical-it was psychological.


Looking closely at her friend, Miranda asked with concern, "If you're going to operate, can you even handle the scalpel now?"


Verena's brows drew together faintly at the question,but she forced a small smile. "I'm working through it.The trembling isn't gone completely, but it eases with each attempt. By the time the surgery comes, I'll have crossed that mental barrier." Miranda knew some wounds healed only with patience and strength from within.


"Alright then. Do what you must. I trust you." She exhaled, and then added softly, "I actually came today to tell you-I'm leaving tomorrow."


"So soon?" A hint of reluctance laced Verena's tone."Can't you stay just a few more days?"


Miranda chuckled."Oh,come on. I flew back just for your wedding. Now that it's over, mountains of work are piling up at the company."


Realizing her friend's schedule was packed, Verena relented. "Then promise me you'll take care of yourself. Don't just work endlessly-remember to rest."



Miranda, never one for long, teary farewells, slipped an arm around Verena's shoulders and teased,1"A you're already missing me, aren't you? How about knock your husband unconscious and we run off together?" Verena, used to her antics, played along with a grin.

"Don't just talk big-let's see you follow through!"


For a heartbeat, Miranda faltered, recalling Isaac's anxious expression when he came to fetch Verena on the wedding day.



"If I truly ran off with you, wouldn't your husband hunt me down?" Clicking her tongue,she shook her head. "Forget it. I value my life far too much."


Her words drew a soft laugh from Verena.


After the laughter faded, Miranda's tone grew earnest. "We walk different paths, and distance will always be between us-that's life. Don't worry about me, I'll look after myself. But as for you, don't let anyone trample on you. Hold on to that confidence you showed at the wedding. If anyone dares cross you, I'm just a call away. And if Isaac ever dares to wrong you, I'll be on the next plane, ready to give him a tongue-lashing he won't forget."



She clenched her fist to punctuate her words. To Verena, Miranda was more than a friend-she was family. Her heart warmed with gratitude.


"Thank you, Miranda," she said sincerely, a smnile breaking across her face.


Time slipped away quickly when shared with an old friend.





Glancing at her watch, Miranda sighed. "I'd better head back now."



"Stay for lunch at least?" Verena tried to keep her longer.





But Miranda picked up her handbag. "No, thanks.I have a video meeting to attend later."


"Alright," Verena conceded, "I won't hold you back if you're busy."


As they went downstairs, Miranda spotted Isaac in the living room. Verena's words about him being her first love and his amnesia echoed in her mind, stirring both pity and a quiet approval of him. She greeted him politely, "Mr. Bennett, I won't trouble you further. Until next time."


Isaac's gaze lingered briefly on Verena walking alongside Miranda, before he quickly looked away.


He inclined his head slightly toward Miranda, his voice cool and measured. "Take care, Miss Beckett."


"I'II see her out," Verena said.


Isaac merely nodded, not meeting her eyes.


Miranda had come by car, so the two women chatted beside it for a few more moments.



Inside, Isaac wheeled himself to the window,his eyes tracing Verena's silhouette in the distance.


Her smile glowed like sunlight, yet his mind echoed with her earlier words. "I could never forget him. I'm still crazy about him, to be honest."


His chest burned; bitterness gnawed at him.


Isaac had believed that man was only her past,while he was her present and future. He thought she would at least deny those feelings, especially under the roof they now shared.


But instead, she had spoken with startling candor.


Her openness felt like a knife twisting in his chest.


Isaac stared at her bright smile, his lashes quivering,his heart'ablaze with suffocating pain.


"Verena, how should I treat you?" he whispered.


When Verena returned after seeing Miranda off,she found Isaac gazing blankly out the window.


"Isaac?" she called softly.


He gave no reply.


Perplexed, she called again, "Isaac?"


Still no answer. She stepped closer, her voice laced with concern. "What are you thinking about? l've called you several times. Didn't you hear me?"


He startled from his thoughts, eyes falling instinctively on her lovely face. The words slipped out before he could stop them. "What do you want?"


Deep down, he wanted to know why Verena came close to him.What was it that she truly wanted?


"Huh?" Verena leaned nearer, confusion written in her eyes. "You're asking what I want? Why ask something like that?"


When he realized he had spoken too rashly, panic flickered across his gaze. Isaac feared she would glimpse his hidden doubt and walk away.


Forcing composure, he caught her hand, giving it a light squeeze as he shook his head. "I only meant-tell me what you like. I'm not a romantic man, but l want to give you everything I can."


Looking into his dark, unfathomable eyes, Verena broke into a smile. She leaned close to his ear,her voice soft yet teasing. "Isaac, you sly man. You say you're not romantic, but everything you do tells a different story."
###Chapter 117 Are You Avoiding Me
Silence fell as lsaac turned his head, watching her through lowered lashes. Verena could not help but study him, her gaze drifting from the sharp cut of his cheekbones to the strong line of his nose, and finally to the way his lips pressed together.


A faint shimmer danced in Verena's eyes. She savored every second at his side, warmed by the feeling that everything around them felt perfect.


Drawing in a quiet breath, she rested against his chest, tilting her head until their faces hovered dangerously close.


Right before their lips could meet, Isaac shifted abruptly, turning his face away from hers.


Caught off guard, Verena blinked; she then reached out and gently guided his chin back toward her."Isaac, are you avoiding me?" she said, her voice edged with hurt. He could not look away from the honesty in her eyes,his lips drawn into a tense line.



She was the person he cared for most,yet something inside him would not let him accept her touch so easily.



Maybe it was jealousy gnawing at him, or that sick feeling of doubt. What if, even when her lips brushed his, her mind wandered to another man?


The thought alone was enough to drive him out of his mind.



Yet every time he faced her, the words dissolved before he could voice his doubt.


A quiet fear haunted him, whispering that if he questioned her, Verena would walk away for good.


Losing her was the one thing he could not allow-not even in his worst nightmares.


In a sudden burst of impulse, lsaac caught her wrist and drew her closer, almost desperately. A gasp escaped her as she landed right in his lap, her surprise written across her face.


Without thinking, she looped her arms around his neck. "What's going on, Isaac? Talk to me," she said.


Instead of answering, lsaac held her tightly, pressing his face into her shoulder as if he could hide from the world there.


His head dipped, and Verena's fingers wandered to the ridge at the base of his neck, her touch featherlight.


Her cool fingertips brushed his skin, sparking a shiver that ran down his spine and made his whole body tense.


He drew in a shaky breath, clinging to the comfort of her familiar scent.


Reality stung-he knew deep down that her heart belonged elsewhere, and he was just a fleeting comfort.


Still, he could not bring himself to let her go or shatter the fragile illusion they shared.


For now, he would settle for this fragile closeness,pretending for a moment that he was the one she truly loved.


He could not help but scoff at how ridiculous it all was-how far he had fallen.


None of it mattered in the end.


As long as she remained with him, Isaac was willing to ignore the rest of the world.


The faint trace of her perfume sent his heart racing,every breath leaving him a little more unsteady.


Every feeling inside him screamed with the need to keep her close, to never let her slip away.


Warm breath danced across the thin fabric of her shirt, sending a wave oftingles along her skin.


Giggling, Verena gave his shoulder a soft push and said, "Isaac, stop that! You're making me squirm."


As soon as her playful tone reached him, Isaac pulled back, meeting her gaze with affection.


He breathed out her name, barely more than a rough whisper. "Verena..."


He almost never spoke her name so softly, and for a fleeting second, she wondered if he had regainedhis memory.



She found herself lost in his face, caught off guard by how striking he looked in that moment.


A gentle tremor flickered in his lashes. His dark eyes,bright and vulnerable, watched her with an intensity that left his cheeks burning and his lips parted, silent but hungry for more.


Without thinking, Verena's throat tightened as she tried to steady herself.


Something about him right then was utterly irresistible.





She saw no point in holding back now-not when everything in her urged her to close the distance. Unable to fight it any longer, she pressed forward,closing the gap between them.


But before she could reach him, lsaac claimed her mouth first.


A startled gasp slipped from her lips, but she melted into his kiss, responding with a hunger of her own.


His kisses had always been tender, but now there was a new kind of urgency in the way he moved.


There was fire behind every touch, a possessiveness that left her breathless and wanting more.


Each kiss seemed to steal the air from her lungs,the closeness almost overwhelming.


Blinking through the haze, she caught a glimpse of his flushed cheeks and trembling lashes.


Noticing her sudden pause, lsaac tugged gently at her lower lip with his teeth, teasing her before pulling away just enough to leave her wanting.


A rush of warmth pulsed through Verena as her grip tightened around his shoulders, the fire of his touch burning right through the thin fabric.


Lost in one another, their lips met again and again,neither willing to let the moment slip away.


A sudden shift in Isaac's crotch made her pause,her breath catching mid-kiss.


A jolt of realization brought a playful thrill, and she drew back, breathless, whispering, "Wait, Isaac-hold on."


Before she could move further, Isaac shot her a defiant look and leaned in, murmuring, "Don't make me stop now.I want more."


He trailed urgent kisses along her jaw,coaxing her head back and drawing a shiver from her spine.


Every protest faded beneath his fierce kiss, and she surrendered, letting him take the lead. She decided to tell him what she found after the kiss.


Yet, there was no sign of restraint in him; lsaac's hunger only seemed to grow. Her hands pressed against his shoulders with more force, and she broke free just long enough to gasp."Isaac, seriously. Give me a second,will you?"


Her tone was thick with desire, but her plea landed sharp between them.


Rejection left lsaac's mind racing, confusion and longing flashing through his eyes.


Why pull back now, after everything?


She claimed she cared for him-so why the hesitation?





How could her lips and her heart speak so differently?


Why promise him closeness, only to retreat?


In that instant, his mind could only fixate on her rejection; he completely forgot all the times Verena had taken the initiative and they had kissed passionately.


Jealousy flared as he tipped her chin up, his voice rough and certain. "You're not getting away from me,Verena. Not now, not ever."


The words had barely faded before he captured her lips in a desperate,heated kiss.


Limbs entwined, clothes rumpled, they tumbled deeper into each other.


Halfway through, Isaac stilled, his eyes falling to the mark just beneath her collarbone.



There, inked boldly on her skin, the black letter "l"seemed to mock him-a sign that someone else still lingered in her story.


A sharp ache flickered in his chest. Driven by a wild,jealous need, he gripped her shoulders and rained frantic kisses over the mark and the skin around it.


She drew in a quick breath, wincing, as she threaded her fingers through his hair. "Easy, Isaac. You're going to leave a mark."


Every ounce of control gone, he pressed his lips around the mark, leaving flushed,red trails blooming across her neck.



Annoyance flickered in Verena's eyes as her fingers threaded through his hair, desire coloring her cheeks.
###Chapter 118 Your Body Is Responding




Fortunately, Verena's mind stayed clear, like a candle that refuses to flicker in the wind, able to tell what mattered and what did not.


She clenched her teeth, summoned her strength,and pushed Isaac away once more. Afraid he might try again, she quickly blurted, "Isaac, listen to me.I need to examine your body."


Isaac, dismissive and suspicious, believed she was merely looking for an excuse to spurn his closeness.


Breathing heavily, his voice carried a note of displeasure. "Is this really the moment for a checkup?"


Even as he spoke, he leaned forward again, eager to continue.


Verena, quick on her feet, covered his mouth and sighed, "Don't you see? Your body is responding." Isaac froze, caught off guard. His thoughts stalled,and he looked at her in bafflement.



Seizing that pause, Verena slipped from his grip,rose from his lap, and crouched beside him.


Lifting his shirt, she revealed his lean abdomen and pressed her fingertips against a few pressure points.


As her hands moved, her eyes shifted toward his crotch.



Within moments, the swelling that had been there subsided.



Verena didn't feel let down; instead, her lips curled into a bright grin.


Though brief, that flicker of change was like a light at the end of a long tunnel.


Looking up at Isaac with joy, she declared, "This is wonderful! It proves my revised treatment plan is working. It's a good sign. Stay here a moment-I'll fetch the medicine and apply it again." With that, Verena dashed upstairs, her steps almost dancing.


Isaac sat there, dazed, watching her cheerful figure vanish from sight.


He lowered his gaze, staring at his abdomen, eyes filled with confusion and disbelief.



Had he really responded?


Was it not a trick of his imagination?


Could there truly be hope of recovery-of becoming whole again?






Since that small but telling reaction, Verena devoted herself even more to refining her formulas, working tirelessly to craft a stronger ointment.


Isaac had even arranged a medical room for her within their home.


One day, as usual, Verena locked herself inside,weighing herbs, mixing medicines, and poring over her notes when Rhonda knocked, announcing that Danica had arrived.


Verena froze for a heartbeat.


Isaac's mother?


They had crossed paths only occasionally, and always with others around.


The last time they met alone, the subject had been Isaac.


Why was Danica here now, and by herself?


Verena's brows knitted with faint doubt, and she told Rhonda, "I understand. I'll come down shortly."


After the maid left, Verena went to the bedroom,slipped out of her loungewear, changed into something more formal, and descended the stairs.


As soon as Danica saw her, she quickly put down her coffee.


With a warm smile, she beckoned, saying, "Verena,come over here!" Verena was slightly taken aback by the familiar tone,yet her face betrayed nothing.


Smiling politely, she approached and greeted, "Good day,Danica."


Danica's smile deepened, fine lines showing at the corners of her eyes. "Good day,my dear."


She drew Verena down beside her on the sofa,and then reached into her handbag and produced a red velvet box.



"Verena, I want you to keep this." Danica opened it,revealing a jade bracelet.


"What is..."


Danica gently slipped it onto Verena's wrist as she explained, "This piece has been passed down through three generations. Take it as a blessing from me, as your mother-in-law."


Verena gazed at the lustrous jade. Though she knew little about jewelry, the quality spoke for itself-it was no ordinary piece. Understanding the meaning behind the gesture,she did not refuse. With a warm smile, she said, "Thank you,Danica.It's truly beautiful."


Then, recalling something, she added, "By the way,Isaac isn't home. Shall I call him back?"


Seeing her poised and graceful manner, Danica felt a quiet relief.


She shook her head and smiled faintly. "No need.I came especially for you."


Verena maintained her composure, her tone gentle."Is there anything you want to discuss with me?"


Danica cleared her throat, her gaze carrying a touch of apology. "Verena, I wronged you before.When we first met, you mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University.I assumed you were lying and, if it weren't for the challenges lsaac and the Bennett family were facing, I'd have opposed the marriage. Only now do l realize I misjudged you. I owe you an apology."


Verena blinked in mild surprise, and then smiled softly. "Danica, there's no need. My mother's words created that misunderstanding. Before the truth surfaced, you were only looking out for lsaac. As a mother,you acted out of duty."


Her words were frank yet generous, the kind of response not everyone could manage.


Danica's fondness for her grew deeper.


When she learned Verena had cured Barrie's leg, she had been stunned. Once the truth was confirmed,shame replaced her prejudice, and gratitude filled her heart that Isaac had married Verena.


If only Verena could restore Isaac as well.


Danica placed her hand gently over Verena's."Verena, I know you healed Barrie. You're truly remarkable."


Her voice trembled, emotion catching in her throat."All I ask is that you try to heal lsaac's legs. You can't imagine how much he has endured. When the accident happened, his father died beside him. He spent a month in a hospital bed, and when he finally awoke, he had lost both his father and the use of his legs. From that moment, he changed-withdrawn,silent, shutting himself in his room day after day. And I, in my grief, selfishly blamed him for his father's death. The weight he carried was unbearable. But since you came into his life, he's softened. He no longer hides away; his gaze has light again. He's becoming more like the boy he once was."


By then, tears streamed freely down Danica's face.


Her words painted a picture of lsaac's suffering during the months Verena had not been by his side.


Sorrow welled in Verena's eyes. She clasped Danica's hand and said earnestly, "Isaac is my husband. Even without your request, I would give my all to heal him. Don't burden yourself with guilt. Every heart falters under grief. It is only human to break.I believe Isaac will understand you."


Danica wept until her nose flushed red. Through her tears, she asked in disbelief, "Truly? He won't hold it against me?" Sensing her low spirits, Verena shifted the topic gently. "Danica, I have good news. Isaac's sex function has already shown signs of progress."


Though embarrassed to discuss such matters with her mother-in-law, she chose honesty.


"From the beginning, I realized his problem wasn't just physical but deeply psychological. In the following treatments, I incorporated certain stimulating medicines."


Her fingers brushed her cheek, and her voice dropped slightly. "Yesterday, when we were close, l noticed a reaction. It was fleeting, but it proves the treatment is working."


When her words faded, silence lingered in the room.


Moments later, Danica gripped Verena's shoulders,eyes alight. "Really? Verena, is that true? Has Isaac truly improved?"


Her excitement tumbled out in repeated questions,while Verena smiled and nodded. "Absolutely. I wouldn't deceive you about something so important."


Danica's joy overflowed. When she first arrived, she carried only the faintest glimmer of hope, knowing countless renowned doctors had declared Isaac's chances slim.



Yet now, Verena had given her a gift more precious than anything she could have dreamed.
###Chapter 119 Kaia Was Missing





Excitement danced across Danica's features as she processed the good news. Then, she remembered the uproar Kaia had caused at the wedding, trying to set her own sister up.


Most people that day had seen only the surface, but Danica saw through the act, reading the tension with practiced eyes.


Someone who could plot against her own flesh and blood probably never showed her older sister any kindness to begin with.


It was hard to miss the hands-off approach of the Willis parents-rules bent and broken, and no one seemed to care.


What truly stood out was how Verena stayed cool under pressure, shutting down every accusation with calm and skill, like she'd faced this kind of drama before. When Danica decided to form an alliance with the Willis family through marriage, Kaia had been the only name she heard. It was only after chatting with Laura and Alec that she discovered there was an older daughter, one who'd spent years out of sight,raised in the countryside.


That was the moment Danica understood: the Willises weren't telling her everything.


She could still picture Laura's eager smile as she finally brought Verena forward, like showing off something for sales.


It all clicked now-back then, Danica hadn't questioned why the Willis family brought Verena into the picture. But the truth was obvious: the Willises refused to risk Kaia's future and instead offered up the daughter they'd always neglected, just to k<eep their end of the deal.


These thoughts pushed Danica to squeeze Verena's hand, her voice low with regret and new respect."Verena, I mean this-I can't thank you enough for helping Isaac. I misjudged you. You knew what you were signing up for and still said yes. That wasn't fair to you. I'm sorry for all of it. From now on, I promise you have my support. If your family ever makes things hard for you, you come to me. I'll have your back, no matter what."


It was the least Danica could offer, a small step toward making things right.


Whatever else happened, the fact that Verena had given her son hope for a real future would always matter most.


Verena answered with a gentle smile, her voice steady, "You don't need to worry about me, really.I chose this path for myself. Being with Isaac was my decision; no one forced me."


Her words floated out softly, but there was no doubt in the strength behind them.


A wave of relief washed over Danica, who could only look at Verena in wonder.



For the first time, Danica was certain she'd made the right call forming a marriage alliance with the Willis family.


They spoke a little longer, but soon Danica glanced at the time, knowing she had to go.


Without protest, Verena walked her to the door,quietly seeing her out.


Hardly a moment after Danica disappeared, the sound of Isaac's car pulling up echoed through the drive.


Jacob gave lsaac a hand into his wheelchair, and then lsaac moved across the walkway until he was right beside Verena.


"Did my mom just leave?" Isaac asked, watching her with curiosity.


He'd caught a glimpse of Danica's favorite car rolling out of the estate.



It was obvious to Verena that Danica timed her exit so lsaac would not catch even a hint of their talk about his condition. Verena gave a little nod. "She just stopped by for a quick chat, that's all."


There was no reason to add more worries to lsaac's condition, so Verena left out every detail about Danica's questions.


A note of unease slipped into lsaac's voice. "She didn't put you through the wringer, did she?"


For a second, Verena wondered just how intimidating Danica must appear from Isaac's perspective.


As she guided his wheelchair into the living room,she flashed him a reassuring smile. "You're stressing for nothing. It was just regular small talk."


Isaac's eyebrows knitted together."Are you sure?You'd tell me if she was giving you trouble, right?"


She let out a quiet sigh, and then knelt down to look him in the eye.


"Isaac, do you really want to see a rift between me and your mom?" She lifted her wrist so he could see the gleaming jade. "See this? Your mother just gave me her prized bracelet as a welcome."



His eyes dropped to the smooth, green stone resting against her skin, and for a heartbeat, he went quiet.


That piece of jade wasn't just jewelry. It carried the weight of family tradition-every daughter-in-law received it as a mark of acceptance. Danica guarded it like it was priceless.


A warmth softened lsaac's gaze as he took in the sight of that bracelet on Verena's wrist.



...



One week had slipped by since V/erena walked down the aisle. Kaia had vanished just as long-no one had seen her since the wedding.



Kaia had stormed out that night and simply never bothered to come home.



The night Kaia disappeared, Alec was too furious to chase after her. Laura and Luka shrugged it off,convinced she was just crashing at a friend's place. But after seven days had passed, Laura came home from the office, and Luka dropped his bag after school, only to find the house just as empty-Kaia's room looked untouched, not a trace of her anywhere.
A worried frown creased Laura's brow. "Where is she? How long does she plan to stay away?"
Luka's shoulders slumped. "Maybe she's still mad and hiding out at a friend's place."
Laura's voice grew sharp. "She should at least pick up the phone. It's not right to disappear for days."
Because of Kaia's drama, several business partners were already backing out, all of them tossing out words like "integrity" and "reputation" as an excuse.
Lately, Laura found herself buried in work at the office, while Alec was so swamped that he hardly made it home before midnight.
With chaos at the company piling up, Kaia's absence seemed less like a coincidence and more like a perfectly timed escape. Laura's patience snapped as she said to Luka, "You know most of the people Kaia runs with. Start dialing and figure out where she is. Tell her she needs to show up here by tomorrow morning-and I don't want her wandering anywhere else until I let her."


"Got it."


He scrolled through Kaia's contact list, exhaling slowly as he made the first call.


"Hey, Marianna? Luka here. Has Kaia been crashing at your place?"


A voice crackled through. "Nope. I'm not even in the country-I'm out on vacation."


Luka ended the call, and then tried the next number,barely pausing between dials.


"Hi, Saniya. It's Luka. Did Kaia come to see you a week ago?"


"A week ago? Wasn't that when the thunderstorm hit? Why would she show up in that mess?" Luka pressed, "Any idea who she's been hanging around with lately?"


"No clue.Sorry."


"Alright. Thanks anyway," Luka replied, voice tight,before moving on.


One call after another, he.found himself getting nowhere. Most of Kaia's so-called friends were just party buddies; beyond club nights and group chats,they didn't seem to care about her whereabouts.


Still, Luka refused to quit, running through the last few contacts in her list.


He finally reached the last one. "Hey, Mckenzie, it's Luka-Kaia's brother. Have you heard from her at all?"



"No,nothing."


Just as he was about to say thanks and hang up,Mckenzie's voice turned sly. "By the way, I heard Kaia stirred up trouble at Verena's wedding. Seriously, she sabotaged her own sister? That's messed up." Luka gripped his phone tighter, refusing to let his anger show. "I'm being respectful here, so keep the gossip to yourself."


Mckenzie just chuckled, not backing down. "Relax,I'm not trying to start anything. But if Kaia's missing,maybe think about who she's pissed off lately.Who knows, maybe someone snatched her."


A cold spike of fear shot through Luka at the word "snatched."


"Thanks for your time," he said, and then cut the call short.



When he put the phone down and didn't dial another number, Laura walked over, eyes full of worry. "Did you find her? What did everyone say?"


Luka's hands trembled. "She's gone, Mom. I think Kaia's really missing."


Laura's face went pale as a sheet. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 120 You've Chosen The Wrong Person
Just then, Alec returned from the company.


Catching sight of Luka with Laura, he frowned and asked, "What are you two doing here?"


Laura, flustered, quickly explained, "Alec, Kaia is missing. It's been a week now, and she hasn't come home. I asked Luka to call her friends, hoping she might be staying with one of them, but no one has seen her. Alec, where could Kaia have gone? Do you think something has happened to her?"


A shadow of worry crossed Alec's eyes. It was the first time Kaia had run away, and never had she vanished for so long.


Yet, what weighed heavier on him than her disappearance was the Bennett family/'s silence.


A week had passed since Verena and Isaac's wedding. Despite the uproar Kaia had stirred, the Bennett family had shown no reaction.


The club was still under restrictions, but there was no hard crackdown either, leaving Alec unable to read Isaac's stance.



The ambiguity gnawed at him like a riddle with no answer.





The more he thought, the more restless he became.


With a deep frown, he waved his hand. "She can go wherever she pleases. She stormed off in anger;if trouble finds her, she brought it on herself."


With that, Alec strode upstairs.


Tears welled in Laura's eyes as she turned to Luka."What should we do? It seems your father has washed his hands of Kaia."


Luka swallowed, the last phone call echoing in his ears-someone might've snatched Kaia. Verena's image flashed unbidden in his mind.  He gritted his teeth and patted Laura's hand gently "Mom, don't worry. I'll search for her tomorrow. I'll bring Kaia back,I promise."



The next morning, lsaac had already gone tothe company. Verena was taking her breakfast at the dining table.


Soon after, Rhonda came forward to announce, "Mrs.Bennett, your brother is here."


Luka?



Verena paused mid-bite. "Send him in."


Moments later, Rhonda ushered Luka inside.


Verena stayed seated, giving him a calm glance.

"Would you like something to eat?"


Facing his eldest sister, with whom he shared little closeness, Luka shifted uneasily.


He shook his head. "I've already eaten."


Verena only nodded, having asked out of courtesy.  She gestured at the seat across from her. "Sit."


Luka obeyed, lowering his head, nervously tugging at the edge of his shirt, yet saying nothing.


Verena, unhurried, continued her meal. Only when she had nearly finished did she ask, "Well then,speak. You came this early-what is it?"


Though suspicion lingered in his heart, Luka knew he had to take small steps.


"Kaia has been missing for a week. We haven't found her, and Mom is so worried she can't sleep. Verena,you have wider connections. Could you heIp us look for her?"



Verena gave a sudden, mocking laugh.


When all was well, Luka barely gave her a glance.Now that Kaia had vanished, he had come bowing his head,asking politely for help.


What irony.


Startled by her scoff, Luka looked up. Verena leaned  back in her chair, arms folded.


"Are you sure you've come to the right person?"


Her domineering stance stirred Luka's irritation.Kaia was her sister by blood, yet with Kaia missing,Verena appeared cold as stone.


He frowned. "What do you mean by that?"


Verena lifted a shoulder carelessly. "Isn't it obvious?Whether Kaia lives or dies, what does that have to do with me? If you're here for my help, let me be plain-you've chosen the wrong person."


Luka's fists clenched, his eyes full of reproach.


He had hoped that by softening his tone, she might show a shred of compassion. He hadn't expected such a heartless reply.



"You really are cold. Even a stranger would show more concern for another's life than you do for your own sister..."


Verena cut him off sharply. "Shall I list what Kaia has done to me? She smeared my reputation in our circle,making me out to be worthless. She tried to ruin my wedding before all eyes, determined to crush me. Do you know what would have happened to me if the truth hadn't come to light?"


Luka froze, lips opening and closing without sound.


Verena went on, unflinching. "She schemed against me, hoping I'd fall. And now you ask me to look for her? She never wanted me to have peace, so why should I wish her any?"


Seeing how resolute she was, Luka tried to shield Kaia with words. "Kaia only went astray, making things hard for you in a moment of confusion. But wasn't it because you gave her a hard time when you first came to Willis Villa? It was unfair to her...



Clang!


Verena slammed her utensils onto the table, the sound jolting Luka in place.


"Who made life hard for whom first? Who provoked  whom first?" Her gaze was cold as ice. "In front of you all, she plays the doting sister. In front of me, she goads and plots. In your eyes, Kaia is the gentle sister, and I'm nothing but a stranger carrying the title of eldest. But in my eyes-before you tried to trip me at the staircase, you were my only brother. Before Kaia turned against me, she was my only sister. Now,to me, you both are nothing."



Her words lodged in Luka's throat like a stone. He looked at her, his eyes stung by the absence of warmth in hers.



"Have you thought only of Kaia's unfairness? What about mine?"


Verena gave a bitter smile. "You both grew up with every privilege-fine schools, a life cushioned in our parents' love. All I had was Grandma to lean on. For a single word from Kaia, you attacked me without knowing the truth. Did you ever stop to consider my feelings? Since neither of you ever cared for mine,why should I care for yours?"  Luka froze, shaken, his thoughts in turmoil.


He had never truly reflected on her words before.


Memories stirred-memories of distance, of never questioning why he and Verena had remained strangers despite sharing the same blood.


Yes, they had the same parents, yet their liveshad been worlds apart.


He and Kaia enjoyed every luxury, while Verena had grown up in the countryside.


Each time their father suggested bringing Verena and Grandma to Shoildon, their mother would grow furious, raising storms until the idea was abandoned.


Only now did Luka see the unfairness clearly.


Guilt swept over him as he mnuttered, eyes clouded,"I'm sorry."


But apologies that come too late heal nothing.


Verena's reply was as cold as steel. "I don't accept it." Luka pressed his lips tight, wanting to argue further.


After a long silence, he finally asked, "Does Kaia's disappearance have anything to do with you?"
###Chapter 121 You're Evelyn





"Do you think I arranged something to happen to her?" Verena asked, her brows knitting slightly.


Luka dropped his gaze, cheeks reddening with shame. He didn't need to say a word-his silence gave him away.


A soft laugh slipped from Verena. "How ridiculous.With everything l've worked for and the future waiting for me, why would I risk it all on someone so worthless?"



Her eyes cut towvard him with icy disdain before she turned her head aside. "I won't stoop to anything illegal. That's not who l am."


Only then did Luka understand-Kaia's disappearance had nothing to do with Verena.


He rose slowly, giving her a stiff nod. "Then I won't take up any more of your time." His steps were heavy as he left, unease weighing him down. If Verena wasn't behind it,then what had really happened to Kaia?



···


Far away, in a villa in Shoildon, Kaia sat curled tightly on a bed far too large for her small frame. Her bloodshot eyes were hollow and unsettling.


"You're still refusing to eat?"


Katelyn Fuller walked closer, her voice carrying a chill. Kaia didn't even bother to lift her head."Whether I eat or not has nothing to do with you."


Katelyn didn't so much as flinch at Kaia's defiance.


Her crimson lips curved into a smile as she leaned closer, whispering near Kaia's ear, "You still don't get it, do you? Starving yourself, sulking in the dark,feeding your anger-it's the weakest path you could take. If you really want revenge, you have to stay alive, sharpen your mind, and turn rage into strategy.Build plans so flawless they cut your enemies down <###Chapter 121 You're Evelyn                                   110281-1010227
in one strike. That's how you win."
She straightened, picked up a bowl of porridge from the bedside table, and held it out. "Eat."
Kaia's glare hardened. She slapped the hand away,her voice like ice. "I don't need your kindness. Don't think I can't see through you."
The porridge splattered slightly, lukewarm and sticky against Katelyn's skin, leaving a faint mess.
Unbothered, she set the bowl aside, calmly wiping her fingers with a tissue. "Oh? Then why don't you explain what you think I'm after?" she asked with a slow, deliberate ease.
Kaia scoffed, "You're not fooling mne. You're trying to use me as your pawn against Verena-just another step to get close to lsaac. Do you really take me for an idiot?"
Everyone in Shoildon already whispered about Katelyn's obsession with Isaac.
Kaia, having grown up in the city, was well aware of it. Katelyn folded her arms, her smile twisting into something sharper as she looked down at Kaia."Smart lady."


It was praise in words only-the scorn behind it was clear as glass.



"I know you're laughing at me for being foolish. Fine,I'll admit it-I'm not clever," Kaia admitted,her lips twitching with stubborn defiance. "But after losing to Verena again and again, do you really think I'd be dumb enough to challenge her outright? She's got Isaac behind her now, and even the CEO of AuroraNexus in her corner. You don't cross people like that. I won't, and neither will you. Otherwise,why bother with me at all instead of striking at her yourself?"



Katelyn didn't flinch at the accusation. Calm and composed, she shook her head. "You're half right.I do intend to use you against Verena, but not because I fear her. I can't afford to let lsaac suspect I'm moving against her. Do you want to know why you've lost to her every time?" Kaia clenched her jaw, saying nothing. With a smirk,Katelyn added, "Because your tricks were sloppy.Every scheme y/ou tried was transparent, easy for Verena to dismantle. If you'd taken the time to plan properly, you wouldn't have fallen so hard."


Kaia's tone stayed flat. "Maybe so. But it doesn't change the fact that I'm finished. I'm no match for her, and I'll never bring her down."


Leaning closer, Katelyn's eyes gleamed. "So you'll just accept defeat? If you work with me, I'll give you resources, guidance, everything you need. I'll make sure Verena never forces you to bow your head again."


The conviction in Katelyn's words carried weight, and against her will, Kaia felt a spark of temptation. She hated her failures, hated Verena even more.Yet even with the offer dangling before her, doubt still gnawed at her-because facing Verena again seemed impossible.


Kaia's eyes narrowed on Katelyn, suspicion and hesitation warring inside her. At last, her defenses slipped, and she asked quietly, "What exactly can you give me?"


The question told Katelyn all she needed to know-Kaia was wavering.


She slid onto the bed beside her, closing the gap,her voice dropping to a coaxing murmur. "You've always idolized Evelyn, haven't you? The miracle doctor everyone praises, admired at home and abroad."


The name alone sent a spark through Kaia's dull gaze, her hopelessness cracking into sudden light.


Not missing a beat, Katelyn leaned in, feeding that spark.



"But being her fan isn't enough. You should stand at her side as her apprentice. Learn everything she knows. Become greater than her. Then crush Verena in her own field. Strip away her glory. And when the time comes, I'll help you topple her support from Isaac and the AuroraNexus CEO."



Every word rolled off Katelyn's tongue like a spell, weaving possibility into Kaia's ears.


For the first time in ages, Kaia felt her pulse quicken with something close to hope, as if Evelyn might walk into the room any second.


The despair weighing her down gave way to burning desire. She wanted more than survival now-she wanted to rise as the most renowned doctor alive,praised by the elite. She wanted the Bennett family to choke on their arrogance, Alec and Laura to drown in regret, and Verena-oh, especially Verena-to kneel before her and beg for mercy in front of the world.


The thought consumed Kaia until she could no longer hold back. She seized Katelyn's arm, her voice trembling with excitement. "You can really take me to Evelyn? You can truly make that happen?"


Katelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.′′Of course. I don't make promises I can't keep."


Even so, Kaia tried to rein in her eagerness, forcing a sliver of doubt into her tone. "But why should I believe you? You claim to know Evelyn-but do you?Don't think you can trick me. Our professor has met Evelyn, so l'd know if you were lying."


Katelyn tilted her head, a soft "Oh?" escaping her,her voice touched with curiosity. "And which professor would that be?"


"Professor Wendell Branson," Kaia answered firmly.


At the name, Katelyn's gaze dropped for a brief moment, the corner of her mouth twitching as she etched it into memory. Wendel Branson. Good.


Now she knew exactly who had contact with Evelyn.Mixing fact with fabrication was her art, and a mere professor was hardly an obstacle she couldn't bend to her advantage.


Lifting her eyes again, Katelyn's voice rang with confidence. "I'd never stoop to lying to you, Kaia. Not about this."



Kaia, seeing no flicker of dishonesty in Katelyn's face, pushed further. "Really? Then tell me-where is Evelyn now?"


Katelyn's lips curved as her eyes narrowed, a sly gleam flashing before she answered, "Right in front of you."


The words jolted Kaia. She stared at Katelyn in disbelief, her voice rising. "You're saying you're Evelyn? Don't be ridiculous. Evelyn's a man!"


Unshaken, Katelyn held her gaze, her smile calm and unnervingly confident. "And what makes you so certain? Who ever told you Evelyn was male? Have you seen a single report confirmingit?"


Kaia faltered. In truth, she hadn't. There had never been a clear account of Evelyn's identity-only vague descriptions. Her own admiration had led her to imagine Evelyn as some refined, scholarly man.


"Kaia," Katelyn called out smoothly, leaning in as if sealing the claim. "Believe me. I am Evelyn. The world calls Evelyn a legendary phy/sician for good reason. Some say I live in seclusion, others whisper about mystery-but none of that erases the fact that I've healed countless patients and built a reputation recognized everywhere. Why would I risk telling a lie so easy to expose?"
###Chapter 122 Public Opinion Effect





Katelyn's calm certainty left Kaia little room to doubt.A woman as cunning as her would never risk a lie that could be shattered so easily-if she wasn't truly Evelyn, the real one would step forward to expose the fraud.



The figure Kaia had idolized for years now stood before her, and the awe inside her chest swelled until it drowned everything else. She couldn't say if anyone alive could defeat Verena, but if Evelyn was involved,Kaia believed it was possible.


Her gaze softened into adoration as she clutched Katelyn's hand, her voice trembling with devotion."You're really Evelyn? I can't believe I'm meeting you -after all these years, and we've even crossed paths before without me knowing. This is incredible!"


"In this country, just call me Katelyn," Katelyn replied,her smile perfectly composed, though her eyes betrayed nothing. "We'll have plenty of time together, so there's no need for such excitement."


Hearing that, Kaia's joy overflowed. She nodded over and over, grinning wide. "Of course, of course. I get it -you don't want to attract attention. But tell me,when do we strike back at Verena?"


Katelyn's voice flowed like silk, smooth and unhurried. "Not yet. First, you need to regain your strength. When the time is right and the plan is ready, I'll let you know."


Still sniffling from the cold she'd caught in the storm,Kaia lowered her head and whispered, "Alright."


The thought of the reason behind Katelyn targeting Verena still gnawed at Kaia, and confusion spilled into her words."Katelyn, I don't get it. Isaac isn't who he used to be. Even with his money and power,he's a broken man now. Why would someone as extraordinary as you still want him? Honestly, he doesn't deserve you."


Her protest was fueled partly by admiration for her idol and partly by the resentment she carried for Isaac's constant defense of Verena.


She added, her tone sharper, "And his legs-they're ruined. Everyone knows he'll never walk properly again."


Katelyn rose to her feet, her confidence radiating."With me by his side, do you really believe Isaac can't recover?"


Her gaze slid past Kaia and out the window,her voice low and resolute, as if she were speaking more to fate than to anyone in the room. "Isaac will be mine.And Verena-she won't escape me. I'll drag her down with my own hands. This isn't only about helping you.I despise her for taking what's mine, for wearing the title of his wife."


A cold smile curved Katelyn's lips. "One day,Verena will understand that the role of Isaac's wife belongs to me-and me alone."


After lingering long enough to let her words settle,Katelyn urged Kaia to rest, and then swept out of the  room.


The butler, waiting just outside, leaned in close and murmured, "Miss Fuller, the guest has arrived. He's waiting in the study."


Without breaking stride, Katelyn gave a single nod,her eyes fixed forward. "Keep watch on the woman inside.I want every move reported back to me."


The butler bowed his head respectfully. "Yes, Miss Fuller."


Katelyn walked steadily down the hall until she reached the study door.


Pushing it open, she stepped inside and greeted the man on the sofa. "Mr. Baldwin, forgive the delay.I hope you haven't been waiting long."


Foley Baldwin, the most powerful voice in Shoildon's news world, immediately rose to his feet. "Not at all.I only just got here myself."


"Please, sit," Katelyn said before lowering herself onto the sofa opposite him. They faced each other across the polished table, and Katelyn laced her fingers together on her lap. Her voice was smooth, deliberate. "Mr. Baldwin, I'm sure my butler has already filled you in on the basics.People like us don't waste time dancing around. The fact that you're here tells me you're ready to do business."


The other day, following Katelyn's instructions, her butler had lured Foley out, drowned him in liquor, and set two heavy lockboxes before him.


By morning, when he woke, the sight had been enough to stun him-neat stacks of cash piled high,far beyond what a man in his position could ever earn in years of honest work.


The butler had whispered at the dinner meeting that this was only the down payment, with far more to come once the job was finished.


The temptation was too much to resist. And after all,Katelyn's request wasn't outlandish-half the news in entertainment was embellished anyway. Not long after, Foley had picked up his phone and asked the butler for the meeting time, greed outweighing hesitation.


Now, recalling the gleam of those banknotes, he grinned broadly. "Miss Fuller, your generosity speaks louder than words. How could I possibly disappoint you?"


Foley leaned forward eagerly. "Just say the word,Miss Fuller. Whatever you require, I'll see to it."


Katelyn's smile was cool and calculated. "My request is simple. Push the stories of my successes abroad.Dress them up with a little mystery-use phrases like 'an enigmatic figure' or 'a hidden talent.' Don't reveal too much. The goal is to nudge the narrative toward Evelyn without ever confirming it. Keep the language vague, leave the speculation hanging. The rest is your craft, not mine."



After laying out her instructions, she checked the time on her watch, her expression softening into a polite smile. "You'll have to excuse me now-my trainer is due any minute." Taking the hint, Foley rose to his feet, bowing his head slightly. "Ah, yes, I just remembered I have pressing matters waiting at the office. Consider it done, Miss Fuller. You'll have no complaints from me."



Her eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of mock confusion sharpening her gaze, the unspoken warning clear.


Catching it instantly, Foley straightened with a nervous chuckle. "Of course. For the record, I've spent the entire day at home, handling business privately. No visitors, no conversations. You can count on my discretion."


Only then did Katelyn's smile return, her voice smooth. "Good. Safe travels, Mr.Baldwin."






Money greased every wheel, and Katelyn's money in particular worked like oil on fire. Foley wasted no time. By the very next morning, headlines blazed across Shoildon's media outlets, Katelyn's name stamped everywhere and whispered in elite circles.


The banner story read: "Katelyn Fuller Returns with Stellar Credentials! Enigmatic Background Stirs Curiosity among High Society."


Once the article went live, Foley wasted no time. As Katelyn instructed, he unleashed a wave of paid influencers to flood the comment sections and steer the conversation.


The first voice popped up. "Wait a second-wasn't Katelyn living in Clokron all this time? She's really back?"


Another quickly followed, commenting, "Didn't she study medicine? I've heard rumors she comes and goes like a ghost-totally mysterious."


A third comment read, "Oneof my friends swears she went to the same school as Katelyn. They say she might have a second identity... though nobody knows for sure." Then came a fourth comment. "Word is, she once cured a patient that even top professors couldn't save. The guy walked away completely healed under her care!"



The chatter spread, and soon the city's wealthy began adding their own speculation to the mix.


In Shoildon's upper circles, the gossip spread like wildfire.


"We all knew she came from a family of doctors and was a top student," one socialite remarked. "But if she's handling cases beyond even professors,maybe she's returned for a particular patient?"


Another leaned in, curiosity piqued, "That could be it.But who would have the power to bring her back?"


Someone gestured toward the earlier thread and muttered, "And what about that rumor of a hidden identity? Could it actually be true?"


"An internationally recognized doctor, famous for solving impossible cases... doesn't that sound exactly like the elusive surgeon, Evelyn?"


"No way-that's what the article was hinting at too!"


"Come on, rumors don't just appear out of nowhere.Even entertainment reporters wouldn't dare print that without a shred of truth."


Speculation grew wilder, some debating the real reason behind Katelyn's return and whispering about her supposed secret identity, while others dredged up stories from her school days.


"Remember how obsessed she was with lsaac back in high school?"


"Of course! That's when I realized chasing a man isn't as easy as everyone claims."


"She was so relentless, every woman in school avoided even looking at Isaac, terrified Katelyn would 'welcome' them with a not-so-friendly warning."


Meanwhile, Katelyn sat with her phone in hand,scrolling through the comments. A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips. The narrative had taken root exactly the way she wanted-public opinion was shifting, and the stage was set for her next move.


Without glancing up, she called toward the doorway,instructing, "Prepare the car. I'm heading out."
###Chapter 123 For Isaac





At the Bennett Mansion, Danica raised her brows in mild surprise when a servant announced Katelyn's visit.



The Bennett family had always maintained close ties with the Fuller family, and Danica had practically watched the lady grow up. She remembered clearly how boldly Katelyn had chased after lsaac.


That Katelyn had only just returned from overseas yet chosen to come here first spoke volumes-her thoughts were still firmly fixed on Isaac.


After a brief pause, Danica gave a small nod. "Show her in."


A short while later, she watched as Katelyn swept into the living room with a dazzling smile, her hands carrying tastefully wrapped gift boxes.


Before leaving the country, Katelyn had trailed Isaac constantly, like a shadow glued to his side. Now, on her return, lsaac had lost his ability to walk and was bound in marriage. Still, she appeared unchanged-radiant, sweet, and brimming with youthful charm that recalled those earlier days.


The sight stirred something in Danica, a wistful ache.If not for that accident, perhaps Isaac and Katelyn might have truly ended up together. She had always admired Katelyn, but Isaac's heart had been as cold and distant as a mountain of ice, impossible for anyone to thaw.


"Mrs. Bennett! It's been far too long-I've missed you dearly!" Katelyn chimed brightly, slipping into Danica's arms with the ease of family.


Though years had passed, her warmth was genuine enough to soften Danica, who patted her gently on the back. "Katelyn, you've grown lovelier during your time abroad. Surely you have a trail of admirers chasing after you now?"


Katelyn pressed her hands to her cheeks with a shy laugh. "Mrs. Bennett, I've only just come back and you're already teasing me."


She motioned toward the neatly stacked boxes on the table. "I brought a few things for you-please take a look and see if they suit your taste."


Danica's eyes landed on one package, her brows lifting when she recognized the insignia of a rare luxury brand few could get their hands on.


With a light tap on Katelyn's shoulder, she said with a smile, "Thank you, dear. You're too polite; your visit alone is more than enough."


Katelyn stuck her tongue out playfully. "It's nothing,just a little token of my respect for you."


This wasn't her first time in the Bennett household.With practiced ease, she signaled a maid. "Dorcie,would you mind taking these upstairs?"


Dorcie Wright bowed her head respectfully before carrying the gifts away.


Danica then led Katelyn to the sofa, pouring a steaming cup of coffee before handing it over. "So tell me, how long will you be staying in the country this time?"


Accepting the cup with a sweet smile, Katelyn shook her head, her expression tinged with hesitation. "To be honest, I don't know yet."


Danica's brows drew together. "What do you mean by that?"


Placing the cup back on the table, Katelyn met her gaze squarely, her tone earnest. "Mrs. Bennett, I'll be frank. The reason I returned...is because of Isaac."



Danica stilled, surprise flickering across her features.She hadn't expected Katelyn's feelings to remain this strong-chasing after lsaac abroad, and even now,with his disability, refusing to let go.


Reading her thoughts, Katelyn softened her smile."Please don't misunderstand. When I say it's for Isaac, I mean I've come to treat him. Isaac and I grew up together. No matter what's happened, I can't turn my back on him." Danica exhaled softly, her shoulders easing as she asked, "So you're saying you intend to treat lsaac?"


"That's right," Katelyn repled with a firm nod. "You know I grew up surrounded by medicine, and l studied it seriously abroad. I've dealt with cases similar to lsaac's and performed countless surgeries.I only came back once I was certain I had the confidence to succeed. Mrs. Bennett, believe me-l can heal him."



As the words lingered in Danica's mind, she recalled the morning's headlines that had rippled through high society. If what they said was true, if Katelyn's skill truly surpassed even that of the professors, then maybe... just maybe she could do what no one else had managed.


The idea tugged at Danica, tempting as it was, until the image of Verena surfaced. She herself had gone to Verena not long ago, pleading for her help with Isaac.


And Katelyn-Danica had not forgotten her relentless pursuit of Isaac in the past. Allowing her near him again could invite trouble, or worse,misunderstandings.




Her hesitation did not escape Katelyn's sharp eyes.


With a gentle tone, Katelyn asked, "You're worried his wife won't accept it, aren't you?"


Danica gave a slow nod. Katelyn leaned closer, taking her hand with a reassuring smile. "Mrs. Bennett,Isaac's health has to come before anything else. As for me, my feelings for him faded long ago-they're nothing but distant memories now. I know full well there can never be anything between us again.Please don't mistake my intentions."


Sensing Danica's softened stance, Katelyn continued gently, "Even so, I'll always see him as one of my dearest friends. Watching him suffer like this,knowing I finally have the skill to help-how could just turn away?"


Her words settled into Danica's thoughts. If Katelyn truly possessed the ability to heal Isaac, then perhaps it would bring an extra layer of security. With a small sigh, Danica replied, "Katelyn, this isn't a decision I can make on my own. I'll have to ask Isaac what he thinks."


Katelyn's smile bightened, sweet and warm. "That's more than enough for me."


After Katelyn's departure, Danica instructed the driver to head straight for the company.


Inside his office, lsaac was bent over a stack of contracts when a knock sounded at the door.Looking up, he asked, "Mom? What brings you here?"


Danica crossed the room and lowered herself onto the sofa, her movements hesitant. Since the accident, moments alone with him had grown rare,and the words she wanted to say often died in her throat.


She filled the silence with small questions-if he was tired, what he'd eaten for lunch.


Isaac answered each one without complaint, but before she could continue, he cut in, "Mom, I really need to get back to work."


Clearing her throat, Danica forced the conversation forward. "It's about Katelyn. She's just come back from abroad and visited me earlier. She claims to have experience with conditions like yours, and... I believe she might be capable. Would you consider letting her try to treat you?"


Isaac didn't hesitate once the words left her mouth."No. There's no need."


Danica leaned forward, unwilling to back down so quickly. "But if you tried a different doctor, it might open the door to another chance at recovery..."


His hand slammed the documents flat against the desk with a sharp crack. His tone dropped, edged with ice. "Verena is already treating me, and | trust her completely. Under her care, I've been improving.I don't need anyone else, nor do I want anyone else."


What he didn't voice was the deeper truth-he wanted no connection to Katelyn, not now, not ever. The last thing he intended was to create friction with Verena.



Faced with his unyielding stance, Danica found her arguments slipping away.


A few more words passed between them before she finally rose and left the office.


Back in the car, she pulled out her phone and dialed Katelyn. "Katelyn, I spoke with lsaac about the treatment.He refused."



Her voice softened with concern, as though cushioning the blow. "You know how he is. Once his mind is set, it's like moving a mountain. Don't let it discourage you."


Katelyn, however, showed no sign of disappointment.Her lips curved into a confident smile as she answered, "I expected as much, Mrs. Bennett. Thank you for speaking with him on my behalf.Please don't worry-I won't give up. I'll make lsaac accept my treatment sooner or later." Hearing the determination in Katelyn's voice,Danica could only end the call with a weary sigh, caught between two equally stubborn hearts.
###Chapter 124 Play The Impostor




Once the call ended, the driver caught Katelyn's expression in the rearview mirror. "Miss Fuller,shall l take you home now?"


When she had left the Bennett Mansion earlier,she hadn't given that instruction. Instead, she'd told him to wait at a nearby parking lot.


Sliding her phone aside, Katelyn arched a brow. "No.Take me to the Bennett Group headquarters."


Isaac's rejection hadn't stopped her-it only made her more determined. If he refused through his mother,she would confront him herself.


"Understood," the driver replied, steering the car smoothly out of the lot.


Minutes later, the Bennett Group tower loomed before them. Before opening the door, Katelyn turned to him."Stay here and wait. There's no need to follow me inside."


She stepped out gracefully, her heels clicking against the pavement as she headed straight for the building.


The lobby was bright and bustling, two employees stationed at the reception desk.


One receptionist spotted her immediately and rose politely. "Good afternoon, miss. May I ask who you're here to see?"



Katelyn's answer was calm but direct. "I'm here for your CEO,Isaac Bennett."


The receptionist's smile stayed professional."Do you have an appointment with him?"


Katelyn shook her head once. "No, I don't."


A flicker of hesitation crossed the receptionist's face."I'm sorry, but without an appointment, I'm afraid I can't let you through-" "Wait a second," the other receptionist interjected,eyes widening as she held up her phone. She had just been scrolling through the news, and the face in front of her matched perfectly with the photo on the trending article.


Given her reputation in high society, it was only natural to assume she knew their CEO.


The receptionist straightened quickly, her tone cautious but polite. "Pardon me, are you Miss Katelyn Fuller?"



Katelyn offered a composed smile. "Yes. I'm a friend of Isaac's."



The young woman hesitated before responding,"Miss Fuller, normally we can't allow visitors without an appointment. But I can contact the CEO's assistant to confirm."



"That would be helpful," Katelyn answered smoothly with a nod.



The receptionist immediately picked up the phone and dialed Jacob's number.


Inside the CEO's office, Isaac had just returned from a short meeting. He leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose to ease the dull ache behind it.


A knock sounded against the door.


Without looking up, Isaac said quietly, "Come in."


Jacob stepped inside, bowing slightly. "Mr. Bennett,the front desk just called. Miss Katelyn Fuller is here asking to see you. She's in the lobby. How would you like me to proceed?"


At the mention of her name, Isaac's eyes snapped open, his brows tightening in iritation. So she still wouldn't back down.


His voice turned cold. "I won't be meeting her."


He opened a file on his desk and added curtly,"From this moment on, don't take any of her calIs."


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood, Mr. Bennett. I'l remember."



He exited the office and returned the receptionist's call,repeating Isaac's instructions word for word.


The receptionist turned back to Katelyn with an apologetic smile. "I'm very sorry, Miss Fuller. Mr.Bennett is currently tied up with work and won't be able to receive visitors. Perhaps you could return another time?"



Katelyn caught the deliberate politeness in her tone and knew instantly it was nothing more than a brush-off.Isaac was avoiding her, exactly as she expected.


Still, she smiled sweetly. "That's fine. I'll wait for him here."



With practiced grace, she crossed over to the lounge area and settled into a sofa, her posture calm but resolute.


As soon as she was out of earshot, the receptionist who had first spoken leaned toward her colleague and whispered, "Who is she, really? You're treating her like royalty."


The other woman gave her a sharp look before answering in a hushed tone, "That's Katelyn Fuller,daughter of Fuller Group's CEO. She moves in the same circles as Mr. Bennett. Some say they even grew up together. Do you want to be the one to offend her?"


The first receptionist frowned. "If she's so close to him,why wouldn't he agree to see her?"


Her colleague shot her a warning glare. "Keep your head down and mind your own work. Curiosity doesn't pay here."



···


Meanwhile, in Seraphina Villas, Verena carefully measured out herbs in her medical room, her focus steady on the medicine she was preparing.


Her phone, set on speaker beside her, carried Miranda's voice across the counter.


"Verena, you've been distant with me lately. You Verena let out a soft laugh. "You're always so busy. I figured I shouldn't bother you."


Miranda groaned theatrically. "I was busy, but now I'm stuck bored out of my mind. I'm venting to you while tapping around on my iPad."


Her voice brightened with curiosity. "So what's been keeping you occupied lately?"


Without slowing her hands, Verena replied, "I'm working on a new batch of medicine for lsaac."


"Medicine again?" Miranda's tone lifted with surprise. "Didn't you say the last time we talked that you'd already made something for him? Why more now?"


Still focused on her task, Verena explained, "That one was for external use. Since his condition's showing signs of progress, I'm preparing an internal prescription this time."


Miranda let out an excited gasp. "That's amazing! At this rate, he'll be back on his feet in no time. You really do live up to your reputation, Evelyn!"


Verena chuckled. "You're giving me too much credit.It'll take time, but I'll accept the compliment."


Their conversation slipped into acomfortable lull,each busy with their own activity while still sharing the moment.



Suddenly, Miranda cursed under her breath, startling Verena enough that her hand slipped, spilling too much of one ingredient. She quickly removed the excess and asked, "What happened?"


"You have to check Shoildon Entertainment's latest report," Miranda blurted out. "I saw it even from abroad. Don't tell me you haven't?"


Understanding immediately, Verena stayed calm, still tending to the mixture. Her tone was light, almost dismissive. "Ah, that? Yes, I've already seen it."


She had come across the report earlier that morning while scrolling through her phone. Miranda sounded baffled. "You've seen it, but you're this calm? Everyone in the comments is convinced that woman's Evelyn. Aren't you going to set the record straight?"


Verena arched a brow. "And why would I? I know the editor who published that piece. His writing has always been precise-never vague unless someone's pulling the strings. The woman they're talking about is just another wealthy lad, hardly a public figure.There's no story there. But the timing of the release,right as she returns from abroad, makes it obvious.She wants people to connect her name with Evelyn without ever stating it outright."


She placed the finished medicine aside, disinfected her hands, and said casually, "If she wants to play the impostor, let her. It only diverts attention from me. I'll sit back and see which assassin-for-hire takes the bait."


Miranda fell quiet for a moment, and then warned in a softer tone, "That's clever, but don't underestimate her. She's still part of the upper circle of Shoildon.if she decides to cross you, she'll only stir up bigger problems."


Where Miranda carried unease, Verena's voice stayed light, even teasing. "You're halfway across the world in Clokron, yet you're keeping closer tabs on Shoildon gossip than l am."


Miranda gave a small laugh. "Despite living in another country, I make it a point to keep up with news from back home. Besides, I follow that editor too. Normally, I scroll past his articles, but when I spotted Evelyn's name, I couldn't resist reading."


She clicked her tongue and added, "I mean it, though -what's your real take on all this?"
###Chapter 125 That's Nothing More Than Your Delusion
Verena's smile faded, her tone turning firm. "If she dares to confront me openly, let's see if she has the courage to claim she's Evelyn. Should she admt it,I'll tear off her mask myself. But if she hides behind vague hints, then I'll see if her real aim is me."


Noticing Miranda's worry, Verena softened her tone,lips curving slightly. "Relax. Other than the setbacks I've had with Isaac, there's no one left who can rattle me."



On the other end of the line, Miranda's brows knitted tighter, her unease far from soothed.


"Still," she cautioned, "you need to stay on guard.Your network is strong in Clokron, but in Shoildon,you don't have the same protection."


Verena chuckled. "Who says I'm unprotected here?  Isn't Isaac still by my side?"






As dusk settled, one of the lobby elevators chimed,drawing Katelyn's attention instantly. Her eyes lit up as soon as she saw who it was.


She quickly tucked her phone away and strode forward, her smile warm and expectant. "Isaac."


Jacob was the one wheeling lsaac out of the elevator. At the sound of Isaac's name being called,he instinctively slowed.


Katelyn's steps quickened, her expression glowing with affection. "Isaac, it's been so long.I hope you've been keeping well."


But Isaac's gaze remained fixed ahead, his face carved from stone, not sparing her even a glance.


"Jacob, did I tell you to stop?" Isaac's deep voice echoed.



Flustered by the reprimand, Jacob understood  immediately and resumed pushing the wheelchair forward without another pause.



Katelyn had long grown accustomed to lsaac's indifference, and his cold shoulder didn't faze her.


"Hold on a second." She quickened her pace,stepping directly into his path.


The persistence grated on him. Isaac lifted his eyes with visible impatience, his tone sharp. "Miss Fuller,what exactly do you want?"


His words carried the same chill as his stare, and Katelyn's lips quivered before she forced a faint smile. "Isaac, you haven't changed-you're still as heartless as ever."



A hollow laugh slipped out, her voice softening as she added, "It's been years since we last saw each other.Don't worry, I'm not the reckless woman l used to be. I won't chase you anymore. But even if we couldn't be lovers, we were still childhood friends,weren't we?"  She tried to tug on the past, but lsaac's response was merciless. "Are you finished?"


His hands tightened on the wheelchair wheels, ready to move forward at the slightest pause.


Helplessness flickered across her face, yet she still lowered her voice, almost pleading. "Isaac, please...don't shut me out completely."


His reply cut sharper than any blade. "Katelyn Fuller."


He used her full name, his tone cold and deliberate,the weight of formality striking against her casual familiarity.


"I have a wife," Isaac said flatly. "And given our past,keeping you at a distance isn't cruelty-it's common sense."


The sarcasm in his voice hit its mark, freezing her smile and leaving a hollow ache in her chest.


All her life, Katelyn had grown up believing she could claim anything she desired. Isaac was the single exception. Yet rejection only made her resolve  harden-the more he resisted, the more determined she became to have him.



Katelyn steadied her breathing, forcing herself into a gentler tone. "I'm sure your mother already told you why I came. Isaac, I'm worried about your health.I've studied cases like yours for years-let me handle your treatment,please?"


Her voice lifted with urgency as she continued, "I swear I can get you walking again. You don't have to be afraid-I only want to heal your legs. I won't ask for anything in return, and I won't interfere in your marriage."


Those promises sounded sincere, but whether she meant them was a truth only Katelyn carried.


Isaac didn't blink. "So you sent my mother to plead for you," he said coolly. "Did she forget to mention that my wife is also a doctor-and she's the one treating me?"


His eyes hardened, his voice edged with ice."You claim you won't ask for anything in return. Do you  really think the moment you ask, I'll simply hand it over?"



Katelyn had expected some trace of softness, a hint of courtesy for their shared past. Instead, his blunt rejection sliced through her like glass.


Her chest tightened, resentment flashing in her eyes at the way he spoke of his wife. He accepted someone like Verena, yet always turned her away.


Katelyn said nothing, but lsaac caught the flicker of dissatisfaction instantly.


"Katelyn," he said, his tone cold but deliberate, "we grew up together. You know me well-but I know you better. If you wanted nothing, you wouldn't be here waiting for hours, desperate to force a chance to speak."


The words cut too close to the truth, and panic flickered in her gaze before she could stop it.


Isaac leaned forward slightly, his voice steady and merciless. "Let's be clear. I love my wife. I will never  give you hope. Don't waste your time scheming to drive a wedge between us. Even if Verena walked away from me tomorrow, I still wouldn't choose you.Do you understand?"


The words left his mouth like a cold truth, but the weight of them carried a warning as well.


Katelyn's jaw tightened, her smile stiff and brittle."Since you insist on being so blunt, then I'll stop pretending too. Fine, I still have feelings for you-that's why it kills me to see you like this. If you're so sure about your feelings, then why won't you accept my treatment? What are you afraid of?"


Isaac didn't hesitate. "'It's not fear. It's refusal."


He had no desire for entanglement with her, no wish to plant even the faintest shadow of insecurity in Verena's heart, and absolutely no interest in inviting misunderstandings into his marriage.


"Jacob. We're leaving."


At the order, Jacob pushed the wheelchair forward,  guiding Isaac past Katelyn without pause.


Her hands balled into fists, fury spilling out as she shouted after him, "Isaac! Are you really going to let your stubborn pride trap you in that chair for the rest of your life?"


The words hit the air like a slap. Jacob's grip faltered,his body stiffening. He wanted to look at Isaac's face,but from his position behind the chair, he couldn't see the storm gathering there.


Across the lobby, both receptionists froze,exchanging wide-eyed glances. Ever since Isaac had been confined to a wheelchair, Danica had strictly forbidden anyone from uttering such words. Yet here was Katelyn, bold enough to fling them straight at him.



Seeing that Jacob had stopped pushing the wheelchair, Katelyn stepped closer, her voice sharp and unrelenting. "Face it, Isaac-no one but me can save your legs. You're clinging to hope in your wife,but think about it. She's just a medical student from Pine Hill University. Every doctor you've sought  before her came from prestigious institutions, world-class specialists with reputations that eclipse hers."


She pressed harder, her tone cutting. "If doctors from the top of their field couldn't cure you, what makes you think Verena possibly could?"


Isaac didn't bother addressingher long-winded claims. He latched onto the last line, pivoting his chair toward her.11SO1according to you， she can＇t一but you can?"


The sudden glance from him made Katelyn's pulse race. Convinced she'd finally broken through, she fought to keep the excitement off her face and nodded eagerly. "Yes. I can. I'm more qualified than any of those so-called specialists."


But before her anticipation could take root, lsaac gave a low, humorless laugh. "That's nothing more than your delusion."


His voice cut like ice. Turning away, he wheeled himself forward without another word, leaving her staring at his back as it grew smaller in the distance.
###Chapter 126 Jealousy Only Comes From Caring
By late afternoon, Verena had finished preparing the last of Isaac's medicine. With her work done, she curled into the swing chair on her balcony, lazily flipping through a book as the sunlight spilled across the pages.


The faint click of the door caught her ear. She glanced over her shoulder and her lips curved into a warm smile. "Isaac, you're back."


Closing the book with ease, she set it on the small table beside her and rose gracefully, heading in his direction.


He answered with a distracted nod, his eyes lingering on her longer than usual, something clouded in their depths.


Isaac's mind was elsewhere. He knew Katelyn's   temperament far too well-reckless, obsessive,unpredictable. If she decided to fix her madness on Verena, she would stop at nothing. That thought alone weighed heavily on him.


"The food's already set," Verena said lightly. "Shall we head down for dinner?"


But her husband seemed lost in thought, unmoving.She tilted her head, catching his unease. "Isaac,what's on your mind?"


He shook it off, though his tone carried quiet warning. "If someone tries reaching out to you in the next few days, ignore them."


Her brows arched, curiosity sparking in her gaze."Oh? So there is someone stirring up trouble?"


Leaning back against the wall, Verena rested her chin in her palm, a knowing smile tugging at her lips."Don't tell me it's one of your old admirers."


Her voice held more teasing amusement than jealousy, as though she were fishing for gossip  instead of reassurance.


That lack of envy unsettled Isaac in a way he couldn't explain. A strange urge rose in him-he wanted her to care, if only a little. "Yes," he admitted quietly. "A woman who chased after me for years back in school."


Verena's eyes widened, her tone laced with exaggerated surprise. "Since school? That's real devotion. Even after all this time, and despite you being married, she still hasn't let go? How touching.Aren't you even a little moved by such loyalty?"


She bent closer, her playful expression hovering just inches from his face, as though she were defending the other woman instead of him.


Isaac narrowed his eyes, studying her face as though searching for the faintest crack. What he found wasn't jealousy at all, but an almost curious spark-as if she were intrigued rather than unsettled.


A strange restlessness stirred in him, and his brows pulled tight. "So you really don't care?" he asked, his  tone low, edged with frustration.


Verena tilted her head, confusion flickering across her features. "Why would I?" she replied honestly."You're not involved with her, are you? Then what's there to be upset about?"


Her calmness doused his agitation, yet it brought him no comfort.


Katelyn meant nothing to him. That was the truth.But what he wanted wasn't just Verena's logical acceptance-it was fire. He wanted proof that she cared enough to be shaken, to feel possessive, to burn for him the way he quietly burned for her.


His gaze lingered on her, questions coiling in his chest. Was her serenity rooted in trust? Or was it indifference-proof that no matter what he did,he would never truly move her heart?


The thought struck deep, leaving him hollow. For the first time, he felt as though her world might remain forever out of his reach. He lowered his head, voice breaking softer than a whisper. "If our roles were reversed, I'd be furious Because jealousy only comes from caring."


Though barely spoken, the stillness of the room carried his whisper straight to her. She froze, the weight of his words sinking in, and for once, her steady composure faltered.


Sliding down to meet him at eye level, Verena rested a hand gently on his knee. "Isaac, you've misunderstood me," she said softly, her voice warm."I'm not unbothered because | don't care. I'm unbothered because I know you. I know you'd never betray me. My calmness isn't indifference-it's trust."


His throat worked as he swallowed, and he brushed his fingertips lightly along her cheek, almost as though he needed to feel she was real. "You mean that?" he murmured, the question trembling with vulnerability.


Isaac's hands framed her face, his touch firm yet reverent, and before Verena could react, his lips pressed against hers. The kiss was unhurried at first, tender enough to make her lashes flutter closed. Without thinking, her arms looped around his neck, pulling him closer, her body answering his without hesitation.


That simple, instinctive gesture stirred something turbulent in him. What began as a soft kiss deepened, their breaths blending, their hearts drumming to the same rhythm.


Just as her body melted into the moment, Isaac drew back slightly, his lips hovering over hers.


Verena's brows furrowed faintly, her voice low and questioning. "Why did you stop..."


He didn't give her time to finish her question. In one smooth motion, he caught her hand, tugged her forward, and settled her onto his lap.


Startled, Verena gasped, but her surprise was quickly drowned when his mouth found hers again-this time fierce, deliberate, claiming. His hand cradled the back of her head, keeping her close,while his tongue brushed past her lips with teasing  insistence.


The world tilted. Breathless, she leaned back slightly,searching for air, but Isaac's arm tightened around her waist. It wasn't forceful-it was almost childlike, a desperate hold as though he feared she might slip away,his silent declaration that she belonged to him.


The kiss lingered, consuming and heady, until her lips tingled with numbness.


When he finally eased away, Verena stared at him with hazy eyes, her chest rising unsteadily.Her lips parted with a faint laugh. "So... are we still having dinner?"


Isaac pressed her closer against him, his breath warm at her ear, his voice low and roughened. "Of course."


That lingering kiss had lightened Isaac's mood-at least she hadn't pushed him away. Maybe, just maybe,she felt something for him after all.


Dinner passed, and when Verena set her utensils  down, she checked the clock and turned to him."Come with me to the bedroom. It's time for a health check."


Isaac's brow arched. "Didn't you already check me earlier this week?"


"From now on, we'll be doing it every day. Think of it as treatment, not just observation," Verena replied.


Inside the bedroom, she guided him to the bed,arranging pillows behind him until he rested comfortably against the headboard.


Isaac no longer carried the stiff unease he once had under her care. Without waiting for instructions, he loosened his belt and slid his trousers partway down.


Her voice cut through the quiet, low and deliberate."Keep going."


Isaac froze, uncertain he'd heard her right. His eyes flicked up to meet hers.


Perched at the bedside, Verena tilted her head, the corners of her lips curving into a slow, knowing smile. "You heard me. Everything."


Her gaze dipped pointedly toward the dark blue boxers that still clung to him. "Even those."


A dry swallow caught in his throat. "That wasn't necessary before..."


Verena leaned in, her expression calm but edged with amusement. "Because before, the treatment hadn't reached this stage. Tonight, I'll be using a new method-precise, demanding, and far more detailed than anything we've tried so far. I'll need to watch your body's response, track the timing of every shift,and record it all carefully."


Her eyes glimmered with a mix of mischief and authority as she lowered her voice. "So, Isaac... are you going to undress yourself? Or should I do it for you?"


Heat surged across lsaac's skin, climbing from his collar to his cheeks until his whole face burned crimson. Words stumbled from his lips, broken and useless."I...|-" Amusement flickered in Verena's eyes, her mood turning playful as she leaned in closer. Her fingertip began at his temple, trailing slowly down the bridge of his nose before pausing at his mouth. She brushed against his lips with the faintest touch, a feather-light caress meant only to test his restraint.


The contact made his throat tighten. Isaac swallowed hard, his head tilting toward her fingers as if drawn against his wil,aching for more.


But she denied him that satisfaction. Her hand slipped lower, pressing gently against his chest,circling deliberately as though she owned every inch.


Isaac had slipped into his home clothes, yet he could still feel her touch pressing through the thin fabric,frustratingly distant, liketrying to scratch an itch with a glove on.


Verena's slow teasing was too much for him, and his throat tightened as his Adam's apple bobbed twice, a rough gasp slipping free.


Not missing his reaction, Verena moved closer, her  lips nearly grazing his ear. "Isaac, you blush at the smallest touch. How will you manage when things go further?"



Her fingers traced down his torso, slow and teasing,until they hovered at the edge of his waistband."You clearly can't decide... so let me decide for you."


That was when lsaac's hand shot forward, gripping her wrist, his voice unsteady but firm. "No..."


Feigning hurt, Verena lifted her gaze to his, her lashes trembling as though on the verge of tears. "So unwilling to accept my treatment? Don't you want us to finally become a real husband and wife?"
###Chapter 127 I'm An Old Acquaintance Of Isaac's
Color crept up lsaac's neck, staining his ears and cheeks as he shifted uneasily beneath Verena's gaze. Every part of him betrayed how much he wanted her, how much he wanted to be her husband in the truest sense.
He turned his head sharply, refusing to meet her eyes. "I'll... I'll take them off myself," he muttered.
Verena caught the flicker of nerves in his voice and finally relented, a knowing smile tugging at her lips.Without another word, she drew back her hand and crossed the room to retrieve the medical kit.

By the time she turned again, he had already stripped away his boxers, leaving his lower body bare. His long legs were still muscular, every line of muscle etched in quiet defiance.  Though she had seen him before under different circumstances, this moment carried a weight all its own. His memory erased those past intimacies,but hers did not.


Verena inhaled slowly, steadying herself before dipping a cotton swab into the medicine. She pressed the cool liquid against the firm planes of his abdomen.


A shiver ran through him. His fists clenched on the sheets, his jaw tight, as though sheer willpower kept him from reacting further.


He kept his face turned away, the flush climbing higher.


The shame wasn't in the treatment itself-he wasn't resisting her skill. It was the vulnerability, the exposure, the thought of her unwavering eyes on him.



But Verena's focus was absolute. Once her hands began their work, nothing distracted her-not the heat radiating from him, not the ragged cadence of  his breath.


When the medicine reached its peak effect, she set the swab aside and carefully took up her silver needles. With precision born of years of mastery, she pressed each one into the right points along his abdomen, steady and unerring.


This time, Verena abandoned gentleness. One by one, the needles slid into place with deliberate pressure, sharper and more demanding than before.


"Hh-" Isaac sucked in a harsh breath, his jaw locked as sweat prickled along his hairline.


Her gaze lingered on his face, calm but probing. "Do you feel it burning? Like the heat is rising inside you?"


He gave a strained nod, fingers digging into the sheets as though to anchor himself. The fire in his abdomen had spread upward, licking at his chest,leaving him restless and raw.


Verena's tone carried reassurance, though her hands  remained steady. "Your body responded to our closeness the other day, which was promising. Today I raised the dosage and refined the method.What you're feeling means the treatment is working."


Through the haze of heat, lsaac's eyes locked on hers. Pain was something he could bear, especially when it came with hope. His hand shot up, clutching hers with surprising force, his voice rough with longing. "Tell me... will I really become the man beside you in every way? Not just in name?"


Her heart trembled at the naked plea in his wvords.She squeezed his hand firmly, meeting his gaze head-on. "Yes, Isaac. Trust me-you will."


Isaac saw the care in her eyes. For a moment, the fire in his body wasn't the only thing consuming him. His dark eyes softened, filled with emotions he couldn't untangle-half devotion,half confusion.


Was this woman's heart truly his? At times she looked at him as though she cherished him more than her own life. At others, she seemed impossibly distant. The next morning, Katelyn replayed her conversation with Isaac from the day before. Every sentence from him had revolved around his wife. The way he shielded Verena gnawed at her, stirring both fury and unease.


He had warned her not to seek Verena out, but that only cemented her resolve to do exactly that. If Isaac guarded her so fiercely, perhaps Verena wasn't as capable as people claimed. Maybe she was only strong enough to deal with fools like Kaia.


Katelyn's fingers danced across her phone screen,pulling up her assistant's messages. Within moments, she found the number she'd been given-Verena's. Without hesitation, she pressed call.


Meanwhile, Verena had just set her cup aside and was heading for the stairs when her phone buzzed.She didn't bother glancing at the caller ID; habit led her to swipe and answer immediately.


"Hello?" Good morning, Ms. Verena Willis."


A smooth, unfamiliar female voice drifted through the receiver. Verena frowned and finally glanced at the screen. Unknown number.



"Who's speaking?" she asked evenly.


The woman on the other end gave a soft, deliberate laugh. "Let's just say I'm... an old acquaintance of Isaac's."



The way the stranger spoke lsaac's name-soft,almost possessive-caught Verena's attention.


Isaac's words from the night before came back to her. So this must be her, the one who'd chased after him since school. Bold woman, Verena thought, to appear this quickly and so directly.


Her tone remained calm, almost indifferent. "What exactly do you want?"


On the other end, Katelyn was a bit surprised that Verena didn't ask for more details about her identity.With a light laugh, she said, "I do have something to  say, but over the phone feels... impersonal. Why don't we meet this afternoon? I'll tell you everything face to face."



Verena didn't need long to recognize the hidden thorns in Katelyn's voice. Still, shewasn't one to shy away from a challenge. "Fine. I'll meet you."


She ended the call before the other woman could add another word.


Staring at the darkened screen, Verena's lips curved into a cool, knowing smile.
###Chapter 128 Let Her Wait





That afternoon, Katelyn realized her meeting with Verena was coming up, so she picked out a sleek silver handbag from the closet, dressed herself with meticulous care, and strutted out in her favorite heels.


She arrived at a cozy restaurant in Shoildon, claimed a corner table, and sent Verena a quick message with her location. "I'm here now. See you soon."


Settling in, Katelyn ordered a juice and waited, the picture of composure.


Verena responded with a simple, "Okay." Then she placed her phone aside and continued her work on her laptop.


There was a reason people trusted a woman's instincts-they were hardly ever wrong.


When Katelyn called earlier, Verena instantly picked up on the underlying tension that this was no friendly invitation.



Sensing that Katelyn had her own agenda, Verena had no intention of playing along easily. Since Katelyn had already arrived, Verena decided to let her wait.



Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Katelyn saw Verena's short response and figured she was on her way.


A self-satisfied grin formed on Katelyn's lips. She assumed Isaac's wife would be easy to deal with.After all, she'd agreed to meet without any hesitation.



With her confidence soaring, Katelyn locked her phone and slipped it back into her bag, ready for whatever came next.



Thinking Verena would walk in any minute, she sat back and watched the door, waiting patiently.


After finishing almost three glasses of juice, Katelyn grew impatient, and Verena still hadn't appeared. Her eyes swept the room, but there wasn't a single familiar face heading in her direction.


A quick glance at her phone told Katelyn that nearly an hour had slipped by. Irritation flickered across her features. Apart from Isaac, she'd never waited so long for anyone. If meeting Verena hadn't been essential, she would have walked out ages ago.


Katelyn pushed down her annoyance and kept scrolling through her feed, doing her best to appear unfazed.



Elsewhere, Verena closed her laptop with a quiet snap and made her way downstairs, phone in hand.


Rhonda greeted her with a polite smile. "Are you heading out, Mrs. Bennett? Should I ask the driver to get the car ready?"


Verena shook her head, her expression light.′′NO need, I'll drive myself. I won't be gone long, so there's really no point."


Seraphina Villas weren't far from the restaurant Katelyn picked, so the drive took Verena less than twenty minutes.


Once inside, Verena told a server her name and waited as she was guided through the dining area.


The server pointed toward the far side of the room with a welcoming smile. "Ma'am, your table is over on the right."


Verena gave a nod of appreciation. "Thank you,I see it."


With that, the server offered a small bow and hurried off to her next task.



Turning toward the spot the server indicated,Verena spotted an empty table with just a single glass set out.



At that moment, another server approached with a new glass of juice, while a young woman, her attention fixed on her phone, hurried right into the server's path.


Their paths collided, causing the server to lose balance and splash juice onto the woman's hand.
A quick apology came from the server. "I'm so sorry about that."
She fumbled for a napkin, reaching out to help clean the spill.
The woman sidestepped the gesture, snatching a napkin herself to wipe her hand.
A glance down confirmed Katelyn's outfit was unscathed, much to her relief, especially since the clothes were a rare, limited edition piece.
Annoyance from her long wait for Verena now bubbled up over this small accident. She shot the server a cold glare. "Could you try being more careful?"
The server's cheeks turned crimson as she murmured another apology. "I'm truly sorry, I'll bring you a replacement right away."
Unimpressed, Katelyn waved her off. "Forget it. Just get back to your work." Visibly grateful, the server bowed several more times before retreating.
###Chapter 129 Persuade Isaac To Accept Her Treatment Plan
From a distance, Verena silently observed the commotion, taking in every detail as the scene unfolded. Apparently, the woman who had spent years chasing after lsaac was the arrogant type.


Shrugging off her thought, Verena strode over to the table.


Katelyn was still dabbing juice from her fingers when a soft shadow approached her. Looking up, she found herself face-to-face with a woman whose features were refined and whose presence was effortlessly graceful.


A slight arch of her brow, and Katelyn paused. "So you must be Verena Willis?"


A gentle smile appeared as Verena gave a nod."That's right, I'm Verena." An unexpected wave of discomfort washed over Katelyn at Verena's easy acknowledgment. She'd gone to great lengths to look her best, thinking she might unsettle Verena with her own confidence.Knowing Kaia since childhood, Katelyn had assumed Verena would possess the same simple, understated grace as Kaia. She had never anticipated how strikingly beautiful Verena actually was.


Without another glance, Katelyn tossed her used napkin into the trash, her lips curving into a calculated smile. "If memory serves, we agreed on two o'clock for this meeting."


Verena pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes flicking to her phone before she spoke. "Is that so?I'm sorry about that. Looks like I'm running an hour behind."


Despite the apology, Verena's tone was airy and nonchalant, betraying no real regret.


An hour of waiting had frayed Katelyn's patience, and Verena's relaxed attitude only made things worse. It stung to think lsaac had chosen someone like Verena  over her. Besides her beauty, what did this woman possibly have to offer?


There wasn't any point in starting a fight right away,so Katelyn forced her irritation down and kept her smile intact. Still, her words carried unmistakable sarcasm. "I heard you grew up somewhere pretty remote and only came to Shoildon this year. I suppose punctuality isn't something you're used to."


Beneath Katelyn's soft tone, her words carried a subtle bite.



Rather than rising to the challenge, Verena turned to a waiter and quietly asked for a glass of water.


It wasn't long before the waiter returned,setting the glass in front of her. Verena offered a quiet thank you, took a small sip, and then looked across the table at Katelyn with a calm smile. "Apologies, I've had my hands full lately, so anything not urgent tends to get pushed aside. As for my sense of time..."


She paused for a moment, mneeting Katelyn's gaze with a mild, almost teasing comment. "I'm actually  the type who's never late. Today's meeting with you just slipped my mind, that's all."


Katelyn's lips curled in a private smirk. What kind of person claimed to be punctual, only to forget a meeting? It was obvious to her that Verena's lack of polish showed, even now that she was living in comfort. No matter how fancy Verena's new life,she'd always be out of place among the elite with Isaac.People in their social circle would surely gossip about the two of them.


The more Katelyn dwelled on it, the more convinced she became that lsaac couldn't really be in love with Verena. He was just being dutiful, keeping up appearances for the sake of family expectations.


Surely, Katelyn believed only someone like her, a childhood friend with history and a connection to Isaac's world, could truly stand beside him,through whatever came their way.


Shaking off these thoughts, KKatelyn kept her expression perfectly composed. "You must be incredibly busy. I appreciate you squeezing me in," she said. Then she added with a hint of emphasis,
"I'm Katelyn Fuller, Isaac's friend since we were children, and, as you may have heard, we are childhood sweethearts."
Katelyn lingered on the phrase "childhood sweethearts," making it clear she wanted Verena to notice just how special her.connection with lsaac was.
Verena remained composed, her face relaxed and friendly as she patiently waited for Katelyn to say more.
When Verena's expression remained unfazed,Katelyn assumed she must be holding back a pang of jealousy. After all, what woman wouldn't feel uneasy facing her husband's childhood sweetheart?
Straightening in her seat, Katelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. "To tell you the truth, I came today because I'm concerned about lsaac's health. As his wife, I'm sure you want the best for his recovery, just as l do."  Verena took a moment to study Katelyn, searching her memory for the connection, and then it clicked.Katelyn's name had come up in those tabloid articles linked to Evelyn.


With the pieces falling into place, Verena quickly saw through Katelyn's intentions.


One eyebrow lifted, she responded, "Of course I want Isaac to get better. But what exactly are you suggesting, Miss Fuller? Are you hoping to oversee Isaac's treatment yourself?"


With unwavering confidence, Katelyn met Verena's direct gaze. "That's right, I plan to take on lsaac's treatment myself.I know you're a doctor as well, but his situation isn't something just anyone can manage."


"ls that so?" Verena leaned back and crossed her arms, her voice cool."SOo you believe you can succeed where I would fail, is that right?"


Although Katelyn was convinced of her own abilities,she made sure her words and posture radiated poise and sophistication in Verena's presence.


Katelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear,offering a warm smile. "Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not doubting your abilities. The truth is,Isaac's mother has already sought out numerous renowned doctors, and none have succeeded. Your credentials are impressive, but so many have tried and failed with Isaac. Every unsuccessful attempt only makes things harder for him. We simply can't take unnecessary risks with his health."



A soft chuckle escaped Verena. She recognized how cleverly Katelyn tried to elevate herself while subtly undermining her at the same time.


"Of course, no one should be reckless with lsaac's well-being.But what makes you so sure that I'm the risk, and you're the solution?" Verena crossed one leg over the other, a spark of amusement in her gaze."Miss Fuller, you and I both know medicine doesn't offer guarantees. No real doctor would promise a perfect outcome, isn't that right?"


"I can make that claim because I've achieved results before," Katelyn replied, her smile taking on a hint of superiority. "Could it be that you're doubting me because lsaac's shown some improvement while you're caring for him?"


Lifting her glass, Verena took a calm sip, unfazed."Whether he's getting better or not, why does that matter to you?"


The evasive response only seemed to confirm Katelyn's suspicions. She felt even more certain that Verena wasn't capable of curing Isaac; if shewere,she wouldn't be so indirect.



Her assessment now complete, Katelyn dismissed Verena as all ego and little substance-not worth her energy or competition.


Leaning in,Katelyn lowered her voice and spoke with deliberate clarity. "Let me reassure you, I'm not here to stir up any drama. My only goal is to see lsaac recover, which benefits you too, doesn't it? I'd appreciate it if you'd support me in convincing lsaac to accept my treatment." Verena saw right through Katelyn's indirect tactics now. Katelyn wasn't just eager to showcase her long-standing bond with lsaac; she also wanted her to persuade Isaac to accept her treatment plan.
###Chapter 130 Why Not Hand Her The Stage

Verena tilted her head slightly, her gaze steadly on Katelyn.Since you're so certain you can heal lsaac,why don't you tell me where exactly you practice?"


Katelyn's lips curved, but her eyes carried a glint of calculation. "That's a private matter. Not something I can just reveal."



Her voice lowered with deliberate mystery. "But surely you've heard of that world-renowned surgeon abroad-the one who takes on impossible cases and never faiIs?"



The implication was clear, almost brazen.


Amusement flickered across Verena's face. Of course she knew who Katelyn was hinting at. How could she not? The so-called legend was none other than herself. It seemed this woman had truly decided to wear Evelyn's mask.


Her smile deepened with quiet mockery. "Are you suggesting Evelyn?"


At the name, Katelyn's expression didn't flinch.She neither confirmed nor denied, but the confidence radiating from her grew thicker, as if she were basking in the illusion. "Some truths don't need to be spelled out. Her reputation speaks for itself, doesn't it?"



Verena almost laughed. How absurd. Who didn't stumble at the start? She had once faced failures,mistakes that had carved lessons into her bones. No doctor was flawless, yet Katelyn was painting perfection as if it were gospel.


Katelyn danced around the truth, tossing out half-answers that dangled like bait. She wanted the room to believe she was Evelyn, yet kept enough distance to deny it later if things went sour.


Verena,unwilling to give her such an escape route,leaned in with a feigned air of curiosity. "Oh, I've eard of her. She's rather extraordínary. Tell me,though-what exactly is your relationship with Evelyn?"


Katelyn faltered, the confident curve of her lips stiffening for the briefest second. Had Verena really not caught on? She had been dropping hints like breadcrumbs, practically spelling it out, yet this woman still pressed for an answer.


Openly declaring herself Evelyn would be dangerous -too many threads that could unravel if anyone started pulling. So she swallowed the risk and smoothed her smile. "As I mentioned a moment ago,some truths don't need to be spelled out. There are things my work prevents me from speaking about directly."


Verena's laugh was light, but the gleam in her eyes carried a sharper edge. Her nails tapped softly against the wooden table in a steady rhythm, each click a subtle warning. "Then tell me plainly-should I expect you to bring Evelyn here for lsaac's treatment,or are you trying to convince me that you are Evelyn?"


The tapping stopped. HHer hand stilled, her gaze locked on Katelyn's face. Though her voice was calm, the weight in her words cut straight through the room like a blade.



Katelyn stiffened under Verena's steady gaze. What was this supposed to mean? Why wasn't Verena swallowing the story?


Doubt flickered through her. Could Verena actually have ties to Evelyn? No,ridiculous.


Pine Hill University turned out droves of medical graduates every year. Someone like Verena-quiet,unremarkable-could never get close to Evelyn, let alone know her personally. Even she hadn't managed to step foot in Evelyn's hospital.


Forcing her unease down, Katelyn straightened her back, though her smile began to falter at the edges."I've already said, certain things can't be spoken aloud. You don't need to press me. All you really need to understand is this-lsaac's recovery is in my hands, and mine alone."


Verena let out a quiet laugh, the sound light but edged with scorn. It was almost amusing-Katelyn repeated the lie so often she seemed to have convinced herself it was the truth. As though she wasn't just pretending to be Evelyn, but actually slipping into the role, losing the line between fantasy and reality.


"Miss Fuller," Verena said, her tone silk over steel, "I must thank you for showing such concern. Especially for my husband."


She dragged those last two words out slowvly,savoring the weight of them, as if staking her claim in front of Katelyn and daring her to challenge it.


Verena caught the faint shift in Katelyn's expression and let a warm, almost disarming smile spread across her lips. "But I can't make that choice for Isaac. Since you're so certain about your skills, I'll leave it to him. You can talk to him directly. If he values his health, I'm sure he won't ignore such an offer. As for me, if he agrees, I won't object." For all her patient waiting, that was all Katelyn got-an elegant brush-off wrapped in politeness. Rage bubbled under her skin, though her smile hardened like ice. "So this is your game? Are you toying with me?"


Verena tilted her head, eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Why ever would you think that? I simnply don't know you well enough to judge your sincerity.People wear masks, Miss Fuller, and intentions are rarely as pure as they seem. That's why I believe the decision should rest with lsaac-he knows you far better than I do."


The calm cruelty in her tone only stoked Katelyn's fury. Before she could gather a reply, Verena rose gracefully, her every movement deliberate. "I've said what I needed to say. Goodbye, Miss Fuller."


With that, she turned and walked away, her figure retreating like a final taunt.


Katelyn sat frozen, trying to process the sting of Verena's words. It took her a long moment to realize she had been neatly cornered and dismissed. Her eyes clung to Verena's retreating silhouette, a venomous wish burning that she could pierce straight through her back.


That woman wasn't extraordinary-just the daughter of a minor Shoildon family barely worthy of mention.She, on the other hand, was Katelyn Fuller, the only heiress of the Fuller empire, courted and admired wherever she went.


What gave Verena the gall to carry herself like some untouchable queen? Only the Bennett name wrapped around her finger. Strip her of Isaac and his family's prestige, and she'd crumble back into the mediocrity she came from.


The insult dug deeper with every passing second.She had wasted more than an hour, waiting with patience she rarely gave anyone, only to be brushed aside as though she were nothing. Why should Verena get to wear the title of Mrs. Bennett?


Katelyn's heart twisted with fury at the thought. She had loved Isaac for over ten years, chased him with persistence that would have broken a weaker man, yet still she never won him. In the end, Verena hadn't earned him-she had stumbled into him, a wornan who got everything by chance while Katelyn was left grasping at the edges.


Katelyn seethed at the thought of lsaac choosing Verena over her. Everything she had invested-years of devotion, relentless pursuit-shattered the moment Verena appeared in his life.


Even after Verena's silhouette vanished from sight,Katelyn's eyes stayed locked on the doorway,burning with resentment as though the woman still stood there mocking her.


Meanwhile, Verena strolled calmly out of the restaurant, her steps unhurried as she headed toward the parking lot. With one hand, she pulled out her phone and dialed Miranda.


The call connected almost instantly, Miranda's teasing voice filling the line. "Well, well, what a surprise. Dr. Willis actually calling me first-this must be historic." A soft laugh slipped from Verena, though her tone shifted quickly. "Save the jokes. I have something important to discuss."


Miranda straightened her voice, sensing the seriousness. "Alright, what's going on?"


Sliding into the driver's seat, Verena shut the door behind her but didn't bother starting the car. "You were right the other day. That woman really is using Evelyn's name to serve her own agenda. I can't pin down her endgame yet, but her current plan is clear -she's trying to use Evelyn's reputation as leverage to treat lsaac, get close to him, and worm her way into his life."



Miranda let out a dry laugh. "What a joke. She really thinks she can pull that off? And you're just going to let her prance around pretending? You're not planning to call her out?"


Verena's lips curved into a faint smile as she replied,"Not yet."


Her gaze drifted toward the scenery outside the window, a glint of amusement sparking in her eyes."Actually, you've reminded me of something important. There's already a pack of vultures circling,waiting for the chance to drag me down. If she wants to claim Evelyn's name so badly, why not hand her the stage? Let's see how long she lasts when the knives come out. We can take the chance to handle those attackers."


Miranda's voice brightened with approva1. "That's brilliant, Verena. You're turning her ambition into bait.Let her draw the fire while you sit back and watch-classic strategy."


"Careful with the praise. Too much of it might make me think I actually enjoy playing these games,"Verena teased, her fingers tapping the steering wheel before she started the car. "I'm driving now;we'll talk later."


Miranda chuckled. "Fine, I'll stop before you get cocky.Drive safe."


The line clicked off, and Verena eased the car onto the road. In seconds, she was lost in the stream of traffic, her calm expression hiding the storm of calculations already forming in her mind.
###Chapter 1311 Need You To Take The Next Step For Me

Anger followed Katelyn through the front door. She moved briskly past the living room, her expression tight,while the butler stood silently aside and watched her take the stairs two at a time.
Years of service had taught the butler exactly when to keep his distance. Reading her mood in an instant,he kept quiet and stayed out of her path.
Once she reached the upper floor, Katelyn threw open the door to a secluded room.
Half-shuttered curtains filled the space with a dull gray glow. Anyone who walked in would have mistaken the place for a backroom operating table.
But this was no clinic.Floor-to-ceiling shelves lined the walls, holding jar after jar of animal organs and oddities, making it a scientist's lab gone grim.
Without sparing the shelves a glance, Katelyn snatched up a scalpel and dragged a trembling lab rat from a wire cage at her feet.
She pressed the rat down and cut into its side, making no effort to spare it pain-her anger finding an outlet in the violence.
The look in her eyes turned cold and vicious-a far cry from the graceful, polished woman she showed the world outside these walls.
Over and over, she drove the scalpel into the helpless animal, twisting what should have been a tool for saving lives into something brutal.
Weak squeals broke from the rat as it thrashed, the sounds fading fast in the wide, echoing room.
Katelyn barely registered the noise. Her stare was empty while she muttered again and again, "You think you can take what belongs to me? How dare you!"
Each angry whisper brought Verena's face into focus in her mind. She pictured the blade cutting into her rival, not just the animal.
Revenge simmered in her thoughts. She wanted to see Verena suffer, inch by inch.
As the rat's strength faded, it gave one last desperate kick and raked its claws across Katelyn's hand.
Pain shot through her, snapping her out of her haze. She gasped for breath and lifted her arm high.
A final shrill squeak pierced the room.
A moment later, the rat's limp body slid from the table, leaving the room in sudden, utter silence.
"Ah!" A sharp cry rang out from the hallway.
Kaia froze in place, covering her mouth with her hand as she stared in shock at the blood smeared across Katelyn's fingers.
Katelyn turned at the noise and asked coldly, "How much did you see?"
"I... just walked in," Kaia stammered, lowering her hand and trying not to gag from the metallic scent of blood. "I heard your heels on the stairs, so I knew you were home. When I couldn't find you, I saw this door open and thought I'd look."
Katelyn gave a short nod. "Alright."
A note of worry crept into Kaia's voice. "Did something happen to make you this upset?"
"Nothing's wrong," said Katelyn, brushing her off.
Katelyn flashed a smile that looked too smooth, and for a second, Kaia wondered if she had imnagined the earlier flash of anger.
Holding up her stained hand, Katelyn explained, "I was prepping for an experiment, but this rat went wild and tried to bite me. My professor in college always said, 'If a specimen attacks, you put it down right away.Did I startle you?"
Of course,Katelyn was lying. There was no way she'd let Kaia know she was really lashing out over Verena. Kaia had never come across such a principle during her studies, but since it came from her idol, she was ready to accept it without question.
Trying not to look at the mess, Kaia swallowed her disgust and forced a weak smile. "No, I'm fine."
"I'll handle this," Katelyn said quietly. "Go on back to your room. I'll stop by in a bit to talk."
Kaia nodded and hurried away, doing her best not to throw up.
A little while later, Katelyn showed up at Kaia's door.
Sliding onto the bed next to Kaia, Katelyn put on a gentle smile. "So, how are you feeling now? Any better?"After leaving Willis Villa, Kaia got caught in a downpour. The cold she picked up from that night had lingered for weeks.
Kaia, surprised by Kat nearly over it."
"That's what I wanted the next step for me."
Right away, Kaia caugh
When Katelyn nodded,
Katelyn arched a brow forgiveness. If they as past mistakes, anything
Returning home felt lik been a rash decision. D
After a moment of silen
Kaia started to get up, b	elyn's sudden concern, nodded eagerly. "Yeah, I've been taking my meds and I'm
	to hear." Katelyn squeezed her hand,locking eyes with her. "Listen, I need you to take t her meaning, her face lighting up. "Is it time for us to finally start our revenge?"
 Kaia's excitement grew. "What's the plan? Just say it, I'll handle it."
, a sly grin forming. "First, you've got to go home and beg your parents for k, make it sound like you went through hell-say you were in danger, you realize your . Play the part, cry if you have to, but make sure they forgive you."
e admitting defeat, but Kaia knew she couldn't avoid her family forever. Leaving had eep down, she worried Alec and Laura might turn their backs on her.
ce, Kaia nodded. "Alright; I'll do it."
ut Katelyn caught her by the arm. "Wait, that's not all."
Confused, Kaia glanced back. "What do you mean?" A chill flashed in Katelyn's eyes. "You're going to visit Verena, too."

At the mention of Verena, Kaia stiffened, eyes narrowing. "Why/should I bother facing her? You just want to give her a chance to make fun of mne?"

Katelyn kept her voice steady. "Relax. Listen to what I'm saying. Go apologize for everything that's happened and see if you can patch things up with her."

Kaia let her frustration show. "We can't even get through a basic conversation without fighting. How am I supposed to make friends with her? Can't we try something else?"

A sharp look flashed across Katelyn's face. "Do you really not get it? Winning her trust is the only way we'll get the upper hand."

Kaia's shoulders dropped as she mulled it over. "She's smart, you know. There's no way she'd just fall for it and trust me that easily."

A sly grin spread on Katelyn's lips. "That's exactly what I'm hoping for."

Confusion pulled Kaia's brows together. "What are you getting at?"

Katelyn's tone turned playful. "Go to Verena and play the victim. Make sure there are people watching, too.If you beg for forgiveness and she brushes you off, everyone else will think she's the unreasonable one. Her image will take the hit, not yours. Danica might not step into every squabble, but she's big on fairness. Once word gets around, she'll see things my way and back me up."

Turning her gaze to the window, Katelyn's lips curled in a satisfied smirk.

She knew all too well that the Bennett family had strict expectations. In a family like theirs, a daughter-in-law tainted by even a hint of scandal would never be welcome.
###Chapter 132 Realized Her Mistakes


Once the plan wrapped up, Katelyn led Kaia to the car and leaned close. "I want you to avoid any unnecessary trouble. The driver will drop you off inthe city center. He'll hand you the cash there, and you can catch a cab the rest of the way home."

Without a word, the driver swept open the rear door. Kaia slid inside and offered a nod. "Understood. That makes sense."

Just as the car was about to pull away,Katelyn stepped up to the open window, concern etched on her face."Kaia, don't rush into anything. I need you to be careful and think every decision through."

Kaia's lips curled into a faint smile as she met Katelyn's eyes. "You can trust me. I know exactly what's at stake. I'm not the same person I was before."

With their exchange finished, Kaia pressed the button to close the window. The vehicle eased away from the curb, soon vanishing down the avenue.

Reaching the city's heart, the driver eased the car to a stop by the roadside. He passed the envelope of bills to Kaia, who stepped out, and then made her way across the street, flagging down a waiting taxi.

Her journey ended at Willis Villa. Before she got out, Kaia paused for a moment to gather herself. She paid the driver, and then stepped into the sunlight.

Out front, the maid, Kylee Cooper, stood snipping branches, but the sight of Kaia stepping from the cab stopped her cold. After a stunned heartbeat, Kylee rushed over, tears bright in her eyes.

"Miss Willis, you've finally come home!" Kylee's voice trembled. "Since you vanished, everyone's been searching for you. Mrs. Willis hasn't slept a full night since. We've all been so worried."

Having watched Kaia grow from childhood, Kylee had carried her absence like a wound. Now relief and heartbreak mingled as she welcomed Kaia back.

Emotions swelled inside Kaia, and her voice caught. "I missed all of you, Kylee.I really did." With trembling hands, Kylee dabbed at her tears, nodding over and over. "I can't tell you how happy I am to see you safe. It's good to have you home."

Kaia cast a look toward the silent living room before lowering her voice. "Kylee, where are my parents? And Luka?"

"They're not home at the moment," said Kylee softly. "Your parents had to go to the company, and Luka has something at school. Why don't you come in and rest while you wait for them?"

Kylee reached out, intending to usher her inside. To her surprise, Kaia hesitated and pulled her hand free.

A flicker of concern passed over Kylee's face. "Is somethingthe matter, Miss Willis?"

Kaia's gaze dropped as she recalled Katelyn's words.

A single goal carried her home. She needed Alec and Laura to forgive her.

If she made it through the door like nothing happened, Laura would show her some compassion, but Alec's quick temper would almost certainly mean she'd face his anger and a long lecture about her foolishness.

Thinking back on Katelyn's advice, Kaia realized she needed to look as helpless as possible.

So, she stepped back, refusing to meet Kylee's eyes, and shook her head. "Kylee, I don't deserve to walk inside. I messed up. I'll wait righthere uuntil my parents come home."

A worried frown creased Kylee's brow as she reached for Kaia's arm. "You can't stay out here, not with night coming on. You'll get sick."

Without another word, Kaia slipped from Kylee's grasp and dropped to her knees on the walkway.

Startled, Kylee blurted out, "Miss Willis, why are you kneeling?"

Hot tears spilled over Kaia's cheeks as she begged, "I won't move until my parents come back and forgive me. Please, Kylee, just let me stay here."

To anyone watching, Kaia looked every bit the picture of a remorseful daughter. Her fists, hidden at her sides,were balled up tight. From the time she was little, Kaia had never known real discipline. She was always sheltered and never had to humble herself in front of the staff.

Verena's arrival had changed everything. If she hadn't shown up, Kaia would still be living like a little princess, never needing to bow her head.

Kylee's anxiety shot through the roof at the sight. "Oh dear...What do I do?"

An idea struck her, and she quickly fished out her phone, stepping away as she dialed Alec's assistant.

"Mr. Wallace? It's Kylee from the villa. Kaia is here..."

The moment she heard the call, Kaia dipped her head, and a faint, almost hidden smile touched her lips.

Not long after the call ended, Alec's car rolled into the driveway.

The moment the car stopped, Kylee rushed over to greet the couple. "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, thank goodness you're finally home."

Laura barely waited for the car to stop before she rushed out. Spotting Kaia kneeling near the entryway,worry and frustration flashed across her face as she hurried over. She grabbed Kaia's shoulders, her voice trembling. "Where have you been all this time? Do you have any idea how much we searched for you? Not a single day went by when we weren't frantic."

No sooner had the words left Laura's lips than Alec's voice cut through the air from behind. "So, you actually showed your face here?"

With a sharp look in Kaia's direction, Alec strode past without slowing, heading straight for the door.

His tone was as cold as a winter gust, and every word stung as it hung between them.

Realizing he was about to disappear inside, Kaia scrambled to stand. "Dad, wait, please-ouch!"

Her knees buckled, sending her straight back to the ground.

The noise caught Alec's attention, and though he paused, his back remained turned.

A glance at Kaia's bruised knees made Laura's heart clench. She called after him, her voice raw. "Alec, can't you stop for one moment and listen to your daughter?"

Without waiting for a reply, Laura knelt beside Kaia and slipped an arm under her shoulders. "Come on, Kaia.You have to get up."

Seeing that Alec stood rigid, Kaia shook her head. "I can't get up yet. I have to answer for what I've done."

A heavy silence fell before Alec finally turned around, coming to stand before her, hands clasped behind his back. "Alright. Go on. Let's hear what you have to say for yourself."

Staying on her knees, Kaia bit her lower lip so hard her eyes shimmered with tears. Slowly, she lifted her gazeto meet theirs.

Her voice trembled. "Dad, Mom, I'm truly sorry. I should never have done those things."

From the sidelines, Kylee interjected, unable to stay quiet, "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, Kaia has been out here this entire time, kneeling. No matter what I told her, she wouldn't get up. She kept saying she couldn't step inside until you both forgave her."

A mother's instinct kicked in, and Laura's anger faded, replaced by a deep ache for her daughter.Seeing Kaia so broken, tears streaking down her cheeks, Laura gathered her up in a fierce embrace.

She whispered, "That's enough now. I'm just glad you see your mistakes. Come, let's get you inside."

No sooner had Laura spoken than Alec cast his gaze down on Kaia,his voice laced with skepticism. "Is that so? Suddenly you're ready to admit you were wrong? I figured you'd been off somewhere, not giving us a single thought."

That biting edge in Alec's voice made it clear his anger had not faded.

With a gentle but determined motion, Kaia freed herself from Laura's hold and met her father's gaze. "I know you're angry, Dad. Honestly, just being allowed back here is more than I hoped for. I kept thinking I'd never have the chance to see you both again."

Frowning, Alec looked confused for a moment, Laura leaned forward and asked, "Why did you think you wouldn't see us anymore?" Taking a steadying breath, Kaia finally answered, "A sudden storm came thenight I left, and I lost all sense of direction. After wandering around in circles, I finally collapsed by the roadside. My next memory was waking up in a cramped, unfamiliar space. Darkness and fear pressed in on me, and I truly believed that was it. Only when the person who took me left me unattended did I manage to slip out and escape."

Carefully,Kaia watched both of her parents to see how they would react to her story.

Laura's eyes filled with tears, and Alec's face tightened with concern.

Clearly, her words had reached them.

Tears began streaming down Kaia's face as she continued, "I was completely lost, with nothing and no one to help me. My phone had disappeared, so I couldn't even try to reach you. I walked for hours, eating whatever scraps I could find, hoping I might stumble across something familiar. Eventually, I reached the city, but I had no money left. A girl I'd never met took pity on me and gave me taxi fare so I could come home.Going through all of that made me see how foolish I'd been. All my life,you protected me from any real hardship. Verena spent her childhood shouldering responsibility, taking care of Grandma out in the countryside.When Grandma died, Verena finally came here to live with us, but I was too jealous of your attention and let it make me act horribly toward her. Everything I did to her, I regret now."

Sobs wracked Kaia until she struggled to breathe.

Clutching Alec's trousers, she loøked up through her tears and pleaded, "Dad, I swear I'll never hurt Verena again. Please, I want youto forgive me. I'll make it right, I promise."

A downward glance from Alec showed a trace of inner conflict; his jaw tightened, yet the anger in his eyes faded, though he said nothing in return.

All the while, Laura couldn't hold back her own tears.

To see her daughter suffer such hardship was a pain Laura had never imagined she would feel.

Laura shoved Alec lightly and cried out through her tears, "Alec, you claimed she was out there enjoying herself, yet you were the one who cut off every bit of her financial support. How could she possibly live that kind of life? Didn't you hear what happened? Kaia was kidnapped and barely made it back alive. She realizes her mistakes now; her knees are raw from kneeling, and you still refuse to forgive her? She's your own daughter by blood. Doesn't that mean anything to you?"

A heavy silence hung in the air after Laura finished speaking, and Alec couldn't help but steal a glance at Kaia as her sobs echoed around them.

His heart tightened; any father would feel moved seeing his own child so broken, especially when her remorse was so raw and honest.

Lowering himself beside her, Alec placed a firm hand on her shoulder and spoke quietly. "If you truly want to make things right, you'll visit Verena tomorrow and apologize to her directly. That's the first step you need to take."
 ###Chapter 133 I'm Not Holding You Back


Not once in the past would Kaia have even considered offering Verena an apology just because Alec asked her to.

Times had changed, though; now she would have gone to Verena on her own, with or without her father's request.

Relying on Alec for support, Kaia rose to her feet, wiped away her tears, and managed a shaky nod. "Dad, I know how much damage l've done. The guilt is all mine. Whether Verena forgives me or not, I'll go to her and apologize from the heart. I promise."

A new maturity caught Alec's eye as he studied Kaia-her time away had changed her, and relief flooded him.

His hand landed gently on her shoulder. "You shouldn't be standing out here. Go on in and change. Luka will be home soon, and we'll finally share a meal as a family."

Inside the house, Kaia climbed the stairs to change. Luka's arrival in the living room happened just as she came back down.

The school event had just ended for Luka when a call from Kylee let him know Kaia had come home, so he'd rushed out, grabbed a taxi, and hurried back.

Pure happiness lit up his face when he spotted his sister. "You're home, Kaia! I've missed you."

A quick hug passed between them. Luka pulled back, frowning in confusion. "Kaia, I tried calling your friends, but nobody had any idea where you were. What happened?"

Hesitation crept in before Kaia answered, repeating the same story she had told their parents earlier.

Luka listened, concern written across his face, while Laura's eyes glistened with fresh tears.

Picking up on the heaviness in the room, Alec lowered his newspaper and tried to bring comfort. "What matters is that Kaia's safe. Let's have dinner."
Later, Kaia retreated to her bedroom for a shower.
The moment she was alone, she retrieved her hidden phone and typed out a quick message to Katelyn."Everything went as planned. I'll talk to Verena tomorrow."
Katelyn's reply arrived almost instantly. "Nice job."
A smile played on Kaia's lips at the praise.
The following day, while Verena was in the middle of her workout in the home gym, Rhonda came by to let her know that Kaia had come to visit her.
Verena arched her brow in surprise. "Kaia? I thought Luka mentioned she'd gone missing?"
A quick tap switched off the treadmill, and Verena accepted the towel Rhonda handed her, dabbing at the sweat on her neck.
Instructions came without hesitation. "Let her know l'm occupied. She'll have to wait."
Rhonda offered a respectful nod and made her way out of the gym.
Downstairs, she approached Kaia, who lounged on the sofa. "Mrs. Bennett is busy at the moment, Miss Willis. She'll see you shortly."
Waiting didn't rattle Kaia in the least; she had expected to be put off. Instead, she smiled with easy politeness. "That's perfectly fine. I'll just wait here."
Eventually, Verena wrapped up her workout, enjoyed a long, unhurried shower, and at last strolled into the living room, arms folded, voice breezy. "Hope you weren't too bored waiting."
As Verena drew near, Kaia bounced up and slipped her arm through Verena's, her voice sugar-sweet and eyes bright. "Come on, Verena, I'm your little sister! Waiting for you is never a bother. Don't be so formal with me."
That syrupy tone made Verena inwardly cringe. She studied Kaia for a beat before quietly pulling away. "Let's not drag this out. Why did you come?"

Kaia either didn't notice the chill or pretended not to. With a cheerful flourish, she started opening up the neatly stacked gift boxes on the table. "Take a look at these, Verena. See anything you like?"

First, she displayed a khaki coat, holding it up for inspection. "I always see you in lighter colors. This one should suit you, don't you think?"

Switching gears, she set down the coat and picked up a sleek black knit sweater. "This would be perfect for spring-stylish and cozy. With your gorgeous features and that figure, you'll pull it off so elegantly."

A playful energy lit up Kaia's face as she introduced each item, her smile the picture of innocent enthusiasm -a bubbly, girl-next-door vibe that would've fooled almost anyone.

Anyone unfamiliar with Kaia's true self might have believed the act.

Hidden motives, Verena reminded herself, often wore the mask of kindness.

Never for a second did she think Kaia had come just to deliver presents.

Anyone who knew the old Kaia would have expected a dramatic outburst by now after the long wait.

Watching her act sweet and gentle felt completely out of character.

A sharp,unimpressed glance from Verena cut through the air. "Kaia, let's not pretend. I don't have time for your little charades. We're hardly close."

A flicker of hurt froze Kaia's smile before she forced a strained grin. "You've made it clear you don't like me,Verena, but I still need to say this."

Tears threatened as she bit her lip, meeting Verena's gaze. "I owe you an apology for everything. I'm sorry."

Mockery crept into Verena's voice, a soft chuckle escaping her. "Did you really just apologize? You, of all people?"

A small, nervous nod followed as Kaia twisted her hands together. "I mean every word. I've had time to think about all the ways I wronged you. We're sisters. Blood should matter most, but I kept hurting you. Sometimes I just want to slap myself for it..."

With an indifferent shrug, Verena raised her eyebrows. "Well, nothing's stopping you. If that's what you want,go ahead."

Confusion flickered across Kaia's face. "What are you saying?"

An almost teasing glint lit Verena's eyes. "You said you want to slap yourself. So do it. I'm not holding you back."

Those words cut deep, and Kaia's confidence wavered as Verena's gaze bored into her.

No matter how humble she tried to seem, Verena offered nothing but cold indifference-even now, after Kaia dragged herself here to apologize.

Swallowing her pride felt unbearable, and if not for Evelyn's plan, she would have never tolerated such humiliation.

Beneath her calm, resentment simmered, but Kaia kept her composure.

She understood she couldn't afford to disappoint Evelyn, especially when this was their one opportunity to bring Verena down.

When it came to their bigger plar, letting go of her pride felt like a price she was willing to pay.

Wiping away tears, Kaia managed a trembling nod. "If that's what it takes for you to forgive me, Verena, I'll keep going until you believe me."

A sharp slap echoed as she brought her hand down across her cheek.

She didn't stop there.

Another resounding smack left her skin bright red, the sound harsh in the silent room, each blow sending new tears down her face.

No reaction came from Verena, who simply stood by, arms folded and gaze steady, refusing to give in to Kaia's display. Crying rarely moved Verena, especially not when she suspected the motives behind the person who tried to harm her.

Still, she couldn't help but wonder what Kaia's endgame was.

Change didn't happen overnight, and Verena was far from convinced that Kaia's remorse was genuine.

Her time away-who had she spoken to, and what advice had she been given?

Verena never trusted the idea of chance.With Katelyn showing up to stir trouble and Kaia suddenly shifting her behavior, she was certain the timing wasn't accidental.

If the two of them were working together, Verena wanted to uncover exactly what they were plotting.

Rather than sit back and wait for Kaia to make the first move, she chose to keep watch and see what kind of tricks Kaia might pull.

It also gave her a way to test if Kaia had truly matured.

Verena said, "That's enough. Stop right there."

Kaia froze at her words, her eyes darting toward Verena with unease.

Verena gave her a gentle smile. "You're right. We're sistes, and family ties will always matter most. You've apologized, and as your sister, I'd be wrong not to forgive you."
###Chapter 134 Let Her Act As Bait


Nothing about Verena's response was what Kaia expected. She stood there, stunned into silence, unable to come up with anything to say.

Forgiveness seemed far too simple after all the things she had done to Verena.

With Kaia lost in her own thoughts, Verena let out a light laugh. "You came here for my forgiveness,didn't you? Now that you have it, you look almost disappointed."

Disappointment wasn't the emotion Kaia felt. She was simply shocked that Verena would let things go without hesitation. A drawn-out argument was what Kaia had prepared herself for.

Truthfully, her visit was never about making amends. She hoped Verena would lash out, just to prove a point.

Snapping back, Kaia spoke, forcing herself to stay composed. "You got it wrong, Verena. I'm truly grateful.Thank you for forgiving me."

That answer only made Verena smile more. "If you're happy, that's good enough for me. You do seem distracted, though. Is something on your mind?"

Trying to hide her unease, Kaia managed a quick grin. "There's nothing to worry about. I've just been through a lot, so sometimes I drift off."

"That makes sense," Verena said with a small nod. "Take care of yourself, alright? Right now, our family means everything to me-Mom,Dad,Luka,and you."

With a seemingly affectionate pat on Kaia's shoulder, Verena added, "Even if our parents and Luka have their opinions about me, you're still here. I'm glad you're willing to admit your mistakes."

Kaia found Verena's act as the caring older sister almost unbearable but kept her expression warm. "Don't say that, Verena. We're still family, no matter what happens. I'm sure Mom, Dad, and Luka feel the same way." Verena thought it was almost a shame that Kaia didn't put her talent for pretending to better use.

She had no interest in whatever their parents or Luka might think.

A nod was all she offered.

With her plan having gone nowhere, Kaia saw no point in lingering. "I should head back to campus. I'll drop by again soon."

A faint smile lingered on Verena's lips as she gave a silent nod.

After Kaia disappeared from the entryway, Verena wandered overto the expansive window, folded her arms,and followed Kaia's movements with a watchful gaze. Fishing her phone from her pocket,she placed a call without hesitation.

Gavin's uncertain greeting broke the quiet. "Eve-Dr. Willis, is there something you need?"

He nearly called her Evelyn, but quickly corrected himself.

Verena said, "Gavin, I have a favor to ask."

No hesitation from Gavin this time. "Of course. What can I do?"

Eyes still on Kaia slipping into her car, Verena's tone was measured. "I want you to find out who Kaia has been spending time with. Keep tabs on her for a while."

Why would Kaia need that sort of attention? Gavin's confusion was clear. Surveillance seemed like overkill-what had Kaia done?

He finally voiced his doubts. "Did something happen with Kaia?"

With a cold, steady tone, Verena explained, "She's always gone out of her way to make things hard for me.Now, suddenly, she's full of apologies after disappearing for a while. That doesn't make sense. Someone must be working with her."

Gavin suddenly thought of a possibility. Worried, he asked, "Do you think those people from overseas are using Kaia to get at you?" Verena brushed the thought aside. "That's not likely. People like that wouldn't choose just anyone. And if they had any idea about my real background, they wouldn't have any reason to involve Kaia."

She paused, eyes narrowed in thought. "Right now, I'm not sure where those people are hiding, but I expect them to show themselves before long. For now, Kala could be involved with Katelyn Fuller."

The name caught Gavin off guard. "Katelyn Fuller... I remember now. There was that headline-something about her having a mysterious overseas identity. Some even thought she might be Evelyn. What's Kaia's connection to her?"

A sly gin played on Verena's lips as she answered in an easy tone, "I wish I knew myself.Katelyn has known Isaac since they were kids. Yesterday, she approached me, dropped hints about being Evelyn, and tried to snatch Isaac's case away from me. I shut her down. Then this morning, out of nowhere, Kaia arrives,all apologetic. Put together, the timing feels way too convenient to be a coincidence."

There was a sharp edge of realization in Gavin's voice. "Understood, Dr. Willis. I'll have someone keep an eye on Kaia and report back if anything unusual happens. But there's something else I almost forgot to tell you. When I tried calling you earlier, you didn't answer, and I never followed up. Because of that news article about Katelyn, word is spreading that two different groups are after you now. One of them has even hired hitmen.Please be careful, Dr. Willis."

Resting her weight against the glass, Verena replied, "Understood. These groups stay in the shadows. Since Katelyn's eager to pretend she's Evelyn, I'll let her act as bait-maybe it'll draw them out where I can see them. I need to use this chance to figure out who's behind everything."

"That makes sense. I'm relieved you're ready."

"There's one more thing," Verena added. "I'm not able to leave for now, so I want the medical team brought back here from overseas."

Surprise flickered in Gavin's voice. "You're taIking about relocating the entire hospital staff? Wouldn't that make your situation more dangerous? Most of your resources are abroad-here, you have far fewer allies.Are you sure this is wise?"

Verena let out a soft laugh. "That's not your concern. I'll let Katelyn stir up those two groups and deal with whatever comes out of hiding. This way, I'm not alone in the spotlight. The medical team will just be on standby. I won't reopen the hospital until things settle down."

Seeing howw detailed her plan was, Gavin's concerns eased. "Alright, I'll start the arrangements."

"Thank you," Verena replied with a nod.

Shortly after the call ended, Rhonda appeared and asked politely, "Mrs. Bennett, where should I put what Miss Willis delivered?"

Waving it off, Verena answered, "Just store everything in the storage room."

...

Elsewhere, Kaia pulled out of Seraphina Villas and dialed Katelyn from the car.

Once the line connected, Kaia wasted no time. "Katelyn, things didn't go our way."

Katelyn's brow furrowed on the other end. "Tell me what happened."

A memory of the morning's awkwardness crossed Kaia's mind. "I tried to follow the plan-I apologized to Verena first thing. I was sure she'd never forgive me, not after everything I did. But strangely enough, she didn't get upset at all. WVith just a few words, she let it go."

Katelyn sounded unconvinced. "That's all it took? She just forgave you?"

Kaia confirmed, "Yeah, just like that."
###Chapter 135 A Threat


Katelyn stayed silent on the line, her mind turning over carefully.

Their last meeting had shown her that Verena was far more complex than she had first assumed.

Under usual circumstances, Verena would never have let Kaia off so quickly.

From what she sensed, Verena clearly doubted Kaia's true intentions.

Breaking her silence at last, Katelyn said to Kaia, "I understand you. For now, keep patient. Wait for me to reach out, and don't try to come see me until then."

Once the call ended, she turned her eyes toward the butler. "Have all my instructions been carried out?"

He bowed his head in confirmation. "Yes, Miss Fuller. Everything has been arranged. Yesterday, I sent an invitation to Professor Branson on your behalf, presenting you as the esteemed surgeon from Cloverland Hospital in Clokron. This morning, I received his reply-he will meet you at the Fortune Garden Restaurant at noon."

Katelyn's lips curved with satisfaction. "Excellent."

Glancing at the clock, she strode toward the walk-in closet. "Get the car ready," she said. "I'll change quickly.I intend to be early."

The butler responded firmly, "Yes." He then turned to head downstairs.

By the time she reached the restaurant, Katelyn was a full thirty minutes ahead of schedule.

The butler had secured a private suite, discreet and soundproof, chosen to ensure no conversation could slip beyond its walls.

Exactly on time, Wendell stepped into the restaurant.

Spotting her already seated, he offered a polite apology. "Dr. Fuller, forgive me. University matters delayed me until just now."

She rose to greet him, her smile warm and deferential. "Professor Branson, as a fellow doctor, I consider it a privilege to meet you. Even if I had to wait all day, it would be worth it."

With a modest wave of his hand, Wendell replied, "You flatter me, Dr. Fuller. Age alone doesn't make me greater, and my skills may not outshine yours."

Her smile lingered as she motioned to the chair across from her. "Sit, please."

Once he was seated, she reached for the bottle and filled his glass before serving her own.

Lifting her glass, she remarked, "Professor Branson, your work has always inspired me, yet you've graciously agreed to meet someone like me, who has barely scratched the surface of medicine. I'm deeply grateful.Let me drink to you-and to our profession!"

Without hesitation, Katelyn tipped back her glass and drained it in a single motion.

Placing his hands firmly on his knees, Wendell shook his head. "Dr. Fuller, I came here because I know of your accomplishments. We're both servants of medicine, both willing to give of ourselves for it. Don't sell yourself short."

When the invitation reached him the day before, Wendell noticed it bore Katelyn's name, a doctor with weighty reputation abroad. Because he treasured connections with colleagues in his field, he had answered without hesitation.

Remembering this, Wendell smiled warmly and lifted his glass."It's rare to find someone who burns with the same devotion. To our calling in medicine!"

Watching him empty his glass, Katelyn arched her brows ever so slightly.

The impression she gathered was clear-Wendell would not be hard to handle.

Once the glasses were lowered, the table quickly filled with dish after dish.

Patience guided her this time; even halfway through the meal she kept her true agenda hidden. Instead,she steered the conversation toward lighter subjects, and their exchange remnained cordial. Only after Wendell placed his knife and fork neatly aside did Katelyn drop her question with practiced ease.She asked, "Professor Branson, I heard from a friend that you're acquainted with Evelyn?"

Unaware of her intent, Wendell dabbed his mouth with a napkin. "That's right. We collaborated some time ago."

Her brows knitted together for the briefest moment before smoothing again.

That was enough to confirm Kaia's words held weight.

Katelyn pretended to be astonished, her eyes widening before she allowed admiration to soften her expression. A faint blush rose to her cheeks. "Truly? Evelyn has been my idol for years. She inspired me to follow this path in medicine. I admire her so much. Professor Branson, could you... perhaps help me get her autograph?"

The request seemed simple enough. Wendell gave a nod. "Of course. When I see her again, I'll bring it back for you."

Her face lit up with delight. "That's amazing. Thank you, Professor Branson."

When her words were done, she dipped her head, letting a troubled look cross her face.

Noticing her sudden shift, Wendell leaned in. "Dr. Fuller, is something troubling you?"

Raising her eyes slowly, Katelyn spoke with careful softness. "Professor Branson, may I ask a favor of you?"

Wendell had carried the same generous spirit from his younger days into his old age, never losing his kindness. "If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask."

Catching a glimmer of opportunity, Katelyn steadied her expression. "The truth is, I'm facing a case that has left me completely at a loss. I've tried everything, yet I can't find a viable treatment. Because you know Evelyn, I was hoping you could arrange for me to meet her."

At her request, Wendell exhaled slowly, his face clouded with unease.

He recalled how he had recently reached out to Evelyn himself, inviting her to deliver a lecture at Acorith College of Medicine. Her response had been polite but firm-she was occupied and unable to attend, forcing the event to be delayed.

Shaking his head, Wendell explained, "Dr. Fuller, I'd gladly help if I could. But Evelyn keeps her life tightly guarded. She avoids attention and rarely reveals her location. I'm afraid arranging a meeting simply isn't possible."

Seeing the shadow of disappointment on her face, Wendell suggested, "Perhaps this instead-share the patient's details with me, and I'll forward them to Evelyn. Once she replies, I'll make sure you're informed."

From that reassurance,Katelyn knew with certainty that Wendell truly did have contact with Evelyn.

As a celebrated professor in Shoildon, Wendell had neither motive nor reason to invent such a story.

Rather than answering, Katelyn slipped a hand into her purse, drew out a check, and slid it across the table.

Perplexed by the gesture, Wendell frowned at the check. "Why are you giving me-"

Cutting him off, Katelyn said coldly, "I take it that you've seen Evelyn in person. Professor Branson,I need something unusual from you."

With a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, she continued, "There's a patient I wish to treat, but unless they believe I am Evelyn, I won't be accepted as their doctor."

Her words made Wendell narrowthis eyes, suspicion hardening his gaze.

Speaking as though it were a small matter, Katelyn added, "Since Evelyn avoids the public, I need you to vouch for me, telling the patient's family that I am Evelyn herself."

Staring at her in shock, Wendell stammered, "What on earth are you asking of me?"

Her smile never wavered. "Don't worry. The truth will come out in time. I don't mean to steal Evelyn's identity forever-just long enough to win the family's trust."

The moment her words sank in, Wendell's fist struck the table, sending the dishes rattling across the surface.

"So you expect me to lie, to help you pose as Evelyn and trick a patient's family?" His eyes hardened with sudden clarity as he glared at her. "Now i see your reason for this meeting. Hear me, Katelyn Fuller-I'm a man of principle, and I'Il never lower myself to that."

Right and wrong had always been clear lines for Wendell.Feeling utterly betrayed, he jabbed a finger at her."I misjudged you completely. What kind of doctor stoops to this? You stain the very name of medicine."

Through his tirade, Katelyn held her tongue, her calm expression unbroken as she allowed him to rage.

Only when his voice broke into a cough did she finally smile and speak. "'Professor Branson, you may say no,but you should think carefully about what follows."

His palm struck the table once more as he shot to his feet. "Shameless woman! I'll not waste another word on you."

Her voice cut through his fury. "Professor Branson, you have such a beautiful grandson."

That single mention made him freeze. Katelyn's brows lifted as she added smoothly, "He's a precious boy.But accidents happen, don't they? A kidnapping... a sudden crash... or even robbers in the wrong place at the wrong time."

Grinding his teeth, Wendell spun toward her. "This is a nation of law-how dare you try to intimidate me!"

KKatelyn kept her smile, but there was a sharper edge beneath it. "This isn't meant as a threat, Professor Branson. I only want to help you.df you choose to cooperate, your grandson will remain safe, and your family will thrive, living a life of security and respect."
###Chapter 136 Holding The Scalpel With Her Eyes Closed


Wendell narrowed his eyes at Katelyn, unable to believe what he was hearing. "If this isn't a threat, then what is?"

Katelyn lifted her shoulders in an easy shrug, her palms opening wide. "If that'sthe label you want to use,then I won't argue."

Her steady composure only fueled Wendell's anger, his chest rising and falling as his temper spiked. "Do you not realize I could go to the police right now?"

Resting her elbows against the table, Katelyn laced her fingers beneath her chin. "Go ahead, Professor Branson, no one's stopping you. But let's be honest. The police can't shadow your grandson every second of the day. And more importantly, I haven't lifted a finger yet. Even if you file a report, I can laugh it off as a joke. Words don't carry prison sentences."

The moment his grandson entered the conversation, Wendell's weak point was exposed.

His whole body shook with rage, his finger trembling as he jabbed it toward her. He could barely spit out a word."You-"

Amusement flickered in Katelyn's eyes as she watched his face turn crimson. Her lips curved into a sly smile while she poured a stream of wine into his glass.

Glass in hand, she stepped closer, her voice low and deliberate. "Professor Branson,your choices are simple. One road leads to opportunity, the other drags you and your family into ruin."

Without flinching at his hostile glare, Katelyn added, "You're a clever man, Professor Branson. You already know the right answer. You wouldn't really stake your grandson's life on pride, would you?"

The corners of Wendell's mouth tightened as he clamped his lips shut, too furious to speak.

Hatred for her burned inside him, but he also knew she was right-he couldn't afford to gamble. When his silence stretched on, Katelyn's confidence only grew. She could tell he was starting to waver.

Katelyn leaned in, her tone smooth and persuasive. "Professor Branson, I understand your worries.You're afraid I'll hurt the patient, aren't you? But that fear is unnecessary. This patient matters too much to me-l would never lay a hand on him. What I want is to step into Evelyn's role so his family can relax and place their trust in me. I'm not some amateur sneaking in above my pay grade. Cloverland Hospital doesn't accept anyone but the best. The only problem here is that the patient's family needs reassurance, and the quickest way to calm them is with a title they'll respect."

She added, "Professor Branson, what I need from you is simple. Stand behind me. If you do that, your grandson stays safe, and your son's and daughter-in-law's futures remain bright. Everyone gains something -your family prospers, my goal is met, and no one suffers. Can you really call that anything but a win for both of us? And if you're still uncertain, then I'll stake my entire career on this, swearing to you that no one will be harmed."

Holding out the glass of wine, Katelyn's voice softened. "Professor Branson, the longer you hesitate, the harder it becomes. Make the choice now."

Wendell's fists curled tightly at his sides, the battle in his chest twisting him in knots.

Regret pressed down on him; had he known Katelyn's true purpose, he never would have shown up.

Fear for himself meant nothing, but the thought of his grandson caught in the crossfire hollowed him out.

He knew this mess was of his own making, yet dragging his grandson into danger was unthinkable.

For a long moment, he shut his eyes, his entire body sagging as though the fight had drained from him.
When they opened again, resignation dulled his gaze.

A weary nod followed, his voice rough. "Alright. I'll go along with it."

Katelyn lifted the glass with a faint smile. "Professor Branson, you've proven yourself a man of foresight. For that,I'll drink to you."

Wendell's eyes flicked to the wine, and then back to her face, cold and unyielding. His expression carried nowarmth as he sneered, "Don't flatter yourself. I'm only agreeing because I have no other option, not because I care to deal with the likes of you."

Without waiting for her response, he spun around and marched out of the room.

As the private room door slammed shut behind him, Katelyn's grin slipped away. She turned around and tipped the wine into the trash, her gaze turning distant.

At Seraphina Villas, after handling her overseas calls, Verena slipped into the medical room to continue her surgical training.

Her hands had trembled so violently during her first try to hold a scalpel again that she had forced herself into near-daily practice, sometimes repeating the same procedure twice.

Still, the shaking never left.

Every time the blade touched the small body of a lab rat, her fingers quivered and her knees weakened until she thought she might collapse.

Once more, she stepped into the sterile surgical area.

A rat was placed onto the operating table, and she carefully moved through the motions-washing her hands, disinfecting, pulling on the gown, and slipping into sterile gloves.

When she finally reached for the scalpel resting on the tray, a chill seeped straight through the glove, racing up her arm and tightening her chest as her pulse quickened.

The trembling returned to her hands, ligh at first, and then harder to ignore.

A dry lump caught in Verena's throat, and she forced herself to swallow.

The rat on the table lay motionless under anesthesia, and she pressed her fingertip against its small abdomen as if staking her resolve, shutting her eyes tightly.

Since watching the blade only made her quiver, she decided to block out the sight altogether, letting her fingers map out the organs and limbs by feel. For most surgeons, that approach would have been reckless, maybe even impossible.

To Verena, however, it was second nature.

On a human body, she could recognize every detail blindfolded, trusting her sense of touch alone.

That was why people whispered the name Legendary Surgeon when speaking of her.

Instead of staring at the scalpel, she deliberately let her eyes close, surrendering to instinct.

Her heartbeat evened out in her chest, and the twitch in her grip eased until her hand finally stilled. The panic that had plagued her began to fade.

Relief softened her expression, and a small smile tugged at her lips as the tension slipped away.

With her eyelids shut, she guided the scalpel to the precise spot beneath her figertip and drew the first incision.

Without the interference of shaking, the procedure moved along cleanly, almost effortless.

Still,she reminded herself that this was only practice. In a real operating room, closing her eyes would never be an option.

Determined to face the fear head-on, she halted mid-procedure, opened her eyes slowly, and locked her gaze on the work in front of her.

Rather than let the trembling return, she forced herself to press on with the operation.

Deep, steady breaths filled Verena's lungs as she tried to anchor her nerves.

When the operation was nearly finished, she thought the worst was behind her, yet the shaking crept back into her hands.

This time the tremor wasn't overwhelming-it was mild, irritating but still controllable.

Her fingers clamped down on the scalpel, and for a few precious moments, the movement stilled.

She pushed through the final steps, cutting with precision before closing the incision with quick stitches. What should have been a short dissection stretched into what felt like an eternity.

Relief washed over her when she finally looked at the rat, its small body neatly sewn.

The stitches were clean and straight, a sharp contrast to the crooked lines of her earlier attempts.

For the first time in days, Verena felt a spark of pride-this was her best result yet.

The strategy of calming herself by starting with closed eyes had worked, proving she was finally making progress.
###Chapter 137 Good News


Verena realized that if she shut her eyes and opened them again after a while, her confidence would steady her hands, and the nerves would fade away.

But that sense of control lasted just long enough for simpler operations. She quickly realized she needed far more experience to handle complex procedures.

Determined to improve, Verena dove into one surgical practice after another.

Progress came with every attempt.

By sticking to her rigorous daily routine, she became certain that soon she would be ready to operate on Isaac herself.

The possibility filled her with excitement.

As twilight settled over the house and Isaac wheeled himself through the door, Verena hurried to share the good news with him.

Looking into her eyes, Isaac caught the glow of her happiness, and a gentle warmth spread through his chest.

He was fully aware of the dedication Verena poured into overcoming her trembling hands, driven by her determination to be the one who could help him heal.

Rhonda had told himn many times how Verena would lose herself in surgical practice for hours, sometimes working right through meals. At night, Isaac often found her surrounded by medical books at her desk,studying late into the evening before finally resting.

Since their wedding, she seemed to have grown a little thinner, proof of just how committed she was to his recovery.

The thought tugged at Isaac's heart. He reached out and brushed her cheek softly. "I owe you so much,
Verena. I'm grateful, and I'm sorry for making you carry this burden."
Verena placed her hand on his. "You don't need to thank me, not in this house. We promised to stay together through everything. If you keep making it sound like we're strangers, I'll start to get upset."
Isaac's eyes softened at her words, and he instinctively took her hand, pressing a gentle kiss to her skin.His reply was calm and full of affection. "Alright, I'll do as you say."
With a gentle, satisfied smile, Verena asked, "Would you like me to help you upstairs for your treatment?"
Isaac gave a small nod, and Verena carefully wheeled him into the elevator.
As soon as they reached the second floor, she guided him into the medical room without delay.
The approach to the treatment remained unchanged from before.
After Isaac slipped off the last piece of his dark gray boxer briefs, Verena carefully spread the prepared liquid medicine across his abdomen and waited for it to work.
She sat in the chair at his bedside, notebook and pen in hand, poised to track even the slightest change in his condition.
Within moments, the liquid medicine started to take effect.
A faint ache spread through Isaac's legs, accompanied by an intense heat building in his lower groin.
Clenching his jaw, he bent forward, sweat gathering on his brow and sliding down his sharp jawline to pool on his firm stomach.
Verena kept a close watch, documenting every shift she noticed in his body, especially the visible changes in his lower region. She made sure to note the time and wrote detailed observations in her notebook.
Looking over her earlier notes, she quickly realized that tonight's progress was more significant than before.
Seeing Verena's gaze fixed on the notebook, her expression distant, Isaac grew uneasy and asked, "What is it? Is my condition not getting better?"
Pulled from her thoughts, Verena lifted her gaze to Isaac, a bright smile spreading across her face. "I have good news. I compared the notes with your earlier records, and it turns out you've already made significant progress."

For a moment, Isaac could only stare, his surprise plain on his face. "You mean it? Are you sure?"

A playful spark danced in Verena's eyes. "What, you think I'd make that up?"

He was quick to shake his head. "No, it's not that. I trust you."

His voice dropped, softer now. "It's myself I have trouble trusting."

The countless failed treatments and disappointing doctor visits had left their scars.
###Chapter 138 Do You Like What You See


When Verena told him that the condition he thought was hopeless had made significant progress, Isaac almost couldn't believe her.

The idea that he could enjoy intimacy again felt almost too good to be true.

What stunned him even more was the chance that the very affliction that had brought him endless shame could actually heal.

Just as his doubts began creeping back, Verena reached over and messed up his hair with a smile. "Isaac,we need to keep believing in ourselves and in each other. I know your illness isn't simple,but if we take it step by step, things will change. Think about it-you once thought you'd never improve,yet every day of this treatment has proven otherwise. Stay strong for me, will you? Promise me. I'll make sure you reclaim everything you've lost, and when the time comes, your legs will carry you again."

When he looked into her calm and tender eyes, Isaac felt a safety he had never known before, as though something inside him finally settled.

There was something almost magical about her, a quiet force that always stilled the storms raging inside him.

Letting her hand linger in his hair, Isaac gave a small nod. "I promise."

The words came out in a low, alost fragile tone, and his helpless surrender only made him all the more endearing.

Verena couldn't help herself. She mussed his hair again and laughed. "That's what I wanted to hear. Good boy."

Isaac gazed at her in silence, and his eyes glowed with a love too deep for words.

When the session was finished, the two of them headed back to the bedroom. Once he finished his shower, she guided him carefully to the bed and made sure he was comfortable.

As she pulled the covers over him, her eyes paused for a moment on the lower part of his body.

During the earlier application of the medicine, she had spotted noticeable improvements in that area, signs that gave her quiet hope.

Even so, she knew the progress was owed to the medicine's effect rather than a natural recovery.

Verena was curious whether his bodywould still respond naturally to intimacy without the push of treatment or medicine.

Keeping that thought in mind, she pulled the blanket up over him and quietly slipped into the bathroom.

When she finished showering, her eyes fell on her lifeless pajamas, and with a small frown,she tapped her chin,thinking.

Clearly, those wouldn't do.

An idea sparked, and still wrapped in a towel, she made her way straight to the closet.

Inside, the wide closet revealed more of her clothes than Isaac's. What little space lsaac had on the right side had already been invaded by her wardrobe, while the left remained entirely hers.

Kneeling before the lower section, she tugged out something hidden beneath Isaac's side of the closet.

Back in the bathroom, she carefully spread the fabric open in her hands.

What she held was a black satin nightgown, its smooth surface shning with elegance. Lace traced the neckline, and thin straps ran delicately over the shoulders.

Though stunning, it looked delicate, as if one careless pull might rip it apart.

She remembered Miranda pressing it into her hands the night before the wedding,teasing with a wicked grin that she should save it for when Isaac was well again.

Never had she imagined she'd be reaching for it this soon. Snapping out of her thoughts, she gave her head a quick shake, slipped into the nightgown, and stepped out of the bathroom.

Isaac had been listening to the bathroom door creak open and shut, his curiosity building with each sound.When footsteps finally approached, he glanced up-and his lips parted in stunned silence.

Standing before him was Verena, her figure wrapped in the nightgown that ended high above her thighs.Her flawless legs seemed endless, and her smooth shoulders glowed against the thin black straps.

The gown revealed her elegant collarbones, and the skin beneath looked impossibly smooth.

A lump caught in his throat as his eyes grew heavy with emotion. "Why...why are you dressed like that?" he asked, his voice strained.

With a playful tilt of her head and a soft smile, Verena leaned closer. "Don't you think it looks good on me?"

The boldness of her words brought a flush to his cheeks. "I... I don't know what to say."

Watching him stumble over his words, Verena's lips curved into a sly smile. She climbed onto the bed,settled beside him, and wrapped her arms around him in one smooth motion.

Her eyes caught Isaac's, and with a daring softness, she asked, "Be honest. Do you like what you see?"

Fresh from her shower, her fragrance surrounded him so thickly it made his head swim. His throat worked as if to speak, yet no sound came.

When he stayed silent, Verena tipped forward, refusing to let go of the question. "So? Is it yes or no?"

The shift revealed a sliver of skin just above her neckline, subtle yet impossible to ignore. Heat flashed in Isaac's eyes before he quickly lookedaway.

Clutching the blanket for support, he finally blurted out, "l... I like it."

Her lips brushed close to his ear as she whispered, "If you really mean it, then prove it with a kiss."

The playful lilt in her tone carried both sweetness and mischief, making it hard for him to resist.

The words stunned him at first, but once he gathered himself, he fixed his gaze on her as though she were the only thing in the world.

Her answering smile was steady, her eyes warm enough to quiet his hesitation.

Taking her look as permission, Isaac lifted his hand to the back of her head and crushed his mouth against hers.

Her fingers drifted across his chest and down his stomach, coaxing more from him with each touch.

The weight of his breathing told her everything-he was finally responding.

In her mind, she reasoned that this kind of provocation could only strengthen the treatment's effect.

Acting on that idea, she slipped both hands beneath his pajama shirt.

Her chilled palms pressed against the warmth of his skin, drawing a sharp breath from him.

Half-lidded eyes found her intent expression, and a rush of excitement thudded in his chest.

With his eyes shut, he bent lower, pressing soft kisses along her neck, savoring each one.

What began as feather-light touches quickly turned fevered as his lips trailed across her collarbone.

Catching on to where he was headed, Verena pressed firmly against his shoulders to hold him back.

Frustrated at being stopped, Isaac lifted his gaze, his eyes clouded with wounded longing.

Her cheeks flushed with color as Verena caught her breath. "You're only beginning to heal, Isaac. It's still too soon for that."

Hearing her words, Isaac pulled her close, burying his face against the curve of her neck.

His breathing came unsteady, and though he felt a bit frustrated, joy swelled in his chest.

The fear of losing Verena because of his condition no longer loomed over him.

For the first time, he believed he could be whole again, worthy of standing at her side. Inside a secluded villa overseas, heavy curtains left the wide room in near-blackness despite the daylight.

A sliver of light crept through the window, enough to outline one man seated at the desk and another standing before him, both hidden in shadow.

From behind the desk, the man in the chair spoke lowly. "Have you heard anything about Evelyn?"

The figure standing before him dipped his head. "Nothing certain. But a report in Shoildon hinted at a woman who might have been Evelyn."

He paused briefly, and then continued, "But Evelyn's movements are always impossible to follow. If we can't trace her, how would some gossip reporter succeed? I'd wager it's nothing but a rumor."

The man at the desk gave a measured laugh, his head tilting as he shook it. "True or not, we can't afford to dismiss it. If my brother reaches Evelyn first and secures Grandfather's recovery, then my claim to Smoothdeed Group is finished."
###Chapter 139 Katelyn Visited Again


With Isaac slowly assuming control of Bennett Group, Danica discovered her days carried less strain and far more ease.

On a rare quiet morning, she lounged on the sofa, absentmindedly playing with the cat as the television flickered in the background.

A servantstepped forward and announced, "Mrs. Bennett, Miss Fuller has arrived to see you."

Hearing this, Danica blinked in mild surprise. "Katelyn? She's really here?"

The servant nodded. "Yes, ma'am. Her car is waiting out front."

Danica's hand froze mid-stroke, and a faint crease appeared between her brows.

The purpose was easy enough to guess-Katelyn had already made it plain she wished to take charge of Isaac'streatment.

Danica hadn't dismissed the offer; she'd told Isaac about it the same day, only for him to refuse outright with unshakable certainty.

To her surprise, days passed and yet Katelyn still pressed on.

The woman's persistence was nothing short of stubborn.

Helplessness settled over her, for it was clear Isaac had no desire whatsoever to let Katelyn take control of his care.

Still, the long-standing bond between the Fullers and Bennetts meant she had no choice but to receive Katelyn politely.

Letting out a quiet sigh, Danica switched off the television, passed the cat into the servant's arms, and said,"Take it back to the cat house, and then show Miss Fuller inside." Cradling the cat carefully, the servant bowed. "Yes, Mrs. Bennett."

Once the cat was taken care of, the servant stepped outside to welcome Katelyn.

Inside the car, Katelyn noticed the servant drawing near. She removed her sunglasses, and then shifted toward Wendell."Professor Branson, you're clever. Keep your grandson in mind, and I trust I don't have to spell out what you should or shouldn't say in there, do l?"

The ride over had left Wendell restless. Never before had he been asked to lie to a patient's family, and the weight on his conscience was crushing. He clung to the hope that Katelyn truly meant to heal rather than harm,because if not, the guilt would break him.

At her reminder, Wendell's fists tightened on his knees, his voice cutting sharp. "I've heard you already.Don't repeat yourself. And you-remember that your aim is to save lives, not destroy them. Because if you stray from that, Miss Fuller, I'll stop you, even if it costs me everything."

Focused solely on her objective, Katelyn brushed aside Wendell's display of principle as though it were meaningless noise.

Stepping closer to the car, the servant bowed politely. "Miss Fuller, you may come inside now."

When the driver swung the rear door open, Katelyn emerged gracefully, with Wendell trailing behind her.

Catching sight of the elderly man beside her, the servant hesitated briefly in confusion but kept silent,guiding them toward the gate.

Once inside the living room, Katelyn spotted Danica and hurried forward, taking her hand warmly. "Mrs.Bennett, it's so good to see you. I've missed you and couldn't resist coming by again."

Hiding the resignation that tugged at her, Danica returned the smile. "How did you know l'd be home today,Katelyn? What if you came and I wasn't here?"

With a cheerful lift of her lips, Katelyn answered, "I didn't know at all-I simply took a chance. Luckily, you were here, Mrs. Bennett."

The sweetness in her voice carried so naturally that Danica felt her mood lift in spite of herself. Curious, Danica asked, "And how have your parents been these days?"

Looping her arm through Danica's as they sat on the sofa, Katelyn said, "They're both doing well.Just the other day, my mom mentioned she wanted to see you again-it's been too long."

With a soft chuckle, Danica remarked, "You've had such a sharp tongue and quick wit since you were little."

As they chatted, Danica's eyes drifted past Katelyn and landed on the older man standing quietly in the background.

Danica studied his features carefully, a spark of recognition tugging at her memory.

Narrowing her eyes, she searched her mind, trying to place where she had seen him before.

Catching Danica's attention on Wendell, Katelyn allowed a faint, knowing smile to touch her lips.

Since it was clear Danica already recognized Wendell, Katelyn chose not to offer an introduction.

Rising slowly to her feet, Danica spoke with a touch of hesitation. "Am I right in thinking... you are Professor Wendell Branson?"

Joining in the moment, Katelyn smiled. "Mrs. Bennett, your memory is sharp as ever."

Surprised to hear his name spoken, Wendell frowned slightly. "You know me, Mrs. Bennett?"

Hearing his identity confirmed, Danica's face brightened. "I often keep up with medical news, Professor Branson. You've spent your life in service to medicine,teaching at Acorith College of Medicine-Shoildon's finest-and you've earned a reputation as a truly esteemed educator. You're the kind of scholar anyone would admire."

As her praise flowed, shame pressed heavily on Wendell. The phrase "anyone would admire" struck him as painfully ironic, for he felt unfit for her respect while he prepared to deceive her.

Wendell's fists clenched, and for a fleeting moment he nearly blurted out that Katelyn could not be trusted.

Reason soon stifled the impulse, and recalling Katelyn's cold warning,he swallowed his guilt.

Forcing a polite smile, Wendell answered, "Mrs. Bennett, I appreciate your kind words, but truly,I've only done what any doctor should. Nothing so grand."

Taking his words for modesty, Danica replied with warmth, "Professor Branson, do sit down."

Obediently, Wendell crossed the room and lowered himself onto the sofa across from Katelyn.

Gesturing toward a servant, Danica instructed, "Dorcie, bring us some coffee."

When her request was made, she turned back to Wendell with a pleasant smile. "Professor Branson, did you have something particular you wanted to discuss with me today?"

"Actually, I-" Wendell blurted out, but Katelyn cut across him. "Mrs. Bennett, there's something I'd like to say."

At those words, Danica shifted her gaze toward Katelyn. Though she had an inkling of what was coming, she still asked, "And what would that be?"

Katelyn answered smoothly, "It concerns our last conversation-about Isaac's treatment."

Once again, the subject circled back to the same issue.

With a resigned look, Danica exhaled softly. "Katelyn, the last time you spoke to me, I went straight to Isaac and told him. He was firm-he doesn't want you treating him. Talking to me won't change anything.If you truly want this, you'll need to convince Isaac himself."

Expecting that answer,Katelyn nodded and said, "Mrs. Bennett, l've already spoken directly to lsaac.He refused me too. After that, I went to his wife. We sat down and went over Isaac's condition in detail, talking about which treatment might serve him best."

Her tone dimmed as disappointment colored her words. "Buut the entire time, she seemed fixated on the fact that Isaac and I were childhood friends. She cared more about my history with Isaac than about his health. In the end, she rejected my plan to treat him."

After a pause, Katelyn clasped Danica's hand firmly. "But you're not like her, Mrs. Bennett. You're his mother -you care most about his well-being. Couldn't you find a way to persuade Isaac, even compel him, to let me treat him?" When her plea was finished, Katelyn fell silent, waiting patiently for Danica's answer.

Understanding perfectly what Katelyn was pushing toward, Danica sat in silence for a moment before breathing out a faint sigh.
###Chapter 140 Miss Fuller Is Evelyn Rowe


Danica turned to Katelyn and offered her some advice. "Honestly, I think you should let this go. It's not that l don't want to help, but Verena's against the idea, and Isaac himself refuses to go along with it. I can't make him change his mind. You know how he is-once Isaac decides something, there's no convincing him otherwise. I have no say in this."

She went on, "If he's refusing your treatment plan, he must have his reasons. Hle's not the type to risk his own health for no good reason. Since Isaac made up his mind, you should try to respect that. You're finally home-why not use this time to relax and recharge instead of worrying about this situation? Besides,Verena has a degree from a top university, and her medical skills really are impressive. If not, she never could have pulled off the miracle with Barrie's illness when everyone else failed."

Listening to all this only left Katelyn feeling even more agitated. Danica wasn't really trying to help-she was just trying to discourage her. But Katelyn wasn't the type to back down. There had never been anything she truly wanted that she didn't find a way to get.

Sure,Verena had that one big win with Barrie, but Katelyn had performed far more complicated surgeries overseas, each one more difficult than the last. That single success was hardly worth bragging about.

Meanwhile,Dorcie arrived with a tray of steaming coffee for everyone.

Taking a chance to steer the conversation in a new direction, Danica smiled and motioned toward Wendell.
"Professor Branson, you have to try this new coffee blend we got. I'd love to know what you think."

At her invitation, Wendell reached for his cup. "Alright, I'll give it a try."

He brouught the mug to his nose, inhaled the aroma, and then tasted it, giving a slow, satisfied nod. "It smells wonderful and tastes even better."

Danica looked pleased. "I'm so glad it's to your liking."

Wendell smiled and took another sip. Danica then started chatting with him about lighter things. Noticing the change, Katelyn quickly realized Danica was steering them away from anything serious.

Truthfully, Katelyn had no interest in dragging things out, either.

She broke in, cutting straight to the point. "Mrs. Bennett, I've spent time reviewing all the details of Isaac's case. What he's dealing with isn't simple. I respect his wvife and everything she accomplished at Pine Hill University. She deserves credit for what she did for Barrie. Still, Isaac's situation is a whole different story.Even someone with her credentials can't solve this one."

She met Danica's gaze without flinching and spoke with quiet confidence. "From my point of view, I might be the one person who can honestly make sure Isaac recovers completely."

A confident smile spread across Katelyn's face as she finished.

Hearing such bold words left Danica momentarily stunned. Complete recovery? So many respected doctors had failed, and she'd never heard anyone speak with such certainty before-maybe even arrogance.

Doubt and surprise flickered across Danica's face. Could Katelyn actually be so sure of herself?

She knew Katelyn's personality could be unpredictable, but nobody could deny her talent. There was a reason she'd landed a position at Cloverland Hospital. Katelyn never took on a challenge unless she was certain of her abilities. If she was making such a claim, she must be really confident. Still, Danica wondered where that unwavering confidence came from. After all, the experts who had already seen lsaac were as capable as any doctor from Cloverland Hospital.

Danica paused for a moment before asking, "Katelyn, what makes you so certain you can help lsaac?You haven't really explained how."

That was aIl the opening Katelyn needed to reveal her connection to Evelyn.

A faint smile appeared on Katelyn's lips as she asked, "Does the name Evelyn mean anything to you?"

Just the mention of Evelyn was enough to make Wendell's hand tighten around his coffee cup. He let out a long, resigned breath, knowing he couldn't avoid telling a lie that day.

Confusion flickered across Danica's face. Of course, she'd heard stories about the legendary Evelyn,but it made no sense for Katelyn to bring her up now.

Katelyn could tell from Danica's reaction that the name struck a chord.

Her tone was light, almost teasing, as she continued, "I can see you recognize the name. I'm guessing you also know about everything Evelyn has accomplished? She's the one behind some of the most groundbreaking surgeries in recent years-a heart transplant that changed the field, and a pioneering treatment for leg injuries. Her work's even made it into textbooks all over the world."

Danica gave a small nod. "Yes, l've readabout her."

Danica was more than aware of the situation; she had pored over every detail in Evelyn's surgical records.

When Isaac's life turned upside down after that devastating crash, the first name that entered her mind was Evelyn, the surgeon whose reputation bordered on legendary. Yet for reasons no one could uncover,Evelyn could not be reached, and she made no effort to step forward. All Danica had to go on were the scattered notes and formal medical documents left behind.

Tracking Evelyn down was out of the question, even if Danica wanted to try. With no other choice, she turned to other respected doctors, but none of them were confident enough to promise that lsaac would pull through.

That memory made her lean in, her curiosity piqued. "Why are you bringing up Evelyn now? Are you connected to her somehow?"

Instead of answering right away, Katelyn calmly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She glanced across the table and shot a meaningful look at Wendell.

Picking up on her cue, Wendell set his coffee down and addressed Danica directly. "Mrs. Bennett, you're asking the right person. Miss Fuller is actually Evelyn Rowe. I worked side by side with her in Clokron."

Danica's jaw dropped, disbelief written all over her face. "What are you saying?"

Wendell knew he was stuck. He never enjoyed hiding the truth, but with Katelyn holding all the cards,he had little choice. A steadying breath later, he explained, "In Clokron, to keep a low profile, Miss Fuller used the name Evelyn Rowe.She always kept her real name private, so hardly anyone knew the truth. I only figured it out because we worked together. She thought you might have doubts, so she asked me to confirm it myself."

As those words hung in the air, Katelyn let a subtle, satisfied smile flicker across her lips.

Danica turned to her, still reeling. "Is it true, Katelyn? Are you really Evelyn?"

Even with Wendell's confirmation, Danica struggled to process it.

She had always believed Wendell to be honest, and there was nothing to gain by making up something like this.

Once the shock faded, hope took its place, blooming inside her like a garden after the rain.

Excitement flooded her as she grabbed Katelyn's hand, eyes wide with wonder."If you're Evelyn, why did you turn me down when I first reached out about Isaac's surgery?"

Katelyn didn't hesitate. The mention of that old request made her sigh softly before answering, "Back then, I wasn't in Clokron. My assistant took care of everything while I was away. I honestly had no idea you were asking me to treat Isaac. If I had known, I would have been here much sooner."
###Chapter 141 Found The Most Suitable Doctor


Danica listened and took a slow breath. "I see. That explains it."

Katelyn's hand squeezed Danica's a little tighter as shespoke with clear intent. "Mrs. Bennett, I really am the best option for Isaac's care. I hope you'll give this some serious thought."

The urgency in Katelyn's words wasn't lost on Danica. She weighed everything carefully.

Verena had already proven herself by curing Barrie, but as Katelyn pointed out, Isaac's case was far more complex. Even Verena herself admitted she couldn't guarantee success. Compared to that uncertainty,Katelyn's confidence and track record offered reaI reassurance. She even promised there was no chance of failure,reminding Danica that Evelyn had treated cases worse than Isaac's with complete success.

That settled it for Danica. Isaac might resist, but for his own good, she would have to push him-no matter how much he disliked it.

Shaking off her hesitation, Danica gave Katelyn's hand a gentle pat. "You can leave this to me. I'll talk things over with Verena, and I promise, I'll make sure Isaac agrees to your treatment."

A hint of satisfaction flickered in Katelyn's expression as she smiled. "Thank you. I'Il let you handle it."

Danica let out a sigh. "Honestly, I should be the one thanking you. If you really can help Isaac, anything within my reach, just ask, and it's yours."

Katelyn's reply was soft. "Please, there's no need for that between us. Our families have always been close.Isaac's been a friend since we were children. Even if you never asked, I would do whatever I could to help."

Danica felt a wave of gratitude at her words.

They chatted for a few more minutes before Katelyn glanced up, as if something had just come to mind."Mrs. Bennett, I promised Professor Branson I'd go over some research topics with him, so I should get going." She shot a look at Wendell.

He caught her cue and rose. "Yes, we already had plans to meet today."

Danica stood with them. "Of course. I won't keep you any longer."

Turning to Wendell with a warm but apologetic smile, she added, "Professor Branson, I hope today's visit was comfortable. Forgive any lapses in my hospitality."

Wendell felt even guiltier at her kindness, barely able to respond.

He shook his head and forced a small smile. "You were a wonderful host, Mrs. Bennett."

At the front gates of the mansion, Danica watched as they departed, the car pulling away and disappearing down the road.

As the car neared the intersection, the driver glanced back and asked, "Miss Fuller, which way now?"

Katelyn answered smoothly, arms folded with ease, "Drop Professor Branson off at his place first."

It was obvious that bringing up academic discussions with Wendell had only been a pretext for her to slip away.

Wendell shook his head, his thoughts drifting to his grandson waiting at home. "No need. Just pull over at the next corner. I'll grab a taxi from there."

Avoiding any needless interaction with Katelyn was his priority, and he had no desire to remain in the same space with someone he saw as insincere.

The driver paused for a moment, uncertain. "But..."

A faint smile curved on Katelyn's lips as she said, "Follow Professor Branson's instructions."

"Understood." The driver nodded.

The car rolled to a gentle stop at the junction.

Katelyn, still in a good mood, offered a parting word. "Take care, Professor Branson."
 With his hand on the door, Wendell paused. "I've said everything you wanted. Now it's your turn to honor your end of the bargain."

Facing him directly, Katelyn spoke with quiet certainty. "Don't worry. As long as you cooperate, your family won't be harmed."

Satisfied with her answer, Wendell stepped out of the car.

He waited on the curb, soon hailing a cab and disappearing from view. The moment he was gone, Katelyn's pleasant expression dropped. She turned to the driver. "Get two people to watch Danica and Wendell. I want updates on everyone they meet."

With a respectful nod, the driver responded, "I understand, Miss Fuller."

...

Meanwhile, at Seraphina Villas...

In the middle of conducting surgical experiments in the medical room, Verena looked up when Rhonda came in to inform her of Danica's arrival.

Since she couldn't step away just yet, Verena responded, "I understand. Keep her company for the time being."

With a nod, Rhonda headed downstairs to speak with Danica. "She's in the middle of a surgical experiment and isn't able to leave just yet. Please feel at home in the meantime."

Curiosity sparked in Danica's voice as she asked, "Does she perform surgical experiments every single day?"

Rhonda let out a soft laugh and nodded. "She doesn't just do it once a day; she practically lives in the medical room, working nonstop to find a cure for Mr. Bennett."

Danica paused, momentarily stunned by Rhonda's words. She had come with the intention of explaining her reasons to Verena face-to-face, yet now her emotions felt tangled and uncertain.

While Verena's relentless dedication to curing Isaac sparked a quiet sense of gratitude, doubt still lingered beneath the surface. Determination alone wasn't enough to earn her trust, and she wasn't willing to risk Isaac's well-being on unproven medical expertise.

Looking up at the second floor, Danica let out a soft sigh, her words tinged with a gentle helplessness."She really is thoughtful."

Waiting in the living room, she felt a flutter of nerves as footsteps echoed down the stairs.

Verena descended the stairswith a warm smile and said, "Danica, I just wrapped up a surgical experiment and took a quick shower to get rid of the smell. I'm sorry for making you wait."

Danica returned the smile, her eyes warm with concern. "Rhonda told me you spend hours at a time in that medical room. You need to be careful; not even the busiest doctor should neglect their own health."

The unexpected care from an elder caught Verena off guard. After a quick pause, she answered with a reassuring smile, "I promise, I'm fine. You don't need to worry."

Danica reached over and gave Verena's hand a gentle squeeze. "You've been on your feet all morning. Sit here and rest for a bit."

Taking a seat beside her, Verena suddenly glanced at the time and said, "I'll have Rhonda prepare a few more dishes. Why don't you stay and join us for lunch?"

Verena was about to call out to Rhonda, but Danica quickly stopped her. "That's alright. I can't stay long today."

That answer made Verena glance up in curiosity. "Was there something you needed to talk to me about?"

A flash of hesitation crossed Danica's face, but she remembered her conversation with Katelyn and pressed on. "I want to talk about Isaac and his treatment."

Verena nodded, giving her full attention. "Please, go on."

Taking a breath, Danica said, "I've found the most suitable doctor for lsaac. From now on, you won't have to worry about his care."

Verena's expression sharpened slightly. "The most suitable doctor? Who are you talking about?" Danica's excitement showed in her eyes. "It's Katelyn. Verena, do you realize who she really is? She's Evelyn, the legendary medical genius everyone's been talking about, both here and abroad!"
###Chapter 142 | Have No Reason To Slander Her


Verena was momentarily speechless.

The audacity it took for Katelyn to make such a bold declaration in front of Danica was almost shocking.During their last meeting, Katelyn had always skirted the truth, hinting at who she was but never saying it out loud.

Katelyn's sudden bold move clearly came from feeling cornered after her offer to treat lsaac was turned down.

A smirk tugged at the corners of Verena's mouth.'"SO,, Danica, are you truly convinced that Katelyn is Evelyn?"

She pushed right ahead, not pausing for Danica's reply. "But in the end, whether she's Evelyn or not isn't really the point. I already promised to give Isaac my all, and I'm confident about his chances. The truth is,Isaac's sex function has been making incredible progress lately. Just yesterday, he was doing almost everything he could before. So I see no need to change doctors now, and I won't agree to it."

Danica heard those words and something clicked. Her hands reached for Verena's arm as she blurted out,"Wait,do you mean Isaac is regaihing his potency? Are you serious?"

Back when Verena last shared an update, Danica thought Isaac was still far from healthy. Now, the idea that he might be close to a full recovery left her speechless.

Verena did her best to ignore the pain in her arm. She nodded, steady and calm."It's true. He's back to normal in terms of sex function. The only thing left is to confirm that his fertility is back as well."

When she heard the answer repeated, Danica's joy washed over her, bringing a rush of color to her face as her eyes welled up with tears.

A heavy weight seemed to lift from her shoulders as the news sank in.

Her smile lingered, and she found herself thanking Verena again and again. "Verena, it's amazing that you were able to help Isaac heal. I always believed my faith in you was justified."

Suddenly, another worry came to mind. Danica turned quickly, voice hopeful and anxious. "If his sex function is restored, what's happening with his legs now? How much longer before he's able to stand?"

Doctors once thought there was no chance Isaac's legs would ever recover.

Rapid-fire questions tumbled out of Danica's mouth, leaving Verena unsure where to begin.

The hope shining in Danica's expression pushed Verena to be honest. "I'm giving Isaac's legs my all, but the progress has been slow," she admitted.

That answer drained the excitement from Danica's face. "So you're saying there hasn't been much improvement yet?"

Verena exhaled and nodded. "It's true that things are moving slowly, but we're on the right track. The goal is to get his condition stable enough for surgery. Once we reach that point, you'll see real change."

A wave of disappointment settled over Danica as she listened.

Verena had managed to resolve Isaac's other health issues, but when it came to his legs, there were still no guarantees.

A long pause followed before Danica spoke again. "Verena, I do appreciate everything you're doing for Isaac. Still, I plan to move forward with what I decided."

Verena met her gaze, and Danica continued, "Katelyn already mentioned having a talk with you. I know you're worried about how close she and Isaac once were, and that's why you'd rather keep her away.I get it.But not everything is about that. I have no intention of coming between you and Isaac. All I want is for Katelyn to be his doctor-nothing more. You're the one he's married to, the person he'll spend his life with.I know you want to see him recover as soon as possible."

Taking Verena's hand, Danica tried to appeal to both her heart and her head. "You know the name Evelyn Rowe-she's practically a legend in the medical field. Katelyn's skills are top-notch, and letting her treat Isaac is the best move for him. I'm hoping you'll put aside any doubts about Katelyn and let her help. Maybe you could even convince Isaac to accept her treatment." After listening to Danica, Verena couldn't help but admire Katelyn's silver tongue.

Verena slowly pulled her hand back. "Danica, no one wants isaac to recover more than I do. But you're wrong about Katelyn. She isn't who she claims to be. There are things I can't share yet, but one thing I know for certain-Katelyn is not Evelyn."

Her words had barely left her mouth when Danica retorted, "That's nonsense!"

Danica's expression hardened. "Professor Wendell Branson worked side by side with Evelyn in Clokron. He personally confirmed Katelyn is her. Verena, I understand you don't want Katelyn near Isaac, but accusing her of lies only hurts your credibility. I've known that girl since childhood. She has her flaws, but she wouldn't risk inventing something so easily disproven."

Wendell Branson's name stopped Verena cold. Why would he vouch for Katelyn of all people?

Wendell's reputation was built on honesty. A man like him would never cover for Katelyn unless... she had backed him into a corner and forced him to lie.

The realization sank in, and Verena understood just how dangerous Katelyn really was.

Her voice steadied as she faced Danica again. "I have no reason to slander her. If you choose to believe Katelyn instead of me, that's your decision. But Isaac's condition is too serious to gamble on. Another failed attempt will make things worse for him. I will never allow her to treat him. If you want to convince lsaac otherwise, then speak with him directly, because I won't help you sway him."

Danica stared at her as though she didn't recognize her anymore. "What are you saying?"

Her frustration boiled over. "You're being unbelievably stubborn! Precisely because Isaac can't afford another failure, I want someone more dependable to take over. Andyet you cling to this out of jealousy. Fine,if you won't listen, I'll talk to Isaac myself. I won't waste another word on you."

She spun on her heel and stormed off, the sweep of her dress tailing behind her like a final word unspoken.

Left behind, Verena sat still, her mind circling back to the troubling matter.

Wendell had publicly vouched for Katelyn, calling her Evelyn. That thought tightened Verena's eyes as suspicion stirred within her.

She reached for the phone resting on the table and dialed quickly.

At that moment, Wendell was leaving the lecture hall, papers tucked under his arm, heading toward his office.His phone buzzed in his pocket.

The caller ID showed no name, just an unknown number.

With little hesitation, he accepted the call.

"Hello? Who's calling?"

A smooth, unmistakable female voice drifted through the line. "Professor Branson, it's been a long time."

The sound stopped Wendell mid-step, so abruptly that a passing student nearly collided with him.

The student offered a quick greeting, and Wendell returned a distracted nod before veering into a quieter corridor.

His voice wavered with disbelief. "Evelyn... is that really you?"

A soft reply confirmed it."Yes. It's me."

Wendell's hand grew damp around the phone. From the moment he allowed Katelyn to use Evelyn's name and backed her with his false testimony, he had dreaded the day he might be confronted by Evelyn herself.

He never imagined the real Evelyn would seek him out this quickly.

Evelyn had never relied on a fixed number, and he should have recognized that from the start.

Yet the call was already live, and hanging up now would only make things worse.

Even through the static of the line, Wendell's chest tightened with guilt, the weight of shame pressing down harder than he cared to admit.

His thoughts scattered until Verena's calm voice cut through. "Professor Branson, let's meet this afternoon -same place as always." The simple request made his stomach twist, and his first instinct was to back out.

"Evelyn, I... this afternoon I'm supposed to be at the school," he stammered.

Her reply came smoothly, leaving him no room to hide. "I already checked. You're free."

Wendell froze, realizing once again how easily Evelyn uncovered the smallest details.

For a stretch of silence, he said nothing, until her voice returned, lighter this time. "Good. Then we'll meet.See you later."

Defeated, Wendell forced himself to agree. "Alright. I'll be there."
###Chapter 143 Did Katelyn Cross A Line With You


Verena made her way to a local café later that afternoon.

She spotted Wendell already sitting at the reserved table, his posture stiff and his fingers locked together.

With an understanding smile, she approached and slid into the chair opposite him.

"You're early, Professor Branson," Verena remarked as she settled in.

Wendell's nerves were obvious as soon as he saw her.

He managed a shaky grin. "I actually just arrived a moment ago."

Noticing the tension that filled the space between them, Verena jumped straight to the point."Katelyn Fuller reached out to you, didn't she?"

The way she said it left no room for doubt-it wasn't a question, but a fact.

Stunned by how quickly she'd put it together, Wendell hesitated, and then exhaled slowly. "No one ever gets anything past you,do they?"

Her arms resting gently on the table, Verena continued, "So, what did Katelyn do to convince you to help her lie?"

Under the table, Wendell's hands clenched tighter. "She invited me under the pretense of a friendly meeting, but when I got there, I realized it was a setup. She spoke about a patient she was desperate to treat,but said the family needed convincing first. She wanted me to vouch for her by saying she was Evelyn.I know you too well to let anyone impersonate you, soI refused."

His words trailed off as he glanced at Verena, and then dropped his eyes.

"But then.." His voice cracked with a weary sigh. "She threatened my family. She mentioned my grandson,my son, and my daughter-in-law. Evelyn, I never wanted to lie, but I couldn't put them at risk. So I caved.She brought me to the family, and I said what she wanted me to say." Embarrassment crepot up Wendell's face as he spoke, his cheeks reddening.

A calm assurance floated across the table from Verena. "You don't need to worry about any of it," she said gently.

That response caught Wendell off guard, leaving him confused.

He searched her face for any sign of anger, but found only steady, clear eyes.

Verena leaned in and continued, "Professor Branson, I'Il make sure nothing happens to your family. You,your grandson, your son, and your daughter-in-law are all safe with me."

Wendell was stunned by what he heard and needed a moment before he responded. "Evelyn, aren't you upset with me for pretending you were someone else?"

With a soft smile, Verena shook her head. "The patient Katelyn is desperate to treat is actually my husband."

That bit of news made Wendell's eyes go wide. "That's... I can hardly believe it."

Verena nodded again. "What's done is done, Professor. You shouldn't feel responsible or carry any guilt.I promise, your family will be looked after."

The more composed and forgiving Verena seemed, the heavier Wendell's shame became. He tried to speak,but couldn't find the right words.

Elsewhere in the café, a man wearing a black jacket watched their table, a phone pressed to his ear.

Speaking in a low voice, he reported, "Miss Fuller, Wendel is with Verena right now."

Katelyn's quiet chuckle traveled down the line. "Understood. Don't lose track of them."

Once that call ended, she immediately dialed another number.

Danica answered after a moment. "Hello, Katelyn?"

With a gentle voice, Katelyn asked, "Mrs. Bennett, have you already talked to Verena?"

That question reignited Danica's earlier frustration from her conversation with Verena. Her reply came out flat and annoyed. "I visited her this morning."

Katelyn didn't let the tension faze her. "When you saw her, did you let her know that Professor Branson confirmed I'm Evelyn?"

Assuming Katelyn doubted how clearly she'd explained things, Danica snapped, "I told her everything she needed to hear."

A hint of a sly smile flickered across Katelyn's face. She put on a slightly anxious tone. "That explains a lot.While I was out having coffee today, I spotted Verena too. I was about to go over and say hello, but..."

She let her words hang in the air.

Danica couldn't help herself. "What happened next?"

Katelyn picked up the story right away. "I saw her sitting with Professor Branson. They looked pretty deep in conversation. Mrs. Bennett, she heard about him from you just this morning and now she's talking with him.What if she's trying to keep me away from lsaac by convincing Professor Branson to say I'm not really Evelyn?"

Danica cut her off, firm in her conviction. "That's not possible. Verena wouldn't do something like that."

Danica standing up for Verena brought a flicker of jealousy to Katelyn's eyes, though she kept her tone sweet. "You never know what people are capable of. Verena worked hard to become part of your family, and she's got a lot to lose. Honestly, I'd feel threatened in her shoes too. Wanting to protect her place is only natural. Still, it's not right to play dirty."

Danica weighed those words in silence.

Even if she felt frustrated with Verena, she wasn't quick to jump to conclusions.

Her mind drifted back to what Rhonda had said during her earlier visit. Danica let the thought sit before she finally replied, "I don't pretend to know Verena inside and out, but every time l've dealt with her, she's struck me as someone with integrity."

Katelyn noticed that Danica's words, though calm, seemed to lean in Verena's favor, which left her feeling uneasy. "Mrs. Bennett, are you sure about this..."

Before she could finish, Danica chimed in, "Don't worry. I'll be watching Verena closely. No matter what disagreements come up or how much pushback I get, I'll make certain isaac receives your care. I'm prepared to keep after him until he agrees to the surgery."

That unwavering determination finally eased Katelyn's mind. She arched her brows and gave a genuine smile. "That's exactly what I wanted to hear, Mrs. Bennett."

...

Later that night, after Verena finished Isaac's treatment, the two of them took turns showering.

There was still work left on Isaac's plate, so he stayed at his desk until almost midnight.

Only when he closed his laptop and left the study did he realize the bedroom was empty.

A ripple of panic passed through him as he paused at the doorway. Just as he considered calling her name,a cooI night breeze drifted in from the wide balcony, sending the sheer curtains floating through the air.

Looking up, Isaac spotted Verena at the railing, her back turned toward him, eyes on the sky.

She wore a soft champagne nightgown that almost disappeared against the pale curtains-no wonder he missed her at first glance.

The thought made Isaac laugh quietly at himself. His instinctive worry at not finding her had completely thrown him.

Steadying his nerves, he took another look at her graceful outline. "Couldn't sleep?"

That gentle question made Verena glance over her shoulder, a playful smile lighting up her face. "I'm waiting for you."

Her tone was teasing, and as the wind swept through, her hair fluttered around her shoulders.

The unexpected sweetness left Isaac speechless for a mnoment, but he couldn't stop himself from smiling back. He rolled his chair to her side, feeling a quiet warmth settle between them.

Verena slipped onto his lap, and Isaac instinctively drew her closer,his arms tightening around her waist.

Her palms cradied his face as she put on an exaggerated pout. "Working all day at the office and then bringing it home too? Such a pitiful man."

Before Isaac could respond, she leaned in with a playful sigh. "But it's fine, because this pitiful man belongs to me."

Her teasing tone and mischievous sweetness made Isaac's chest rumble with a quiet laugh.

"Don't move," Verena remarked gently, tilting his head up. "I'm giving you a massage."

Her fingers pressed against his temples, easing the tight knots of fatigue until the tension started to melt away.

Soon, though, her hands began exploring further.

Her delicate fingers glided along his brow, and she murmured softly, "Isaac, your eyebrows are so full, and the shape of your brow bone is so striking."

Her fingertips drifted down to the bridge of his nose. "And this nose-straight, sharp, like it was carved on purpose."

A small laugh escaped her as her attention slid lower.

"But your lips," she whispered with a dreamy look, tracing them lightly. "Those are my favorite. Soft, warm,and far too tempting."

Her voice carried like a gentle song, playful yet tender.

Isaac studied her closely, captivated by the faint blush on her cheeks, the hazy shimmer in her eyes, and the natural flush of her lips. There was even the faintest trace of wine on her breath, leaving her somewhere between sober and tipsy.

His hand caught her wrist with quiet firmness. "Did you drink?" Holding up two fingers, Verena grinned. "Just two glasses."

Isaac tilted his head, his voice low. "Something troubling you?"

She gave him a sly smile. "Who says it has to be trouble? Maybe I was drinking because I was happy."

He accepted her answer with a soft nod. "Then tell me, what was it that made you so happy?"

Her lips curved in a mischievous grin. "That's for me to know."

Without another word, she leaned forward and captured his lips.

There was no resisting her charm-Isaac never stood a chance.

Completely undone, he cupped her face in both hands and deepened the kiss.

Above them, the night sky glittered with countless stars, while the evening wind stirred the trees with a gentle rustle.

On the balcony of the villa, their embrace painted a picture that could have been lifted straight from a dream.

Hungry for more, Isaac clung to her like a boy unwilling to let go of his favorite toy.

Then, out of nowhere, Verena pressed both hands against his shoulders and broke away.

When he tried to close the distance again, she pushed a little firmer, holding him back.

He breathed heavily, his voice coming out rough. "What's wrong?"

Her eyes softened, though her tone carried weight. "Isaac, I need your word on something. Don't ask why,just promise."

Though confusion lingered, he didn't hesitate. "You have my word."

Her expression grew serious. "Whatever your mother tells you, don't agree to let someone else take over your treatment. It's not that I don't want you to get better faster-I just can't put faith in someone willing to do anything to get their way." Isaac's sharp mind connected the dots at once. "Did Katelyn cross a line with you?"

Verena hesitated, choosing not to give him a direct answer. "She went to Professor Wendell Branson and forced him to back her up, claiming she's Evelyn Rowe. Your mother believed her. She came to me asking that I step aside so Katelyn could treat you, but I refused."

Her gaze turned grim. "I wouldn't be surprised if Danica tries to pressure you into it herself. You'll need to be ready."

His brows drew together in frustration. "Katelyn is out of her mind."

Verena's tone sharpened. "And there's more. Katelyn threatened Professor Branson, so make sure his family,especially his grandson, is protected."

Isaac gave a firm nod. "This mess started because of me. I'll see to their safety personally."
###Chapter 144 The Attacks (Part One)


Morning arrived with a pale gold glow as Isaac rolled the chair onto the balcony, feeling the crisp air against his skin while he made a call to Jacob.

On the other end, Jacob answered promptly. "Mr. Bennett, is there something you need?"

Looking up atthe sky, Isaac instructed in a calm, steady voice, "Assign several trustworthy bodyguards to watch over Wendell Branson and his family."

Without pressing for details, Jacob responded right away, "I'Il see to it immediately."

A quiet "Alright" was all Isaac said before ending the call.

Verena emerged from the bathroom and noticed Isaac putting his phone away. She slipped her arms around him from behind. "Who were you just talking to?"

Turning just enough to see her, Isaac answered, "Jacob. He's already arranging for Professor Branson and his family to be protected, so you can stop worrying about that."

After a moment, he added, "Leave Katelyn to me. I'll handle whatever comes up."

Feigning concern, Verena arched an eyebrow and teased, "Are you sure you're up for it? Danica is siding with Katelyn now. What if she insists you follow Katelyn's plan for treatment?"

Isaac held her hands where they rested against his chest and said gently, "Katelyn has only confused my mom for the moment, nothing more. And remember, we promised to trust each other. Whatever opinions my mom has are her own, but they will never change how I feel."

With a lighthearted laugh, Verena stretched out the word,"Oh,"∂nd grinned."So my husband really does trust me after all."

She brushed his chin upward and planted a gentle kiss on his cheek. "That's your reward for having faith in me." That little gesture made her features seem even brighter, happiness lighting up her whole face.

Isaac lingered in the moment, his fingers brushing the place where her lips had touched, and a wave of sweetness filled his chest. He realized that even the smallest hint of affection or passion from Verena had the power to captivate him completely, leaving him lost in the feeling long after it happened.

Isaac found himself wondering if Verena's warmth was a sign that she was finally opening her heart to him.Maybe she was letting go of the past and her first love. Could it be that he was beginning to mean something real to her?

The thought drew a faint, genuine smile to his lips before he even realized it.

Verena caught him lost in thought. She gave his shoulder a little tap. "Let's get breakfast. Don't you have work this morning?"

He snapped out of his reverie and nodded. "Yeah, let's go downstairs."

They shared a meal together, and then Isaac left for the office.

Verena headed to the medical room on the second floor, yet rather than starting her surgical experiments right away, she paused by the window and placed an overseas call to her assistant.

The moment the call connected, Verena asked sharply, "Julianna, is everything arranged on your end? If so,l need you back in Shoildon as soon as you can. No more stalling."

A weary sigh was clear in Julianna's reply. "Evelyn, it's not that we're dragging our feet. There's still a patient here who's in rough shape. If surgery is needed, we'll have to staya bit longer."

Verena considered this for a moment. "Have Bradley Duncan take over that case. I trust his hands-he can handle the surgery. I want the rest of the team to come back as soon as possible."

That request left Julianna momentarily speechless. What could possibly be so urgent that Evelyn needed everyone back right away?

Though the question burned in her mind, Julianna simply agreed. "Alright, I'll-"

Verena interjected before she could finish, "You take care of all the details. Make sure the team returns quietly. Don't draw any attention."

Julianna had worked alongside Verena for a long while, but she had never seen her so relentless in chasing after something. The urgent request stirred an unshakable sense of unease deep within her.

Julianna could no longer contain her curiosity and asked, "Evelyn, are you rushing like this because something serious happened back home?"

A simple "Yes" came from Verena, her tone measured. "The people who've been after me have found out where I am. And now someone else is pretending to be me. Sooner or later, everything will come to a head.I plan to use this chance to flush them out once and for all. Only then will I be free to do what I need to do."

Her voice carried no urgency, as calm and ordinary as if she were commenting on the day's weather.

Julianna hesitated before answering. Her worry was evident as she said, "Evelyn, you're out there without any real protection. For now, that impostor might be diverting danger away from you, but there's a chance they will discover the truth soon and hunt you down. Please, be cautious."

A soft smile touched Verena's lips. "I can handle it,Julianna. You don't need to trouble yourself over me.Just make sure you and the others get back here quickly."

"Alright, I understand," Julianna replied, her voice heavy with reluctance.

···

Danica had tossed and turned the previous night, Katelyn's words replaying in her mind.

Could it really be true that Verena bribed Wendell to smear Katelyn's name? And if it wasn't true, then why had Verena arranged to meet Wendell the very afternoon after she was told about him?

The more she dwelled on it now, the more unsettled she became. For Danica, Isaac's health outweighed everything else.

Finally, she reached for her phone and instructed her assistant, her tone sharp and decisive. "Keep close watch on Verena and Wendell. I want a full report on every move they make."

The assistant replied respectfully, "Understood, Mrs. Bennett." An hour later, her phone rang again.

"Mrs. Bennett, nothing about Verena's actions has seemed out of the ordinary, but we did come across something else..." the assistant said, his voice fading as he trailed off.

The abrupt pause made Danica's brows draw together. "Come across what?"

The assistant's voice dropped, uneasy. "There are groups of men around Wendell's residence. Some of my people recognized them-they're associated with Mr. Isaac Bennett. It looks like he has already placed Wendell's family under surveillance."

The news left Danica both furious and unsettled, a wave of disbelief rising within her. She could hardly accept that Verena might have orchestrated such a scheme. To her, it seemed obvious that Verena must have spoken to lsaac, persuading him to surround Wendell's home in order to force his compliance. Did Verena honestly think that if Wendell denied Katelyn's claim of being Evelyn, she would simply accept it as truth?

Danica muttered to herself, "This is outrageous... completely outrageous."

The call with her assistant barely ended before Danica was already dialing Verena's number.
 ###Chapter 145 The Attacks (Part Two)


On the other side, Verena had just wrapped up her conversation with Julianna when her phone lit up again.

The moment she picked up, Danica's voice cut through, sharp and accusatory. "Verena, I know about your meeting with Professor Branson. I once believed you were only stubborn and unwilling to bend, but now l see your jealousy has gone too far. Did you really push Isaac into threatening the professor, all so Katelyn couldn't be given the chance to treat lsaac?"

The harshness of the words caught Verena off guard, leaving her silent for a moment. When she finally spoke, her brows drew together. "I never tried to threaten Professor Branson."

Danica wasn't convinced. Her tone rose, edged with urgency. "If that's true, then explain to me-were those men stationed outside Professor Branson's house sent there because of you?"

Verena let out a quiet breath before she answered evenly, "Isaac sent them at my request, yes, but it wasn't to harm him. Katelyn cornered Professor Branson and pressured him to lie, to claim she was Evelyn. I asked Isaac to place guards there only to protect him and his family. With Katelyn involved, their safety could be in danger at any time."

Danica fell into silence, her grip on the phone tightening.

Verena had told her before that Katelyn wasn't Evelyn, and once again she was repeating the same claim.For a moment, Danica's certainty wavered. Yet Katelyn's persuasive words echoed back in her mind, pulling her into doubt all over again.

Danica fell quiet for a moment before delivering her warning. "I will look into this myself. And if I discover you lied to me... then you will no longer be welcome as my daughter-in-law."

Verena had never been the type to bow her head to threats. She understood Danica's concern for lsaac,but she wasn't about to allow intimidation to pass unchecked.

Her tone sharpened as she answered, "My only wish is to stand beside Isaac as his wife. I've never cared about carrying the Bennett family's name. If you choose to put your faith in Katelyn instead, that's on you.But remember this--I respect you because of isaac, not because you hold the title of matriarch of the Bennett family."

She ended the call abruptly, giving Danica no opportunity to reply.

On the other side of the line, Danica's anger boiled over, yet beneath it lingered a nagging unease. Perhaps Verena's certainty came from knowing more than she let on.


...

The news of Verena meeting Wendell unsettled Katelyn. A troubling thought struck her-what if Wendell had confessed everything about her threats to Verena? If that were true, she needed to move quickly before he became a liability.

Driven by that concern, Katelyn dialed Wendell's number.

The phone rang several times before cutting off without an answer.

Her brows drew together in irritation. Why would he ignore her?

She tried again, but this time the call went straight to voicemail-the phone was switched off.

An uneasy suspicion began to form. Why would Wendell dare defy her after everything she had over him?Unless...he really had told Verena the truth.

The thought made her stomach sink. Acting on her instinct, she pulled up another number and made a quick call.

"Kaia, meet me. We need to talk."

When Katelyn asked to meet, Kaia immediately understood it was time to move forward with their plan. She agreed in a rush, nodding as she said, "Alright,I'll head out right now."

The call ended, and Katelyn grabbed her keys, driving away from the villa on her own. She didn't notice the vehicles pulling out behind her the moment she left the gates. Her car shot onto the main road, the engine roaring as she sped up, while the trailing cars slipped neatly into place behind her.

At the upcoming intersection, just as she was about to turn, another car darted out from the opposite side.

Katelyn's pulse spiked, her breath caught, and a startled cry tore from her throat. "Ah!"

She tightened her grip on the wheel, yanking it in an attempt to avoid the sudden danger.

But the oncoming car had already calculated her path. With a sharp acceleration, it slammed straight into her vehicle.

The deafening crash lit sparks as metal scraped against metal.

Her head struck the doorframe hard, a dizzying pain leaving her reeling. Before she could recover, the other car lunged forward again, clearly ready for a second hit.

Panic shot through her. Who were these people? Why were they after her?

Thoughts tumbled in her mind with no answers. One thing was clear-she had to get away.

As the car came barreling toward her once more, she spun the wheel, turning the car around.

Yet the moment she tried to speed away, a line of black cars appeared, blocking her escape route.

That was when the truth sank in-she had been cornered with no exit.

Her palms slipped against the damp leather of the wheel, her lips dry as she ran her tongue across them.Quietly, she pressed the accelerator, still clinging to a faint hope of breaking through.

Since there was only a single car behind her, Katelyn thought she might have a chance of forcing her way out.

But that slim hope vanished in an instant.

The moment she twisted the wheel, the swarm of vehicles closed in, hemming her from every direction. One slammed into the hood with brutal force. The impact was so violent that the hood flipped open, metal screeching as smoke hissed out.

Thrown forward by the recoil, Katelyn's forehead struck the steering wheel before her head snapped back against the seat.

Warm blood began to seep down her temple, soaking into her hair in dark streaks.

Her hands clamped tighter around the wheel, knuckles pale, her entire body shaking as if refusing to let go.

Before she could recover, another car came barreling straight toward her.

The assault didn't stop. One crash after another battered her vehicle until the frame gave way and the car tipped onto its side, glass shattering across the asphalt. Still, the attackpressed on, merciless.

Minutes dragged by. Her vision dimmed, her body heavy, and only the seatbelt kept her from collapsing completely.

The cars finally came to a stop, and one person rolled down the window and instructed another, "Go check if she's dead."

"Got it," one of the men answered as he climbed out, moving toward the wreckage.

Halfway there, the rising wail of sirens pierced the air.

His face drained of color. He spuñ on his heel and sprinted back, yelling, "The police are here! Move out!"

Engines roared to life, and within seconds, the fleet of black cars scattered, leaving nothing but shattered glass and twisted metal behind.
###Chapter 146 Who Was Telling The Truth


Before the police could show up, the group had already vanished, slipping away with astonishing speed and leaving no trace behind.

With no other option, the officers prioritized checking on the victims first and quickly requested emergency assistance.

At Shoildon Primary Hospital, as she slowly regained her consciousness, Katelyn could barely make out two men speaking nearby.

"Doctor, what's the patient's condition right now?"

"Officer, her injuries are not serious. She only suffered a mild concussion. She'll stay unconscious for a bit,but after some rest, she'll be alright."

"Understood. I appreciate your efforts."

Offering a humble reply, the doctor acknowledged the thanks before a nurse summoned him away.

Nearby, the shuffle of paper filled Katelyn's ears. She tried to force her eyes open, frowning in her struggle,but her eyelids refused to move.

Out of nowhere, memories of being surrounded by cars played in her mind. Panic washed over her, and she fought hard to break free from the nightmare. She finally forced her eyes open.

A white ceiling was the first thing to greet her gaze.

She kept her eyes fixed above, sweat gathering on her brow while her lips lost their color.

Noticing the slight stir, the officer glanced at Katelyn and asked, "You're awake?" Do you feel well enough to talk? Could you answer a few questions?"

Katelyn shifted her gaze toward the officer and said, "Could I make a quick phone call first, officer? "Here you go." The officer grabbed the phone from the nightstand and passed it to her. "This belongs to you,right?"

After accepting it, Katelyn nodded in thanks.

She went straight to her contacts and dialed Danica right away.

The officer stepped out without a word and took position right outside the door.

As soon as the call connected, Katelyn's voice shook with tears. "Mrs. Bennett."

Danica heard the trembling in her voice and quickly asked, "Katelyn, what's the matter?"

With a shaky breath, Katelyn replied, her words tight with fear, "Mrs. Bennett, some people tried to kill me with cars. Please, I need your help."

Danica's heart skipped a beat as she took in what Katelyn had just said.

Realizing how shaken Katelyn sounded, Danica spoke in a gentle voice. "Try to calm yourself,sweetheart.
Explaining everything over the phone is tough. Just tell me where you are, and I'll come get you."

Right away, Katelyn told her that she was at Shoildon Primary Hospital.

Danica heard Katelyn's cries and, understood she was calling from the hospital. Even though worry gnawed at her, she kept her composure and promised Katelyn that she would be there soon and that there was no reason to be scared.

The officer came back into the room just as the call wrapped up.

"Was that a family member you were talking to?" he asked.

With eyes still swollen from tears, Katelyn gave a nod. "Yes. She's coming here soon."

The officer reached for a chair, sat down, and opened his notebook, ready with a pen. "Now that you're awake, I'd like to ask you a few things."

In a quiet voice, Katelyn replied, "Officer, I'm ready to answer. Please, go ahead." She spoke so softly and respectfully that the officer saw in her a young woman who had clearly been raised well.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he tried to understand how someone so gentle and lovely could find herself the target of such cruel intentions.

A wave of sympathy came over him, but hequickly reminded himself to focus on his duty.

"Your name?"

"Katelyn Fuller."

"How old are you?"

"Twenty-six."

"And your occupation..."

Once the officer had noted down her basic information, he began to ask more about what had happened that day, wanting to get every detail about the cause, how it all unfolded, and how it ended.

"Then none of those people seemed familiar to you?" the officer asked.

"At that moment..."

"Katelyn!"

Before Katelyn could continue, Danica flung the hospital room door open and rushed in.

Katelyn and the officer turned their eyes to her, and Danica froze for a moment, caught off guard by the officer's presence.

Once she noticed the badge on his chest, she understood he was handling official business. She nodded politely and said, "I'm sorry for stepping in, officer."

Without making a sound, Danica took a seat on the sofa.

The officer wasn't fazed at all. He simply looked back at Katelyn. "Miss Fuller, please go on." A small nod from Katelyn signaled she was ready to speak. "At the time, I was sitting in the car and felt too scared to get out. More than ten vehicles surrounded mine, and every single window was rolled up tight, so there was no way to see anyone inside. After my car flipped over, I saw someone get out to check if I was still alive. By then, blood had already blurred my vision, and I couldn't make out any faces. I heard sirens,and right after that, all the cars sped away."

Danica's worry deepened as she listened, her brows drawing closer together in concern.

When she first heard Katelyn on the phone, she assumed it was just an ordinary accident; maybe Katelyn's fear had made her overthink it.

But hearing that a dozen cars boxed Katelyn in and flipped her vehicle stunned her.

That hadn't been an accident at all; someone had intentionally tried to kill her.

Meanwhile, the officer made sure to record every word Katelyn said in his notebook.

"Miss Fuller, your description points to a planned attack carried out by a group. There has to be someone coordinating this. Otherwise, the cameras at that intersection wouldn't have just stopped working right when it happened."

He hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Miss Fuller, take a moment to think. Have you upset anyone lately?"

Danica kept her eyes on Katelyn, waiting to hear what she would say.

Katelyn longed to find out who had tried to kill her, but she also recognized this as the perfect chance to take Verena down.

She had no intention of letting this chance slip through her fingers.

Later, she planned to have her team look into who was responsible for orchestrating the attack.

But right now, framing Verena was what matered most.

Drawing in a breath, Katelyn shook her head. "Officer, I've only just come back from abroad. There's no way I could've made any enemies here yet." The officer wasn't fully convinced. "Just because you've only recently returned, doesn't mean you're safe from trouble. Try to remember if you've crossed anyone's path since you got back. Sometimes even small arguments can become dangerous situations."

Katelyn narrowed her eyes and gave a confused nod. "Alright. I'll try to recall if anything happened."

She made it look like she was thinking hard.

A heavy silence filled the room, and after a moment, her eyes suddenly went wide and she drew in a sharp breath.

Noticing her reaction, the officer immediately asked, "Did something just come to mind?"

A moment of uncertainty crossed Katelyn's face as she glanced at Danica, her expression heavy with worry.Turning to the officer, she said, "Officer, not long ago, I argued with someone. This is Mrs. Bennett sitting on the sofa; she's like a family to me. Her son Isaac and I grew up together as close friends.Life took a hard turn for him after acar accident left him using a wheelchair. I came back from overseas after studying medicine, hoping I could perform surgery for him. But his wife, who is also a doctor, never felt comfortable about my friendship with Isaac. No matter how much I tried to explain, she keptrefusing to let me operate.My biggest reason for comingback was to help him walk again, and I didn't want to let this chance slip by. In the middle of our talk, I ended up arguing with his wife. If you're asking about people I've fallen out with,she's honestly the only one. Officer, could it be that she hired someone to have me killed just to keep me away from lsaac?"

Katelyn's voice quivered with fear, and she clutched herself tightly, her shaking frame making her appear completely defenseless.

Danica moved closer to Katelyn before the officer had a chance to reply. "Katelyn, Verena would never do something like that," she said.

Even as she spoke, doubt crept in.

Catching the uncertainty in Danica's eyes, Katelyn's voice cracked as she pleaded, "Mrs. Bennett, Verena probably thinks you'd take my side. She's scared I'll come between her and Isaac. Please, don't let her fool you." Danica paused, torn and overwhelmed, but shook her head. "No. That can't be true. Verena isn't capable of something like that."

The officer watched the exchange and decided to step in. "Let's all take a breath and calm ourselves for a moment."

Looking at Danica, he continued, "We are still working through all the suspects. Until we learn the truth,nothing is certain yet."

With a nod, Danica realized she'd lost her composure and drew in a steadying breath. "Thank you, sir."

She faced Katelyn next and said, "Katelyn, after everything that's happened, I understand how you feel. Get some rest, and I'll come back to see you soon."

...

Drifting through the hospital hallway, Danica found her mind tanged in worry, unable to shake off Verena's words or the sight of Katelyn's pain and fear.

Each of them had a different story, making it impossible for Danica to tell who was telling the truth.

Passing by another wing of the hospital, she caught bits of conversation between uniformed officers who seemed deep in discussion.
###Chapter 147 Called To The Police Station For Questioning


The sound of the officers talking reached Danica as she moved along the path.

"She's just a young lady. They really didn't hold back on her."

"That's the truth. If we hadn't been circling the area on patrol, she could have been abandoned out there in the wilderness with no chance of survival."

"Being dumped in the wilderness might almost have been kinder. When more than ten cars surround one and ram into it again and again, the body is crushed to the point that not a single organ is left unharmed."

"Such a pity... It's a miracle she managed to stay alive."

Their voices grew fainter as they walked away, and Danica slowed until her steps nearly faltered. Each word they spoke pressed against her chest, making her heart squeeze with pain.

The picture she carried of Katelyn's danger suddenly sharpened, and it was far more terrifying than she had imagined.

Even if Katelyn sometimes behaved erratically, she would never go so far as to invent a story about her life being in danger.

Danica made it all the way home without breaking out of her daze, and even standing inside her own doorway did nothing to lift the heavy weight inside her.

···

Far away, in a private villa outside the country, a man dressed in black leaned back in a large office chair, his computer glowing with the image of an ongoing conference call.

When his subordinate finished giving the report, he narrowed his eyes, and a sinister light flickered in them."So,she's still breathing?"

For a moment the subordinate hesitated, and then answered in a tight voice, "Yes, sir. That's correct." The man cursed quietly, his tone low and venomous, "Useless idiots. What do I even keep you around for?"In a rush, the subordinate defended himself. "Sir, this country, Akoitha, doesn't operate the way Clokron does. You can't carry out these things so openly there. When the police arrivedI on the scene,retreat was the only option we had."
Lighting a cigarette, the man took a long drag, and then released the smoke in a slow ring that drifted through the room. "Where is she now?"

"She was taken to a hospital," the subordinate responded quickly.
"A hospital?" The man arched one brow, a dark grin spreading across his face. "Good. Let her breathe her last there, and we won't even have to get rid of her body ourselves."
With a respectful tone, the subordinate answered, "Yes, sir."

The man's voice grew colder. "Make sure of it. And if you fail, don't bother returning."
On the other end of the line, the subordinate wiped the sweat from his forehead and replied quickly,"understand,sir."
At Shoildon Primary Hospital, inside a top-floor VIP suite, silence filled the room.
A nurse entered for the routine check of Katelyn's vitals. Spotting her asleep, she decided not to wake her and slipped out quietly once everything looked stable.

The door clicked shut behind her, and moments later, the window eased open from the outside.
Dressed head to toe in fitted black clothing, with their face hidden behind a mask, a shadowy figure vaulted inside with fluid, silent movements.
Moving closer to the bed where Katelyn slept, the intruder slowly lifted an arm, a gleaming dagger sliding down from within the sleeve.
The point of the weapon lined up perfectly with the vulnerable skin of Katelyn's neck.
Inside her dream, Katelyn suddenly felt the sting of something sharp driving toward her head, the sensation shocking her awake.

Her eyes shot open to the sight of a cold blade hovering inches away, and terror ripped through her as she cried out,"Ah!"

The sound made the intruder narrow their eyes before slashing the dagger toward her without hesitation.

Katelyn tumbled off the bed in panic, hurling whatever objects she could grab in the intruder's direction.

Every throw missed as the figure dodged with ease and advanced again, blade flashing as it swung a second time.

"Help! Somebody help me!" Katelyn bolted toward the door, but just as her hand reached for the handle,a grip clamped down on her right arm and the dagger sliced across it.

“Ah!"

Blood poured from her right arm in a steady stream. The sting of the cut was nothing compared to the terror clawing at her mind, and her legs buckled until she collapsed onto the floor.

The intruder moved closer at a slow, deliberate pace, raising the dagger for another strike, when a whistle suddenly pierced the air and heavy footsteps thundered in the hallway.

At the sound, the intruder pulled, back the dagger, dashed toward the window, and vanished into the night without leaving a trace.

"Miss Fuller, are you hurt?" An officer shoved the door open, lifted Katelyn from the floor, and set her back on the bed while a nurse rushed in to dress the bleeding wound.

A middle-aged officer turned toward the open window, his brow furrowing."Who could move with such speed and skill?"

Another officer answered grimly, "Climbing and escaping at this height would take the training of a professional killer."

Katelyn's gaze rested on the officers, her body trembling as the fear refused to leave her.Who was determined enough to want her dead? Every attempt so far made it clear they would not give up until she was gone.

True fear gripped Katelyn this time. She seized the arm of the officer who had asked her questions earlier and begged, her voice breaking, "Officer Collins, please protect me. These people are after my life."

Waldo Collins gave a firm nod. "Stay calm. We'll guard you and make sure they fail."

...

After coming back from the hospital, Danica kept replaying the words of both Verena and Katelyn in her mind.

Even though Katelyn's account seemed more convincing on the surface, Danica still quietly leaned toward believing Verena.

Still, Katelyn had suffered an ordeal that left her pitiful in Danica's eyes.

One afternoon, Danica prepared several nourishing dishes and planned to deliver them to Katelyn at the hospital.

While she finished packing the food, Bobby descended the staircase.

"Bobby," Danica called out as he came down. "Katelyn is injured and staying in the hospital. Why don't you come with me to see her?"

Bobby looked reluctant. "But I already promised my friends I'd meet them for billiards."

Danica tugged sharply at his ear. "You can spend time with your friends whenever you want. Right now,Katelyn is injured, and she's been your friend since childhood. You ought to visit her, because in her heart she still treats you like a younger brother."

Bobby shielded his ear and murmured in protest, "She always followed Isaac around like a shadow. I never really spent time with her."

Danica clicked her tongue in annoyance. "Tsk! What was that you just said?"

Worried she might reach for his other ear, Bobby gave in with reluctance. "Alright. I'll go." When they reached the hospital, Danica pushed the ward door open and was startled to find the same officer,Waldo,already seated inside.

Bobby's face showed confusion. "Why is a police officer here?"

Danica moved closer and asked, "Officer Collins, could you tell me what happened?"

Waldo gestured toward the window. "Not long ago, someone climbed in with the intent to assassinate Miss Fuller. We managed to arrive in time to stop the worst, but she still ended up wounded."

As those words sank in, Danica's eyes turned to Katelyn. Her arm was wrapped in a bandage, yet fresh blood had already soaked through, and her complexion looked drained and fragile.

Katelyn broke down with heavier sobs. "Mrs. Bennett, do you still think I'm lying? She truly wants me dead."

Bobby stayed frozen, not knowing what to say.

Danica knitted her brows together but kept her silence.

She already realized that Katelyn hadn't fabricated this, because tricking the police would have been impossible.

Even so, she could not bring herself to openly say that Verena might really be responsible.

Waldo looked through his notes before he asked Katelyn once more, "Miss Fuller, are you certain Verena Willis is the only person who comes to mind as the suspect?"

Tears ran down Katelyn's face as she nodded hard. "No one else could have done this. She knows my hands are everything to me as a doctor. Now my arm has been cut, and I can't even say when it will heal."

Her crying worsened, and she buried her face in her hands.

Bobby shouted angrily, jabbing a finger at her, "That's nonsense. Someone may be targeting you, but it has nothing to do with my sister-in-law. Verena is gentle and kind, and she would never stoop to that. Are you just accusing her because you dislike her?"

"Bobby!" Danica snapped as she yanked him to the side. "You're getting more out of control with every

passing day."

Waldo fixed him with a hard stare and spoke with firm authority. "We're treating this as a proper investigation. Anyone with past ties to the victim can be seen as a suspect, so l expect your cooperation."

...

At Seraphina Villas, Rhonda picked up a phone call, and her complexion drained of color at once.

In her panic, she dashed upstairs, pounding on the study door without her usual restraint.

When Verena opened it, she looked surprised. "Rhonda, what's wrong? Why are you so worked up?"

Breathless, Rhonda delivered the news. "Mrs. Bennett, the police just called. They want you to come down to the station for questioning."
###Chapter 148 Main Suspect


As soon as Verena reached the police station, she caught sight of Danica and Bobby standing at the front entrance,giving the impression that they had been there for a while.

Her presence did not go unnoticed. Bobby spotted her right away and stormed over, his voice thick with frustration. "Verena, can you believe what that mániac Katelyn is saying about you? She's got people after her,yet she's pointing the finger at you, acting like you're behind everything. She's just making things up!"

He stopped, glancing at Verena as if afraid she might be upset, and quickly added, "I know you're not to blame. The police just want to talkto you. There's no reason to be scared."

Bobby looked as though he was about to add more, but Danica stepped in and pulled him behind her.

Her gaze lingered on Verena, her expression hard to read. "Officer Waldo Collins is inside waiting for you.You should head in."

She feIt a debt of gratitude to Verena for the help she had given Isaac, especially regarding the recovery of his sex function. Yet, the reality that Katelyn had been targeted could not be ignored.

Katelyn's statements were detailed and sounded genuine, while Verena had never been the kind to fabricate stories. Danica felt caught in the middle, uncertain about who to trust.

The memory of their last phone conversation weighed on Verena, and she knew that Danica's faith in Katelyn ran deeper.

A quiet acceptance passed over her face. "I understand."

Verena then glanced at Bobby, her expression softening as she offered a gentle smile. "It's okay, Bobby. I'Il be fine," she said.

Once inside the interrogation room, an officer spoke to her in a polite tone. "Please hold on for a bit. Officer Collins will arrive shortly." Verena answered him with a warm smile and a small nod, "Okay."

Barely two minutes later, the door opened, and two men entered the room.

An older man walked in first, followed by a younger officer carrying a pen and notebook.

With a calm, unreadable expression, the older man asked, "Are you Verena Willis?"

Rising from her seat, Verena caught sight of the badge on his chest and answered with a pleasant smile,"Yes, Officer Collins, that's me."

Waldo gave a slight nod and sat down across from Verena, while the note-taker quietly took his place at his side.

Fixing his eyes on her, Waldo said, "This meeting concerns the recent attempt on Katelyn Fuller's life. Based on her statement, you're currently our main suspect, so we'll need to ask you a few questions."

"Attempted murder?" Verena arched a brow, a subtle smile touching her lips. "I don't believeI understand.Could you explain what you mean?"

Waldo replied without hesitation, lacing his fingers together,"Absolutely."

His eyes shifted to the notebook before him as he asked, "Can you tell me where you were on the morning of December 1st?"

Verena paused, thinking back. "I was at home."

Waldo continued his line of questioning. "Can anyone confirm that for you?"

Remaining calmn, Verena said, "The housekeeper was there all day. I never left the house."

Waldo observed her closely, noting how she remained steady, uncertain whether her calm meant confidence or simply nerves of steel.

His tone turned more serious as he continued, "That morning, Katelyn was nearly killed at a busy intersection on Wood Street by a group of vehicles acting in concert. Every move was meant to end her life.Luckily, our patrol arrived just in time and stopped things from going any further." He paused, and then continued, "After she was brought to the hospital, someone made another attempt on her life within forty-eight hours. I've followed up with the victim, and right now, all signs point to you as the leading suspect. So, I need to ask plainly-have you ever had any disputes with Miss Katelyn Fuller?"
###Chapter 149 The Real Target Was Verena


With a firm stare fixed on Verena, Waldo carried an air of authority that demanded respect and left a lasting impression.

In most cases, anyone questioned under such pressure would have found it difficult to stay composed,even with nothing to hide.

Despite this, Verena sat perfectly at ease, her composure never wavering.

A gentle shake of her head followed as she answered, "Officer Collins, I can honestly say I never had any disputes with Katelyn."

The level-headed way she spoke took Waldo by surprise, but he kept his face impassive, true to his reputation as one of Shoildon's most experienced officers.

Leaning a little closer, he fixed his attention on Verena. "You say there were no disagreements,but Katelyn has shared a different account."

Without letting her expression change, Verena waited in silence for him to continue.

Waldo turned a fresh page in his notebook. "According to Katelyn, she returned from overseas to help treat your husband. Because she thought your family might doubt her credentials, she specifically asked Wendell Branson to confirm her identity as the renowned Evelyn Rowe. Eventually, the patient's mother agreed to let her proceed, but you were opposed. Your objection was driven by jealousy over her childhood bond with your husband, and you wanted them to have no contact at all. To stop her from operating,you supposedly tried to pay off Wendell and get him to claim she was lying. However, your mother-in-law,who has great influence in the household, already supported her. Once you realized your mother-in-law distrusted you, the accusation is that you took drastic measures, hiring someone to eliminate the threat for good."

His eyes remained locked on Verena as he tried to read her reaction. "Now, give me a straightforward answer: did you encourage your husband to follow Wendell, hoping to intimidate him for your own purposes?" Verena let the question hang for a moment, taking time to think.

It became clear that whoever targeted Katelyn was likely the group of people from overseas.

She knew the true target was not Katelyn, but herself.

Those responsible had acted quickly, apparently desperate to get rid of her before she saw them coming.

There was no way they expected the Evelyn they were pursuing to be someone else entirely.

As she realized this, Verena could not help but acknowledge the lengths Katelyn had gone with her dramatic scheme.

Even after nearly dying, Katelyn was still determined to ruin her. That kind of drive had to come from real hatred.

But Verena knew the charade needed to end.

"Absolutely not." Verena refuted Waldo's question with steady confidence. "Let me explain why I said there were no disputes with Katelyn. She never even got the opportunity to argue with me. She wanted to be my husband's doctor, but both he and I refused. Even with my mother-in-law insisting, my husband's answer stayed the same. I had no motive to harm Katelyn, so there's no reason I'd ever consider a crime against her. And about Wendell, I never tried to bribe him to turn on Katelyn. In truth, Katelyn was the one putting pressure on him. She forced him to lie and say she was Evelyn Rowe. The only reason there were people around Wendell's family was for their protection, not intimidation. You can confirm everything with him directly."

Waldo drew his brows together. "What makes you so sure Katelyn lied? How can you know for certain she isn't Evelyn? If your mother-in-law hadn't told you that Wendell identified Katelyn as Evelyn, what would have led you to him in the first place? Doesn't that show you tried to pay off Wendell?"

"I know she's lying because I'm the real Evelyn Rowe, and I have no reason to bribe Wendell."

Her blunt reply caught both Waldo and the note-taker off guard.

Waldo blinked in surprise, taking a second to process. "Excuse me, what did you just say?" He clearly had not expected such a revelation.

Verena answered in the same measured, even tone, "Wendell and I have a long history, and I understand the kind of person he is. He isn't someone who could be bribed. So, when my mother-in-law said Wendell had vouched for Katelyn as Evelyn, I suspected that he must have been threatened. I reached out to him and found out my instincts were right. That's why I made sure he and his family had someone to look out for them.And with Katelyn, since I am the real Evelyn, I have no motivation at all to try to harm her. If I wanted to keep her away from my husband, there are plenty of ways to do that. The only reason I haven't told my mother-in-law or anyone else who I am is that there are still complications I need to resolve first."

A long silence settled after Verena finished. Waldo watched her, reading the unwavering calm in her eyes.

Even though she sounded a bit proud, her logic was clear and difficult to dispute.

If Verena truly was Evelyn, then Katelyn's accusations against her didn't add up.

"So, you're claiming to be Evelyn, and you believe Katelyn is pretending."

Verena answered with assurance, "Yes, I am Evelyn."

After a moment's pause, she gave a gentle smile. "I would appreciate it if you kept this confidential. I'm not able to reveal my identity to everyone just yet."

Waldo stayed quiet for a moment, his fingers drumming against the table, before saying, "Words alone won't convince anyone. What proof do you have that you're Evelyn?"

Verena, already expecting the question, answered openly,medical team will be back soon, and every patient we've treated will be able to vouch for me."

Waldo believed he had caught a weak point and said, "If that's true,then why not allow us to reveal your identity as Evelyn to the public right now?"

He pressed further, and Verena chose not to hold back as she explained, "Someone is trying to kill me. Until I find out who they are, I can't reveal my identity."

That answer sparked a look of realization in Waldo's eyes. While looking into Katelyn's background, he remembered coming across a news article about her.

The article hinted that she might actually be Evelyn.

Hearing what Verena just revealed, he realized if Verena truly was Evelyn and Katelyn was simply posing as her, then the group hunting Evelyn must have read that article, assumed Katelyn was Evelyn, and set their sights on the wrong person.

The real target was always Verena.

Now seeing the larger picture, Waldo understood that things were even more tangled than he thought.

But he could not take Verena's word at face value without solid proof.

Rising from his seat, Waldo came over to Verena. "Mrs. Bennett, for now, we'll remain cautious about your claim and will conduct a thorough investigation to confirm what you've said."

He reached out to shake her hand. "That's all the questions I have for now. As the inquiry goes on, we may need you to return for more questioning. I hope you'll cooperate."

With a small smile, Verena shook his hand. "Of course. It's a citizen's responsibility to help the police whenever possible."

Once she stepped out of the interrogation room, Verena was led to a different waiting area.

In the midst of giving a lecture, Wendell got a call from the police station.

When he learned the police wanted to question him for a case, his mind blanked for a second, but he quickly tried to compose himself.

Once the call ended, he told his students to keep studying on their own, and then left the classroom with nerves showing in his steps.

Over at the Bennett Group headquarters, a management meeting was in progress when a knock interrupted the proceedings.

Isaac disliked interruptions in the middle of meetings, and a trace of irritation crossed his face as his tone cooled."Come in."

Jacob entered, visibly uneasy, and walked up to Isaac to whisper, "Mr. Bennett, the police station called and they've requested you to come down."

Isaac looked at him in confusion. "Did they say why?"

Lowering his voice further, Jacob leaned in. "It seems to be about your wife..."
###Chapter 150 What's Happened To My Wife


A sudden shift appeared in Isaac's expression, his brows drawing together in concern. "What did you say?"

Jacob kept his gaze low, offering no reply.

Taking a moment to steady himself, Isaac told the room, "I'm sorry, but we'll have to end this meeting here."

He then turned to Jacob with urgency. "Get the car ready."

Without another word, he maneuvered his wheelchair quickly out of the conference room.

Both Wendell and Isaac reached the police station at the same time.

As soon as they arrived, officers separated them, guiding each into a different interrogation room.

Upon entering, Wendell spotted two police officers waiting at the table.

Having never experienced such an ordeal, he found himself growing nervous.

"Professor Branson, please have a seat." Waldo motioned toward the chair facing him. "I'm Waldo Collins.You can just call me Officer Collins."

Wendell did as he was told and asked hesitantly, "Officer Collins, may I ask why I was summoned here..."

Waldo answered plainly, "This concerns Verena Willis and Katelyn Fuller."

Wendell blinked, unsure of the connection. "I'm not sure I understand."

Waldo's tone grew more intense. "Did Verena ever threaten you or try to make you speak out against Katelyn, denying her identity as Evelyn Rowe?"

Wendell froze in surprise before shaking his head. "Verena never threatened me."

Believing Wendell might be too afraid to speak freely, Waldo attempted to reassure him. "You're safe here,and we'll make sure you're protected. Don't hesitate, just tell us the truth about what happened." Wendell answered firmly, "Verena is my friend, and she would never threaten me. The one who pressured me was Katelyn Fuller, trying to prove she's Evelyn Rowe."

A flash of surprise lit up Waldo's face. Was Verena actually telling the truth?

Still, he wanted to be certain, so he pressed on, "But you once said that Katelyn was your associate during your time in Clokron. Why do you say now that she threatened you?"

Wendell's discomfort was obvious as soon as Katelyn's name came up.

He replied, "I only said that because Katelyn used threats against my family. She made me lie for her. She isn't Evelyn; the real Evelyn is Verena. My acquaintance with Katelyn barely goes back a month, but I've known Verena for almost three years."

Waldo leaned forward and asked, "Do you have any proof to support what you're saying?"

At that, Wendell rubbed his temple and offered his phone to Waldo. "You can look through my chat history with Katelyn. We only exchanged contact details recently. If we were really partners in Clokron, there would be no reason for us to add each other on the chat app just a few days ago. Also, if you notice,almost every conversation was started by her. Even with calls, she always dialed my number first. If we had been close for years, the communication would go both ways."

After a brief silence, he continued, "If that isn't convincing enough, you can look at the surveillance footage.Our first meeting took place at a well-known spot, Fortune Garden Restaurant. I had never laid eyes on her before that day."

Waldo paid attention as he checked both the messages and the call logs.

Everything Wendell said matched up: Katelyn always reached out first.

Their chats were short and to the point, mostly arranging where to meet, and her tone came across as distant, nothing like the way real friends or work associates would speak.

Waldo returned the phone to Wendell and asked, "So, the people stationed at your home..."

"They were arranged by Verena. She was worried that Katelyn might try to hurt me or my family, so she set up protection." Wendell's voice was steady. "Officer Collins, Verena really is Evelyn, and I count her as a true friend. If you still have doubts, you can pull my call history with Verena. Even though she uses different numbers, you can trace the owners. Also, when she came back from overseas, we had a meal at Fortune Garden Restaurant, too. There's surveillance footage that will confirm I met Verena much earlier than I ever knew Katelyn."

Waldo glanced at the officer taking notes.

With a quick nod, the officer turned to the computer, and soon a video from the surveillance system played on the monitor.

Watching the footage, Waldo saw clear proof: Wendell had met with Verena long before he ever saw Katelyn, and the time gap between those meetings was obvious.

A small frown settled on Waldo's face. He realized that what he was uncovering was not at all what he had expected.

He let out a quiet sigh, rose from his seat, and told Wendell, "Thank you for answering our questions,Professor Branson."

His face stayed unreadable,giving Wendell no clue where he stood. Rising to his feet,Wendell extended his hand and said politely, "Thank you for your efforts, Officer Collins."

Once Wendell had gone, Waldo stepped into the other interrogation room.

When the door opened, Isaac glanced up to see who entered.

Waldo asked, "You must be Mr. Isaac Bennett?"

Seeing the name badge on his chest, Isaac nodded. "Yes, Officer Collins."

As Waldo stepped closer, he noticed Isaac sat in a wheelchair rather than an ordinary chair, and for a brief moment,sympathy flickered in his eyes.

Regaining his composure, Waldo took the seat across from Isaac, preparing to begin the interview, but lsaac spoke first. "Officer, can you tell me what's happened to my wife? Where is she right now?" He had tried to reach Verena several times on the way to the station, each time without success, and worry was etched on his face.

Noticing Isaac's concern, Waldo answered, "There's no need to worry, Mr. Bennett. Mrs. Bennett is in a waiting area. After we finish here, you'll be able to see her."

A bit of tension left Isaac's shoulders after hearing that.

He gave a nod and said, "Of course, Officer Collins. Go ahead with your questions."

Waldo's first question was straightforward. "Are you aware that Katelyn Fuller has been attacked?"

A look of confusion crossed Isaac's face. "When did this happen?"

Waldo answered, "On the morning of December 1st, it was at the second intersection on Wood Street. But the surveillance cameras there had been intentionally destroyed."

Isaac gave a sight shake of his head. "I didn't know about that."

Waldo rested his hands on the table and met Isaac's eyes, and from his look, Isaac didn't appear to be lying.

He paused, and then shifted the conversation. "Mr. Bennett, did your wife ever ask you to arrange surveillance over Wendell's family?"

Isaac squinted slightly, sensing something off in what he had just heard.

He gave his head a small shake and corrected. "It wasn't surveillance. It was protection."

Feigning confusion, Waldo furrowed his brow. "Is that so? What makes you say that?"

With steady composure, Isaac explained, "Katelyn threatened Wendell's family so he would claim she was Evelyn Rowe, just to convince my mother she was the right surgeon. Still, my wife and I refused her offer.Later, my wvife talked to Wendell and confirmed he had been pressured by Katelyn. That's when she asked me to ensure his family was safe."

Waldo listened, deep in thought.

So far, Isaac's, Wendell's, and Verena's stories all lined up. Could Katelyn have orchestrated the entire situation?

Waldo held back from making any conclusions since there was nothing solid to prove Verena had hired hitmen.

After a few seconds of silence, he stood and told Isaac, "Thank you for your help, Mr. Bennett."

Isaac nodded and shook Waldo's hand in return.
###Chapter 151 The Person She Reached For First

The moment lsaac wheeled himself out of the interrogation room, the opposite door to the waiting area swung open.


Their eyes locked instantly, Verena and Isaac holding each other's gaze for a quiet second.



A faint smile curved Verena's lips as she asked, "Were you frightened by it?"



Relief spread through lsaac as he noticed her calm expression, untouched by fear.


He gave a small shake of his head and said, "No, I'm alright."


When the two headed toward the exit, the sight stirred Danica and Bobby, who quickly rose from their seats in the lobby.



Bobby rushed toward them, turning to Waldo with worry written all over his face. "Officer Collins,what about Verena?"



Waldo cast a glance at Danica before he answered Bobby firmly, "There isn't sufficient evidence to tie  Verena to the crime."



That answer made Bobby smack his hands together in triumph. "See? I knew it! Verena would never do such a thing. If you ask me, Katelyn's lost her mind. She's jealous that Isaac chose someone else,so she's trying to pin it all on Verena!"



Danica's initial shock at Waldo's words quickly softened into relief, and her shoulders eased.



Her lips pressed into a thin smile as she turned to Verena. "I'm just glad you're safe."


Not knowing what else to say, she grabbed Bobby's arm and tugged him toward the exit. "Since it's settled,let's go home."


Though Bobby had been eager to talk with Isaac and Verena a little longer, he ended up being dragged away by Danica.


Once they were back at Seraphina Villas, Isaac made his way straight into the study.



Sitting before the tall window, he dialed Stevie's number.



"It's about time!" Stevie teased the moment he picked up. "Are you finally treating me to a good meal?"


A faint smirk crossed Isaac's face as he answered,  "Haven't you already had your fill scamming free dinners off Leonardo and the rest?"



Pretending to be outraged, Stevie exclaimed, "You're too sharp! Leonardo and I just finished eating, and we're heading to the pool hall now. Care to join us?"


Isaac replied, "Go ahead and enjoy yourselves. I won't be tagging along."



A beat of silence passed before he added, "Stevie,I'm calling because I need your help."


Stevie chuckled warmly on the other end. "Come on,with our friendship, you don't even have to ask. Just tell me what you need done."


Gazing out through the glass, Isaac said in a cold voice,"The surveillance on Wood Street was tampered with the morning of December first. You've always been the expert when it comes to this."


Though he left the thought unfinished, Stevie caught on right away. "Say no more. I'll handle it."


A quiet "Thanks" slipped from Isaac's lips.


Once the call ended, he turned his wheelchair and began rolling toward the master bedroom.


Right as he reached the doorway, Verena's laughter carried through. "Ivan, do you have a moment?" The response that followed was smooth and teasing "For you, my sweet Verena, I'll always be free."



The sound of a man's voice made lsaac freeze in place, instinctively lowering the noise of his own movements.


The words "my sweet Verena" made Verena shiver with irritation.



Her tongue clicked against her teeth as she said,"Could you please drop that nickname?"



The man,instead of backing down,leaned into it with playful stubbornness. "Absolutely not. 'MMy sweet Verena' fits perfectly. How could I call you anything else?"



Though her patience wore thin, she eventually broke into a laugh at his shameless persistence.


The caller, Ivan Calderon, was a young man from Akoitha whom Verena had saved in Clokron three years ago. Having grown up without parents, he had come to see her as the older sister he never had.



With striking features and a voice smooth as honey,Ivan exuded effortless charm. His reputation among friends,however, was that of a mischievous flirt who rarely treated life with seriousness. Verena shook her head with a smile. "Enough with the jokes. I need to talk about something important."


Delight spread across Ivan's face as he exclaimed,"Finally, something worthwhile. Ever since you left,I've been drowning in boredom."


She gave a light laugh. "This task will suit you better than anyone else."


Everyone knew lvan's reputation-his talet in hacking was unmatched.


The thought of putting his skills to use filled him with energy. "Perfect! At last, I have something exciting to do!"


Calmly, Verena continued, "What I need is for you to repair the surveillance on a particular street. I'll message you the location."


Ivan let out a confident chuckle. "That's nothing for me. Consider it done, my sweet Verena."


She returned his grin and said, "I'm grateful,lvan."


With a dramatic click of his tongue, Ivan teased,"Grateful? After everything we've been through, those words sound like an insult to the bond we once shared."



His mischief carried through every word, and Verena  couldn't help but laugh openly.



Their conversation drifted for a few more moments before they decided to end the video call.


Once the line went silent, the room felt still, though Isaac hadn't moved from the doorway.



His lashes lowered as unease curled through him. That man had called her "my sweet Verena." What connection did they share? Just how close were they?


Then a memory struck him-Verena had spoken the name Ivan.


Ivan. The initial "I". The same letter inked beneath her collarbone. Could it really mean him?


Isaac's thoughts wouldn't quiet, and the longer he lingered on them, the sharper the ache that pierced his chest.



The armrests of his wheelchair bore the weight of his grip as he swallowed down the bitterness and rolled himself forward into the room.



The sound of movement made Verena glance over her shoulder.



When her eyes landed on Isaac, she knelt in front of him and asked gently, "Were you frightened when the police summoned you so suddenly today?" It was the identical question she had posed to him earlier at the station.



Instead of answering at once, Isaac lowered his gaze,studying her with an intensity that looked almost like he was lost in thought.


Just as she was about to repeat herself, he finally broke the silence and said slowly,"Yes."



Her instinct was to comfort him, but lsaac lifted his hand first, brushing his fingertips across her cheek."Because I was scared something might happen to you,"he admitted.



For a heartbeat, Verena looked startled, and then she smiled softly and pressed her hand over his."You don't have to worry. I'll be fine."


The brightness of her eyes pressed down onhim,and even though they were clear, he found himself unable to read what she truly felt.


Isaac tightened his lips, pretending he hadn't caught the voice of the man she had spoken with on the phone earlier.


He remarked, "There's no need to trouble yourself about this. I've already arranged for someone to repair the surveillance on that street." With a shake of her head, Verena answered in a lighter tone, "That won't be necessary. I've already asked a friend to take care of it."



The word stung Isaac's throat. A friend? What kind of friend used such tender words, especially a man?


He forced down the bitterness long enough and asked,"Can you really trust your friend?"


Assuming Isaac's concern was only about competence,Verena gave a confident nod. "Of course. He's the one I trust most."


The edge of the armrest dug into Isaac's palm as his fingers curled tighter.


It struck him then that he was still not the person she reached for first when trouble arose.


On their wedding day, it had been Miranda. Now,once again,it was someone else.


Though he fought to keep control, the weight inside his chest made his eyes burn red despite his silence.
###Chapter 152 I Really Like You Doing This To Me
Verena started to get up to plug in her phone, but before she could take more than a step, Isaac reached out and caught her wrist.


With a gentle pull, he guided her closer, settling her right in the space between his knees, refusing to let her go.


She opened her mouth to say something, but his arms wrapped around her waist, holding her tight, and he pressed his face softly into her stomach,clinging to her for comfort.


Confused, Verena ran her fingers lightly through his hair. "Is something wrong?"


Being close to her like this was the only way lsaac could convince himself that she truly belonged to him and that no one else had a claim on her.


The warmth of her voice, the slight tremor as she spoke, gave him a peace he found nowhere else,and he pressed his cheek even closer, finding solace in her presence.



The more he dwelled on it, the tighter his grip became. Isaac let his lashes fall, hiding the redness in his eyes."It's nothing. I only wanted to hold you," he murmured softly, his voice carrying a faint hum that betrayed none of the storm inside him.



Believing he was simply exhausted, Verena cupped his soft head and stroked it gently, letting him embrace her however he wished.



A soft buzzing came from her pocket moments later.


Isaac,however, showed no sign of letting go, keeping his head against her and his arms snug around her waist.



Not wanting to disturb himn, Verena let him stay as he was, reaching into her pocket to pull out her phone.After a glance at the screen, she answered, "Gavin,what's going on?"


Gavin's voice came through. "You remember asking me to look for a good plot in Shoildon for the hospital you're planning? I found one. Come by when you're free and take a look."



Even though Gavin was no longer serving as Verena's assistant, she still relied on him out of habit and briefly forgot he no longer held that role.


Gavin, still eager to be of help thanks to all he'd learned from her, had volunteered himself to track  down a suitable site for the hospital.


Surprise flickered in Verena's eyes. "I honestly thought it'd take ages. You really found one this fast?"


Gavin answered with a playful tone, "Of course. You know who mentored me."



Verena let out a soft laugh. "You can't flatter me like that. I don't deserve it."


Some background noise buzzed through the line, but soon faded, making it clear Gavin had stepped away for a quieter spot.


He came back on the line. "The site's picked, so just let me know when you want to see it. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call. I have to get going for now."


Verena gave a small nod."Alright,thank you."


"Don't mention it," Gavin answered her with a warm smile.


The call ended quickly, and Isaac had caught every word.


He looked up at Verena. "So, you're planning to open a hospital?"


Verena didn't try to conceal it and gave a nod. "Since  I've returned from abroad, it's time to bring the medical team here."



Isaac fell silent for a moment, his gaze turning thoughtful. "Building a hospita takes a lot of work.Have you managed to get all the permits? I could have Jacob help you out. If there's anything you need,just let him know."



He watched her with hope in his eyes, wanting to be involved.



Verena smiled despite herself and ran her hand through his hair. "I appreciate it, but there's no need.Gavin has already taken care of everything."


She sounded so cheerful and carefree, her smile shining, but to Isaac it felt like something sharp had just pierced his chest.


He blinked hard, feeling a heat rise behind his eyes,so he pressed his face back against her, hiding any sign of his pain.


A quiet moment passed before he finally nodded,offering a weak smile that faded before it reached his eyes.His words came out strained. "Alright, I get it."


Isaac often resented this part of himself, aware that ever since meeting Verena, his heart had grown more delicate and easily shaken.  Some days,he was certain Verena loved him.



But other days, it felt like she only cared for him,never truly needing him.


The idea that he might be disposable crept in,threatening to unravel all the confidence he had built.


That realization broke through the fragile sense of security he'd built, leaving his heart unsteady and leaving him uncertain about what to do next.


He never wanted Verena to notice these feelings.


He worried that she would tire of having to handle his emotions, or worse, decide she needed to leave altogether.



So Isaac kept it hidden.



Breaking the silence, Verena suggested, "Isaac, let's head to the medical room."



Isaac understood what she meant and loosened his grip on her,answering softly, "Alright."


Inside the medical room, Verena supported Isaac as he eased onto the bed.



She began by gently performing a treatment session on his legs, and then carefully applied her own herbal remedy below his abdomen. While she sat nearby, Verena watched every reaction in his body, making sure nothing went unnoticed.


Once the treatment finished, she made careful notes in her notebook, documenting the results.


A bright smile spread across her face as she turned to him. "Isaac, today's session was just to reinforce the recovery of your sex function. The last treatment for your condition was the final round. Your sex function has made a full recovery." she announced, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Do you know what that means?"



A puzzled look crossed Isaac's face as he tried to understand her words.


Leaning closer, Verena lowered her voice, her gaze fixed on him. "It means you can enjoy a normal sex life now."



That simple truth hit lsaac like a wave, stirring his heart in a way he couldn't hide.


A quiet smile touched his lips as he reached up,his thumb tracing the soft curve of her cheek. "Is that true?"


Maybe he was asking her, or maybe he just needed to hear it out loud.Thinking he might be doubting himself, Verena quickly reassured him. "Absolutely! You're fully recovered.Hmm..."



She didn't get to finish, as Isaac's lips captured hers.


Seeing the longing in his eyes, Verena returned his kiss, her arms slipping around his neck, deepening the connection between them.



That simple gesture sent heat racing through Isaac,lighting him up inside.


With a firm but gentle grip, he pulled Verena onto the bed,drawing her closer.


She lay beside him, cheeks flushed and eyes shining with unshed tears.



Isaac moved in for another kiss, but she stopped him with a soft hand on his cheek.



Confusion flickered across his face, mixed with the slightest hint of disappointment.


Verena's smile turned playful, her voice gentle and sweet. "Isaac,I really like you doing this to me."


Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and her lips curled into a teasing grin.
###Chapter 153 Repeat What You Just Said
Isaac caught the glimmer in Verena's gaze, a trace of longing that stirred something deep inside him.


Only when their closeness erased the distance between them did he feel certain that Verena's affection was genuine.


Yet certainty wasn't enough; what he craved was to be the only one who occupied her heart at every moment.



His thumb brushed against the corner of her lips as he whispered, "Leave out the last four words."


A look of confusion crossed Verena's face. "What are you talking about?"


Leaning closer until the bridge of his nose almost touched hers, Isaac spoke in a low rasp. "Repeat what you just said, but drop the last four words."


The meaning dawned on her then. He wanted to hear the sweetness again, and she didn't mind giving it.Slowly,she enunciated each word. "Isaac, I really like you." As those words echoed in his mind, he wished with all his heart that she would mean them for the rest of their lives.



His hand tilted her chin upward before he pressed his mouth to hers.



Her breath soon grew uneven, and when he noticed,Isaac drew back slightly.


Verena inhaled deeply to steady herself, but he pulled her close once more.



Her body gave no resistance to his closeness.


Her fingers slid into his hair, weaving through the strands with an intimacy that made his pulse race.


When Verena was with someone she cared for, no amount of time ever felt like enough.


The white blouse she wore hung open at the top,several buttons undone, leaving her neck and collarbone exposed.



Isaac's lips traced across her skin, leaving faint marks along her collarbone.


As his lips drifted lower, he paused, his fingers brushing against the small "I" tattoo etched there.


From the very first time he noticed it, he had made a  habit of shutting his eyes during their intimate moments, choosing to pretend it didn't exist.


Confronted with it once more, Isaac realized he could no longer deny the truth staring back at him.


Could the "I" tattooed on her skin really stand for lvan?


His throat constricted as the word slipped out in a low murmur."I."



Gathering the nerve, he fixed his eyes on hers and asked, "Do you honestly love that letter so much?"



Verena's lashes fluttered, her expression softened,and she seemed entirely absorbed in the moment.


She leaned close to his ear and whispered with deliberate weight, "It's the one I cherish most."


Isaac's jaw tightened,his fists curling hard, and then he crushed his mouth against hers with sudden force.


The abruptness drew a startled gasp from Verena,though soon her body responded instinctively to his fervor.



He pressed harder, claiming every breath she tried to take.



The intensity became too much, and Verena pushed against him with a small effort. Her resistance only fueled the storm inside him,jealousy flaring hot, his eyes burning red as his control wavered.



The possessiveness he had tried to cage surged out,and he gripped her as though he could never let her go.


She softened within his arms, tilting her face to place a tender kiss on his chin.


A sudden vibration cut through the air. Buzz... Buzz...


Breath ragged, lsaac raised his head and asked between gasps, "Do you want me to end the call?"


Her chest rose and fell quickly, and she gave a small nod. "Alright."


Even as she reached for the phone, Isaac's arm stayed firm around her waist, his lips brushing against her ear in a lingering touch.



The screen lit up with the caller's name, and Verena hesitated,worried Ivan might be calling for something urgent. Turning to lsaac, she murmured, "Wait a second. I need to answer my friend first."


The name "Ivan" flashing on the screen made Isaac's eyes darken with jealous fury. Without hesitation, he snatched the phone from her hand and powered it off, his expression hard and unyielding.


Verena parted her lips to protest, but Isaac buried his face against her neck and murmured, "You told me to hang up. Once you decide on something,you shouldn't take it back."



Realizing she had contradicted herself, Verena gave a small nod. "Alright, I won't go back on my word."


Isaac's head pressed more firmly against her skin, his hold unrelenting.


Sensing a shift in his mood, Verena slid her hands to his waist, trying to lift him.


His arms closed tightly around her, but his legs remained unmoving.


The effort to roll over seized his body; what was effortless for most felt like scaling a sheer cliff for him.No matter how hard he pushed, his legs refused to obey.



Frustration poured over him in a freezing wave, his cheeks swelling with strain, the veins on his arms standing out like cords. That sense of helplessness wrapped him in suffocating silence, stealing the very air from his lungs. Even in the heat of desire, the simple act of turning exposed every weakness he wished to hide.



Understanding his struggle, Verena moved quickly,flipping him onto his back as though to take control herself, but Isaac stopped her.


"Don't." His lashes fell, and the tremor in his voice betrayed him. "We should wait until my legs recover.I can't stand the thought of you seeing me so powerleSS."


Her heart ached for him, but she knew words would do little to ease the sting of his pride.



Instead, she pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead and whispered with a faint smile, "There's no need to hurry.Once you're healed, we'll have all the time in the world."







At Shoildon Primary Hospital, Katelyn sat upright in bed, a magazine resting across her lap as a nurse carefully checked her injured arm.


A sudden knock on the door drew her attention, and when she looked up, her eyes brightened at the sight of Waldo standing in the doorway.



Once the nurse finished wrapping Katelyn's wound,  Waldo stepped into the room.



Knowing Waldo had summoned Verena to the station after his last visit, Katelyn quickly asked, "Officer Collins,how is my case progressing?"



Waldo's gaze carried weight as he answered evenly,"There's no evidence linking Verena at the moment.The street cameras were sabotaged and remain unrepaired, so the trail of proof has gone cold."



Katelyn's brows knitted together as she murmured,"How could that happen?"



With a stern face and sharp eyes, Waldo responded,"Katelyn, I need answers. According to Wendell Branson, you used threats against his family to force him into lying, making him say you were Evelyn. He has now formally accused you of endangering his safety. Do you admit this?"


At his words, Katelyn lifted her eyebrows slightly.She had already anticipated the police would summon Wendell.



The fact that Wendell wNould betray her secrets didn't surprise her in the least.



She understood that the police didn't actually care about whether she was Evelyn, so she chose not to conceal it. Keeping her composure, she answered,"That's true, I'm not Evelyn. But Officer Collins,  there's no law against pretending. I only asked him to help me build a false identity. Threats were never involved."



Waldo's brow furrowed as his unwavering eyes bored into her. "Then explain why he agreed to cooperate."


A quiet laugh escaped her before she said, "The answer is simple. He took payment. Cash, jewels,treasures from auctions-his pockets were full. If you don't believe me, send your people to search Wendell's home."



Her lips curved faintly in satisfaction as she spoke.


She congratulated herself for planning ahead, bribing Wendell's foolish son and greedy daughter-in-law long before this moment.



After a pause, she released a measured sigh. "Even after I gave him so much, Wendell still chose to betray me. It must be because Verena offered him new incentives. Officer, you need to judge this carefully. Wendell insists I threatened him, but it's Verena's guards standing outside his house. I never stalked him or laid a hand on his family. Don't let yourself be deceived by his lies."


Years of experience had taught Waldo to distinguish lies from truth, yet without solid evidence,his hands were tied. His piercing gaze stayed locked on Katelyn as he warned, "I expect your claim is true-that you haven't endangered anyone. If I discover otherwise, I won't overlook it. And as for the one who plotted the attack against you, we will uncover the truth."


After delivering those words, Waldo turned on his heel and exited the room.


The moment the door clicked shut, Katelyn reached for her phone on the bedside table and dialed a number.


When the call went through, Kaia's eager voice rang out."Katelyn, is there something you need me to do?"


A calm smile touched Katelyn's lips as she answered,"Yes, Kaia, I have something important to tell you."


Curiosity sparked in Kaia's tone. "What is it?"


"I was ambushed," Katelyn replied smoothly, her smile unwavering. "And it was Verena who orchestrated everything."


Kaia's voice shot up in shock. "What! Are you certain it was Verena? Katelyn, just say the word and I'll take revenge for you!"


"No, Kaia. I don't need retaliation.What I need is your help with something only you can manage." Kaia answered without pause, "Then tell me. What should I do?"



"I want you to find a reason to get close to Verena,"Katelyn instructed, her voice firm yet gentle. "Stay under her roof if possible. Watch her carefully and learn who she keeps closest to her."


Her eyes narrowed as she spoke, a flicker of calculation glinting beneath her calm exterior.


Verena, it seemed, was proving to be a far more formidable opponent than Katelyn had imagined.


Deep down, Katelyn suspected Verena carried a secret she was desperate to keep hidden.
###Chapter 154 Visiting Verena
Kaia no longer shrank away from seeing Verena.Revenge remained her driving force, and disguise was a role she wore with ease.



With a tone full of confidence, she assured Katelyn,"When I apologized before, Verena forgave me without hesitation. Don't worry, Katelyn. A small trick is enough to make her soften again."


Though Katelyn had little faith in Kaia's cleverness, she knew Kaia was still the most suitable person to approach Verena.



Pressing her lips together, Katelyn answered, "I'll wait for your success."


After ending the call, Kaia stepped out of her room.


In the living room, Laura was watching television when footsteps echoed from the staircase.


When she glanced up and spotted Kaia with a handbag in hand, she asked with curiosity, "Kaia, are you going out to meet some friends?"



The trauma of Kaia's disappearance had left Laura wary;now she made a habit of checking in whenever her daughter planned to leave.



From her spot near the staircase, Kaia glanced at Alec,who sat behind his newspaper, seemingly lost in the day's headlines. She hadn't forgotten how much Alec valued Verena's status. His satisfaction had been clear when Kaia suggested mending fences with Verena.



With a bright tone and a practiced smile, Kaia called out, "Mom, I'm not seeing friends tonight. I'm going to Verena's, and I might stay over a few days."



Laura paused in surprise, trying to figure out when Kaia had grown so familiar with that problematic Verena.After thinking it over, though, she decided it might actually be a good thing. No matter what happened,Verena's status couldn't be ignored, and keeping closer ties with her could only work in their favor.


Deciding to support the idea, Laura returned the smile."That's nice. You girls deserve a chance to catch up as sisters."



"Wait, you're spending a few days with Verena?" Alec put aside his newspaper and stood up, his face showing mild surprise.



Kaia caught the faint surprise in his eyes, yet she could tell he approved of what she was going to do.



She nodded quickly and said, "Yes. Verena has been back for a while, but I hardly ever got to spend time  alone with her. I know I hurt her a lot in the past,and now that she's finally forgiven me, I want to make it right. Just like Mom said, it's time for us to catch up as sisters."



Alec's smile softened as if a weight had lifted. "I'm glad you're thinking like that. You and Verena share the same blood. No fight can ever erase that bond.If you stand by each other, then when trouble comes,neither of you will face it alone."



Rarely did Alec show this kind of warmth.For once,he looked like a genuine father, gently guiding his daughter toward love and loyalty.



Kaia,however,understood the real reason behind his smile. He longed to reach out to Verena himself, yet pride kept him from doing it, so he counted on herto bridge the gap.


Still, she kept that thought to herself. Instead, she gave a polite nod and said, "I understand, Dad.I've always remembered what you've told me."


After a short pause, she brightened her smile. "Dad,Mom, I'll be out tonight, so don't worry about making dinner for me."



Her determination sharpened as she thought of the task Katelyn had entrusted to her.


Just as she moved toward the door, Alec called out, "Kaia..."



The ongoing troubles with the club had left him cornered, unsure of how to move forward. However,Kaia's plan to visit Verena and stay for a few days hinted at a shift in their relationship. Should Kaia succeed in gaining Verena's support or speaking favorably for Willis Group, the balance of the situation with the club could finally lean in their favor.



But Alec's pride stood in the way, making it impossible for him to ask his daughter outright for help.


As his daughter,Kaia could read his thoughts with ease.


She offered a gentle smile and said, "Dad, I'm your daughter, and I'm part of the Willis family. I've always thought about what's best for us. I know the club troubles are weighing on you, but trust me. I'll do my best to talk to Verena and ask her to ease up on Willis Group."


Even without speaking their full minds, both believed they understood exactly what the other wanted.



Kaia left the Willis Villa and set off toward Verena's home.







When Rhonda informed her of Kaia's arrival, Verena's mouth curved into a sly smile. The last visit had been  full of tearful apologies and begging for forgiveness.This time, she wondered what sort of trick Kaia had prepared.



Verena pushed her papers aside, slipped into a coat,and headed down the stairs.



By the time she reached the bottom step, Kaia was already inside, tugging a silver suitcase across the floor.



Kaia looked up, her face breaking into a bright smile."Verena!" she caled out warmly.



The sweet tone sent a shiver down Verena's back.Pulling her coat a little tighter, she forced a casual smile and asked, "What's with the big suitcase?"


Kaia strolled over and slipped her arm through Verena's. "We've got a short holiday break," she said cheerfully. "My school club is holding aget-together near here, so I thought I'd stay with you for a few days.And I figured you might be lonely, rattling around this house by yourself, so I came to keep you company.You don't mind, do you?"


Her voice rang wit sugar, the kind that made her sound like an innocent little sister doting on her elder.



Inside, Verena scoffed. The whole point of that school club event was to build friendship,yet Kaia had shown up here. There was no doubt she had another  agenda.



Verena didn't buy for a second that Kaia came just to ease her loneliness.



A thought struck her, and her gaze sharpened.If Kaia's earlier vanishing act had anything to do with Katelyn,then this visit reeked of Katelyn's orders. The reason was plain enough-Kaia had been sent to spy on her.And if that was the game, Verena decided she would make sure there was more than enough for Kaia to report back.



Thinking that,Verena let her lips curl into a faint smile.She looked at Kaia and gave a small nod. "Of course.Stay as long as you want."



Kaia hid her smirk, mocking silently how quickly Verena had swallowed the act. She had expected it to take more work.



Kaia steadied her tone, put on a sweet smile,and said,"You really are the best, Verena."


Verena slipped her arm free and said calmly, "Rhonda,take Kaia's bag upstairs and prepare a room for her."



Rhonda gave a quick nod before hauling the suitcase up the stairs.



A ringtone chimed from Verena's coat pocket. Verena checked the screen, and Kaia angled her head as though she might catch a glimpse. A second later,Verena locked the phone screen.



Kaia quickly looked away, acting as if she hadn't noticed at all.



Even so, Verena caught the little move.



She gave a faint smile and remarked, "I need to return this call upstairs. Make yourself comfortable here."


Kaia nodded like an obedient child. "Okay," she said softly.


Verena walked into her study with the phone and dialed Ivan's number.


Ivan picked up right away, his voice full of mock drama. "My darling Verena, you really ignored me.I'm crushed."



Verena laughed, recognizing his teasing. "I couldn't answer earlier. Someone was around, and it wasn't the right time."



She changed the subject and asked, "Were you able to take care of what I asked you to do?"


Ivan answered with smug pride, "Of course I did. It was child's play. I've already sent the restored video to  your email."



Verena smiled with satisfaction. "Perfect. Thanks for that. I'll look at it right now."



After hanging up, she grabbed her mouse and pulled up her inbox.


The footage slowed, and a gray car appeared on the screen. Out of nowhere, a black car swerved in front,cutting it off.


The black car rammed the gray one, forcing it into a sharp U-turn. But the moment it turned around,several other cars moved in from behind, closing the trap.



As the video neared its end, a man dressed in black stepped out of one of the cars. His build and features didn't look like anyone from Akoitha or the nearby regions.



Verena froze the screen when something caught her eye and zoomed in closer.


A dark blue tattoo stretched across his right arm, its design unfamiliar.



She snapped a screenshot and forwarded it straight to her detective friend, Samuel Perez.


Her hands flew over the keyboard. "Samuel, I've hit a  problem. Can you dig into this tattoo and tell me what it represents? Thanks."



His response arrived almost instantly. "Leave it to me."

###Chapter 155 Bitter Feud Between Two Brothers
Kaia sat downstairs in Verena and Isaac's marital home,suspicion stirring inside her. What kind of call required so much privacy that Verena had to retreat to her room to answer it?



She was set on uncovering whatever hidden truth Verena was trying so hard to keep quiet.


With her curiosity getting the better of her,Kaia crept up the stairs, quietly trailing Verena to the second floor.



The moment the study door closed, Kaia pressed her ear close, hoping to pick up something,anything. To her annoyance, not a single sound made it through the thick door.



Kaia furrowed her brow, surprised at how well the door blocked out noise.


She leaned in, pressing her ear closer to the door,hoping to catch even the faintest sound.



Right as she did, the door swung open from the inside.


Verena stood there,her lips lifting in a sly, mysterious  smile. "Were you just trying to listen in on my call,Kaia?"



Kaia froze mnid-turn, but quickly smoothed her features and returned Verena's smile. "You've got the wrong idea, Verena. I just wanted to talk to you, but when I got here and realized you were on the phone,I figured it was better to wait downstairs until you finished."



Verena's eyes lingered on Kaia, the corners of her mouth hinting at amusement. It seemed Kaia's ability to make up stories had improved, if only slightly.


Playing along, Verena nodded. "Alright. Go ahead.What did you want to say?"



Unbothered,Kaia replied, "Dad knows I came here today,and he asked me to check in about the club issue."



She hesitated briefly before going on. "Verena,we're both Dad's daughters, and with everything happening at home, we should be helping each other,right?Could you talk to lsaac and ask him not to give Dad a hard time?"



Kaia adopted the perfect image of a dutiful daughter,though her real feelings were far from caring.



In truth, she half hoped Alec would stay in trouble longer, since she had always hated his double  standards.



Alec only saw her as a pawn, so she felt no need to bend over backward for him.



Verena had no doubt that Alec would send Kaia to negotiate.


With a smnirk, Verena replied, "That's a decision I can make myself."


Kaia blinked, momentarily caught off guard. She hadn't expected Verena to offer Alec any help.Wasn't Verena supposed to be too spiteful to lend a hand?



Kaia started to say more, but Verena's voice turned slow and cool. "But I don't owe him anything. After what he did to me, he can't expect any favors. I've never been known for mercy. If someone chooses to go against me, they'll soon regret it."


Back when Laura and Kaia forced her out of Willis Villa,Alec never spoke up for her.


When Kaia spread lies about her, Alec stayed silent.


On her wedding day, when Kaia slandered her, Alec offered no defense.



Alec now wanted her to set aside all the pain he had caused, act as though none of it ever happened, and  still defend him.



Why should she even consider it?



Every word Verena spoke carried a message meant for both Alec and Kaia.



Kaia took a moment to process the meaning behind those words, and then forced a stiff smile. "Alright, I'lL let Dad know what you said."



Just as Verena was about to shut her door, another thought crossed her mind. She paused and, with a voice both cautioning and instructive, said, "One more thing. I don't want anyone waitingoutside my room while I'm working.If you need me, wait until I come out. And if you're bored, you can always catch a movie on the third floor."



With that, Verena shut the door firmly behind her.


Anger tightened Kaia's features as she glared at the closed door.


A cold snort escaped her, and she muttered, "Who do you think you are? Just wait, your downfall is coming."



...


Known for his knack for digging up secrets, Samuel got back to Verena in less than five hours. The first thing he said was, "Evelyn, the man backing the tattooed guy isn't an ordinary person."


Looking confused, Verena asked, "Who could it be?"



He responded with a question, "Do you know about Smoothdeed Group?"



Verena paused to think before replying, "It's one of the top players in both domestic and international finance.The founder,Maxton Fairclough,built it from the ground up and made quite a name for himself with several remarkable achievements."



After a brief pause, she asked, "Is this connected to him somehow?"



Samuel replied, "No, not Maxton. It's his younger son,Erick Fairclough."



Verena was familiar with the founder's legendary reputation, but knew little about the rest of the family.


"Erick Fairclough," she repeated, her eyebrow arching in confusion. "I don't know him at all. Why would someone like that want me dead?"


Samuel had gathered plenty of details and explained,"Earlier this year, Maxton suddenly fell into a coma.When he finally regained consciousness, he was gravely ill, and no doctor could determine what was  wrong. His condition quickly deteriorated after that,leaving him bedridden and almost in a vegetative state.He has two sons and several daughters. Under normal circumstances, given his health, he should be preparing a will. His elder son, Tobin Flairclough, has always been the child he favors, and many believe there's a strong chance the company would have been passed down to Tobin. In other words, if Maxton had recovered and written a will, Erick likely wouldn't have received much, certainly not as much as Tobin.However,their father slipped into a coma before he had the chance to draft a will, and without one, the inheritance would automatically be split among all his children. That's why Tobin immediately began searching everywhere for a skilled doctor to save their father, but no one was able to help him. Even more strangely, a few of those doctors died under mysterious circumstances on their way to treat him."


Samuel paused, and then continued, "My research points to Erick being behind those deaths. He didn't want his father waking up. If Tobin tried to bring you in for treatment, Erick would have found out and decided to target you, just as he did the others. Right now, you're the doctor most likely to succeed in helping their father."



Hearing this,Verena's eyes darkened thoughtfully. "So it's a bitter feud between two brothers over the family fortune." Over the line, Samuel cautioned, "Erick is relentless.He never lets loose ends remain. Don't take him head -on."



Verena answered with a cool, steady voice, "I'l stay cautious. For now, my identity is still under wraps.That should keep me safe."


He agreed, "I'll forward all the detailed information to your email. I won't keep you any longer."


Verena thanked him. "Thank you,Samuel."



After their call ended, Verena spent a moment in thought, and then called Julianna.


Julianna answered and asked, "Evelyn, do you need something?"


Verena got right to the point. "Julianna, can you check if Tobin Fairclough ever reached out for my help while you were running the hospital over the past six months?"



Tobin Fairclough was the older sonin question.


Julianna paused. "Give mea second, I'll look into it."


After a brief pause, Julianna's voice came through the receiver. "Yes, Evelyn. He reached out to you earlier this year, but since you were busy then, I turned him down politely on your behalf."



Verena responded, "Give me his contact information."


Julianna replied, "Of course."



The moment their conversation ended, a new message from Julianna popped up on Verena's phone,displaying Tobin's number.
###Chapter 156 | Just Want To Make A Deal With You
Verena saved the phone number, pausing as she stared at the string of digits, a sly little smile tugging at her lips.



The Faircloughs held considerable power overseas,and Verena was well aware she couldn't see the full extent of the forces supporting Erick from the shadows.Confronting Erick head-on seemed reckless;instead, she decided to use the leverage of his older brother, Tobin, to keep Erick's influence in check.


With her plan in place, Verena pressed the call button.


Meanwhile, across the ocean, Smoothdeed Group's senior management gathered deep into a business meeting.



Just outside those doors, Tobin's assistant noticed an incoming call from overseas.


The number flashed on a device reserved only for Tobin's closest associates and family. Not wanting to keep the caller waiting, the assistant answered immediately.



The assistant put on his best professional tone and  said, "You've reached Tobin Fairclough, General Manager of Smoothdeed Group. May I know who's calling?"



Verena's brows knitted together at the sound of the young man's voice. Samuel's intel described Tobin as a seasoned executive, and this didn't match what she expected.



She asked directly, "And you are?"



The assistant responded without missing a beat,"This is Javier Rogers, Mr. Fairclough's assistant."


That answer seemed to satisfy her,at least for now."Alright, Mr. Rogers. I need to speak with Mr.Fairclough directly. Can you put me through?"


Javier kept his tone courteous as he explained, "I'm afraid Mr. Fairclough is in a meeting at the moment.If there's anything you'd like to pass along, I'll be sure he gets the message."



Choosing not to introduce herself right away, Verena remained vigilant. Despite speaking to Tobin's assistant, she couldn't shake the suspicion that Erick might have planted someone close enough to overhear every word.



Keeping things vague, she replied, "You can let Mr.Fairclough know that Willis returned his call.He's tried to reach me several times, and I finally had a moment to get back to him. Please let him know after his meeting."



Javier responded with polite assurance, "Understood.I'll make sure MMr. Fairclough gets the message."



Moments later, the door to the conference room swung open.


Tobin stepped out, and Javier hurried over to mneet him."Sir, you just got a private call. The person on the line said it was urgent..."



Without waiting for the rest, Tobin stopped him with a terse gesture, his expression dark. "Save it for later.There's something I need to handle right now."


The sudden interruption in the meeting had been caused by unsettling news from Tobin's secretary that his father had suffered a sudden medical emergency and had briefly lost his vital signs. The shock had left Tobin no choice but to abandon the meeting on the spot.



Noticing how anxious Tobin was, Javier thought better of pressing further and simply kept pace behind him.



After Maxton's collapse, Tobin had arranged for a private medical facility inside the family estate,ensuring his father would always be within reach of professional care. By the time Tobin reached the estate, the family's live -in doctor greeted him with an update. Only five minutes earlier, Maxton's condition had stabilized, and his vital signs were back to normal.



Relief washed over Tobin as soon as he heard the news.


Despite wanting to stay longer, Tobin knew the company needed his attention. He offered a few gentle words to the unconscious Maxton before leaving for the company.


On the drive back to the office, Tobin sank into the car seat and shut his eyes as he replayed the day's events and the tasks waiting for him. Then Javier's words about an important call sprang into his mind.


He opened his eyes and asked, "You mentioned an important call earlier. Who was trying to reach me?"



Javier handed him the phone, glancing toward the back seat. "The caller introduced herself as Willis, and she sounded like a young woman."


Taking the device, Tobin watched in silence as Javier quietly raised the privacy partition in the car.



A slight crease formed on Tobin's brow. A young woman,calling his private line? He studied the unfamiliar number in the call log,unable to remember ever speaking with anyone fitting that description. Still, considering the exclusivity of his private number, he suspected it could be a matter worth his attention.



A brief pause lingered before Tobin finally made up his mind and dialed the number back.


The call went through, but he kept quiet, choosing not to say a word at first.


Breaking the silence, Verena spoke up. "Is this Mr.Tobin Fairclough?"


The unfamiliar sound of a woman's voice made Tobin bristle wwith suspicion. "Who is this?" he demanded, his tone tight.


A subtle smile touched Verena's lips when she picked up on his hesitation.


Without hesitation, she answered, "I'm Evelyn Rowe.Half a year ago, you contacted my assistant about helpoing your father."



Tobin's entire expression changed at the mention of Evelyn. Surprise and anticipation rushed into his voice."Wait, are you really Evelyn?"



Verena confirmed it with a calm, steady tone. "Back  then, my assistant was busy handling everything because | was caught up in other obligations. I couldn't respond personally, so my assistant turned you down on my behalf. Now that things have settled on my end, I wanted to reach out myself."



Hearing that, Tobin's urgency became obvious. "So you're saying you'll take my father's case now?Whatever you ask for, it's yours. As long as you can help my father recover, I'll make it happen."


While Tobin pleaded, Verena looked outside her window, her gaze cool, a sly smile flickering across her face.



She replied, "There's nothing I want for myself. I just want to make a deal with you."


Tobin hesitated, clearly surprised.′′Adeal?"


A hint of intrigue colored Verena's voice as she continued, "I'll forward you a document. Everything you need to know will be there."


Seconds later, a message arrived on Tobin's phone with the promised document attached.



As Tobin tapped on the file, a video began to play: a fleet of black vehicles boxed in a lone gray car. He immediately recognized the tattoo on one of the men -Erick's subordinate, unmistakable even from this angle. The call remained open, and Verena broke the silence."Your brother's men were actually after me.Unfortunately, someone else got caught in the crossfire."



Rage flushed across Tobin's face; his grip on the phone tightened until his knuckles stood out,veins pronounced.


Barely containing his fury, he snapped, "I knew he'd do anything for money, but I never thought he'd go this far! He actually tried to have our father killed!"



Clearly uninterested in family drama, Verena kept her tone cool. "Tell me, Mr. Fairclough, did you never think it odd that every doctor you called was either in a plane crash or a mysterious accident the very next day? Isn't that a little too much of a coincidence?"



Tobin's pulse pounded at his temples as the realization hit him, the color risng in his face.


Verena added, "So here's what I want: I'll treat your father, but only if you remove the danger hanging over my head."



Turning to the window, Tobin's eyes hardened, his voice cold. "You have my word. If you save my father,I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. No one will dare threaten you again, not while I'm here." A faint, knowing smile touched Verena's lips. "Then let's hope this partnership works out for us both,Mr.Fairclough."
###Chapter 157 A Trip Abroad
Once Evelyn's identity was confirmed, Tobin didn't waste a second and asked what mattered most."Evelyn, is there any way you could come soon to start my father's treatment? His condition has gotten worse, and we're running out of time."



Rather than answering right away, Verena took a moment to think. "Mr. Fairclough, could you send me your father's previous medical records first? I'll look them over and then decide."



Quick to respond, Tobin said, "I'll send everything right now."


No sooner had the call ended than Tobin's email arrived in Verena's inbox.



Returning to her desk, she opened the new message.



Verena studied Maxton's medical records with care,weighing every detail before reaching a firm conclusion. Confidence settled over her as she became convinced that the surgery stood a strong chance of success.



Lately, she had spent countless hours immersed in surgical experiments, and by now, wielding a scalpel came to her as naturally as breathing.



Certain that she could take on the case, Verena picked up the phone and called Tobin back.



As soon as the line connected, she spoke. "Mr.Fairclough, I've reviewed all the records. I'm almost completely sure I can help your father. I'm still in Akoitha, though, so I'll need to leave tomorrow morning."



Tobin could hardly contain himself. The moment he heard her words, he leapt from his chair. "That's wonderful news! I'll get my assistant to book your ticket right away."


Anyone could see how much this meant to him. His gratitude nearly spilled over.


How could he not feel overjoyed? He had spent so much time seeking out countless renowned doctors,yet none had shown absolute confidence in treating his father's illness, and a few had even met with unfortunate accidents on their way to the Fairclough family residence.



Hearing confidence from a physician at last brought immense relief.



If another doctor had said as much, Tobin might not have believed it. But coming from Evelyn,he trusted every word. With a faint smile, Verena said, "But here's the problem.Your brother has managed to sabotage every doctor you've brought in for your father. That means he's got someone close to you,keeping tabs. If we want to keep things safe, we'll need to get creative."



For a long time, Tobin had guessed that Erick planted a spy in his inner circle, though he'd never found proof. He frowned. "So what should we do?"


Verena's eyes narrowed as she came up with a plan."You need to spread a rumor-say that your girlfriend from Akoitha is flying in to visit. Let the word slip through your friends. That'll make your brother relax and keep my arrival off his radar."


Tobin's reputation meant he wasn't exactly a stranger to attention from women, especially since his wife's passing, and no one would be surprised by the news.


After thinking it over, Tobin nodded. "Alright, let's go with that. Once my assistant has your flight sorted, I'll have the details sent straight to you. I'll also get someone to help spread the rumor."


A soft smile crossed Verena's face. "I'll count on you for both, Mr. Fairclough."


Later that night, Isaac returned home after a long day at work. He took the elevator upstairs, and when he entered the bedroom, his eyes landed on a packed suitcase by the bed.



Surprise flickered across his face just as Verena stepped out of the closet with a stack of clothes in her arms.



When she spotted him, she greeted him with a smile."You're home."



Isaac's brow creased as he glanced from the suitcase to her. "Where are you headed?"



Verena carefully folded the clothes and tucked them into the suitcase, and then sat down on the sofa across from him. "Isaac, I have something important to take care of overseas. I'll probably be gone about a week."



Hearing her mention a trip abroad made Isaac's heart lurch.



If he remembered right, Verena's first great love was living abroad.



A troubling thought hit Isaac-was it possible that man from her past had contacted her?



Worry came through in his voice as he asked her several questions. "Why do you need to go abroad? Is there someone waiting for you? Can I come along?"



He didn't try to hide his anxiety, every question tumbling out one after the other.



Verena paused, weighing the situation. Taking Isaac along would be impossible if she was pretending to be Tobin's girlfriend, soshe shook her head. "I'm sorry,Isaac. I'll have to handle this one alone."



She thought for a moment about how much attention the Fairclough family attracted. Anything that happened would likely get noticed by the press,even overseas.



Worried that foreign media could expose the news about Tobin's girlfriend, she considered the risks carefully. While domestic attention on overseas reports was usually low, she knew people in the same business circles would certainly notice, and there was no guarantee that Isaac wouldn't hear about it.


So,rather than keep him in the dark, Verena decided to be honest. "Isaac, I'm going to meet someone important, but I can't go as myself. I'll be using a different identity for this trip. Ifany strange news pops up, don't believe a word of it, and please don't jump to conclusions. Will you promise me that?"


For a moment, Isaac simply watched her, his eyes clouded with too many emotions to name. He finally nodded, his voice low. "I promise. Just be careful."



No matter what he said, Isaac couldn't quiet the fear that she'd see her old flame-the one she could never seem to forget.



First loves had a way of haunting people, and that thought lingered as he remembered the small letter tattoo beneath Verena's collarbone.



She'd once called it the one she cherished most, and the memory only made his heart ache more.



Letting go of something that important wasn't easy,not for anyone.


Restless thoughts chased him through the night,keeping sleep out of reach.



Around seven, Verena was up and getting ready.


When she stepped out of the bathroom,she saw Isaac propped up against the headboard.


She crossed the room and settled next to himn,her bare feet making no sound. "Did I wake you?" she asked quietly.



He reached out, wrapped her in his arms, and traced gentle lines along her hair. "I never really got to sleep,"  he said softly.


Verena's mouth curled into a playful grin. "Let me guess-you're too miserable without me to rest, is that it?"



This time, Isaac didn't dodge her teasing. He looked her in the eye, all seriousness. "If I said yes, would you let me come with you?"



The question took her off guard for a second, and then she leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. "Not this time. I really do have to go alone.Please just stay here and wait for me to come back,alright?"


Then a thought struck her, and she quickly added, "Oh,by the way/, I was so caught up with packing last night that I forgot to mention it. Kaia is staying at our house now. I have a feeling Katelyn sent her, so make sure Rhonda keeps an eye on her."



A hint of irritation crossed Isaac's face. "Why not just tell her to leave?"



Verena let out a light laugh. "Pushing her out wouldn't solve anything. I'd rather keep her close and figure out what she's really after."


Seeing the time, she knew she had to hurry. She stood up and grabbed her suitcase. "I should get going or I'll miss my flight. Take care, okay?" She was heading toward the door before Isaac could say a word.



He reminded himself there was work waiting and pushed his worries aside, making himself rest for a couple more hours.



When he opened his eyes again, Jacob was already waiting in the hallway. Isaac let him help into the wheelchair, got ready for the day, and headed downstairs by elevator.
###Chapter 158 Girlfriend



Kaia had already taken her seat at the dining table by the time Isaac made his way downstairs.



Her eyes flicked past him, searching for Verena, but she only found Isaac and the house staff.


She put on her sweetest smile. "Isaac,is my sister still asleep?"


Isaac guided his wheelchair toward the table, refusing to look her way or acknowledge her question, as though she wasn't even there.



Tryinng to hide her discomfort, Kaia forced her lips into another smile and turned her attention to Rhonda."Rhonda, are you not going to call my sister for breakfast?"



Rhonda came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of toast. "Mrs. Bennett left early this morning. She took her suitcase with her," she answered.



The news caught Kaia off guard. She pressed for more."She left? Did she say anything about where she was headed?"



Rhonda gave a small shake of her head. "She didn't  tell us."



Katelyn had specifically told Kaia to keep tabs on Verena,yet somehow Verena had managed to leave right under her nose.



Frustration rose up, and Kaia's voice lost its friendly edge. "You didn't even think to ask her where she was going?"



Rhonda froze for a moment at her sudden outburst,silently thinking that this young ladyfrom the Willis family was stepping far over the line;even Verena herself would never treat her this way.



Still,since Kaia was Verena's sister, Rhonda kept her composure and answered respectfully, "It isn't our place to question Mrs. Bennett's affairs."



Still not satisfied, Kaia tried again. "But you must have some idea,right?"



A hesitant look crossed Rhonda's face. "Honestly, I have no clue..."



Isaac, growing irritated by Kaia's persistent questions,shot her a sharp look and spoke in a firm voice."Kaia,your sister agreed to let you stay as a guest, not as a spy. You should learn your place. Keep crossing the line and I won't be so polite."



The sharpness of his words made Kaia stiffen. Admiration for lsaac's background and looks had faded as she had realized what truly counted was something else entirely.



To Kaia, Isaac, with his disability, now seemed like any other man-powerful but far from perfect, hardly deserving of her admiration.


Still,his reputation made her think twice about pushing her luck. Only now did she realize how reckless she'd just been.



The warning stung, but Kaia managed to keep her tone pleasant. "Isaac, you're reading too much into it.I'm just worried about my sister, that's all."


Without glancing her way, Isaac returned his attention to breakfast, quietly eating without another word.


His silence cut deeper than any argument, but Kaia remembered what her impatience had cost her before,and forced herself to swallow her irritation.



She finished her meal without bringing up Verena again.


Once Isaac left for work, Kaia hurried upstairs and reached for her phone, dialing Katelyn in a rush.


The call barely connected before Katelyn's voice came through. "What's going on over there?" Kaia wasted no time. "Verena left this morning,suitcase in hand. Nobody knows where she went."



She hesitated, suspicion creeping into her tone."Katelyn, do you think Verena's planning something?"



Left with a suitcase this early?



Katelyn's frown deepened as she mulled it over, her expression shifting as she pieced things together.


She muttered to herself, "Leaving with luggage probably means she's traveling-and it can't be for something minor."


As the realization struck, a sly smile played on her lips.


If Verena was off on a trip now, maybe she and Isaac had a falling out.



Ever since they'd first met, Katelyn believed V/erena was a poor match for lsaac.



This might finally be the moment their marriage hit a rough patch.



If that were the case, getting close to lsaac would be much simpler.



Even so, Katelyn stayed cautious. Reining in her excitement, she kept her instructions clear. "Just stay where you are and pay attention to lsaac. Wait until tomorrow to see if Verena comes back, and then report to me. And Kaia-don't do anything unless I say so."



After losing to Verena several times, Kaia now thought twice before acting out again. Years of admiration for Evelyn meant she followed her instructions to the letter now.



She nodded several times, eager to please. "Don't worry,K<atelyn. I'll do exactly as you say."







While flying, Verena managed to catch a little sleep.As soon as the plane touched down, she turned off airplane mode on her phone.



A message pinged almost instantly-it was from Isaac,sent just a couple of minutes earlier. "Did you land yet?"


A small smile spread across Verena's lips as she tapped out a reply. "Just got here."



Right after she sent her response, the noise of camera shutters and people talking reached her ears.


She glanced up to see a tall, broad-shouldered man making his way through the crowd. Although his hair was streaked with gray at the temples, there was no denying his good looks and presence. Thanks to the photo Samuel had sent, Verena recognized Tobin immediately. She slipped her phone into her bag,raised her hand, and called out, "Tobin,over here!"



Tobin had never met her face to face, but before boarding, she'd told him she'd call out to him once she landed.



He stopped in his tracks when he heard his name,surprised to find a young woman waving at him.



Even with sunglasses and a mask, her poise and the shape of her figure made it clear she was young and attractive.



So this was the elusive, much-taked-about Legendary Surgeon-a woman, and a striking one at that.



Tobin could hardly believe it, but he kept hisreaction hidden.



He put on a warm smile, stepped over, and slipped an arm around Verena's shoulders. "Sweetheart, I've been waiting for you forever."



The sound of cameras intensified as reporters pressed closer.


One shouted above the noise, "Mr. Fairclough, is this your girlfriend from Akoitha?"



Someone else piped up with another question. "Mr.Fairclough, your wife passed away three years ago.This is the first time you've gone public with a girlfriend. Are you worried about how your children will take it, or do you see yourself making this official?"



Instead of answering, Tobin shot a quick look at his assistant.



Javier picked up the cue, stepping forward to address the press. "I'm sorry, but we can't answer those questions right now. Thanks for understanding."


With no further response, the reporters had to settle for snapping more photos, hoping to catch something newsworthy.



They trailed Tobin and Verena all the way to the car before finally giving up.



Settling into her seat, Verena looked out at the crowd still snapping pictures and turned to Tobin. "You really know how to handle the press. That's some serious business skill."



Tobin watched the cameras for a moment before focusing on her. "Word's already reached Erick. He's waiting at the house for a spectacle. Aren't you the least bit concerned all this attention could blow your cover?" Meeting his gaze, Verena gave a confident smirk. "I'm not the type to take risks unless I know the outcome.By the time your brother figures things out, your father will be out of danger."



The pride in her voice fit her perfectly, adding to her presence.



Tobin couldn't help staring, and Verena caught him.She shot him a sideways glance and teased, "Didn't anyone ever teach you it's rude to stare?"


With a small, amused grin, Tobin finally looked away."I just didn't expect Evelyn to be so young."



Verena just smiled, letting the compliment hang in the air. "Hard to explain over the phone, isn't it? So, tell me more about your father. Anything strange happen recently?"



His initial surprise faded as Tobin explained his father's sudden collapse and what followed.



They talked as the driver pulled up to the Fairclough family's garage.



Getting out, Verena noticed the prying eyes watching them and slipped her arm into Tobin's, playing up the image.



Anyone looking on would think they were truly a  couple.



The Fairclough home looked like something from a storybook-a grand house nestled against green woods and overlooking wide, rolling meadows. The place radiated calm and quiet beauty.


As Verena stepped inside with Tobin, she found herself in a grand dining room where a man in his thirties sat at the end of a long table.



His dark suit was perfectly pressed, sharp features set in a constant scowl, and the way his narrowed eyes sized up the room gave him a menacing edge.



Erick watched their approach, drawing out his words as he spoke. "So this is the woman who's caught my brother's eye. I get it now-she's definitely easier on the eyes than those girls he used to date."



Verena had already taken off her sunglasses and mask.



Tobin's brow furrowed at the sound of his crude and disrespectful words, and he gave a stern warning "Erick, mind the way you speak."



But Erick wasn't finished poking at him. He let out a mocking laugh. "What, getting protective already?You must be falling hard,Tobin."



Tobin didn't take the bait. He simply said to Verena,"This is my younger brother, Erick." Verena greeted Erick with a soft smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fairclough. I'm Verena Willis."


Erick only offered a brief, dismissive look and stayed silent.



Guiding Verena to a seat beside him, Tobin turned gentle. "That flight must have worn you out. Let's get you something to eat first," he said before asking the staff to bring out food.



While thestaff moved around them, Erick couldn't keep his eyes off Verena, a flicker of suspicion in his gaze.


He broke the silence. "I've got a question for you,Miss Willis."


She glanced up, meeting his stare. "Go ahead."



He searched her face. "My brother hasn't even set foot in Akoitha this year. When exactly did you two cross paths?"



Unfazed, Verena let a teasing note slip into her answer. "Who says you have to meet face-to-face to get close these days? There's the internet for that.Tobin and I met online, and after talking for months,we just clicked. It felt right, so here we are."



Her eyes sparkled with the excitement of telling the story,cheeks pink like a girl caught up in her first romance. "You wouldn't believe how he started chatting with me. The real surprise? I had no idea he was the influential Fairclough family's eldest son. If I'd known, I'd never have had the nerve to answer his first message."



Erick watched her act the part of someone totally out of place in an upscale home, and any suspicion he had started to fade.



To him, Verena seemed like nothing more than a pretty distraction for his brother-someone harmless,maybe even a little naive. He figured he'd been too quick to doubt her.



A smirk tugged at his lips. "Spare me the romance stories. I'm not interested in hearing about you and Tobin."



Once the meal ended, Tobin turned to Verena. "Let's go see my father," he suggested.


Erick assumed his brother just wanted to bring a woman to comfort their ailing dad. He didn't think much of it and let them go.



While they strolled through the hallway toward the back of the estate, Erick's assistant leaned in close and spoke in a low voice. "Would you like me to have someone keep an eye on them?" Erick didn't take his eyes off the pair as Verena clung to Tobin's arm, pausing here and there to take in the grand paintings or marvel at the fine porcelain.


In his mind, she fit the role of an outsider dazzled by wealth and luxury.


He gave a soft, dismissive laugh, a trace of sarcasm in his eyes. "She's just a pretty face. Not worth the trouble."



Hearing that, the assistant stepped back and dropped the subject.
###Chapter 159 | Know My Place
Tobin guided Verena toward the rear of the estate,where they were met by a spotless white building gleaming in the sunlight.


Stepping inside, Verena noticed it resembled an ordinary hospital-only here,the extravagance spoke of wealth poured in without hesitation.



In the spacious ward, a celebrated local physician-entrusted solely with the care of Maxton-was in the middle of a physical examination, while a nurse quietly refreshed the vases of flowers.



At Tobin's arrival, the doctor lifted his head and offered a polite nod. "Good day, Mr. Fairclough."



Tobin returned the courtesy before asking, "Dr. Smith,how is my father's condition today?"



Britton Smith gave a weary sigh and slowly shook his head."The same as always. No sign of improvement."



The weight of those words darkened Tobin's face,sorrow clouding his expression.



Sensing his despair, Verena discreetly squeezed his  wrist, urging him to steady himself. He then said, "Dr.Smith, this is my girlfriend. I'd like her to spend some time talking with my father. Would you all step outside for a moment?"



It was a request that carried reason, and Britton found no grounds to object. He inclined his head. "We'll be right outside. If anything happens, Mr. Fairclough,simply use the call bell by the bed."


With that, he gestured to the nurses, and together they left the room.



Moments later, the door clicked softly shut.


Verena released Tobin's arm, turning to grab the nearby medical devices. "I need to perform a thorough examination on your father. Keep an eye on the door for me."



Obedient to her words, Tobin moved to the doorway,his anxious gaze never leaving her.


Verena slipped on a stethoscope, every line of her face marked by focus as she examined Maxton carefully.



Ten minutes later, she set the equipment back in place and gave Tobin a steady nod.



He rushed to her side, nerves straining his voice."Well? Can you cure him?" Verena's reply came with firm assurance. "I can."



Her tone lit a spark in him, a flicker of hope blazing into joy. He seized Maxton's hand with trembling excitement. "Dad, did you hear that? You'll wake up soon-you'll get better."


But Verena tempered his elation with calm words."Although your brother has momentarily set aside his doubts about me, he is a man who trusts no one. To guard against trouble, we must carry out the confidential procedure as soon as possible."



Tobin understood. Until his father truly awoke, nothing could be revealed to Erick.



He clasped Maxton's hand tighter, whispering with resolve, "Don't worry. It won't be long."



Not wishing to stir suspicion by lingering too long, the two concluded their visit and quietly left.



Meanwhile, in Shoildon, Stevie had arranged a swim with friends, but one by one they declined.Frustrated,he decided to swim alone. After a few laps, boredom crept in, and he climbed ashore.



Stretching out on a beach chair, he picked up his phone to tackle some overseas work.


 
No sooner had he unlocked it than a notification leapt   across the screen.



The headline shouted, "The First Appearance of the Mysterious Girlfriend of Tobin Fairclough."



"Tobin Fairclough?" Stevie frowned,perplexed.



He had never met Tobin, but his reputation was familiar enough.



Wasn't he always painted by the press as a grieving widower, devoted to his late wife and untouched by romance?



Who could possibly change that tale?



Curiosity burning, Stevie tapped the article.



The images within nearly sent him tumbling from his chair.



He stared at the photos, his jaw slack with disbelief.


The woman leaning on Tobin-though masked and wearing sunglasses-bore a figure and mannerisms that were unmistakably known to him.



It was Verena.



The report even carried a short video, which Stevie played with trembling fingers.


There, a woman in sunglasses waved at Tobin, and he  responded with endearment, calling her,"Sweetheart."


Stevie felt his world tilt. If the photos had left a sliver of doubt, the voice erased it.



Drawing in a sharp breath, he exclaimed, "Impossible!How could Isaac's wife be there?"



And worse-foreign media declared her Tobin's mysterious girlfriend.


Sensing something gravely amiss, Stevie wasted no time.He forwarded the news to Isaac and immediately called him.



The moment the call connected, his voice burst out in haste. "Quick! Look at the message I just sent!"


Isaac, baffled, asked, "What's going on?"


Nearly shouting,Stevie pressed, "Just check it! Your wife is being taken right under your nose!"



Isaac, unsettled, opened his laptop and clicked on Stevie's chat window.



A foreign tabloid article?



His brows drew together as he followed the link.



While Isaac kept silent, Stevie urged anxiously, "Did you see it? Did you?" Isaac's throat tightened, but his voice remained calm."Yes,I saw."



For a moment, Stevie was stunned-then burst out,"Are you serious? Your wife is holding another man's hand, being paraded as his girlfriend, and you sit there calm as a monk? Love must have blinded you."



A faint pang tugged at Isaac's heart as he stared at the photo,yet he held on to composure.He remembered Verena's words before her departure-she would need a false identity abroad.



Though confused, he chose to trust her.



"It's not what you imagine," he said softly. "Verena warned me beforehand. Her identity there is a mask,nothing more. I know this, so set your worries aside."


Stevie, however, couldn't fathom it. What man would watch quietly as his wife clung to another?



Skepticism laced his tone. "You're sure about that?Not just bewitched by love?"



Isaac allowed himself a faint smile. "I'm not the fool you take me for. I trust her."


With that, Stevie could only concede. "Fine. I've passed on the news. What happens next is between you two." 
Isaac thanked him, and the call ended.



Silence wrapped around Isaac's office.



His eyes lingered on the photo, shadows flickering in their depth.



He turned his phone in his hand, weighing his thoughts,before finally making a call.



Verena had just stepped out of the Fairclough family's hospital when the device buzzed in her hand.



She glanced at the caller ID, her lips curvingfaintly,and then pressed to hang up.



Hearing the tone of disconnection, Isaac froze in disbelief, his brows furrowing.



As he reached to dial again, a message appeared on his screen. "I'm being watched right now and can't talk on the phone."



His tension eased slightly, and he typed back, "I saw the news report from abroad."



Verena marveled at how swiftly the press moved, yet she feared Isaac might stilI harbor unease.



Patiently,she explained, "Isaac, this is what I warned you about. I must pretend to be close to Tobin,fooling his brother in order to reach my goal." Meanwhile,Erick, noticing Tobin and his girlfriend had yet to return, walked toward the hospital at the back of the estate, suspicion stirring in him.



Crossing the back garden, he spotted them at last.



Tobin lingered behind, issuing orders to the servants,while the woman in front was busy on her phone,her eyes sharp and alert. She seemed different from the naive girl from earlier.



Even as she typed, Verena sensed someone approaching.



Without betraying it, she slipped the phone away and lifted her head.



A smile appeared on her face as she stepped forward,her tone almost eager. "Erick, are you here to visit your father as well?"



Erick ignored her question, his eyes narrowing as he sneered, "Don't act like we're close. My brother's interest is nothing more than a passing fancy. You'd better play the role of a companion and not dream of climbing into the Fairclough family."



Catching the edge in his words, Verena answered gently, "I assure you, I see things more clearly than you believe." His frown deepened, suspicion flashing in his gaze as though her mask had slipped.



When he was about to speak, Verena smiled ingratiatingly and added, "I know my place. I'm aware of the gulf between a companion and a wife. If what I seek can be gained easily with the title of a companion,why would I make life difficult by reaching for more?"
###Chapter 160 Strategy



Seeing that Verena seemed to know her place,Erick shot her a sideways look. "Glad you get how things work."



Inwardly, he scoffed at himself for ever being suspicious.



He figured women like her were just chasing wealth and had no reason to hide anything deeper.


All it took was a small reward to keep them happy-and they were never any real trouble.







With Erick's doubts behind them, Verena and Tobin headed to the hospital for another visit with Maxton the next day.



They sat side by side at his bedside. As Verena leaned in for an exam, lifting her hand as if to check Maxton's eyes, she caught the sensation of being watched through the glass panel on the door.


She looked down and changed course, resting her palm gently on Maxton's shoulder instead.


She deliberately raised her voice, her tone full of regret. "I always heard stories about Mr. Maxton Fairclough's business success, but never expected to meet him like this. He has such a kind look-what a shame, for someone so good to end up here. I hope he wakes up soon."



Tobin didn't understand why she suddenly sounded so sentimental, but when he caught her glance, he realized there was an audience.



He played along, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Don't worry. Dad's strong. I'm sure when he finally wakes up and meets you, he'll be thrilled to have you join the family."



From outside, Britton listened to the exchange, some of his earlier suspicions slipping away.



He stepped inside,letting the door close behind him.



Hearing someone enter,both Tobin and V/erena turned to see who it was.



Britton walked over with an easy smile and said casually, "Mr. Fairclough, I've noticed you've been coming to the hospital quite often these past few days. It's clear you care deeply about your father's condition. If he were aware of this,he would surely feel comforted."



Tobin placed a gentle arm around Verena. "Before he got sick, Dad always told me to move forward and build a new life. Now that I've found someone, I bring her to see him. I hope hearing our voices will bring him back."



Britton gave Verena a quick glance, catching the shy smile she offered, and then nodded. "With so much love around him, I bet your father will pull through."



Tobin managed a hopeful smile. "We can only wait and see."



Britton's eyes lingered on Maxton before he spoke again. "It's important not to overstay during each visit.Too much excitement could slow your father's recovery.So,Mr.Fairclough-"



A flicker of realization crossed Verena's face. Britton's rush to send them off spoke volumes; she pegged him for one of Erick's people almost instantly.



No real doctor would lurk outside just to eavesdrop on the family's conversations.



Tobin gave a polite nod. "Dr. Smith, I'm trusting my father to your care."



Britton kept his professional smile. "Of course, that's my responsibility."



With that, Tobin and Verena headed out.



As they walked, Verena slipped her arm through his  and spoke in a low voice meant just for him. "That doctor works for Erick. We'll need to steer clear of him when it's time for surgery."



Tobin turned,stunned.



He hadn't realized he'd let one of his brother's men get so close to their father.



The thought sent a chill through him. Without his decision to put security cameras everywhere, Erick might've already tried something.



Although anger simmered beneath the surface, Tobin maintained a gentle facade for the prying eyes and kept his voice light. "So what should we do now?"



Verena lowered her eyes and played the part of a bashful girlfriend, answering softly, "Let's get back to your room. I'll tell you thee."



From a distance, the gardeners spotted the two huddled close and assumed it was just another sweet couple moment. They wisely chose to stay away and give them privacy.



Once they were back in Tobin's suite,Verena wasted no time. "Did you already arrange for the equipment and the surgical team I'll need?"



Tobin already understood why she had come and had taken steps in advance. He had told his assistant to  prepare everything and deliver it. "They're on their way now; it won't take long," he said.



No sooner had the words left his mouth than a knocking sound came at the door.



The two looked at each other briefly before Tobin called out, "Who's there?"


A voice replied from the hallway, "Mr. Fairclough, it's Javier. I brought the documents from your office."


He made sure to stress the word "documents."



Tobin nodded. "Just leave them in my study, thanks."



As soon as Javier walked away, Tobin turned to Verena, excitement shining in his eyes. "Everything's set for the surgery now. All that's left is to actually do it."



Verena spoke up. "We have to deal with Dr. Smith first."



She reached for her small medical kit and pulled out a thin, silver needle. "I'll put you to sleep with this.Once you're out, I'll call Dr. Smith in as a distraction and slip away to your father's room for the operation.The effect wears off pretty fast, so when you wake up,you need to keep him busy no matter what. Stall for as long as you can, and don't let him leave until I get back." Tobin's eyes fell on the silver needle she held, and with firm resolve he said, "I understand you. I'll make sure to buy enough time for my father's care."



Verena guided him onto the bed, and once he was settled, she started inserting the needle into his arm.



Within minutes, Tobin was fast asleep.



She stashed her medical kit and hurried toward the door.



Her rushed footsteps drew a servant, who stopped her with a worried look. "Miss Willis, is something wrong?"



Verena gripped the woman's shoulder, her voice urgent. "Find Dr. Smith-quickly! Tobin just lost consciousness. Go get him, now!"


The servant's eyes widened. "I'll fetch him right away!"



She bolted off toward the hospital wing.



A short while later, Britton showed up with his medical kit.



He leaned forward slightly and asked, "How are things looking?"



Tears brimming in her eyes, Verena shook her head."I have no idea. We just finished a walk outside, and as soon as we got back, he collapsed. Dr. Smith, please help him-check on Tobin!"



Britton remarked, "I'll need everyone to step out.I have to check on Mr. Fairclough alone."



He waited for the room to clear, and then closed the door behind him, leaving the others lingering in the hallway.



With the crowd distracted, Verena used the commotion to quietly slip away.


Moving quickly, she made her way toward the hospital wing.



Erick got word and rushed home from the office.



Despite any issues he had with Tobin, family drama called for a united front when it mattered.



He climbed the stairs to Tobin's room and found the door shut tight. Turning to a nearby staff member,he asked, "What's happening in there?"


The servant replied with careful respect, "Dr. Smith is inside checking on your brother. We're waiting out here for news,sir."



Erick's eyes scanned the area, searching for any sign of Tobin's girlfriend.



A frown creased his face as he asked, "So only my brother and Dr. Smith are in there?"



The servant gave a firm nod. "That's correct."



A flash of realization hit Erick, and his expression hardened. Without another word, he spun around and hurried toward the hospital. The moment he reached the stairwell, a wall of Tobin's bodyguards stepped into his path.



Recognizing their faces, Erick's voice rose in anger."You're blocking me? My father's in danger, and there's a threat in this house. If something goes wrong,it'll be on your heads. Move!"


But the bodyguards stood their ground, showing no sign of backing down.
 ###Chapter 161 | Have The Perfect Scapegoat
Erick's eyes flashed with suspicion. "So you really think you can stop me? Listen, the woman my brother brought back has completely vanished, and anyone can see she's up to something shady. If anything happens to my father because of her, every one of you will be held responsible. I can't just sit back and let her get away with it. Are you honestly going to stand in my way?"



Without hesitation, one of the bodyguards replied,"We have strict instructions from our boss. Nobody is allowed near the hospital today."



Only then did it click for Erick that he'd walked right into Tobin's setup.



These bodyguards weren't amateurs. Erick might be able to handle one or two, but facing this many,he wasn't about to do anything reckless.



Even with Erick's own group of loyal men and his significant influence in the underworld, he was outnumbered at the moment.



Just as he reached for his phone to call for backup, a guard from behind snatched it out of his grip. "Shit!" Erick muttered as he lunged to reclaim his phone, only to have several guards slam him to the floor and pin him instantly.



"If you have any urgent business, Mr. Fairclough,you can make your calls later," the bodyguard said coldly.



Meanwhile,inside Tobin's room, Britton had no idea about the chaos erupting outside. He sat next to the bed,feeling uneasy.



Tobin had passed out from sheer exhaustion. After giving him the necessary meds, Britton expected him to wake up soon.



Yet,more than thirty minutes ticked by, and there was stilI no sign of Tobin waking up.


Even though Britton worked under Erick, he knew he'd be blamed if anything happened to Tobin. Erick wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice him to keep the peace with the rest of the family.



Britton got up, planning to ask a servant to keep an eye on Tobin while he ran to the hospital for some extra injections.



But as soon as Britton started moving, Tobin, who had only been pretending to be unconscious, quickly called out, "Dr. Smith." 
"You're awake, Mr. Fairclough," Britton said as he turned to Tobin and helped him sit upright.


With a trembling voice, Tobin pretended to be frail."Dr. Smith, what happened to me? Why do I feel so weak?"



Britton calmly explained to him what had happened,and as soon as Tobin heard about his sudden collapse,he clutched Britton's arm, eyes wide in panic. "How could I just pass out like that? Is it something serious?Am I going to end up stuck in bed like my father? Dr.Smith,you have to help me!"



Panic was written all over Tobin's face.



Britton offered some reassurance. "You don't need to worry, Mr. Fairclough. You collapsed because you pushed yourself too hard. Get some proper rest, and you'll recover quickly."


Still on edge, Tobin asked him, "Are you sure? Please,double-check everything."



His obvious anxiety left Britton with no choice but to perform another detailed examination.







Elsewhere, Verena had made her way to Maxton's room and slipped right in with the surgical team Tobin  had arranged.



Even though Britton was temporarily held back,Verena understood that Erick would never leave only a single doctor to oversee Tobin.



She was certain extra eyes were monitoring the situation. The remaining people might call for backup,and she feared the situation could spiral beyond her control.



Driven by panic, she hurried through the surgical preparations.



Nervous sweat formed along her hairline, soaking into her mask.



Drawing in a silent breath, Verena blocked everything else out, channeling all her concentration into guiding the scalpel with steady hands.



A sudden noise from the hallway, a shuffle, and then the faint patter of approaching feet, snapped her focus.



Verena tightened her jaw, thrown off by how quickly the interruption came.



Nervous sweat pooled along her hairline, dripping down. Her palms were wet beneath her gloves, making the scalpel even harder to control. Still,Verena centered herself, determined not to let the tension in the corridor shake her hands.



She was nearly finished with the procedure.All she needed was a handful of minutes more.



The footsteps outside grew louder, picking up speed as they neared.



From the increasing noise, Verena guessed that several people were converging right outside the room.


Any sudden intrusion would ruin everything she'd worked for.



That meant she needed to pick up the pace as every second counted now.



Outside the door, the footsteps suddenly stopped.


"Who's inside? Open up now!" Erick demanded,his shout echoing through the door.


Stationed bodyguards replied, "Mr. Fairclough, nobody is allowed inside at the moment."



"Then let's find out if you really have what it takes to keep me out," Erick shot back, signaling to his subordinate.


Without hesitation, the man stepped forward and landed a heavy kick to the bodyguard blocking his  path.



Right then, Tobin's bodyguards surged forward,launching themselves into a fistfight with Erick's men.



A barrage of thumps and the scuffle of bodies slamming against walls echoed through the corridor.


Although the chaos outside intensified, Verena's concentration never wavered. Her hands moved with precision, closing the final stitches.



She was so close; only a final touch remained before she'd finish the procedure.



The fight outside left the entrance unguarded for Erick.



Fixing his gaze on the door, he approached it,determined to force his way inside.



Before he could reach for the handle, the door swung inward and Verena slipped out, pulling it shut behind her and cutting off his path.



She looked completely composed, and if not for the beads of sweat at her hairline, anyone could mistake her for a visitor checking in on the patient.


Verena spared a quick look at the guards now lying defeated on the floor, victims of Erick's men. Maintaining her composure, Verena offered a small smile. "Mr. Fairclough, do you realize what kind of uproar you're causing by storming in with an army?Aren't you worried about disturbing your father?"


Erick glared at her, his eyes cold and full of suspicion."Who gave you permission to step into my father's room alone? No one comes near this hospital without the Fairclough family's consent. You know that."


Without waiting for Verena's response, he barked at his men, "She broke into my father's room to do him harm.Take her away!"



Two bodyguards closed in on Verena.


Yet she stood her ground, knowing full well that Erick wouldn't be here if Tobin's people were still in control.



Right now, her best strategy was to buy some time for Tobin to arrive. She could only hope he'd get there soon enough.


Verena folded her arms and let out a soft laugh."Mr.Fairclough, I just finished operating on your father.He'll regain consciousness shortly. Are you really planning to arrest the one person who might save him?Or are you hoping your father never wakes up?"



Their stares locked, tension flaring between them like two blades meeting mid-strike. The moment Verena mentioned Maxton might wake up soon, a dangerous glint flashed across Erick's face.



Only now did he realize he'd completely underestimated her. She wasn't some opportunist but the very doctor his older brother had hired for the operation.



She'd finished the procedure in record time and was now claiming a quick recovery. If Erick's instincts were right, this woman had to be the real Evelyn.



The realization struck him hard that he'd just been outsmarted by Verena and Tobin. Shadows clouded his features as he gave her a chilling smile."You really think saving my father puts you above the rules?Don't forget. He's still unconscious. If anything were to happen, you'd be the first one everyone blames.Honestly, you've made it easy for me. Now I have the perfect scapegoat."



With his mask gone, Erick's threats came out in the open. Verena met his gaze, her lips curling into a smirk. "So this is the real Erick Fairclough, huh? No more playing nice?"


Out of sight, her fingers moved swiftly, sending a silent message to Tobin for backup as they'd planned.



Tobin's supposed arrest at Erick's hands was nothing more than a carefully staged deception. Tobin's team had already been stationed throughout the estate,ready to act at a moment's notice.



Convinced Tobin was out of the picture and his father remained helpless, Erick dropped the act. He was certain the entire estate was now under his control.



Believing he'd already won,Erick felt untouchable.



Noticing Verena with her phone, Erick gave her a disdainful look. "Really? Still hoping Tobin's going to come and rescue you?"



He paused, voice dripping with sarcasm. "My men have already got him locked down. He's in no position to help anyone, not even himself."



Knowing Tobin needed a bit more time, Verena shifted tactics, her tone gentle and almost amused. "Tell me,Mr.Fairclough, are you truly willing to throw your own father and brother under the bus? I have to admit, I'm dying to know, what's your grand plan for Tobin?"



A twisted grin broke out across Erick's face. "If he wants to fake illness so badly, then he can follow my father to the grave."



His cruelty was unmistakable, but Verena didn't back down. "And you're not worried that people might get suspicious if they both vanish on the same day?" A cold sneer played at Erick's lips, his eyes reflecting a deadly resolve. "Everyone in this family will swear that Tobin just slipped into a coma out of nowhere and never woke up. No one will link it to me.And as for my father, the surveillance footage will pin everything on you and your botched surgery. In this household, I decide what the truthlooks like."



He leaned in, the threat plain on his face. "Once my father and Tobin are gone, I'll be the only one left to inherit everything. WVith no one standing in my way, I'll finally-"



"And just what is it you think you're capable of?" A commanding voice rang out from the corridor,cutting through his fantasy.


The sound brought Erick to a halt, and he turned around, panic flickering in his eyes.


At the far end of the hallway, Tobin appeared, leading a squad of armed men straight toward them.



Within seconds, Tobin's team overpowered Erick's guards,seizing control.


Erick's face drained of allcolor,and he stared ahead in shock, barely able to stammer, "No... This isn't happening..."



Tobin strode forward, his voice dripping with contempt. "I never realized you could be this vicious,Erick. But it looks like your evil scheme just fell apart."
###Chapter 162 He'd Been Duped
Tobin showed up with remarkable composure, as though he'd been out for a relaxing stroll instead of facing a life-or-death situation.


Everything that had just unfolded struck Erick like a slap in the face. Only now did he grasp how thoroughly he'd been duped. Tobin's earlier surrender was an act, and the story about Verena being his girlfriend was nothing but a clever ruse. Every detail had been designed to lead him astray.



A mix of anger and anxiety gripped Erick. The thought of Maxton waking up and discovering his betrayal sent a wave of fear through him. If that happened,he wouldn't just lose everything; the consequences would be far worse.



With this thought, his blood ran cold, and his jaw clenched tight. There was no way he could let things end like this.



Desperation crawled up Erick's spine as he racked his brain for any way to salvage the situation.



Right then, an idea suddenly sparked, and a cocky smirk curled at his lips. Lifting his gaze, he taunted, "Impressive, Tobin. You even roped Evelyn into your performance. I'll admit defeat this time, but don't think you can keep me down with just this little trick."



Tobin replied, his tone sharp as a knife, "You're right,I can't bring you down so easily. But you aimed for more than just me today. You went after our father,too. When he wakes up and learns what you've done,do you honestly believe he'll let it slide?"



His gaze fixed on Erick, Tobin continued, "I won't have to lift a finger. Our father will be the one to deal with you."



Even though Tobin made the consequences crystal clear, Erick showed not a hint of fear. A cool grin spread across his face as he nodded. "You're absolutely right. Dad's reputation for being ruthless in business is legendary. If he ever discovers my part in this, I'll be finished."



A shadow crossed Erick's face, and his voice took on a dangerous edge. "But let me ask you, Tobin,are you really prepared for Dad to hear the truth? Remember,your youngest daughter goes to a school that answers to me, staffed with people loyal to me alone. One call from me, and she could vanish without a trace."



On the surface, Tobin's expression barely shifted,but inside, he felt nothing but cold,bitter disappointment.A weary sigh escaped him. "I can't believe you'd throw  away your own family just for the sake of power and money."



Erick responded with a dismissive laugh, "Family means nothing compared to wealth and power! As long as I'mn not the one pulling the strings, I'll always be trapped by someone else. I'd much rather be the one in charge than spend my life being ordered around."



Erick's relentless attitude made further conversation pointless in Tobin's eyes.



"Did you really believe I'd lay a trap without having a backup plan?" Tobin shook his head, a wry smile tugging at his mouth. "Everything was already in place before Evelyn got here, and I was just waiting for you to take the bait. If you want to threaten me with my daughter, by all means, try it. Let's see if a single phone call is enough to make her disappear."



Erick couldn't wrap his head around how Tobin had managed to act so fast. With his desperation mounting,he fumbled for his phone and tried to make a call,clinging to his last shred of hope. The call never went through; the line stayed busy.


Frustration built with each failed attempt. Erick dialed again, refusing to accept defeat, only to be met with the same unbroken silence. His face hardened in an instant. Jaw clenched, he snapped, "I won't let you win. This isn't over."



Tobin's gaze was cold as he watched Erick unravel.Turning to his men, he spoke in a flat, commanding tone. "Erick's lost his mind. Take him away and keep him under strict watch. Make sure he stays put until my father wakes up. We can't risk him doing anything reckless."



His orders were met with a chorus of obedient voices."Understood,sir."



Without hesitation,several burly bodyguards closed in and led Erick out of the hospital.



The rest of Erick's followers were swiftly dealt with,restoring order to the hospital in a matter of moments.



Once calm returned, Tobin glanced over at Verena,letting out a weary sigh. "I'm sorry you had to see all of that, Evelyn."


Offering a gentle, understanding smile, Verena replied,"No family is perfect. Everyone faces their own battles."



Her reassurance struck Tobin as oddly comforting. In his mind, someone as capable as Evelyn must have come from a stable, supportive family, far removed from this kind of chaos. What he didn't realize was  that Verena had already weathered similar storms with Alec's family, and scenes like this barely fazed her anymore.


After exchanging a few more words, Tobin's anxiety resurfaced. "Evelyn, how is my father now? When do you think he'll wake up?"


Verena explained, "The operation just ended, and your father's still under anesthesia. It's hard to say exactly when he'll become conscious, but I'm confident he'll be awake by tonight."


Relief washed over Tobin, the tension melting from his shoulders as he sighed. "That's a huge relief."


Verena laid out the recovery plan for Tobin. She explained, "When your father wakes up, he'll have to remain on strict bed rest for no less than two months.It's important that he stays calm and avoids any unnecessary stress or activity during his recovery. I've already briefed the nurses who helped during the surgery. They know exactly how to care for him,so you can put your mind at ease."


For half a year, Tobin had knocked on the doors of every prominent doctor he could find, each one telling him there was no hope for his father.Hearing Evelyn say that recovery was possible nearly brought him to tears. Standing tall, Tobin offered Verena a deep bow before speaking. "Evelyn, I can never repay what you've done for my father. If you hadn't come along,I'd still be desperately searching for answers. If there's anything you want, say the word. As long as it's within my reach, I'll make it happen."



Verena could sense the genuine gratitude behind Tobin's words, so different from Erick's cold ambition.Maybe it was his status as the favored oldest son, or maybe he truly cared about his father.


With a soft smile, Verena responded, "Actually, there is one thing I'd like you to help me with."


Tobin didn't hesitate for a second. "Just tell me what you need."



Verena responded calmly, "What I'd like is for you to put an end to those entertainment news articles linking us together."



"What?" That answer took Tobin by surprise. He stared at her, realizing she was completely serious.


He blinked, genuinely puzzled. "That's all you want?"



With someone in his position, removing a news story was as easy as making it appear in the first place.



A playful glint flashed in Verena's eyes as she added,  half-teasing, "Naturally, that's not the only thing I'll ever ask for. Favors like these aren't paid off so easily.But since you're determined to repay me, Mr.Fairclough, I won't hesitate to reach out if anything else comes up. For now, though, that's all."



Meanwhile, Katelyn's friend stumbled across the headlines before they were wiped from the web and immediately sent them her way.



"I don't usually keep up with news, but this was everywhere." The friend messaged. "Isn't this woman the wife of the guy you're interested in? How did she get caught up with Tobin Fairclough?"



It was no secret among Katelyn's friends that she liked Isaac. After clashing with Verena and coming out defeated, Katelyn couldn't help but vent her frustration to her friends. She had sent them pictures of Verena and ranted about how much better she was.That was why, when her friend saw the photo in the news,she recognized Verena right away.


After reading the message, Katelyn shot up in bed, a jolt of disbelief running through her.
###Chapter 163 You're Threatening Me For Her
Katelyn clicked on the link, and the moment the story popped up-Verena pictured beside a middle-aged man-a jolt of excitement shot through her,lighting up her entire face with sly,wicked delight.


At last, Verena had served up the perfect scandal on a silver platter.



Katelyn was floored by Verena's boldness. Parading around with another man in public, completely shameless-was she out of her mind?



Did Verena really believe that slipping away to another country for a little adventure would keep her secrets from getting back here?


Katelyn could barely contain herself, eager to watch Verena struggle to explain this mess away.


She was convinced that, after seeing proof like this,there was no way Isaac or Danica would let Verena set foot in the Bennett family.



After a few days of recovery, Katelyn was feeling much better, and the doctor told her she could finish recovery at home starting tomorrow. But patience wasn't he strong suit. She ripped the IV from her hand and ran out of the hospital without even bothering with the discharge process.



Outside,she flagged down the first cab she saw.


Moments later, the taxi pulled up at the gates of the Bennett Mansion.



The housekeeper, busy trimming hedges, glanced up just in time to see Katelyn stride past without so much as a greeting.



"Mrs. Bennett!" Katelyn called, rushing into the house.



Finding no one in the living room, she stretched her neck and called upstairs.



The housekeeper trailed behind, flustered. "Miss Fuller,Mrs. Bennett's resting. Maybe you could wait-"


Katelyn brushed past her, irritation flashing in her eyes."Mrs. Bennett! You have to come down right now.There's something you need to see!"



Danica had barely drifted off when Katelyn's shouting carried up from downstairs.



She tried to block it out, rolling over in frustration, but the noise only grew more insistent. With a disgruntled huff, Danica sat up, her expression  darkening. "That girl is getting bolder by the day."



Grumbling to herself, she threw on a coat and made her way downstairs.



The moment Katelyn heard footsteps coming down,a sly smile flickered across her face.



"Weren't you supposed to be in the hospital? Why are you here now?" Danica asked as she strode over,eyeing Katelyn with surprise.


Without answering,Katelyn grabbed Danica's hand and led her straight to the couch.



"There's something you need to see right now."


She wasted no time, pulling up the news article and shoving her phone into Danica's hands before she could ask any questions. "Read this."



Danica glanced down, confusion etched across her features.



But as soon as she read the headline and saw the photo,her whole expression changed. Her brows drew together in a stormy glare, and anger flashed in her eyes.


"The First Appearance of the Mysterious Girlfriend of Tobin Fairclough..." Zooming in on the photo, Danica stared at the masked woman beside the middle-aged man, her breath quickening. "That's Verena, isn't it? What on earth is Verena doing overseas? And how could she become someone's girlfriend?"



Katelyn watched the fury bubble up in Danica, barely disguising her satisfaction with a forced look of concern. "I thought the same thing. At first, I wondered if it could really be her, since she was so covered up. But the more I looked, the more certain I became-it's definitely Verena."



Katelyn put on a look of sorrowful sympathy. "I just thought you should see it for yourself, in case I was overreacting. Honestly, she must be out of her mind.How could she betray Isaac like this?"



Danica trembled with fury, tossing the phone aside as she snapped, "Out of her mind? She's too clever for her own good! That girl has no respect for this family at all!"



Katelyn flinched at Danica's sudden outburst, quickly dropping her voice in feigned worry. "Does Isaac know yet? Maybe we should hold off on telling him..."



That was enough to send Danica over the edge."Hold off? Absolutely not! He deserves to know exactly what kind of woman he brought into our family-a shameless liar running around with other men!" A flash of cruel delight crossed Katelyn's face. "Got it.I'll forward you the link right now."



Danica sprang from the couch and stormed out,too enraged to remember her manners. Katelyn didn't even get so much as a parting glance.



Alone in the silence, Katelyn stared at the phone Danica had flung aside.



Her gaze lingered on the zoomed-in photo, and that sinister, obsessive smile crept back onto her lips. Her eyes sparkled with a cold, unhinged satisfaction.


This was it. She hadn't even lifted a finger yet, and already Verena's downfall was in motion.



In Katelyn's mind, Isaac had always belonged to her alone.




...



Jacob noticed Danica approaching and made a move to stand, but she swept past him in a blaze of anger,heading toward the CEO's office without so much as a glance his way.


Being Isaac's mother, she outranked everyone; Jacob didn't dare to object or even announce her presence before she burst in. The office door crashed open, slamming shut behind her with a bang.



Isaac was lost in paperwork when the ruckus made him look up, expecting to see Jacob.



He was ready to scold his assistant for barging in, but the sight of Danica's stormy glare made any annoyance instantly evaporate.



He arched a brow, confused. "Mom? What's going on?"



"What's going on?" Danica gave a bitter, sarcastic laugh as she brandished her phone, thrusting the link from Katelyn right under his nose.



"Why don't you take a look for yourself? See what your wife's really been up to. She flew overseas behind your back-just look at this disgrace!"



Isaac eyed the phone she'd dropped on his desk.He recognized the story. It was the same one Stevie had already sent his way.



Realizing she'd misunderstood everything,Isaac met her gaze and calmly explained, "Mom, you've got it all wrong about Verena. I knew about her trip before she left. That article is just a smokescreen for outsiders. None of it's true. She had important business overseas, and I was in on it from the start." "Important business?" Danica snapped, her voice dripping with skepticism. "What could possibly be so urgent? Don't tell me you actually believe she went abroad to cure someone? Sure, she knows a thing or two about medicine, but with so many outstanding doctors abroad, why would someone need her help?And why was a performance needed? That's just a flimsy excuse, and you're falling for it?"



Her temper flared, words tumbling out faster and louder. "And look what she did. She ran off and got cozy with another man! Didn't you see the headline calling her Tobin Fairclough's mysterious girlfriend?Stories like that don't just appear out of thin air. Who would dare write that about the general manager of Smoothdeed Group unless it was true? You've lost all sense. You'll believe anything Verena says, even as she humiliates you for the world to see."



The more Danica ranted, the firmer lsaac's tone became. "I'm warning you, Mom. This is the last time I'll explain. Verena never lied to me. She was upfront about everything from the beginning."



Danica stared at him like he'd lost his mind, her anger practically boiling over. "You can't see what's right in front of you! She's making a fool out of you, and you're still defending her? She's seducing another man in your face, and you're just letting it happen? What kind of hold does she have on you?"  Just then, Isaac's phone buzzed on his desk.



The caller ID showed that it was his wife calling.



He answered, and Verena's gentle voice drifted through the line. "Isaac, everything's settled here. I'll be home tomorrow."



"Great..." Isaac began, but before he could finish,Danica snatched the phone right out of his grasp.


He lunged forward to reclaim it, but being stuck in a wheelchair left him just out of reach.



Danica,having caught sight of the caller ID,tightened her grip, ready to unleash a tirade on Verena.


But Isaac's warning cut through the air. "Mom, if you say anything to hurt her, don't blame me for what happens next."



Danica stopped cold, shock washing over her face."You're threatening me for her?"



Isaac met her glare head-on, his voice steady but unyielding. "Because you're the one trying to hurt her.I've told you again and again, this is nothing but a misunderstanding. Instead of trusting your own son and Verena, you believe some rumor from strangers.If that's how it is, then I have to draw aline." No mother could stand to hear those kinds of words coming from her own son.


Pain flickered across Danica's face; her eyes welled up as she hurled the phone aside and stormed out of the office.



With the tension finally broken, Isaac let out a deep,weary sigh.



The last thing he wanted was for Verena to be exposed to those baseless accusations. He could never truly hurt Danica, bout using such harsh words had been the only way to put a stop to her reckless fury.
###Chapter 164| Will Always Be On Your Side
 Earlier,when the argument broke out, Danica had accidentally ended the call. Once she'd left, Isaac noticed and immediately dialed Verena's number.


"Sorry about earlier, the call dropped by accident,"Isaac said, his tone gentle.



A soft laugh came from Verena's side. "Don't worry about it," she replied easily.



She'd been wanting to bring something up, but Isaac jumped in first. "What's your flight time tomorrow? I'll pick you up at the airport."



His voice was warm, carrying a note of genuine care.


Verena had considered bringing up the earlier incident,but it was obvious Isaac preferred to let it slide. He was trying to protect her from any lingering awkwardness,but with Danica's voice ringing out so loudly earlier, it was impossible for Verena not to notice.



She paused for a moment, and then answered, "I don't have the details yet. Once I get my ticket, I'll send you the info." "Alright, I'll be waiting," Isaac responded, his voice reassuring.



Verena had never been one to dodge difficult topics,so she asked outright, "Did your mom come by to give you a hard time after she read that news article from abroad?"



Isaac hadn't planned on discussing it, but the way she phrased her question left no doubt she'd caught part of his exchange with Danica.



"Yeah, she did." He let out a quiet sigh, his frustration showing. "My mom doesn't know the full story yet.She got upset after reading the news, and no matter how I tried to explain, she just wouldn't listen. Don't worry, though. When you're back, I'll go with you to clear things up. She's not totally unreasonable. She's just reacting to the shock of the news. Once she settles down, she won't be so harsh."



The mistrust was understandable. to Verena since she hadn't spent much time with Danica.



Verena kept her tone steady as she replied,"You really don't need to worry about me. I can handle this myself."



Still worried that she might feel hurt, Isaac offered a gentle promise. "No matter what anyone says, Verena,I'll always be on your side." Something inside her softened. In that moment, it almost felt like nothing had changed. Isaac's faith in her was unshaken, just as it had been before his amnesia. Despite everything Danica had said and everything he'd forgotten, he was still the same lsaac:trusting her completely, refusing to doubt her for even a second.



A wave of emotion swept over Verena, and her eyes stung. She couldn't let him carry the burden by himself.



Clearly, asking Tobin to suppress the news wasn't enough; the truth needed to be made public.



She understood that if she tried to clear things up after she returned home, no one except Isaac would be convinced. But if Tobin came forward with an official statement,it would carry real weight.


Danica might never accept her word, but she wouldn't question a public declaration from Tobin.



After all, if she were simply Tobin's romantic partner,he wouldn't have publicly defended her and explained the situation.



Having reached a decision, Verena's lips curved into a small smile as she spoke into the phone. "Thank you for always believing in me, sweetheart. I've got something I need to take care of, so I'll talk to you  again soon."



The word "sweetheart" caught lsaac off guard. His eyes brightened, and a quiet smile played on his lips."Alright, just be careful."


Once the call ended, Verena stepped out of her room,determined to act.



She knew Tobin was still at his family's hospital,so she went directly to the medical wing at the back of the estate. After riding the elevator up,she spotted Tobin waiting alone on a bench at the far end of the hallway.



"Mr. Fairclough," Verena greeted in a polite tone.



Tobin shot to his feet, concern etched across his face."Evelyn, what brings you here? After everything you've just been through these past few days, you should really be resting."



With a warm, reassuring smile, Verena replied, "1wanted to talk to you about something important."



Tobin felt a deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the woman who had rescued his father's life,making him determined to keep their relationship on good terms. He understood better than anyone how unpredictable life could be, and no one was ever truly safe from unexpected tragedy. Even the best ddoctors had failed where she had succeeded, solving a problem others deemed hopeless. Building a strong relationship  with someone of her skill and character was a priority in both his personal and business affairs.



He leaned in, eager to help. "Of course. What's on your mind?"



"About..."



Verena was just about to explain when chaos erupted.A nurse rushed out from the intensive care unit,her voice trembling with urgency. "Mr. Fairclough, there's an emergency! It's your father's vitals; they're dropping once again!"



Shock froze Tobin in place. "What did you say?" he demanded,barely able to process the news.



A wave of uncertainty and worry crossed Tobin's face as he glanced at Verena. Noticing his distress,Verena's brow creased with concern. "Let me check on him," she said calmly.



Without another word, she hurried after the nurse,heading straight into the ICU.



Inside, the monitors showed alarming drops in Maxton's vital signs. Wasting no time, Verena slipped into protective gear and moved to his bedside for a closer look.



It didn't take long for her to spot the problem. Earlier, after the operation, she'd been forced to leave the final steps to her assistant so she could intercept Erick. It seemed likely that Maxton's setback was caused by the rushed and unfinished care he'd received after surgery.



Pulling back the blanket and carefully inspecting the surgical area, Verena discovered a clear sign of infection.



Luckily, the problem was discovered early enough to prevent any lasting damage.



Turning to the nurse, Verena requested tweezers and other tools. Then she carefully cleaned the wound again and applied advanced treatment to steady Maxton's condition.



Verena's quick actions paid off. Soon, Maxton's vital readings on the monitors began climbing back to normal.



Once everything was under control, she peeled off her gown, mask, and gloves and stepped back out of the ICU.
###Chapter 165 Are You Truly Capable Of Curing Isaac
The moment Verena stepped out, Tobin rushed over,his words tumbling out in panic. "How's my father? Is it serious? Evelyn, I'm begging you-please save him."



Verena's composed demeanor seemed to settle the room as she spoke in a gentle tone. "There's a post-surgery infection, but fortunately we detected it early.I've already treated the wound, and his vitals remain stable. However, given his condition, it's unlikely he'll wake up anytime soon."



At those words, Tobin's chest tightened even further,and he asked with rising dread, "Didn't you promise he would be awake tonight?"



Verena gave a quiet nod. "That would have been true if nothing had gone wrong. But now, with the infection,there's no certainty."


His brows knitted together, and he asked, "Then how long before he opens his eyes again?"


After a pause, Verena answered plainly. "It depends entirely on his strength. It could be a couple of days,maybe three, or even a week." The weight of her words pulled Tobin's expression darker still.



When she noticed the strain etched across his face,Verena held back anything else she might have said,knowing he wouldn't hear it now.



Only when Maxton regained consciousness would there be an opportunity to talk about clearing the rumors.



...


Back at the Bennett Mansion, Danica's anger simmered into despair. Her most beloved son, Isaac, had stood against her today-all because of a woman accused of betrayal.


How could he turn on her when everything she had done was for his sake?



The more she relived it, the less she could contain herself, until tears slipped down her cheeks in a flood of bitterness.



Katelyn had been staying at the Bennett Mansion ever since she delivered the story of Verena's supposed affair, lingering there to witness how events might unfold.



When Danica entered the room with tear-streaked  cheeks, Katelyn's brows drew together in suspicion.She rose at once and led Danica toward the sofa with practiced care.



With tissues offered in hand, Katelyn put on a mask of concern,though her tone carried intent. "Mrs. Bennett,what happened? Why are you crying all of a sudden?Did Isaac say something to hurt you?"



Normally, Danica would have kept famnily matters hidden from her. But the weight of her sadness overwhelmed that instinct, and she needed someone willing to listen.



Clutching the tissues tightly, Danica cried out, "I never believed that the son I poured my heart into raising would one day stand against his family because of a woman who betrayed him."



The change in Katelyn's expression was immediate,her displeasure evident. What exactly did that mean?Could Isaac truly be siding with Verena? The thought gnawed at her.



Covering her resentment with practiced ease,Katelyn asked further, "So Isaac doesn't accept the report from abroad?"



As she dabbed her tears away, Danica pressed her palm to her chest and blurted out, "Not only does he dismiss that report, but he also refuses to place any  trust in me, his own mother."



More sobs escaped her as she spoke through the tears."The video clearly shows Verena leaning into that man's arms, yet lsaac insists it's just a misunderstanding. Worst of all, he even threatened me for her sake."



So consumed by grief,Danica didn't notice the shadow passing over Katelyn's face. "And as for Verena, in the beginning I did look down on her because of her family. But with time, after a few encounters, I thought she seemed decent enough. I never imagined she would be so false! Isaac treats her with nothing but love and trust, so how could she repay him this way? But..."



By now, Danica's sobs only grew heavier, her words carrying raw anguish. "Isaac acts like Verena has bewitched him. He refuses to listen to anything I say.Since he won't take my advice, I'd rather step aside.I won't involve myself in their mess anymore!"



The way Danica spoke about lsaac's defense of Verena stirred jealousy inside Katelyn. Why could Verena claim the devotion she had always longed for,while she herself was ignored?



Still, Katelyn had long mastered the art of hiding her true feelings, and she smoothed them over with a mask of concern. Her hand came to rest lighntly on Danica's shoulder as she said, "Mrs. Bennett, Isaac is your son. How can you simply watch while he loses his way? He's only blinded for now, confused between right and wrong, and that's why he dared to answer you so rudely. You can't just abandon him at a time like this. He needs his mother to steer him back."



Danica already knew this reasoning by heart,but she lacked any power to put it into practice.


Through tearful sniffs, she sobbed, "What choice do l have? The moment I spoke a few words against Verena, he threatened me. Isaac is utterly consumed by her. I can't change his mind. Besides, he holds all the authority in the company-I have nothing to use against him."



Her reaction didn't escape Katelyn's notice, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she understood Danica's hesitation. Danica wanted to strike at Verena, but Isaac's threats restrained her.



With her lips curving faintly, Katelyn leaned closer and said with a show of earnestness, "Forgive me for being blunt, Mrs. Bennett, but lsaac only clings to Verena because of what happened to his legs. His pride was shattered, and when she claimed she could cure him,he poured every ounce of hope into her. Think about it-before then, Isaac had never looked twice at any  woman.How else could he suddenly grow so attached to a wife chosen from a marriage alliance?"



Danica felt as though a veil had been lifted when Katelyn laid out her reasoning. Deep down, she knew Isaac was never a man who bent easily to others,nor was he the type to depend so much on a woman.Clearly,his wounded pride and fragile state had driven him to lean on Verena, just as Katelyn described.



Once this truth sank in, her bitterness melted away,leaving behind nothing but anxious concern for her son's future.



"You're making sense. Isaac wouldn't give his heart to someone so quickly. What ties him to Verena is probably the hope she represents."



Noticing that Danica seemed open to her guidance,Katelyn felt a wave of satisfaction and said, "That's why helping Isaac recover the full use of his legs is the only way for him to regain his confidence and eventually recognize Verena's lies."



The thought of Veena once more stirred grief and anger in Danica, and she murmured, "But Verena isn't even in the country right now. Who's left to treat Isaac?"



Katelyn clasped Danica's hand and smiled with deliberate calm. "Mrs. Bennett, remember who l am -I'm Evelyn Rowe.Let Isaac place his trust in me and allow me to perform the surgery. I can guarantee his recovery. When he stands again, grateful and full of life, that will be the chance for us to cut Verena away completely."


Hearing Katelyn assert her identity with such confidence erased the last trace of doubt inside Danica.



Because of the scandal abroad tied to Verena, any trust Danica once had in her had already collapsed.Even though Verena insisted before that Katelyn had fabricated everything, Danica brushed it off as nothing more than a desperate excuse, fearing Katelyn might steal lsaac away.


Once she steadied herself, Danica faltered, and then asked, "Katelyn, are you truly capable of curing Isaac?"



When Katelyn caught the question in Danica's eyes,she realized the woman was tempted, though a trace of hesitation still lingered.
###Chapter 166 | Won't Fail You
With a confident nod, Katelyn replied, "Of course. The cases I handled overseas were far worse than Isaac's.If Verena hadn't stopped me back then, I would've performed the surgery already. By now, he'd be on the path to recovery."


The certainty in her tone eased Danica's doubts,though one concern lingered. "But I can't force Isaac.How will I convince him to let you treat him?"


Reaching into her purse, Katelyn produced a small packet and placedit in Danica's hand. "This induces a brief sleep. It's completely harmless. If you trust me,simply get Isaac to take it. I'll handle the rest."


For a long moment, Danica studied the packet before curling her fingers tightly around it, determination sparking in her gaze.


If this could hasten lsaac's recovery and reveal Verena's true nature, DDanica believed she was prepared to do whatever it took.



Her voice dropped low as she asked, "When do you need me to act?" After a moment of thought, Katelyn replied, "The day after tomorrow. I'll send word in advance."



Other matters demanded her attention before then.



Watching Danica agree so quickly only confirmed what Katelyn already sensed-Danica's hatred toward Verena had reached its height.


That meant, no matter what happened in between,as long as Isaac regained his health after she performed the surgery, Danica would not hold her accountable.



With that assurance,Katelyn softened her expression and spoke gently. "Don't be upset anymore. Trust me.When Isaac walks again, he won't defend Verena the way he does now. It's late, so I'll let you rest."



Danica accepted the reassurance and asked the housekeeper to see Katelyn out.


Once she got in the car, the driver glanced at her reflection in the rearview mirror. "Miss Fuller, do you want to head home or go to the hospital?"



A sly curve touched Katelyn's lips as she shook her head. "Take me to Stellar Restaurant."



Stellar Restaurant had served as the secret meeting place for Katelyn and Kaia. At once, the driver turned the wheel and followed her instructions.



Pulling out her phone, Katelyn dialed Kaia. Their arrangement was simple-Katelyn always spoke first,ensuring no one would suspect anything.



The moment the line opened, she spoke directly. "I've got directions for you. Meet me where we always do."



Kaia replied with a short "Okay." She then ended the call.


Back at Seraphina Villas, Kaia understood that a summons from Katelyn meant another assignment.She changed quickly and hurried down the stairs.


Rhonda, dusting one of the carved columns in the living room, froze when she heard the sharp rhythm of heels and ducked behind it.


As soon as Kaia slipped out the door, Rhonda reached for the landline and dialed Verena's number.


When the call connected, her urgent whisper came through. "Kaia just left. She seemed in a rush."


Verena arched a brow, amusement glinting in her eyes.


So,the restless ones had finally decided to act. It was their turn to move. Her tone stayed light. "Understood. Thank you,Rhonda."





After days of careful watching, Rhonda had already judged Kaia to be nothing good.


She asked hesitantly, "Do you want me to follow her?"


A faint smile touched Verena's lips. "That won't be necessary. Just pretend you know nothing.Wait,and let them show their hand first."



Kindhearted as she was, Rhonda lacked the skill to tail anyone. And lately, Kaia had become more cautious.Verena believed that it was better to leave such work to those who knew how.



Taking Verena's words to heart, Rhonda responded in agreement.



···


Meanwhile, in the quietest corner of Stellar Restaurant,Katelyn arrived ahead of time. A short while later, Kaia rushed inside.



Looking at her idol with worry, Kaia asked, "Katelyn,are you feeling any better now? Does it still hurt at all?"



Though she wanted to get straight to the matter at hand,Katelyn reminded herself that she had to remain flawless in front of Kaia.



Her reply came gently. "The pain stopped once the stitches were in. And once they're removed, I'll be almost completely fine."


Kaia bobbed her head in relief. "I'm glad. I wanted to come see you earlier, but since I'm living at Verena's place, it's been difficult to slip away."



Seizing the moment,Katelyn asked, "How has Isaac been treating you lately? Has he grown suspicious?"


After a pause to think, Kaia shook her head."I don't think so. He's been cold and distant the whole time."



Katelyn's tone sharpened slightly. "Did he say anything about when Verena will return?"


Another shake of the head came, this time with irritation. "When he's home, he barely speaks except to Rhonda. He ignores me completely, eats in silence,and then disappears into his room. From the looks of it,Verena isn't coming back soon."



A faint arch of Katelyn's brow came with a bitter laugh."Whether she returns soon or not makes no difference."



Her voice was so quiet Kaia leaned in. "What was that?"



"Nothing." Katelyn's smile turned smooth as she said, "Kaia, I have something I need you to do."


At once, Kaia straightened, eager to please. "Just tell me."



If not for Katelyn's earlier warning to wait, Kaia would have already tried to deal with Verena herself.


Watching her eagerness, Katelyn's lips curved slightly.The pieces were aligning-only the final move was left.



From her purse, she drew out a neatly wrapped white packet and passed it to Kaia. "When Isaac returns tonight, pour this into his drink."


Taking the packet, Kaia glanced down with curiosity in her eyes. "What is it?"



A sly smile tugged at Katelyn's lipsas she murmured,"It's an aphrodisiac."



Shock flickered across Kaia's face; she hadn't expected Katelyn's fixation on Isaac to run this deep.



Noticing the reaction instantly, Katelyn tilted her chin with pride and remarked, "I told you before-whatever I set my sights on, I'll claim, no matter the cost."



To Kaia, it made little sense. Why devote herself to a man bound to a wheelchair? Yet Katelyn had always been the figure she admired most,so helping her was the only choice Kaia felt she had.



Her head bobbed quickly. "Don't worry. I won't fail you."


After a moment of thought, she added, "Once Isaac takes it, do you need me to do anything else?"


Katelyn gave a slight shake of her head. "Just call me right away. I'll handle the rest."


"Understood," Kaia replied with a firm nod.


When the details were settled, Katelyn dismissed her."You should leave before someone gets suspicious about your absence."



Trusting the advice, Kaia rose and gave a quick wave."Alright, I'm going."




···


In Clokron, at that very moment, a photo appeared on Verena's phone.



The image showed Katelyn with Kaia.


A message followed from Griffin Briggs, a detective,saying, "Kaia met Katelyn at Stellar Restaurant. I saw Katelyn give her something that looked like a packet of medicine."
###Chapter 167 Flip The Table On Them
When Verena read the message, she felt no storm in her heart. She had already foreseen that once Katelyn learned she was abroad, she would seize the moment to act.



Opening the attached photo, Verena studied it intently,her eyes sharp as a blade.



Katelyn, just like her, was a doctor. She had slipped medicine into Kaia's hands, who was now living at Seraphina Villas and could easily approach Isaac.



The intention behind that medicine seemed painfully clear to Verena.



She reached for her phone to call Isaac, wanting to sound the alarm.



But the call never connected.



After a pause to gather her thoughts, she dialed Bobby instead.



He answered at once, pleasantly surprised. "Verena,is this real? You're actually calling me?" A soft chuckle escaped her lips. "Yes, it's me."


Bobby's voice bubbled with excitement. "Isaac told me you were overseas.When are you coming back?Once you return, I'll treat both you and lsaac to a meal."



Moved by his warm sincerity, Verena agreed, "It should only be a few more days. I'll reach out when I return."


The idea of sharing a meal with his flawless sister-in-law had Bobby practically walking on air. "Perfect,then it's settled. You mustn't go back on your word."


Verena laughed lightly before her tone shifted to seriousness. "Bobby, before that, I need you to do me a favor."


He replied eagerly, "Of course, Verena. Just say the word."



Verena explained, "Since Kaia moved into Seraphina Villas, I've been keeping an eye on her. MMy detective just informed me that she met Katelyn, who handed her a packet of medicine. No doubt it's something shady. I tried reaching Isaac, but he didn't answer, so I'm telling you instead."



Hearing that Kaia and Katelyn were working hand in glove, Bobby cursed. "Those two women are truly birds of a feather-brazen enough to scheme against  Isaac! I'll teach them a lesson this very instant!"



As he made to rush out, Verena stopped him,saying,"Bobby, don't be reckless. I already have a plan."


His curiosity piqued, Bobby quickly asked, "What's the plan?"


Verena's lips curved into a cold smile. "Go to Seraphina Villas, but don't interfere with Kaia's actions.Let her believe her scheme is working,and then we'll flip the table on them. Once she slips the drug, find a reason to lead her away. By then, Katelyn should appear, and you can..."


Bobby listened closely, and by the end he was both impressed and proud. No wonder she was his perfect sister-in-law-calm in the storm and able to turn danger into opportunity.



With admiration swelling, Bobby pounded his chest over the phone. "Leave it to me. Don't worry, I'll make sure Isaac comes to no harm."



Hearing his confidence,Verena burst into laughter.







Kaia returned to Seraphina Villas and spotted Isaac's car in the garage-proof of his return.



Inside the living room, she found him seated on the  sofa,absorbed in a financial newspaper.



He didn't so much as glance her way or ask where she had been, and even Rhonda didn't greet her.


A suffocating weight pressed on Kaia; never before had anyone treated her as if she were made of air.



Just as she was about to flare up, Rhonda's cheerful voice rang out. "Mr. Bobby Bennett,what brings you here?"



Kaia turned her head and saw Bobby stroll in, hands buried in his pockets.


She frowned faintly. Why had Bobby come at this hour?



Bobby shot her a scornful glance, and then said brightly to Rhonda, "Just dropped by for a meal and to check on lsaac."



Rhonda chuckled heartily. "Well then, perfect timing.One mnore dish and everything's ready."


Isaac looked up at his brother. "Does Mom know you're here?"



Clicking his tongue, Bobby dropped into the seat beside him. "I'm not a child who reports every move to our mother." Isaac lowvered his head again and continued with his paper.



Suddenly, Bobby seemed to remember something."Hey, is your phone dead? I called earlier but you didn't pick up."



Isaac instinctively reached for his pocket, and then paused before replying, "I left it in the car."


"Oh, I see." Bobby quickly handed over his phone,brimming with fake enthusiasm. "I found a few sneakers I like, but I can't decide. Mind giving me your opinion?"



Isaac's brow furrowed. Bobby never hesitated when it came to spending money, so his hesitation now had to mean something.



Sure enough, when Isaac looked at the phone, a line of text flashed before him. "Verena told me Kaia,under Katelyn's orders, plans to drug you. I'll lead her away later-someone else will handle the rest."



Danger flickered in Isaac's narrowed eyes.


Yet he swiftly masked it, remarking casually,"They're all good.Why not buy them all?"


At that moment,Kaia leaned forward curiously. "Isaac,what are you two discussing?" Bobby quickly pocketed his phone and shot her a dismissive look. "Even if I told you, you wouldn't get it."


Her enthusiasm smothered under a cold refusal, Kaia clenched her teeth but forced out a brittle laugh.



"Dinner's ready," Rhonda announced.



Ignoring Kaia, Bobby wheeled Isaac to the dining table.


Though her stomach churned with frustration,Kaia plastered on a smile and followed.


After dinner, night fell.


As Isaac was about to enter the elevator, he told Bobby,"Stay downstairs for a while. I have some work to finish."



When the doors closed, Bobby stretched out on the sofa,absorbed in a game.



Rhonda cleared the dishes and warmed a glass of milk for Isaac, as Verena had instructed before leaving-knowing warm milk eased his sleeplessness.


From the moment Rhonda began tidying, Kaia's eyes searched for a chance to slip in the drug. But with Rhonda bustling about and Bobby seated in the living room, no opening appeared.



Her patience thinned, until finally Rhonda left the  warmed milk on the counter and disappeared into the restroom.



Kaia's eyes gleamed. From the corner of her gaze,she checked on Bobby-he was sprawled on the sofa,exclaiming now and then, "Awesome!" at his game.



Seizing the moment, she drew out the packet and poured the powder into the milk, stirring quickly to disguise it.


The toilet flushed. Kaia hurried back to the coffee table, lifting a cup of water and sipping slowly as if nothing had happened.



In her mind, the plan was flawless.



What she didn't realize was that Bobby had seen it all reflected on the wall opposite.


Moments later, Rhonda emerged and carried the milk upstairs.



Kaia prepared to follow, but Bobby suddenly stood and called her over.



She froze, forcing a smile. "What is it?"


Bobby feigned urgency, pulling her toward the door."Ah! I nearly forgot something important-just came back to me now!" Irritation flashed across Kaia's face. She longed to hurry upstairs, yet Bobby was dragging her out."What's so urgent?"



"Slater asked me to fetch you," Bobby insisted."Said there's something he needs to consult you about."



Kaia frowned.Slater wanted her advice? Then she remembered Verena treating Barrie. Could it be his illness had returned?



Her voice trembled with curiosity. "Is something wrong with Barrie?"



Bobby hesitated briefly, and then nodded. "Yes, it's about Barrie. Aren't you studying medicine? Go take a look."



Hearing that, Kaia sneered inwardly. So Verena's so-called cure was nothing but a bluff.With Verena gone,she alone could save Barrie.



A smug smile tugged at her lips.


Bobby, watching her, felt disgust coil in his chest. He had never met such a self-satisfied woman.



But the task now was to lead her away. He bundled her into the car and drove off.



Minutes later, Kaia remembered Isaac. By now, he  must have already drunk the milk.


Thinking this, she secretly texted Katelyn before locking the phone screen.


In the rear-view mirror, Bobby caught her movements and smirked. He almost laughed aloud at their foolishness-they were digging their own graves.




...



Katelyn, upon receiving Kaia's message,hurried to Seraphina Villas.


The house lay quiet as she called out, "Kaia?"



No reply.


Her eyes narrowed. Could it be...


She suddenly burst into laughter. Never had she imagined that foolish Kaia, instead of ruining things at the crucial moment,would present her such a gift-clearing the path so she alone could have lsaac.
###Chapter 168 My Answer To Her Trap
Before heading upstairs, Katelyn quietly commended Kaia in her heart and sent her a quick message.


"In two hours,make sure you bring Danica over."


Within moments of sending it, Kaia responded with a brief,"Okay."


Slipping the phone into her pocket, Katelyn started up the stairs.



Since Kaia had already described which room belonged to Isaac, she walked straight toward it.


When she eased the door open, she found the curtains drawn tightly,leaving the space in shadow.


Only the faint glow from the hallway allowed her to see the outline of a man stretched out on the bed.



The sight ofIsaac, the man she had admired for so many years, made her heart race wildly, and color rushed to her cheeks.



Even though she was certain he had taken the drugged milk, caution still lingered, and she moved  carefully,afraid someone might hear.



Once she shut the door behind her, only his dim figure remained visible.



But that indistinct silhouette alone was enough to ignite the emotions she had long suppressed.


Bending close, she stroked his face and pressed her lips against his.


Soon after, desire overtook hesitation, and the night took a different turn.




...


Kaia accompanied Bobby to Slater's residence.


When Slater appeared from the stairs and caught sight of her behind Bobby, his expression tightened."Why did you bring her here?"


His voice carried disdain, yet Kaia chose to interpret it another way. She convinced herself he was only too embarrassed to admit he needed her help after he posted on social media to expose her lies.



Before Bobby had the chance to explain, Kaia spoke first. "Slater, pain in the legs isn't something to overlook. Why don't you allow me to check on your grandfather's condition before it gets worse?" Her poise and warm demeanor caught Slater off guard,leaving him staring for a moment before he blurted out, "What are you talking about?"


For an instant, Kaia looked uncertain, and then quickly composed herself with a smile. "Isn't your grandfather sick?"



Leaping to his feet, Slater jabbed a finger in her direction and yelled, "Kaia Willis, listen to me! My grandfather is in perfect health. Say something like that again, and you'll regret it!"


The words left Kaia stunned, and once she pieced it together,she whirled on Bobby with fury. "You tricked me?"



With a casual shrug, Bobby replied, "Maybe I misheard.My mistake."



Color rushed to Kaia's face, her hand trembling as she jabbed a finger at him. "You!"



The realization struck her hard-Bobby's sudden friendliness had been nothing but a setup to humiliate her.



In a fit of anger, she stormed out without so much as a backward glance.



As her angry figure disappeared, Slater frowned,  sensing that something wasn't quite right.


He turned to Bobby and asked, "What's this about? Did you deliberately play her?"



Putting on an air of mystery, Bobby answered,"Too complicated to explain now. I'll tell you later."


Left fuming with no outlet, Kaia thought about calling friends to drink away her anger, but the reminder that she had to speak with Danica kept her from doing so.



Instead,she treated herself to dessert at a restaurant and,once the time was right, hailed a cab toward the Bennett Mansion.



Inside,Danica was in the middle of a beauty treatment when the maid came to announce Kaia's arrival.Reclining with a beauty device in hand and the television on, she sneered, "What does she want now?"”



Danica had never liked Kaia, and with Verena in the picture, her opinion of the woman had only worsened.


In a respectful tone, the maid explained, "She said it concerns Mr. Isaac Bennett."



That name made Danica's brows knit tightly. "Isaac?"



Though the quarrel with Isaac earlier still stung, Danica couldn't forget he was her son. No matter the rift, a mother's instinct wouldn't allow her to ignore any  news concerning him. And since she was aware Kaia lived at Seraphina Villas, if Isaac's health was somehow at risk...



After thinking for a moment, Danica instructed, "Let her come in."



The maid gave a small nod. "Yes, ma'am."


Moments later, Kaia hurried through the doorway.


Casting a cold glance her way, Danica asked, "Talk.What's wrong with lsaac?"


Still catching her breath, Kaia blurted out, "Mrs.Bennett,Isaac...Isaac and Katelyn..."


She let her words trail off, her expression deliberately troubled.



Danica's hands stilled and she sat upright, her tone sharp. "What about Isaac and Katelyn?"



With fingers twisting together, Kaia pretended to hesitate before saying, "They were... in bed together."


Danica's eyes widened as she shot to her feet. "What did you just say?"


A deep breath steadied her, and then she asked urgently, "Are they at Seraphina Villas now?" 
Kaia bobbed her head again and again. "Yes."



At once, Danica brushed past her and snapped to the maid, "Prepare the car."



Before long, the vehicle stopped at the entrance of Isaac's villa.



Danica all but ran inside. She stormed upstairs to the master bedroom, shoving the door wide open.


Already positioned against the man's chest, Katelyn lifted her head at the sudden noise. Playing the part of a frightened doe, she whispered, "Mrs. Bennett,don't blame Isaac. We lost control of ourselves..."



When Danica switched on the light, a storm of emotions surged through her. "Isaac, you actually-"


She cut herself off mid-sentence, her brow furrowing."Wait. Who is this man?"


With a faint smile,Katelyn retorted, "Don't tell me you can't even recognize lsaac?"


But when her eyes shifted upward, her expression froze in place. The man beside her wasn't Isaac at all.She had been in bed with someone else.



Silent and unreadable, the man lay there as though he had simply completed an assignment. Several seconds passed in eerie quiet before Katelyn suddenly shrieked.



She scrambled back, clutching the sheets around her.



"Mrs. Bennett, I swear it was Isaac!" Katelyn's voice wavered,shrinking lower with every word.



Isaac would never allow another man inside the bedroom he shared with Verena. This had to be orchestrated. The man hadn't uttered a sound the whole time.



The realization struck her, and she cried out, "I understand now! Isaac planned this. He trapped me!"



Danica's expression was impossible to read as she turned her gaze on the stranger. "Tell me, who are you?"


Bearing marks of intimacy across his chest,the man sat up and lowered his head respectfully. "I'm Mr. Isaac Bennett's bodyguard."



With anger rising in her chest, Danica asked sharply,"So this really was Isaac's doing?"



Before the bodyguard could answer, a calm but commanding voice cut in from the doorway. "Yes. I arranged it." Both women snapped their heads toward the source of the voice.



At the sight of Isaac sitting in his wheelchair at the doorway, fully dressed and composed, Katelyn nearly collapsed under the weight of despair. "Why? Why would you treat me this way?"



Danica's reproach followed quickly. "Isaac, do you realize how cruel this is to a woman? How could you put Katelyn through such humiliation?"



His eyes hardened, his voice like ice. "Cruel? You're my mother, yet you judge me without a shred of truth.Did it occur to you that she schemed against me first,and what you're seeing is my answer to her trap?"



Earlier tensions between them only fueled Danica's fury, and she retorted, "Even if that's true, you went too far! How can she show her face again after this?"



Isaac let out a sharp scoff. "If I hadn't fought back,I would have been the one lying in that bed. How do you expect me to face Verena after that?"
###Chapter 169 The Only Person You Can Blame F...
The moment Verena's name was mentioned, fury surged through Danica. "Verena, Verena, Verena-do you think of no one else anymore? You weren't always like this. Where did the steady, rational Isaac I once knew go? She humiliated you overseas with her betrayal, yet even after such disgrace,she's the only one you hold in your thoughts?"



Her words grew louder until they turned into a near shout,her throat strained and her body trembling from the force of her anger.


Isaac's expression remained unreadable, though the chill in his eyes was unmistakable. He responded with biting sarcasm,his words cutting through the air,"You believe insulting my wife will make me abandon her?No,it only fuels my resentment toward you. She is my wife. If my thoughts are not with her, then who else deserves them?"



Stunned into silence, Danica could only fume, her rage momentarily choking her voice.



Meanwhile, Katelyn's face darkened, her jealousy twisting into something venomous. Kaia had already  told her lsaac always defended Verena,but hearing it firsthand was far more unbearable, filling her with hatred she could barely contain.



From the instant Isaac had appeared at the door, his eyes had never once rested on her. To him, she might as well have been invisible.


All her life, Katelyn had been spoiled and adored,every whim catered to by those around her-everyone except Isaac. They grew up together, and from the moment she first saw him, her heart had been lost.She chased him relentlessly through their school years,slipping love letters into his bag, trailing him home,and driving away any girl who dared show interest. For nearly a decade, she believed her persistence was wearing him down, that he would eventually return her feelings. But the day news came that he was married, it felt like the earth itself betrayed her. The man she had fought so hard to possess had become another woman's husband.



A wave of injustice consumed Katelyn. Watching something she longed for defiled by another was unbearable. She rushed back home and even went so far as to undergo surgery to restore her hymen before returning. Though she had embraced the freer lifestyle of her years abroad, for Isaac, she intended to present herself as pure and untouched. Yet the careful scheme she built collapsed under his cunning. 
The romantic evening she pictured with Isaac twisted into a cruel nightmare when he sent another man,a mere bodyguard, to her bed. Nothing could have been more insulting.



What once was admiration curdled into resentment and loathing. She hated Verena, convinced that without her, she would have been the one married into the Bennett family. And she hated Isaac too, for crushing the devotion she had carried for so long.


Whether Isaac ever accepted her no longer mattered.What mattered now was revenge-she would rather destroy their marriage than see them content.If they wished to parade themselves as a loving couple, then she would be the one to make them enemies, trapped in endless bitterness.



Katelyn's grip tightened on the bedsheet until her nails bit into her palm, but the sting was nothing compared to the hatred swelling in her chest.



She rose from the bed, her eyes burning with fury, and blurted out through clenched teeth, "Isaac, now l finally see who you truly are! I'll never forget the humiliation you've put me through tonight!"


Even as her words rang with fury, a small, desperate part of her still longed for him to admit fault, to soften,to comfort her. But Isaac gave her no such thing. His glance was cold,his tone harsher still. "The only person you can blame for this is yourself."
###Chapter 170 Plotting Something Else
Katelyn stood frozen, stunned by lsaac's reply. A heartbeat later, tears broke free as she let out a jagged laugh, her voice trembling. "So this is what l mean to you? A decade of love tossed aside with one heartless line."



His cold dismissal snuffed out the last spark of hope within her. What remained in her eyes was nothing but bitter hatred, glistening beneath her tears.


Before she could collapse into sobs, she spun on her heel and fled the room.



Isaac never so much as spared her a glance.



A heavy stillness settled over the space.



Danica turned her eyes on him. His stare stayed fixed straight ahead, sharp and unwavering,filled with stern determination.



Danica hadn't expected his earlier words to strike her so deeply. From where she stood, it was clear that Katelyn's love for him was real. Her approach might have been excessive at times, but there was no doubting the sincerity behind her devotion. Danica had  assumed that even if Isaac didn't return Katelyn's feelings, he would at least hold a measure of sympathy for her after all those years of commitment.Yet, to her surprise, he remained distant and cold, his response as blunt as ever.



Her emotions tangled into knots. She simmered with anger over his blind loyalty to Verena, yet uncertainty clouded her thoughts about how to navigate the mess with Katelyn.


Letting out a weary sigh, she walked out without another word.



As soon as Danica left the room, Isaac instructed Rhonda to have the master bedroom cleared and every item replaced by the next day.


Rather than stay there, he retreated into the study for the night.



He wanted no reminder of Katelyn left in his space.



Until every trace of her was erased, he refused to step inside that bedroom again.



He powered up the computer and turned to work.



But Bobby's earlier revelation drifted back into his thoughts-Verena had been the first to uncover the conspiracy plotted by Katelyn and Kaia. That memory brought a faint curve to his lips as he sent her a video call request.



In an instant, Verena's poised face appeared on the screen.



His chest tightened as he realized two days had passed since he last saw her.


"Is it all settled?" Verena asked, her smile carrying quiet confidence.



Her question was vague, but lsaac needed no further explanation.


A nod from him followed. "Katelyn even dragged my mother in to watch everything unravel. Both ended up storming out-Katelyn in tears, and my mom right behind her."



A cold laugh escaped Verena. "Let her deal with the consequences. If Katelyn chooses to play dirty,she ought to accept what comes with it."



Even from across the world, the fact that Verena was keeping watch for his sake left Isaac feeling deeply cared for.



His gazelingered on her, full of affection. "You're the reason I saw through their setup, sweetheart. I didn't let them get to me." Hearing such sincere words from him for the first time since his memory loss, Verena's laughter bubbled up,genuine and bright.


She grew serious, her eyes steady on his. "But we can't afford to relax. Katelyn's plans might run deeper than this. Honestly, I doubt a woman with her pride can accept you with your current condition..."


Just then, Verena caught herself, regret flashing across her face. "Sorry. That wasn't fair of me."



Noticing her slight frown, Isaac offered gentle reassurance. "Didn't you promise you'd help me get better? We're partners-there's no reason for you to tiptoe around me."


After all, Verena had already given him a sense of security and courage. If he still retreated into old insecurities, the problem would lie with him, not her.


Verena's happiness was unmistakable when she saw that lsaac wasn't as fragile as before. She added,"Here's how I see it: Katelyn's definitely plotting something else. Back when I was around, she never stopped looking for ways to get you to accept her as your doctor. With me gone, she's got one less obstacle. It's hard to believe she'lI just let this chance slip by. Plus, Danica's opinion of me has soured, so with Katelyn's influence, your mother could easily be roped into something against you." Isaac let out a dry chuckle. "So what's next? Is my mom going to slip me a drug and tie me down sO Katelyn can operate?"



With a knowing smile, Verena simply replied,"Anything's possible."
###Chapter 171 She Could Not Go Through With The Plan
After their shared laughter faded, Verena remarked,"Once I've taken care of things here, I'll have Tobin step forward and set the record straight. You won't have to face criticism or ridicule anymore."



A gentle warmth colored her tone, and her gaze softened with concern for him.



Intensity burned in Isaac's eyes as he replied, his voice unhurried, "People's opinions mean nothing to me.The only thing that matters is whether you let me into your heart."



Layers of feeling resonated in his words.



Their eyes met for a moment, and then Verena dropped her gaze, a smile playing on her lips.



···



At the Fuller family's estate, chaos ruled the living room-broken dishes and shattered cups littered every corner,sharp fragments glinting on the floor.


Servants lined the walls in uneasy silence, not daring to intervene. Despair echoed through Katelyn's cries. "Why? Why?"


Without hesitation, she hurled another vase across the room, the porcelain exploding into shards on impact.



"Why must my devotion be met with cold dismissal?Why!" Her hoarse voice filled the room as she grabbed another vase and dashed it to the floor in fury.



Spent from her outburst, Katelyn slumped into the sofa,energy utterly depleted.


Long minutes passed before she could collect herself,clutching desperately at what little reason she had left as she reached for her phone and called Danica.



Hatred for lsaac and Verena simmered, but Katelyn knew she had to focus on the bigger picture. If Isaac could treat her with such cruelty, she would be just as ruthless. Once, she'd dreamed of healing him and building a life together. Now, with his love fixed on Verena, she'd make sure to grant their wish-by ensuring Isaac never left the operating table whole.No woman would stay by a man trapped in disability forever. Isaac might rely on Verena now, but she'd see to it he watched Verena's disgust and abandonment firsthand.


 
Danica's voice came through the line, asking,"Is that you,Katelyn?" Although she tried to sound polite, Katelyn couldn't conceal the rough edge in her voice as she responded,"Yes, Mrs. Bennett. It's me."



That strained tone was all Danica needed to understand the extent of her tears.



Tightening her lips, Danica offered gentle advice."Katelyn, sometimes you need to let things go."


Bitterness twisted through Katelyn's mind at those words. Let go? What reason did she have to move on?



But outwardly, she kept her tone soft. "I know how Isaac feels, and I don't hold it against him. My mistakes are my own. I'll make things right. Still, Mrs.Bennett, Isaac's condition can't wait, and neither can our arrangement. Please see that everything is ready for him tomorrow night."



A pause from Danica followed-a hesitation she hadn't shown earlier.



Anticipating her uncertainty, Katelyn continued, "No matter how he treats me, lsaac has always been the most important person in my life."


Reluctantly,Danica gave a slow nod. "Alright. I'll stop by Seraphina Villas tomorrow."



Late the next afternoon, Danica arrived at Seraphina Villas just as Isaac's workday neared its end. Rhonda,meanwhile,was busy with dinner preparations.


Noticing the visitor, Rhonda was about to greet her,but before she could speak, Danica struck up conversation. "Something smells amazing. What's cooking?"



"Chicken soup," Rhonda said with a bright smile. "The ingredients are all fresh."


Scooping the soup into a bowl, Rhonda was about to serve when Danica stepped in. "Let me handle that.Go on with the rest of dinner."



With a small nod, Rhonda yielded. "As you wish."


Danica brought the bowl of chicken soup to the dining table but lingered there without moving for a long moment. Her fingers tightened around the bowl, and the crease in her brows revealed the weight of her unease.



Memories of Katelyn's recent behavior clouded her mind. She had watched that girl grow up and knew full well Katelyn wasn't the type to swallow mistreatment quietly. After the coldness she'd faced from Isaac,how could she truly wish him well? Anyone would expect anger, even a wish for revenge, not sudden forgiveness.



A jolt of fear ran through Danica. Sweat broke out  along her spine as the realization hit-she could not go through with the plan. Regardless of Katelyn's assurances, risking Isaac's safety was unthinkable.
###Chapter 172 I've Got A Job For You
Danica stood drifting in her own thoughts and didn't notice the door moving.


Rhonda stepped out of the kitchen holding a dish.When she spotted Isaac coming in, she gave him a warm smile. "Mr. Bennett, you're back earlier than usual. Your mother came by to wait for you. I just need to finish two more dishes, and then everything will be ready."


She set the dish down on the table and quickly disappeared into the kitchen again.



The sound of Rhonda's voice jolted Danica back to reality. At some point, the small packet of powder she was holding had torn open.



Panic hit her, and she tried to fold the packet closed before slipping it into her pocket. Her hands shook so badly that a faint sprinkle of white dust fell across the table.



Forcing herself to smile, Danica turned towardIsaac."Rough day?"


Isaac had remained there for some time, his gaze fixed  on her as she handled the packet. A cold heaviness slowly settled in his chest.



He remembered joking with Verena the night before,never once thinking his words might come true.



His stare locked on his mother, and disappointment colored his tone. "Mom, you'd rather side with Katelyn -even if it means working with her against me."



All color drained from Danica's face. She shook her head,terrified by the thought of what he believed."No, Isaac, that's not true. I didn't place my trust in Katelyn to hurt you. I believed her because she's Evelyn, the most renowned surgeon here and abroad.Everything I've done has always been for you."



The way she had fallen for Katelyn's pretty lies told Isaac that arguing further was pointless.


Hoping to avoid more conflict,he lowered his voice."Mom, go home. I can't look at you right now."


His expression carried a disappointment that pierced her heart. Fearful of losing him completely, she stepped closer. "Isaac, please believe me. I could never harm you. I admit I went along when Katelyn swore she could cure you. She told me if I slipped you the drug, you'd pass out, and then she could restrain you for surgery. At first I agreed. But after the way you treated her yesterday, I realized she no longer meant  you well. Once I understood that, I couldn't follow through. I swear I never intended to drug you. Just trust me this time."



Isaac's brow tightened, and he refused to listen further. "Rhonda,take her out."


When Isaac gave the command, Rhonda stepped out of the kitchen. She sensed the heavy atmosphere and wanted to ask, but she kept her thoughts to herself.


Instead, she walked forward politely and motioned toward the door."Mrs. Bennett, let me take you home."


Tears gathered in Danica's eyes. She opened her mouth to explain, yet the words never formed. Left without a choice, she turned to leave.



···


Once Danica returned home, her phone buzzed,and the name "Katelyn" flashed across the screen.


"Mrs. Bennett, did it all go according to plan?"Katelyn's voice carried a thrill she couldn't hide.



That burst of excitement confirmed everything for Danica. Katelyn never wanted to heal lsaac-she wanted payback.The surgery had only been an excuse.



The realization left Danica chilled to the bone. If she hadn't woken up to the truth in time, she might have  walked her son straight into danger.



While fear lingered, her heart burned with resentment toward Katelyn.


"Katelyn, I can't continue with this," Danica said with resolve. "Isaac and I are already fallingapart because of Verena. If I deceive him again, there won't be anything left to repair between us."



Katelyn's voice snapped, her patience breaking. "So you're quitting? Are you seriously saying your ties with Isaac outweigh his chance at recovery? Don't you remember what we're working toward? Once he's able to walk again, he'lI see you were acting out of love.How could you even consider giving up now?"



Her words grew sharper, carrying the tone of a scolding.


Danica stood frozen, shaken to her core.



Her doubts finally hardened into certainty. Katelyn's urgency had nothing to do with Isaac's health. She was scrambling, terrified of losing her chance, and that alone proved her true motives.



After her outburst, the silence on Danica's end stretched too long. Only then did Katelyn realize she had gone too far.



Danica's hesitation told Katelyn that her suspicions  might already be growing.


So what if Danica had doubts?



One mention of Evelyn's name would tear down her resistance. After all, nobody else in the world could repair Isaac's legs.


Katelyn swallowed her frustration and forced her voice into something·calm, though her words carried an edge. "Never forget that I'm the only one who can treat Isaac. I'm the leading expert in this field, and no one else can make the promises I can."


She gave the silence a moment to stretch, making sure the weight of her words settled.


Then she struck again. "Think it through. Would you rather cling to Isaac's wounded pride, or do you want him to stand and live like everyone else? You already know which answer matters most."



Her tone carried an air of superiority that scraped at Danica's nerves, yet she couldn't deny the truth in it.


From the day of the accident, she had searched for doctors far and wide. Every attempt ended in disappointment. Only Evelyn's name surfaced with hope attached to it.


And when it came to complete recovery, only Katelyn spoke with certainty. But now that things had reached this point, trusting Katelyn any longer felt like stepping into a trap.


Danica would rather see Isaac remain in a wheelchair than gamble with his life.



Besides, medical breakthroughs werealways happening.




Katelyn might be unmatched today, but someone new could appear tomorrow.


Still, regret clung to her, weighing her down.


With a heavy sigh, she gave the weakest excuse she could think of. "I'm not feeling well. We'll talk later."


She ended the call before Katelyn could get another word in.



Katelyn tried to speak, but the abrupt busy tone silenced her.



Her temper exploded. She flung the phone to the floor.





Pieces scattered as it broke apart.



Breathing hard, she clenched her fists until her knuckles gave a sharp crack.



The situation had shifted-using Danica as her way in  was no longer possible.



Another pawn would have to take her place.



As she considered her options, one name surfaced in her mind-Kaia.



The thought disgusted her. She despised relying on that foolish girl, but at the moment, there was no one else she could use.



Isaac's devotion to Verena ran too deep.



So be it. If he insisted on protecting her, then Katelyn would drag Verena's reputation through the dirt in Shoildon until the entire city turned against her. Let Isaac try to keep loving her after that.


The image made Katelyn's lips curl into a cold smile.She flipped open her laptop and pulled up the chat app.


Her fingers moved quickly as she sent a message,saying, "Kaia, I've got a job for you."



Kaia's reply came right away. "What kind of job?"



"Spread this news everywhere you can. The wider it goes, the better."



From her files, Katelyn retrieved the foreign report about Verena that she had kept for this moment.She attached it and sent it to Kaia.





Kaia's eyes widened in surprise before an eager grin spread across her face.





Kaia responded, "Unbelievable. So Verena's nothing more than some older man's mysterious girlfriend."
###Chapter 173 Men Queued Up Daily To Invite Her Out
Katelyn had no desire to waste time in idle chatter with Kaia; all she wanted was obedience. So, with a quick diversion, she texted, "Kaia,you won't let me down this time, will you?"



The last time Katelyn had ordered her to drug lsaac,Kaia never learned what had followed. Since Katelyn never mentioned it again, Kaia felt it unwise to pry.



Now that Katelyn was turning to her once more, Kaia took it as a sign of deep trust and assumed Katelyn and Isaac must have already shared intimacy.



Brimming with confidence, Kaia replied, "Don't worry.I won't disappoint you."


Katelyn's lips twisted into a mocking smile. How many times had this foolish woman failed her already? She could only hope Kaia wouldn't stumble yet again.


Once Kaia replied, she quickly forwarded the scandalous news to the chat group of the city's wealthy youth.


Within moments, dozens of messages poured in like a flood. Hearing the constant pings, Kaia sat quietly, savoring the uproar as though she were watching a stage play unravel.



"What?"



"Am I really seeing this? Verena is actually some mysterious girlfriend to an older foreigner?"



"Forget his age-Tobin is a giant overseas. Otherwise,how would Verena get entangled with him?"



"Who would have guessed Verena could be so reckless? Isn't she lsaac's wife? And yet she's having an affair abroad. Is the grass aways greener across the fence?"



"Hold it-Bobby's still in the group. Maybe watch your tongues."



As the saying goes, speak of the devil and he appears.


Bobby clicked the link, and his heart lurched. After a deep breath, he suspected it was nothing but fabrication. He trusted Verena too much to believe otherwise.



He fired back, "Why spread baseless rumors, Kaia? Are you so idle you've nothing better to do?"


His sharp rebuke made everyone realize Kaia was the one who had fanned the flames. The discussion flared anew.



"Right, wasn't there that time Kaia slandered her own sister? Could this be the same trick again?"



"Quite possible."



"I thought she had mended her ways after Slater put her in her place. Didn't expect her to stir the pot again."



"But did you watch the video? It's hard to fake that.Verena even held the man's arm-hardly a sign of strangers."



"Exactly. And didn't you hear him call her 'sweetheart'?Who calls a stranger that? Something is surely brewing between them."



"Come to think of it, that makes sense. But with the Bennett family's standing, why would she need to look elsewhere?"



"Simple-maybe she craved excitement. Besides,Tobin isn't just anyone. His influence abroad matches the Bennetts' at home."



With that, the young elites suddenly felt they understood:however wealthy or handsome Isaac was,with his current condition, he was not like other men and could not offer the kind of fulfillment a woman naturally longed for. As the gossip grew wilder, Bobby's fury boiled over.He tagged Kaia directly. "Kaia, are you courting disaster? How dare you frame my sister-in-law again?Wasn't the last lesson enough?"



Cornered, Kaia abandoned her silence and typed,"Sorry,everyone. I meant to delete the unfavorable news about my sister but mistakenly forwarded it."


Feigning innocence, she added sweet poison."Although I don't know why my sister would fall into such a roe, I still choose to believe her. Please, act as if you never saw this. I beg you-don't share it further."


She knew human nature well; the more you told these privileged rebels not to spread something, the faster they carried it like wildfire.



And so it reached Barrie's ears.


After he watched the video, Barrie's shock was great,but his faith in Verena was greater.



She had once saved his life, and gratitude bound him to defend her.



Fearing Danica might see the report and take it at face value,he rang her without delay.


When the call connected, he rushed out, "Danica,don't believe that foreign report.I assure you-Verena  is not such a woman. She'll never betray lsaac like that."



His voice grew steadier. "You may not know, but when Verena treated me abroad, countless young men of talent and wealth pursued her. I witnessed it myself.If she ever chose someone, it wouldn't be an older man.Most likely, she traveled for medical duty. Don't let this rumor cast a shadow-she truly is remarkable."


At first, Danica was puzzled, but once Verena's name was spoken, she realized Barrie had seen the same report.



His words overflowed with praise and trust so firm it stirred her heart. And indeed, if what he said held true,Verena did have better choices. The story seemed flimsy at best; it was unlikely Verena would trample the Bennett family's honor that way.



Her thoughts settled, Danica smiled and replied warmly, "Thank you for calling. Verena is my daughter -in-law-I know her well."



After a few more courtesies, Barrie-pressed with other matters-ended the call.


No sooner had he hung up than he dialed Isaac. As Verena's husband, Isaac had to trust her and mustn't be misled by the news.



When the line connected, Barrie wasted	no  time: "Isaac, did you see that foreign media report?"


To be clear, he added, "The one spreading lies about Verena and Tobin."



Isaac answered evenly, "I've seen it..."



Before he could finish, Barrie cut in. "It's false, every word! Don't believe it. Verena is not that kind of woman. You've-no idea-when she was treating me abroad, young talents and handsome men queued daily to invite her to dinner. She wouldn't spare a glance at a man so much older than her. These reports are just idle tongues wagging. Pay them no mind..."



Barrie's voice carried on, but Isaac had already seized on one point: young talents and handsome men queued up daily to invite her out.


His eyes narrowed, jealousy twisting in his chest. He couldn't help but wonder-had she ever accepted?
###Chapter 174 Tell Me The Truth
Verena was striking, polished, and talented-no wonder people held her in such esteem.


Yet Isaac, though he cloaked it well, felt a flicker of envy stirring in his chest, a shadow he dared not show Barrie.



Catching the urgency in Barrie's tone, Isaac knew the old man's concern was fixed on Verena. HHe kept his own voice calm, carrying warmth. "Barrie, don't trouble yourself. Verena is my wife. No one knows her heart better than I do, and I trust her completely."


That quiet certainty in Isaac's words drew out Barrie's hearty laugh on the other end. "Good, good! Trust is the foundation of everything. That's what most young couples today are missing. I'm glad you can trust Dr.Willis. Boy, it seems her care and effort on you have not been in vain."



Since Verena was tending to Isaac, Barrie gently shifted the subject toward Isaac's health. After a pause,he asked with caution, "Isaac, under Verena's care,have your legs shown any improvement? Is there still a chance you'll stand tall again?" Barrie had unwavering faith in Verena's skill. With her personally attending to lsaac, progress should have been only natural.


But his question was deliberate-it carried a reminder that Verena's gift as a physician was not to be underestimated or dismissed lightly.


At those words, lsaac's lips pressed together, and silence fell between them.



His gaze dropped, lingering on the area between his unmoving legs.


The world at large believed he was merely paralyzed.What they never knew was that the accident had robbed him of far more.



He sensed that Barrie wasn't only asking about Verena's treatment. The old man was also warning him not to mistreat her on the strength of idle rumors.



If Isaac admitted no progress to his legs, it would only deepen Barrie's worry about Verena.



After a long stretch of silence, Isaac finally spoke,his tone low but steady. "Our families have always been close,Barrie.I know you won't let this slip beyond us."



Confusion crept into Barrie's voice. "Isaac, what do you mean by that?" Drawing a slow breath, Isaac confessed, "To be honest, that accident didn't only cripple my legs. It left me with some issues in the private part."



Man to man, Barrie caught his meaning at once.


His jaw slackened, eyes widening with disbelief.


He had never imagined fate would strike lsaac with such merciless cruelty.



A sigh left Barrie, but Isaac did not sink into self-pity.Instead, a faint smile curved his lips, his words almost breezy. "But with Verena's treatment, those problems have been completely resolved. She also said that once she's back, she'll arrange surgery for my legs."


Stunned at first, Barrie soon erupted into delighted laughter.


Of course-this was Dr. Willis. She could mend even what seemed impossible.


And since Isaac was her husband, if she promised a surgery, then surely she already held confidence in its success.



Barrie's voice brimmed with excitement. "She's brilliant-simply brilliant! | always believed there was no illness beyond her grasp. Isaac, you'd better cherish her. If you let her endure even the slightest wrong,I'll be the first torise against you."


Had it not been for his own useless grandson, Barrie would long ago have wished for Verena to enter his family as a granddaughter-in-law.



Listening to Barrie heap praise upon Verena, Isaac's chest swelled with pride and quiet relief.


He replied, a soft smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, "Yes. The greatest blessing of my life was marrying her."



...



Meanwhile,Bobby-having spent hours sparring online with those wealthy young people-slumped across the sofa,utterly drained.



Annoyance gnawed at him. Running a hand through his hair, he scrolled through the earlierchatter in the chat group.



One wrote, "Not to belittle country folk,but let's be real-Verena never mastered proper etiquette.Honestly, her having an affair with some older man fits her perfectly."



Bobby shot back at once. "Nonsense! Verena is the most refined woman I've ever known!"



Another reply came swiftly. "Bobby, we get it-she's  your kin. But defending your family with such obvious lies? That doesn't help your case."



Reading that, Bobby nearly burst with rage again.


What did they mean by "defending his family with such obvious lies"?



He wasn't covering anything-he was telling the plain truth!



"That's utter rubbish!" he fired back. "She's my family.If I don't defend her, who should I defend-you? Keep slandering her and I'll see to it your family's business crumbles."



Fury burned in him, his temples throbbing. But no matter how fiercely he argued, fresh chat groups sprang up, tossing mud at Verena.


He could keep throwing counterblows, but he couldn't guard every gate all day and night.


Out of options, he punched in Verena's number.



She picked up quickly.



"Bobby, what is it?" Verena's voice was gentle, flowing through the receiver.


Half his anger melted away at once. Worried she might misunderstand, he rushed to say,"Verena, first of all, I trust you. Don't ever think otherwise!"



His nerves tangled his words, and Verena let out a light chuckle. "Then what's troubling you?"


At last, Bobby released his pent-up fury. "That foreign news story about you-Kaia's been spreading it everywhere. No one cares about truth; they just keep slandering you. I've been fighting back, but no one believes me. I know you'd never do such a thing. Tell me the truth yourself, so I can defend you properly."



His voice rose in passion, as though injustice itself was strangling him.



When she heard his fierce defense, Verena's nose stung with emotion.



Since her grandmother's death, no one from her family had shielded her so steadfastly.



A rush of warmth flooded her heart, sharp and overwhelming.



Blinking back the swell of feeling, she answered gently, "Bobby, thank you for standing by me. But you don't need to quarrel with them. Whatever you say,they won't believe it. Coming from the Bennett family,it will only seem like you're protecting your own. As for the truth, let me tell you now."


She paused before continuing, "I went abroad to treat Maxton Fairclough. But his younger son, Erick, didn't want him to recover. To lower Erick's guard, Tobin and I agreed that I would appear publicly as his girlfriend.That's why the foreign press ran that piece. The whole point was to deceive Erick. Don't worry, though.Everyone in business circles already knows Maxton's been in a coma. The surest way to crush the rumor is for him to wake up and, with Tobin's help,set the record straight."



Maxton Fairclough?


Bobby blinked, astonished. "You mean Maxton of Smoothdeed Group?"


Verena nodded. "That's righnt."


Bobby let out a low whistle. Of course he knew Maxton's legend.



But something else shook him even more. "So you went abroad to treat him! Has he recovered?"



A calm smile curved Verena's lips. "The surgery succeeded. He should wake soon. After a few more days of rest, he'll stand with Tobin to set things right."
###Chapter 175 | Need Some Dirt On Someone
Verena's voice came through with a casual ease, as if the conversation were no more important than idle talk about the weather.



Across the phone, shock lit up Bobby's features.


A wave of admiration swept over him; he was half-tempted to drop to his knees right there. "Verena,can you believe it? Dozens of experts tried and failed to help Maxton. Some even claimed he wouldn't see the end of the year. But you turned things around; you actually healed him! Honestly,you're a miracle worker!"


He rattled on with so much energy that Verena barely had a chance to respond.


"Hold on,I need to hang up now. I have to go brag to everyone about how my sister-in-law is the best in the world!"


Bobby didn't wait for her answer; he ended the call with a flourish.



Verena couldn't help but laugh at the abrupt dial tone.She had planned to remind him not to get too involved, but honestly, having a brother-in-law so eager to sing her praises felt surprisingly nice.He was certainly a step up from her own brother.



···


Wasting no time after the call, Bobby jumped into the wealthy young people's group chat to set the record straight.


His fingers flew across the keyboard. "All of you were wondering why Verena would bother with a man almost twice her age? Here's the real story:she went abroad to treat MMaxton Fairclough. That's right, the same Maxton who runs Smoothdeed Group. Pretty wild, huh? You're all well aware of Maxton's position,and the fact that plenty of schemers have their eyes on him. To keep these schemers from stirring up trouble or interfering with his recovery, Verena assumed this identity as a shield for her own protection."



He quickly sent another message. "So all those rumors? Pure nonsense! And here's the big news: she's managed to cure Maxton. Give it a few days, and he'll wake up to clear her name himself. Maybe think twice before you start gossiping; you're only setting yourselves up for embarrassment."



The chat immediately lit up after Bobby's bombshell.



"Are you serious, Bobby?" "Verena managed to cure Maxton? That just doesn't sound believable..."



"He'd been out cold for over six months, and even the best doctors couldn't crack his case. How could she pull off a cure after just a few days abroad?"



Many in the group had always been quick to doubt Verena, but there were also quite a few who trusted her skills.



"Isn't that going too far? Have you forgotten she's the one who saved Barrie?"


"Exactly! Barrie saw specialist after specialist, and not a single one could help, except for Verena."


"If she handled Barrie's complicated illness,maybe Verena isn't getting enough credit here."


Voices of support chimed in. "Bobby's not one to exaggerate. Maybe Verena really did go overseas for Maxton's sake."



A few, unfamiliar with Maxton's name, jumped online to dig up information. What they found left them speechless.



"Hold up, I just searched him. Over the past six months, every doctor who tried failed, and a few even lost their lives. Treating Maxton was no walk in the  park."


"No wonder Verena needed to hide her identity."



As the group's conversation shifted, with more members admiring Verena's courage and skill, Bobby read along, a proud grin spreading across his face.


On the other side, Kaia observed as the conversation turned,with most of the group members marveling at Verena's medical abilities while the few doubters were swiftly silenced.


"How did things turn around so quickly?" Kaia mumbled under her breath.



Her brow furrowed as she quickly sent Bobby's update over to Katelyn.



She followed up and asked, "Katelyn, do you think there's any truth to what Bobby said?"


Reading the forwarded chat, Katelyn's expression twisted with skepticism and disdain. The idea that Verena could heal Maxton was laughable. Anyone could make bold claims, but how could Verena possibly prove it?



Months ago, Tobin had asked Katelyn to help Maxton,but after looking over his files, she'd immediately declined the case. She knew there was no way she could save Maxton. Katelyn had never managed to help Maxton, yet now Verena, just a Pine Hill grad with nothing noteworthy to her name, was out here claiming she'd performed a miracle? If anyone was unremarkable, it was Verena.How could she have the nerve to make such wild boasts?



Katelyn scoffed to herself, brushing it off as nothing more than Verena's desperate bid to save her reputation. What nonsense.


With a faint, dismissive snort, Katelyn tapped out a message for Kaia. "Don't worry about it. Verena's all talk and no substance. All she does is run her mouth.Didn't she say Maxton would be up and about in a few days? We'll see if she can actually pull it off."



Kaia gave it some thought, and her earlier anxiety faded away.


The more she remembered the group singing Verena's praises, the more irritated she felt. She texted Katelyn back. "You're right. We'll sit back and watch her embarrass herself."




···


Meanwhile,the wealthy elites' online discussion about Verena's supposed affair with Tobin had reached Isaac's ears. He sat in his office, cool gaze dropped to the floor,a sharp edge in his posture.


There was no mystery about where this rumor had come from; Katelyn's handiwork was obvious.


While he'd never cared how Katelyn treated him,dragging Verena into her games was crossing the line.


Isaac's eyes narrowed at the thought. Overseas,Katelyn's antics had always followed her from one scandal to another, though in front of him, she never broke her innocent facade. But thanks to Stevie's long stay abroad, Isaac had heard all the real stories.


He considered his options for a moment, and then picked up his phone and dialed.


Stevie's voice came through the line, easy and teasing."What's going on, man?"


Isaac got right to the point. "I need some dirt on someone."



Isaac didn't ask for help often, which only piqued Stevie's interest. "Who's the unlucky target?"


Lifting his gaze, lsaac replied, voice cool and steady,"Katelyn Fuller."



Stevie went quiet for a second, and then let out a  knowing laugh. "So you've finally decided to deal with your stalker."



Stevie wasted no time. By the time Isaac wrapped up his next meeting, a hefty folder had already landed in his inbox, overflowing with video clips, photos, and all sorts of incriminating material.


Isaac arched an eyebrow, his eyes narrowing as he scrolled through the evidence.



He pressed a button. "Jacob."


Jacob appeared at the door,ready for orders. "How can I help, Mr. Bennett?"


Isaac's words were measured, his voice tinged with chill. "Check your email. Take what I just sent and get in touch with some of the more influential entertainment agencies. Make sure the story comes out hard and leaves no room for sympathy."



Jacob nodded, accepting the task without question."Yes,sir."



He slipped out as quietly as he'd entered.


Leaning backin his chair, Isaac folded his arms and let his gaze linger on the newly received fie. If Katelyn wanted to turn his wife's name into tabloid fodder, she was about to find out just how ruthless public backlash could feel.
###Chapter 176 Katelyn's Scandal
Jacob wasted no time, pulling strings with the most reputable entertainment companies in Shoildon.



Before half a day had passed, scandalous reports about Katelyn spread across the internet like a raging fire in dry grass.



"The image of Shoildon's darling,Katelyn Fuller-once praised for her elegance and poise-has left the public reeling. She has been caught frequenting nightclubs and entertainment spots, always surrounded by men!"


Within hours, the story had surged to the very top of Shoildon's trending topics.



Anyone who clicked on the article was met with a barrage of photos and videos.


The first photo showed Katelyn in a nightclub,lounging on a sofa between two men. A row of shirtless, muscular men stood before her.


In the second photo, she straddled one man provocatively, her head tilted back,eyes heavy with intoxication and indulgence, as though savoring forbidden fruit. To any discerning eye, it was clear-  her actions spoke of anything but respectability.



Then came a video, more than ten seconds long.Though the bar's corridor was lit by dim, colorful lights, one could still see Katelyn entwined with a bearded man against the wall. As the clip ended, her hand slid slowly from his abdomen downward... The act was brazen, a complete contradiction to the image of a demure lady she had so carefully cultivated.


Next followed a few more photos, each showing her entering hotels with different men. In some,she was even accompanied by more than one at a time.



As soon as the news broke, the comments section erupted into a feast of gossip. To those in Shoildon's social circles-where Katelyn's upright persona had always been the talk of the town-it was like watching a porcelain mask shatter.


"Am I seeing this right? Is this really the gentle and elegant Katelyn?"



"Gentle and elegant? That was just her mask. The moment she left home ground, her true self showed."


"I knew it! She always struck me as pretentious."


"Notice anything? Not one man is the same. She's juggling partners like spinning plates-doesn't she worry about disease?" "If she worried, she wouldn't live so recklessly."


"Unbelievable! She's handling them like a professional entertainer."



"I can't stand hypocrites like her. She always acted like some untouchable saint, sneering at others for a little fun. But behind closed doors, she's no different from those she mocked."



"Right, just look at that second video-she's skilled,like she's done this a hundred times."



"Wasn't she once the picture of purity, throwing herself at lsaac with such persistence that all of Shoildon knew of it?"


"I used to pity her, thinking Isaac was cold. Now I see -it was all an act. She's nothing short of a stage actresS."



The comments section was flooded with ridicule toward Katelyn.



Across group chats too, the buzz about "Katelyn's double face" grew louder, especially among the wealthy youth who had brushed shoulders with her before. Their words cut sharper than knives.



"I thought my friends were outrageous, but compared to Katelyn, they're tame." "Exactly! Just days ago, my mom praised her, telling me I could never match her. Now? I can't stop laughing-I'm definitely not that promiscuous."


"Same here. She was always the 'perfect daughter'parents admired. Who knew she hid such scandal?"


Hearing her phone buzz relentlessly, Kaia assumedit was another storm of insults aimed at Verena.



She grabbed her phone, only to be stunned-every message was about Katelyn.



She logged onto social media and saw the trending post.


Her eyes widened as she clicked and watched,disbelief spilling from herlips.


"No... this can't be Katelyn," she murmured to herself,disbelief filling her eyes.



Her idol had always seemed beyond reach, as though carved from a pedestal of virtue. How could she be painted with such wanton colors? Young men she might have understood-but older men too? It was beyond imagining.


Kaia thought it through and scrolled back in her group chat. The conversation had originally centered on Verena's troubles. Then suddenly, the internet  exploded with Katelyn's scandal, burying the previous gossip. Such a drastic shift couldn't have been coincidence. Someone must have deliberately unleashed Katelyn's dirt to drown out talk of Verena's affair with Tobin.



Her thoughts fell neatly into place. To Kaia, there was no doubt-this was Verena's handiwork. Who else would be cunning enough to twist the situation? She must have hired people to smear Katelyn, to shift the spotlight and save herself.



Kaia's impatience boiled over. This had to be handled at once, or the damage to Katelyn's reputation would be irreversible.



She forwarded the trending post to Katelyn, adding,"Katelyn, this must be Verena's scheme. She's pulling strings to smear you. You need to act fast and put an end to this!"



When Katelyn saw the message, her mind went blank.For a heartbeat she stood frozen, overwhelmed.Because deep down, she knew-this was no fabrication. Every photo, every video... had really happened.


Rage swept through her like a storm. She slapped a cup off the table, face flushed scarlet, her voice breaking into a roar. "How? How could this happen?Who did this?" Who had betrayed her? Who dared to expose it?



Yet before her anger had fully taken shape, another blow landed.



On social media, a second story surged to the very top.





"Katelyn favors both young and old-never refusing anyone! Truly the 'pure and seductive' woman of Shoildon!"



A chill crawled through her at the words.



She clicked it open, and what she saw drained the strength from her legs. She slumped heavily onto the sofa.



This time,the gallery contained more intimate photos,with men far older than the rest. Three photos were of the same man, taken from different angles-he looked at least sixty.



The new revelation caused a bigger storm than the first.



Crowds multiplied, even people who had never heard of Katelyn before joined in the ridicule.



"I thought the clip of her reaching into a man's pants was the peak of scandal-but this tops it." "My word! With men this old? It's revolting."



"She's chasing thrills in the most questionable wNays.Imagine the germs."



The insults poured in, sharper and uglier with each refresh.



Then one user noticed something.



"Wait-doesn't this old man look like the director of Cloverland Hospital abroad?"



"Who is he? Is that someone important?" another asked.



"Of course! Every medical student knows him-his textbooks are torture."


"Hold on, I think I saw an old report about him. He's a giant in medicine. Let me dig it up."


Soon enough, someone unearthed an article-an interview with none other than the director of Cloverland Hospital.


"It really is him! Katelyn was entangled with someone that high up in the field?"
###Chapter 177 Heartless



After this bombshell hit the internet, users swarmed the comments section,their words dripping with irony and ridicule.



Those in the industry who knew Katelyn couldn't resist spilling the truth.


"If I recall, isn't she employed at Cloverland Hospital?No wonder she rose so high."


"I thought her success came from extraordinary skill.Turns out, it's her talent for winning favors that's extraordinary. She plays her cards well."


"Her family bragged endlessly about how she walked straight into Cloverland Hospital right after graduation,a place others could only dream of. And in just two years,she became head of the department. Back then,I wondered how she managed it. Now the fog has cleared-it was all strings pulled behind the scenes."



"Wait a minute! Isn't the hospital director already married? And his wife isn't someone to be trifled with."



"You're right. I live in Clokron, and the director's wife commands one of the strongest underground networks here. By clinging to the director,Katelyn has set herself against a stone wall."



"Unbelievable. Katelyn really dares to walk on thin ice.Isn't she afraid of payback?"


Scrolling through the comments, Katelyn felt her chest tighten, her hands trembling so badly she could scarcely hold her phone.


The line "Isn't she afraid of payback?" echoed like a bell in her ears, sending a chill down her spine.


When she first entangled herself with the director,she had weighed the risks of discovery. Yet at that time,securing a post at Cloverland Hospital meant more than fear of exposure.


She had acted with painstaking caution,convinced no one would ever uncover her secret.


But now...



Katelyn dared not finish the thought,swallowed whole by a storm of dread and rage.


At last, she clenched her teeth and hissed, "Verena...this must be Verena's doing. She's the one behind it all..."



Buzz...buzz...


Her phone suddenly rang, startling her so much she nearly dropped it.


Clutching it tight, she glanced at the screen, bit her lip,and braced herself before answering.



"Mom,what's wrong?"



No sooner had the words left her lips than her mother's icy voice cut in, sharp as a whip."How dare you ask me that? Tell me, what is this trending scandal online? And what's going on with those men in the photos?"


Dahlia Fuller, decisive and commanding by nature, had a presence that silenced rooms. When she scolded,the weight of her authority crushed like a mountain.


Katelyn shivered beneath her reprimand, her voice breaking. "Mom,please,let me explain."


But Dahlia was too furious to hear her out; rage made her dizzy. She cut in sternly, "After all the years we raised you to walk the straight path-is this your repayment? Do you know your father has collapsed from the shame you've caused?"



Drawing a sharp breath, Dahlia pressed on, "From childhood, we gave you everything, never denying you a thing. And this is how you repay us? Deeds so sordid we cannot lift our heads? Do you know no shame at all?" 
Tears blurred Katelyn's eyes, regret and pain spilling over as she cried, "Mom!"



"Don't call me Mom!" Dahlia shot back<like lightning."I have no daughter like you. Once you brought me pride,now you bring me disgrace."


Katelyn shook her head in desperation, her sobs choking. "Mom, listen, it's not what it seems..."



But Dahlia had already verified the photos and videos.They were genuine, and so she hung up coldly,refusing another word.


The abrupt end of the call left Katelyn hollow,as though the floor had caved beneath her feet.


And in truth, her world was crumbling.


The scandal spread like wildfire, aided by Jacob's contacts who released it overseas with precision.


It wasn't long before the wife of the director of Cloverland Hospital heard of it.



Known for her demand for perfection,she wasted no time. She ordered the media to publish Katelyn's dismissal.



Amid her panic, Katelyn read the foreign reports with trembling eyes: she had been publicly expelled by the  director's wife.



One calamity piled upon another.



Even with her strong will,she could not withstand blow after blow.



She had returned to the country dreaming of curing Isaac and remaining by his side.


If she failed to win him, she could still flee abroad,living in comfort and basking in envy.


That was why she had not resigned her post-only applied for a year's leave, quickly approved thanks to her ties with the director.



But now Isaac despised her, her parents turned their backs, society scorned her, her job abroad was ruined,and she was hunted by the director's wife.



Each blow fell like thunder upon her head, leaving her dizzy, staggering.


She clutched her collar, agony tearing at her. Her chin quivered, lips bitten until blood welled, and at last she broke into sobs.



Moments later, she bit down hard, forcing the tears back. This was no time for weakness.



She sniffled, steadying her breath, willing her frantic heart to calm, and pushed her mind toward the question of survival.


Her reputation had to be salvaged.



With her disgrace spreading both at home and abroad,no safe haven remained.


Still, she told herself, "Restore your name, and everything may yet change."


To do so, she needed to uncover the hand behind the trending storm.


Just as she prepared to call for an investigation,another call came.



"Isaac?"



Seeing the caller ID, her brows furrowed deep.



Why would he call now, of all times?


A dreadful thought seized her, making her heart lurch.


She answered, her voice sharp with accusation."Isaac,was this your doing?"


Isaac didn't deny it. Calmly, almost coldly, he said,"Yes. It was me."



Katelyn's anger flared. Her voice shook as she demanded, "Why? Why would you ruin me like this? How can you be so heartless?"



Isaac's lips curved into an indifferent smile. "Heartless?I only gave you a taste of your own medicine.You smeared my wife, fanning the flames of slander.As for you,I merely uncovered the truth."



His words cut sharper than a knife. Katelyn's pride crumbled under the weight of his cruelty.


"Isaac, we grew up together. Do you really have no regard for our past?"


But Isaac's reply was colder still. "I warned you not to lay a hand on my wife. You chose to ignore me,leaving me no choice. Continue to meddle, and you'll see how far my patience stretches. I will not hesitate to strike at the Fuller family itself. What you suffer now is only the beginning. Out of respect for your parents, I've spared the Fuller family. But defy me again, and you'll lose not only reputation, but wealth and standing.You will no longer be the Fuller heiress."



His voice carried the chill of winter, devoid of warmth.



Katelyn stood rooted in disbelief, unable to accept that lsaac would go to such lengths for Verena.
###Chapter 178 Wait For The Moment You Tell Me...

Katelyn's jaw clenched tight, fury blazing in her chest,her eyes smoldering with defiance as a storm of tangled emotions coiled around her heart.


Anger,fear, and pride gnawed at her ribs like restless wolves.



Isaac's warning left her cornered. She knew he wasn't bluffing, and she also knew the Bennetts carried enough weight to crush the Fullers without lifting a finger.


Her parents were already brokenhearted because of her disgrace. She couldn't let them bleed further on her account-and she couldn't afford to lose the one thing that kept her afloat: her place as the Fuller heiress.



For her, the road had narrowed into a dead end.



Even if her reputation crumbled, her status had to remain untouched.



Without the Fuller family, she would be reduced to nothing but dust in the wind. Her parents might be disappointed now, but she was still their only daughter. Whatever storms came, they would never truly cast her aside.



Biting down her humiliation, Kately forced herself to yield. "Isaac, you win. I've lost. From today on,I won't go after Verena again. But remember your word-don't lay a finger on my parents."



The words left her mouth, but her heart refused to bow.



Once the storm passed, she vowed she would strike back.



Isaac read her too well. His voice remained steady, like cold iron. "I don't believe you."


Rage flared in her eyes, and she snapped, her voice breaking into a shout. "What's that supposed to mean?Didn't you call just to make me promise to leave Verena alone? I've already agreed! What more do you want from me?"



Isaac's tone cut like frost. "Leave the couuntry."



What?



Her mind stalled for two seconds before panic spilled out. "Isaac, you're driving me to the edge! You leaked the news-you know the hospital director's wife has the underworld in her palm. She's merciless. If I leave now, I won't even make it out alive! I can't leave!"


Isaac's voice stayed cold, every word deliberate."Whether you live or die is not my concern. All I want is for you to leave this country. Clokron is not your only path-choose any place you like. Just never show your face here again."


His stance was unyielding, leaving no room for plea or compromise.Katelyn realized nothing she said would shake him.



Grinding her teeth, she finally muttered, "My passport's expired. Give me a week to prepare. Once time's up, I'll leave."



..-


While scandal roared across Akoitha like wildfire,Clokron was quiet.


At the Fairclough estate, Verena had just finished washing up when a servant came dashing toward her.


"What is it?" Verena asked.


The servant panted, breathless with excitement."Evelyn, Maxton-he's awake!"



The moment the words hit her ears, Verena didn't hesitate.She hurried toward the hospital in the estate. Tobin's eyes lit up when he spotted her. Relief flooded his face as he rushed forward. "Evelyn, my father just woke up. Please, examine him-see if there are any complications."


Verena slipped on the sterile gown and mask a nurse handed her. "Very well, Mr. Fairclough. I'll go in and check. Wait outside."



Tobin nodded at once, his whole face glowing with hope."Yes,yes-thank you,Evelyn."


Twenty minutes later, Verena pushed open the ward door.


Tobin darted forward, his voice anxious. "There's nothing else wrong with him, is there?"



Removing her mask, Verena offered a reassuring smile."He's recovering well. Only some post-op precautions remain-I've already explained them to the other doctors. For now, simply spend more time with him."


Hearing that there were no other complications, Tobin exhaled deeply, relief and admiration mingling in his gaze.



His voice brimmed with gratitude. "Evelyn, please,make more requests. I want to repay you properly!"

 
"This is my duty," she replied calmly. After a pause,  she added, "I ask only one thing-when your father regains strength, stand beside him before the media.Tell them clearly that I was here to treat him, and that the treatment succeeded."



Tobin nodded without hesitation, almost stumbling over his words. "Of course! You needn't even request it-we'll proclaim this good news ourselves!" Later, back in her room,Verena called Isaac.



"Isaac, I've got good news," she said with a quiet smile."Maxton is awake. A few more days of rest, and he'll be ready to face the press with Tobin. Once the truth is out, no one will dare mock you or the Bennetts again."



Isaac knew Maxton-one of the great legends of commerce.



He had heard of his illness, but never dreamed Verena would cure in mere days what had baffled countless doctors for months.



A tide of pride, joy, and astonishment surged through his chest.



It wasn't doubt in her skill, but awe-she had accomplished what others could only call impossible.To him, it was nothing short of a miracle. From the heart, Isaac praised her. "You're remarkable.You must have hardly rested. It's been hard on you."



Verena laughed softly, accepting the compliment."I've rested well enough. I was only worried you'd be troubled by the rumors swirling about me."


Her voice was gentle, almost languid, as though she were leaning against the pillows while she spoke.


Isaac lowered his eyes. He knew she was worried about how he was affected by the rumors.



And he, in turn, had kept her shielded.



He hadn't mentioned that Katelyn was behind the rumors, nor that strangers had maligned her name.


He didn't want her weighed down by shadows while she worked.



Now that the matter was settled, she would soon return.



Isaac steadied his heart, his gaze unreadable.



In a voice low and steady, he confessed, "It's been too long since I've seen you. I miss you. How much longer before you come back?"



His tone dipped at the end, faintly pleading.The sound  brushed against her heart like a whispered secret. Verena touched her ear, her cheeks flushing with warmth.



"Soon. At most, three days."



She hesitated, and then added gently, "Isaac,there's something you don't know. I'll tell you in person when I'm back."



It was time-time he learned she was Evelyn.



The assassination attempts had been one reason for silence.



But the greater reason lay in her own trembling hands.She hadn't been sure she could heal Isaac swiftly.



Everyone knew the name Evelyn. Everyone knew the legend attached to it.



If she had taken on that identity yet failed to cure him after a long treatment, the disappointment would have crushed both Isaac and Danica.



The weight of such expectation might have hindered his recovery.



Besides, back then, she hadn't been strong enough to withstand the pressure.


After all, she had once failed someone she loved. She couldn't risk failing again. But now, her hands were steady and she had saved Maxton. She finally had the courage.


When Verena promised to tell him something upon her return, Isaac didn't press.



He only nodded, his gaze soft, his voice gentler still."Alright. I'll wait for you to return-and for the moment you tell me yourself."
###Chapter 179 Trolls



Katelyn's scandal dominated the social media platforms, and it was all anyone in Shoildon could talk about.


Of course, Danica had come across the posts as well.


As she scrolled through the articles, her eyes widened,and a sudden wave of self-mockery washed over her.


Could this really be who Katelyn was?


Had she been foolish enough to fall for someone like that?



The realization struck Danica hard-she had misjudged Katelyn completely, and shame burned in her chest.


The more she thought about it, the more she doubted everything Katelyn had ever told her. Even her claim about being Evelyn now seemed suspicious.


As she recalled the bitter arguments she'd had with Verena because of Katelyn, guilt pressed heavily on her.



Danica admitted to herself that she had been reckless,too quick to latch onto empty words, too willing to be swayed by Katelyn's confidence. Now regret gnawed at her. She understood she had wrongly accused Verena, guided only by Katelyn's lies.



And she wondered just how deeply Verena must have been hurt back then.



Resolving to make it right, Danica told herself that once Verena returned, she would find the courage to apologize and ask for forgiveness. Otherwise, the weight of guilt would stay with her forever.


In the meantime, the backlash surrounding Katelyn kept growing louder, and when Kaia realized there was no indication of it dying down, unease crept over her.It felt as though she were standing right in the middle of a raging storm, unable to find shelter.



How could she not worry?


To her, Evelyn had never been just an idol. In a moment when Kaia had no direction in life, Evelyn's guidance had pushed her toward medicine,giving her a purpose and a dream to chase.



To Kaia, calling Evelyn her source of strength wasn't an exaggeration at all.


So when people started dragging Evelyn's name through the mud, Kaia refused to stay silent.



Not willing to watch her idol be insulted, she opened her laptop, switched to an alternate account, and slipped into a popular forum.



Her fingers tapped quickly across the keyboard as she wrote a post. "This whole mess just keeps getting better. Who would have thought Shoildon's high society could be tangled up in so much drama? First,everyone learned that Verena, the wife of the Bennett family's eldest son, was having an affair with an older man abroad. Then, almost immediately after,all the gossip about Katelyn's personal life exploded.At this point, whether those stories about Katelyn are true doesn't even matter anymore. It's obvious she's being pushed forward as the perfect scapegoat. In just a matter of hours, the attention shifted completely from Verena to Katelyn, leaving Verena untouched. That alone makes it seem very likely that the rumors about Verena are real."



The thread blew up almost instantly.



The first reply read, "This actually makes sense.Everyone's focus really has shifted. And honestly, the timing of the breaking of Katelyn's scandals is way too convenient."



Another user chimed in, "I agree. The original poster nailed it. Katelyn isn't even a celebrity, yet her so-called scandals came out one after another. It's obvious someone wanted to bury the story of Bennett Group CEO's wife." A third response followed. "The bigger question is who's pulling the strings-the Bennett family or Tobin Fairclough."



And then someone else added, "Does it even matter who? What's obvious is Verena has serious backing,and Katelyn ended up as the fall guy. Poor girl got dragged into something way over her head."



Bobby had only been half-paying attention to the drama, scrolling casually. But when he stumbled onto that thread, fury surged through him.



Snatching up his phone, he sent an angry comment."So now you're saying it doesn't matter whether Katelyn's stories are true? How does it not matter?What a joke. What do you want us to believe-that she's clean? Are you one of her paid trolls? Spare me and get lost!"



Kaia responded indifferently, "I'm just a random bystander throwing out guesses. Why are you so worked up? Unless Verena paid you to defend her?"


Back when Kaia followed Katelyn's scheme to drug Isaac, she slipped home right afterward, wanting to avoid any suspicion.



At her own home, she wasn't nearly as guarded as she had been at Seraphina Villas, leaving her bedroom door slightly open. Carrying a tray of fruit, Laura walked upstairs and nudged the door wider before setting the plate on a nearby table.



Her eyes caught Kaia's frantic typing, and curiosity made her glance at the glowing screen.


When she saw the forum post Kaia had written, Laura touched her shoulder lightly and said in a low, worried voice, "Why are you meddling in this? Isaac barely stopped pressing our family, and now you're poking the fire again. If this gets out and he decides to retaliate, our business will pay the price. Your dad won't forgive you for that."


Kaia barely reacted, her fingers still flying across the keyboard.



Laura studied her carefully but saw no hint of regret in her expression.



It was obvious Kaia still held deep resentment toward Verena.



By then, the rumor about Verena having an affair had spread like wildfire. Alec, when he heard it, only muttered a curse, called her a disgrace,and moved on.His attitude was detached, treating it as a nuisance that embarrassed him rather than a crisis worth addressing. Laura herself didn't make much of a fuss either,choosing instead to observe quietly while the drama grew.


What she failed to realize was how much Verena's past actions had scarred Kaia, leaving bitterness that lingered long after.


Still protective of Kaia, Laura softened her voice and said, "Verena's scandal is already big enough. The Bennett family won't let it slide, and neither will Isaac.You don't have to waste your energy trying to make her look worse."



When Kaia jumped in to defend Katelyn, Laura cut in coldly. "Katelyn's family has nothing to do with our business. Let them fight their own battles-we're better off just watching from the side."



The truth that Katelyn was Kaia's idol never crossed Laura's mind, and Kaia saw no reason to explain,choosing instead to keep scrolling through the comments.



Laura took Kaia's silence as agreement. Her eyes skimmed the posts about Verena, and a bitter laugh escaped her. "How did I end up having a daughter with no shame? If I'd known she'd turn out this way,I should've left her behind the day she was born. Then I wouldn't have to deal with her disobedience now." Kaia wasn't the only one who resented Verena. Laura's dislike was just as fierce.



She still remembered how, when she had humbled herself enough to ask Verena to come back home,Verena had treated her with nothing but cold distance.


That memory only made Laura's hatred sharper.


A mocking smile tugged at her lips as she added, "So she saved Barrie. And what of it? A scandal like this will bury her. Even if there were ten Barries, they wouldn't be enough to clear her name."


At that, Kaia's mouth curved in faint agreement.


Together, mother and daughter stared at the computer screen, their faces alight with expectation,as though they were waiting for Verena's downfall to unfold right before them.


Two days later in Clokron, Verena carried on with her daily checkups for Maxton. The rest over the last few days had worked wonders; the man looked far stronger than when he had first opened his eyes.His fatigue had faded, and even though his gaze was still clouded, it shone with renewed vitality.
###Chapter 180 To Challenge Her Is To Declare War On...
After completing Maxton's medical examination,Verena carefully set aside the instruments and offered him a reassuring smile. "Your condition has improved remarkably, and there are no abnormalities in your body. You may leave this ward whenever you wish."



Maxton, who had weathered the storms of the business world for most of his life, had the great perceptiveness for detecting the faintest shifts in the air around him.



When he first opened his eyes, he noticed only his eldest son Tobin by his side. His younger son, Erick,was nowhere in sight, and the absence stirred unease in his heart. At the time, however, weakness chained his tongue, leaving him unable to ask questions. Now that strength had returned, those questions pressed forward.



He suspected Verena, who had witnessed much,might hold the answers.



Turning toward her, he asked with quiet gravity,"Evelyn, during my coma, did anything happen that l should know about?" Faced with his inquiry, Verena chose not to conceal the truth.



She took a seat nearby, composed herself, and began slowly, "I suppose it's only a matter of time before you discover this. So,allow me to speak plainly..."


She then explained how Erick had obstructed Tobin's attempts to find doctors for him,how she had been forced to pose as Tobin's girlfriend to deceive Erick,and how, once the truth came to light, Erick had threatened the lives of all three of them.



Maxton listened, and though his face remained calm,his heart tightened. He had always known Erick to be ambitious, bold to the point of recklessness, and scheming far beyond his years. That was precisely why he had hesitated to hand the company reins to him.Tobin's steady hand could steady storms; Erick's temper was a fire that could consume alL.Yet,never had he imagined his own son would cross such ruthless lines. Even the simplest of creatures knew to honor their parents-yet Erick...



The revelation left Maxton disheartened, though anger simmered beneath. Still, in front of Verena-the savior who had brought him back from death's door -he swallowed his fury and instead managed a smile.



"I never thought matters had taken so many twists and turns, nor that Erick would go so far as to hunt you  down. It is truly my failure as a father. For the trouble you've endured, I owe you an apology."


"Treating patients is my duty," Verena replied softly."Yet because of all this, my family has been unfairly dragged through the mud by public opinion. So I must humbly ask that you and Tobin stand forward and clarify the truth before the media."


Before falling into a coma, Maxton had believed he might never wake again. Thus, his survival felt like borrowed time, a second life gifted to him. Having valued his life before, he now cherished it all the more.To him, Verena was no less than the hand that pulled him from the abyss.



He nodded at once, his gray brows lifting with fervor,his tone ringing with determination. "Rest assured, I will give you my full support. Not only will I explain everything clearly to the public, but I will also see to it that you return home crowned with honor, so those who gossiped dare not utter another word.I want them to recognize your worth, to admire you, to respect you!"



Verena chuckled softly, thinking he might be overdoing it. Just as she was about to gently decline,Maxton raised his voice toward the door."Tobin, bring in the most reputable, truth-seeking reporters in Clokron for an interview." Tobin entered then,looking weary, as if he had rushed in after tending to endless tasks.



Indeed, he had just wrapped up arrangements-yesterday he had instructed his assistant to contact reporters, and today he brought them over, briefing them thoroughly.


Hearing from the servants that Verena had finished examining his father, he hurried back to the ward.


Standing by the bed, Tobin spoke respectfully."Father, everything has been arranged. The reporters are ready. Whenever you wish, we can begin."



...


Before the formal interview began,Maxton repeatedly urged Tobin to ensure the media's questions emphasized Verena's exceptional skill, encouraging them to ask more in that direction.



His words overflowed with praise, almost lifting her onto a pedestal.


Listening at the side, Verena grew slightly uneasy.Smiling faintly, she interjected, "Maxton, I understand your gratitude, but isn't this a bit exaggerated?"



"Exaggerated?" Maxton countered with a hearty laugh,stroking his beard with pride. "This is not exaggeration  but truth. I lay in illness for over half a year,and not one physician could help me. Yet you came, and in a matter of days, you cured me. Tell me, is that not something worthy of boasting?"


Tobin nodded in full agreement, his smile warm.Noticing Verena's continued modesty, he gave her shoulder a light pat. "Don't worry, Evelyn. We'll keep it balanced-there's no danger of us going overboard."


The smile deepened the creases at the corners of Tobin's eyes, reflecting his lifted spirits.


Verena pressed her lips together and nodded quietly.She only hoped they would indeed stay within bounds.


The interview was arranged in the grand hall of the Fairclough estate.



By the time the doors opened, reporters were already gathered, cameras raised, lenses flashing.


With Tobin supporting him, Maxton walked slowly along the carpet toward the stage.



The sound of shutters echoed continuously as Maxton's figure appeared.


The reporters, nearly restless with anticipation,seemed ready to rush forward with questions.



Tobin cleared his throat and began the opening  remarks."Ladies and gentlemen,Iam Tobin Fairclough,General Manager of Smoothdeed Group. Half a year ago, my father suddenly fell gravely ill. Though countless renowned doctors tried, his condition remained hopeless.Yet fate took a turn-or rather,my father's fortune did-for just days ago, Evelyn Rowe arrived."



Here he paused, glancing at Maxton, his eyes shining with sincerity. "Under her treatment, everything changed. My father is not only cured but fully recovered in every respect. I know you all have many questions. Please, feel free to ask, and my father and I will answer as best we can."



The reporters froze in disbelief. Evelyn Rowe? Did Tobin just say Evelyn Rowe? The Evelyn who had solved countless medical mysteries in Clokron?



They had been invited merely to interview the chairman of Smoothdeed Group about his recovery and the company's future. They never imagined stumbling upon such a bombshell.


Though Evelyn was not a business magnate,her name alone carried weight-an enigma, a healer whose hands had worked miracles time and again.



The moment Evelyn's name was mentioned, the reporters surged forward like a tide, crowding around Tobin and Maxton, microphones and cameras in hand. The real treasure was Evelyn's story, and they were determined to unearth every detail.


The room erupted into chaos, questions hurled all at once,leaving neither Maxton nor Tobin able to catch a word.



Maxton raised his hand, gesturing for silence."Everyone, I understand your eagerness. But let's proceed one at a time. All questions will be answered."


Order was restored.Maxton gestured toward the left side. "We'll begin with the reporter on the left."



The chosen reporter asked quickly, "Mr. Maxton Fairclough, is this Evelyn Rowe the internationally renowned healer people speak of?"



The same thought burned in every reporter's mind,and all eyes fixed on Maxton.



He nodded with a smile. "Yes, it is indeed her. I believe only she could possess such remarkable skill."



At this, the room stirred with excitement.



Evelyn's name alone could ripple through every circle,and now she stood tied to Maxton-it was a storm waiting to break.



Another reporter pressed on, "Mr. Fairclough, your  confidence in Evelyn's medical ability seems absolute.Should we take this as you regarding her as your savior?"



The question was clearly one Tobin had arranged, for such personal wording rarely arose otherwise.


Maxton laughed aloud and replied, "It is not blind faith -it is earned faith! She proved her worth by curing me.Otherwise,would I be standing here, answering your questions with such vigor?"


His voice rose, ringing clear. "Furthermore, I, Maxton Fairclough, believe in repaying grace with loyalty.Evelyn saved my life. She is not only my savior but also an important friend to the entire Fairclough family."



A third reporter asked sharply, "Are you implying, then,that the Fairclough family is openly backing Evelyn to the outside world?"



The question hung heavy, and silence filled the hall.



Clearly,this too had been prepared by Tobin.



Maxton's answer came firm and unyielding. "This is not implication-it is declaration. Let me take this moment to state it plainly: No one will dare to disrespect Evelyn. Whoever dares provoke her will face the united strength of the Fairclough family.For to challenge her is to declare war on us." His words struck like a gavel, final and thunderous.The reporters' shutters clicked wildly, eager not to miss the climax of the day.
###Chapter 181 Interview





A reporter leaned forward and asked with curiosity,"Mr. Maxton Fairclough, Evelyn has always been mysterious, and the public is eager to know more.Since you and your son know her personally, could you tell us what kind of person she really is?"


The question was exactly what Maxton wanted.Smiling broadly, he responded in his warm, booming voice, "Evelyn's medical skills are extraordinary.She's not only a gifted healer but also someone with a heart full of kindness. That's what makes her so admirable..."



As he grew more animated, his compliments poured out endlessly, and it was as if he'd forgotten the true purpose of the interview-to address the rumor tying Verena to Tobin.


From her seat in the corner, Verena could only watch the scene unfold, her expression tinged with resignation.


Nearly thirty minutes slipped by, and still neither Maxton nor Tobin had mentioned the scandal involving her.


Frustrated, she pulled out her phone and quickly typed a reminder to Tobin, saying, "Please, stop praising me and get to the main issue."


Clinging to the hope that he'd notice, she looked up again-only for Tobin to chime in with the same glowing praise. "At first, I thought Evelyn was distant and unapproachable. But once I got to know her, l realized she's genuine, honest, and humble. Even with all her accomplishments, she never lets pride get in the way. She has so many qualities worth admiring..."


Both father and son seemed completely swept up,their faces flushed as they went on and on about her virtues.


It suddenly hit Verena that they had turned off their phones before going on stage, leaving them unable to see her desperate message.


Letting out a small, resigned laugh, she leaned her forehead against her hand, her gaze dropping with amusement.


Like father, like son. Neither could stay on track when it came to her.


She couldn't help but think-were these really the same legendary businessmen she had read about?


Neither of them resembled the men described in the reports.


The interview was being streamed live.


Because both Maxton and Evelyn were highly influential, the broadcast caused an immediate stir across Clokron and even Verena's homeland-Akoitha.


In Akoitha, chat groups lit up in every circle.


One chat group, made up of Shoildon's wealthy young elites, was buzzing louder than the rest. "Have you seen that live broadcast from the foreign press?"


"Yeah, I'm watching right now. Didn't expect that."


"So Bobby swore Verena went to treat Maxton, but on camera, Maxton clearly said it was Evelyn who treated him. Not even a mention of Verena. Did Bobby get played by his own sister-in-law?"


The conversation leaned heavily toward the idea that Bobby had spoken up just to protect the Bennett family's reputation.


But since Bobby was in the chat himself, no one dared to laugh at him outright. Instead, the digs were aimed sideways at Verena.


When he noticed the messages, Bobby chimed in,"My sister-in-law told me herself she treated him,and I believe her. She wouldn't lie to me."


His words landed flat, though. The others carried on without acknowledging him.


"She could've at least come up with a story that made sense. Who's going to believe that?"


"Everyone knows she's having an affair with Tobin.What's the point of pretending otherwise? She's only making herself look pathetic."


"Now she's the one who looks like a fool. Honestly hilarious!"


"Even when Bobby said it, I thought it was odd. The Fairclough family wouldn't call in some unknown doctor. If they needed a physician, they'd bring in an expert like Evelyn, someone with real authority."


"So this is what people mean when they talk about putting on an image of perfection while behaving differently behind the scenes. She tried so hard to protect her spotless reputation, but alI she managed to do was leave herself open to humiliation."


The group filled with sneers and mocking comments,but a few sharper voices started to question things.


"Hold up-let's think about this. Verena left the country, claiming she was treating Maxton. Then, in that live broadcast, Maxton himself confirmed Evelyn treated him. What if Verena and Evelyn are actually the same person?"



The remark stunned the group of wealthy youth into silence for a moment.



"You can speculate, but don't cross into the absurd!"one of them wrote.



"Where's the logic in linking the two?" another asked.


Still, a few voices hesitated, suggesting, "It might not be impossible. Verena did graduate from Pine Hill University. That has to count for something."


Others dismissed the idea with laughter. "So what if she studied there? If she were truly exceptional,the internet would already be full of her achievements.At her school she was practically invisible. Every top university has students who scrape by unnoticed."


"I agree with that. At best, Verena's skills are above average. If she were really outstanding, everyone in the circle would know her name already."


The conversation grew so ridiculous that one person finally interjected, "Forget about the scandal for a second. Do you realize this chat is now turning into an insult against Pine Hill's medical graduates?That's laughable."


Bobby had been ready to defend his sister-in-law,but when someone hinted Verena could actually be Evelyn, he froze and thought hard.


Verena wouldn't lie to him-she had said she went abroad to treat Maxton, using the story about being Tobin's girlfriend as a cover to protect herself from malicious attacks.



Now Maxton publicly claimed Evelyn had healed him.


Could it be that Verena and Evelyn were one and the same?



The more he considered it, the more thrilled Bobby became. His cheeks flushed, and excitement burned in his eyes. Meanwhile, Maxton's interview spread rapidly across group chats. Katelyn noticed the flood of speculation about whether Verena might secretly be Evelyn, and her nerves tightened.


Even with so much chatter, most continued to ridicule Verena-but Katelyn couldn't shake the uneasy feeling growing inside her.


She scoured the internet for every scrap of information on Verena and Evelyn, determined not to miss a single clue.



Her search ended with one firm belief: there was no way Verena could be Evelyn.


Once she settled on that conclusion, her lips curved into a cold, twisted smile.



She wasn't the real Evelyn, and Verena couldn't be,either.



There was absolutely nothing linking the two of them, and if Verena had really been Evelyn, she would have spoken up and revealed the truth the moment Katelyn confronted her. And if Verena had claimed it during the flood of online insults, nobody would have dared to mock her.
Her silence told the truth-she wasn't Evelyn.Why else would she keep quiet?
To Katelyn, it looked certain now: Verena had indeed betrayed Isaac. The idea that she was treating Maxton felt laughable, a pathetic excuse.
Tobin would never settle for someone like Verena. If Maxton needed help, he would only trust someone world-renowned-someone like Evelyn.
The thought of Verena's looming humiliation made Katelyn's chest tighten with glee. If Verena went down, the Bennett family would be dragged with her.Their downfall would be just as sweet to witness.
If she couldn't have happiness, then neither would Verena and Isaac.
A hideous grin tugged at Katelyn's mouth, and a wild gleam flickered in her eyes. Madness and satisfaction mingled together in her expression.







Meanwhile, Isaac followed overseas reports closely,his attention fixed on Verena since she had traveled abroad.After watching Maxton's interview, he pieced together the clues and reached a shocking realization-Verena and Evelyn might actually be the same person.



His mother's claim that Katelyn was Evelyn struck him as nothing but a fabrication, a scheme Katelyn had used to fool her.



When it came to Verena, though, he was convinced the Fairclough family had recognized her true identity from the beginning.


Isaac's eyes narrowed as he thought back to what Verena had said during their last phone call.


Was she trying to reveal something about being Evelyn all along?


The silence stretched before he finally released a faint sigh, his gaze dropping.


A storm of emotions swept through him-pride in her,bitterness at her secrecy, and disappointment that gnawed at him.


He couldn't tell which feeling weighed heavier, but his chest throbbed with an ache that words couldn't capture.


Verena turned out to be far greater than anything he had imagined.


She wasn't just gifted; she was a prodigy whose medical brilliance had already placed her far above others her age.


Isaac felt a surge of pride for her achievements,yet the thought of her hiding them left him unsettled.


The revelation hadn't come from her but from the world,and that stung.


Could it be that she did not see him as the most important person in her life, and that was why she believed he was unworthy of being the first to know? His dark eyes clouded as his attention shifted to his useless legs.


Someone as remarkable as Verena-would she really choose to remain with him forever? Could she truly be content tied to a man like him?
###Chapter 182 Gambling




Isaac realized that holding back his questions any longer would only damage both him and Verena.


That was why he chose to call her straightaway.


Across the sea in Clokron, Verena's phone lit up with Isaac's name. The sight of it brought a gentle curve to her lips.


She answered without hesitation, her voice tender as she said,"Isaac."


Hearing the sound he had longed for, lsaac felt the tension in his brow ease, though his eyes carried a deep ache.


His mouth set firmly as he asked in a steady,emotionless tone, "Are you Evelyn?"


The blunt question made it clearto Verena-he must have seen Maxton's interview and already connected the dots.


Catching the disappointment in his voice, she felt guilt rise inside her.


It was true. She had kept him in the dark.


Hidden away in a quiet corner far from the reporters,she spoke openly without bothering to lower her tone.


Her lips curved into a faint, resigned smile as she confessed, "I'm sorry. My plan was to wait until everything settled here before telling you myself.1didn't expect Maxton to skip clarifying my ties with Tobin and instead keep mentioning Evelyn. That was careless of me. Yes, Isaac, I'm Evelyn."


Since the truth was bound to surface eventually,denying it any longer served no purpose.


Isaac stayed silent on the line, but her words confirmed everything he had feared.


So this was the secret, hidden all along and revealed only now. Although he had already known what the answer would be, a quiet sense of disappointment still settled over him.



An indescribable weight spread through his chest as his hand curled tightly into a fist and his throat closed with unsaid words.



Isaac's voice came out rough as he finally asked, "If none of this had ever happened, would you have chosen to tell me who you really are?"


Verena hesitated, her silence carrying the weight of thought.



After a few seconds, she gave a firm nod. "I would."


That small delay, however, made lsaac believe she had been considering her answer carefully.


He could see that her certainty came from hindsight,and that only added to the heaviness pressing down on him.



His lips tightened as he spoke again, not as a question but as fact. "When you say you would,you mean only after everything was settled, you planned to tell me then, right?"


That was exactly what she had intended, and both of them knew it.



Isaac dropped his gaze, his throat moving as he swallowed hard.



"Verena, I told you before-you don't have to face everything by yourself. I'm your husband. I'm the one you can lean on. I'll stand behind you no matter what."



Isaac knew he shouldn't let his emotions get the better of him, that Verena had reasons for staying silent.



But the uneasy ache in his chest refused to fade.



The thought cut deeply-maybe in her heart he simply didn't matter enough.


If she had trusted him completely, she wouldn't have hidden her identity to avoid the fallout. Verena heard the strain in his voice and understood exactly what he was thinking.


She knew his doubts weren't without cause, and she accepted that part of the blame was hers.


With a quiet, remorseful tone, she said, "Isaac,you've got it wrong. It wasn't because I didn't trust you. I was wrestling with my own hesitation, and that's why I held back in the beginning."


Maxton kept speaking on stage, his words flowing smoothly, while Verena let out a quiet sigh. "Isaac,things here are urgent. I still need to clear up the situation with Tobin, and it's too much to explain over the phone. Can we talk it through properly once I'm back?"



Isaac replied, "Alright."


"Then I'll hang up for now."


As the call ended, Verena lifted her gaze to the stage where Maxton and Tobin stood.



Their enthusiasm only seemed to grow, both of them piling praise on her and avoiding the real issue entirely.


This couldn't go on.


She realized the interview might finish without the truth ever being addressed.


Sliding her phone intoher pocket, Verena stepped toward the stage.



At that moment, the reporters were fixed on Maxton's words, so when Verena appeared unexpectedly, heads turned in shock.


Surprise rippled through the room as they watched her stride forward.



She looked every bit the picture of confidence in a perfectly tailored suit, her elegance understated but commanding.


Her long, gently wavy hair fell loosely over her shoulders, uncovering the graceful lines of her neck and the refined shape of her collarbones. White stiletto heels elongated her figure, while the fitted trousers emphasized the length of her legs.


Her striking features carried a sharp poise with a subtle allure that drew every eye in the hall.


Normally, the reporters would have rushed to capture such a scene.



But this wasn't just any event-it was an interview with the chairman of Smoothdeed Group.



What on earth was happening?


Who exactly was this woman?


Why had security failed to stop her from breaking into Maxton's interview?



All eyes from the reporters turned toward Verena,filled with curiosity.


A few who recognized her spoke up.



"Isn't that the woman people have been gossiping about, the one linked to Tobin?" "That's right. Can you believe it? Tobin might have admitted it publicly, but she still doesn't hold any respectable title. And yet here she is, striding onto the stage like she belongs there!"


Her sudden arrival redirected every camera and every gaze. The initial surprise shifted into hushed murmurs; and soon their looks turned cold.


Did she have no sense of the occasion?



What right did a simple romantic partner have to come here trying to draw attention?


Couldn't she recognize her place?


The disgust wasn't limited to those in the room-viewers watching the live broadcast were just as scornful.



Inside the group chat for Shoildon's wealthy young people,questions started flying.


"What's happening right now? Anybody got details?"


Within seconds, a link was shared. Viewers who were already watching the interview reacted in shock, their voices filled with disbelief."No way.Is this actually happening? Did Verena really crash an event like this? Don't tell me she's already clashing with Tobin!"


One person commented, "Even if she and Tobin had a falling out, how could she try to make a scene at such an important event? There are too many cameras here."


Another voice cut in with disbelief. "That's ridiculous.With Tobin's power and reputation, what kind of romantic partner would even think of complaining?Your theories are insane."



Then the chat filled with a flood of the same message. "I get it. I get it. I get it..."


After spamming the line several times, the sender finally added, "Think about it. Having an affair is shameful, right? Nobody would be dumb enough to crash the stage for attention. But she walked up only after Maxton mentioned Evelyn. Come on! Doesn't that prove the truth is about to break out?" The sender's excitement was obvious.


For a moment, the group froze into silence, as if stunned.



As wild as the idea sounded, there was a trace of logic buried in it.


The more they thought about it,the more unsettling it became.



Hadn't Bobby insisted Verena was the one treating Maxton?



And now Maxton had just said Evelyn was the one who cured him.


The pieces suddenly clicked together in their heads.


Those who had mocked Verena earlier began to feel a creeping sense of unease.


None of them dared to admit it out loud, so they stayed quiet and waited for the situation to unfold.


Faces flushed with the sting of embarrassment, yet they still clung to the   hope that Verena was simply making a scene, banking on Tobin's support to storm the stage.


When the quiet dragged on for too long, a person who almost never joined in on gossip finally broke the silence. "I know we shouldn't make assumptions.But... I'm saying it now. Verena is Evelyn. I'm willing to bet a mink scarf on it."


Another chimed in immediately, "I'm in too. I'll wager a pair of boxing gloves that Verena's Evelyn."


Disbelief flared in the group. "Seriously? You're all betting on her being Evelyn? Fine, I'll throw my chips in as well."


###Chapter 183 Revealing Her Identity




Once the call with Verena ended, Isaac kept his attention on the live stream.



Verena had told him she needed to deal with urgent matters, so spotting her on stage didn't catch him off guard.


Still, after days of separation, with only a video call bridging the distance between them, seeing her appear through the broadcast felt strange and unexpected.


On the screen, Verena carried herself with a brilliance that seemed almost supernatural.


Isaac's lips curved faintly, his eyes softening as they lingered on her image.



···


From the moment Maxton uttered Evelyn's name, Katelyn hadn't dared to tear her gaze away from the broadcast.


Her breath caught when the camera cut to Verena.



Verena?



How could she possibly be there?


What in the world was she planning?


Katelyn's brows knitted tight as unease crawled through her chest, squeezing her heart until she could hardly breathe. The sense of dread prickled all the way to her scalp.


The whispers online calling Verena reckless and clueless for barging onto the stage didn't sit right with Katelyn.


She knew from experience that Verena wasn't a woman who acted without purpose.


Walking onto a stage of that magnitude without hesitation could only mean one thing...


The thought jolted her so badly that her complexion  drained of color. She quickly shook her head,muttering under her breath to calm herself.


"No, no, that's impossible. It can't be true!"


Her fingers clamped down on the table edge, nails dragging with a piercing screech. "She's just some obscure doctor. There's no way she's Evelyn. If she really were, then all those times I flaunted myself in front of her, all my efforts to win over Danica,would have been nothing but a cruel joke to her."


Katelyn whispered to herself over and over, but each repetition sounded less certain than the last.


She failed to notice the way her chin quivered or how all the color had drained from her lips.


She could accept losing to Verena who was shielded by lsaac, but to lose directly to Verena was unthinkable.



That would make her nothing more than a fool in Verena's eyes since the beginning.


Drawing in a shaky breath, Katelyn forced herself to  the idea that Verena could ever be Evelyn.


There had to be some other explanation for why Verena dared to step onto that stage.


Her gaze stayed locked on the broadcast, waiting anxiously for Verena to finally speak.


The audience, too, leaned forward, their attention riveted to the screen.



Plenty of people who disliked Verena were convinced she couldn't possibly be Evelyn.


They tuned in eagerly, hoping to see her stumble,humiliate herself, and get thrown out in disgrace.


Every eye in the hall and watching the live stream bored into Verena.



The reporters, who watched with a mixture of pity and scorn, were bracing for the moment Maxton would rebuke her and have security escort her away.


Instead, something no one could have predicted happened. Live on camera, Maxton's weathered face grew flushed, his eyes lit with unmistakable excitement,and he reached out to clasp Verena's hand.



The sight of Maxton eagerly holding onto her left the entire room stunned.



What had been expected to be her downfall suddenly turned into the most astonishing turn of events.



Everyone in the room knew the name Maxton Fairclough.



He wasn't just another wealthy man-he was Clokron's towering business legend, a figure whose reputation stretched far beyond the nation.


And yet, here he was, grasping the hand of a woman most had dismissed as insignificant, a woman with no public standing worth mentioning.


The sight left the reporters frozen, their jaws slack as if the scene defied reason.



One beat. Another.



A third.


Then came the sharp crack of a camera shutter.Click! Click...


The sound jolted the others, and suddenly the hall filled with frantic clicks as every reporter scrambled to capture the moment.


Their instincts told them this handshake was no simple courtesy. Maxton's eager expression, the spark in his eyes, spoke louder than words.


This woman could not possibly be just Tobin's romantic partner whispered about in rumors.


Meanwhile, in the Shoildon wealthy young people's group chat, the live broadcast sent shockwaves.


Those who had mocked Verena moments ago now felt an icy weight settle in their chests.


Maxton's demeanor made everything clear, and it was obvious to anyone with sense that he held Verena in high regard.


Still, denial clung stubbornly to them; they wouldn't admit the truth until it was spoken outright.


Every eye in the hall and watching the live stream fixed on Verena once more.


She remained steady on stage, her posture graceful,a faint smile curving her lips as she faced the cameras after Maxton released her hand.



"Good day, everyone," she announced, her voice steady and confident. "First of all, I want to express my gratitude to Mr. Maxton Fairclough for his generous words and for acknowledging my contributions to the field of medicine."



Maxton stood at her side with a warm smile, nodding several times in quiet agreement.


"But let me be clear," Verena said, her tone calm yet firm. "Mr. Fairclough agreed to accept this interview so that certain rumors about me could be addressed.You've all read the gossip linking me to Mr. Tobin Fairclough."


The press stared at her, puzzled and eager to make sense of her words.



What did she mean by "Maxton acknowledging her contributions to the field of medicine"?



Why was she suddenly talking about rumors?


Was she admitting to being tied to Tobin...


Wait! No... Could it be that she was...


The implication hung heavily in the air, and the sharpest minds in the room already suspected the answer.



"That's correct." Verena raised her voice just enough to carry through the room, her bright smile never faltering as she continued, "Tobin and I are not involved in the way some might think. My presence here has nothing to do with that and is actually for another purpose. I'm mainly here to oversee Maxton's treatment. However, Maxton became so enthusiastic about praising my work that he overlooked explaining the situation, so I felt it was better to step up and clarify things myself."


Verena's lighthearted tone carried a hint of humor,and it was only then that Maxton realized his excitement had led him to gush about her skills without addressing such an important point.



Her light remark drew a ripple of chuckles, while Maxton, realizing his oversight, rubbed his forehead in embarrassment.


"Ah, that's exactly it. I let myself ramble and nearly forgot the main point," Maxton admitted with a hearty laugh before turning to the crowd. "Allow me to clarify once and for all. This young lady is Evelyn Rowe, my attending doctor, and she has no connection to the gossip about my eldest son."



The declaration stunned the audience. Jaws dropped, and the room filled with an almost audible gasp as the revelation settled in.



Evelyn? She was Evelyn?


The revelation left everyone stunned.


The elusive physician who had remained hidden for years was suddenly revealed as a strikingly young woman. Her appearance alone was enough to leave jaws hanging.


The exposure of Evelyn's identity carried even more weight than the announcement of Maxton's recovery.


Maxton's awakening was surprising, yes, but Smoothdeed Group had long been stable under Tobin's leadership, so his condition hadn't threatened the company's strength.


Whether he recovered or not, the group would have endured.


The moment Verena's identity surfaced, however,chaos broke out. Reporters swarmed forward,shoving microphones in her direction as if afraid to miss a single word.


"Miss, are you really Evelyn Rowe?" one of them asked eagerly, his camera trained squarely on her,hoping for confirmation straight from her lips.


Verena's smile was radiant as she lifted her chin,meeting the camera with poise and unwavering confidence.



With deliberate emphasis, she announced, "Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr. Maxton Fairclough."


There it was. The doctor whose face and background had remained a mystery, whose very name carried an almost legendary status among the wealthy,was standing before them in plain sight.


The realization was staggering.


Excitement lit up the reporters' faces. Today was history in the making, and they were right there to capture it.


Click! Click!


The cameras went wild, flashes exploding across the room, yet Verena stood firm, her expression composed, her gaze steady as if the chaos around her couldn't touch her.


Her words echoed across the live broadcast: "Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr.Maxton Fairclough."


As Verena's words carried through the live broadcast, Shoildon wealthy young people's group chat exploded with activity, and some quickly sent messages filled with excitement.
###Chapter 184 Encounter





"See? | told you. People rush to judge too fast, and now they're the ones who look foolish."


"Unbelievable! I never guessed Verena was this capable. Looks likeI won the bet,huh?"


Right ten, someone sent a message to challenge those who had carelessly criticized Verena without knowing the full story. "So where are all the loudmouths who mocked Verena before? Funny how quiet you've gotten now."


Those who had hurled insults earlier avoided the chat, unable to lift their heads, their faces burning with embarrassment.



Damn! They had been convinced she was only trying to attract attention, pretending to matter. Instead,the truth revealed she had genuine talent-and plenty of it. At his home, Bobby bounced in his seat, so thrilled he couldn't contain himself.


The first thing he did was grab his phone and dial Slater, his words spilling out in excitement.


"Man, did you catch that? Did you see how incredible my sister-in-law is? She's a legend!"


Slater, no less fired up after watching, practically shouted, "Verena is amazing! When she treated my grandpa, I already knew she was different. But finding out she's actually Evelyn? That's mind-blowing!"


Puffing up with pride, Bobby cut him off, correcting like a stubborn kid, "Hold on, you can't just call her Verena. She's my brother's wife. You'd better start saying Mrs. Bennett."


Rolling his eyes, Slater retorted, "Give me a break.Our families go way back. Your brother's like my own,so why can't I call her by name?"


The two of them were soon quarreling like boys in a schoolyard, neither willing to back down.


Across town at Bennett Group, Isaac leaned back in his office chair, eyes locked on the screen where Verena stood alone.


Flashes glared as she answered questions with poise,handling every reporter with ease.


Her presence glowed, making her look breathtakingly composed.


From his seat, Isaac's gaze lingered on the screen,his eyes carrying nothing but devotion.


He reminded himself that the remarkable woman being admired by so many was his wife-the one he cherished most.


At the same time, Katelyn's fury spiked the moment she heard Maxton confirm Verena's identity.


In a burst of anger, she shoved the table in front of her, sending it crashing over her phone.


The device survived, and Verena's voice along with the thunderous applause still rang from the speaker.


Katelyn lost all semblance of calm, her eyes blazing as rage overtook her.


Her breaths came harsh and uneven, like she was being crushed under an invisible weight,while her jawN clenched so hard it was audible.


"Verena... Verena..." she hissed, repeating the name as though uttering it alone could obliterate her."How is it possible? How are you Evelyn?"


Katelyn had always perched on her pedestal,convinced that her return from abroad would make her shine brighter than Verena, whom she dismissed as nothing more than a nobody from the rural backwater.



Because of that arrogance, she had never once treated Verena as an equal.


She had believed that after coming back from abroad, Isaac would notice the sharp difference between her and Verena and eventually regret turning her down.


She returned determined to crush Verena beneath her heel.


Instead, she was the one humiliated, reduced to a laughingstock.


No matter how she compared herself, whether in looks or in ability, Verena surpassed her completely.


Verena's success not only overshadowed her but pushed her so far behind she couldn't even compete.



"Hahaha..."



From start to finish, she had been nothing more than a source of amusement in Verena's eyes.



And to Isaac, she wasn't even worth that much.



Hot tears blurred Katelyn's vision as her fists tightened until her knuckles popped.


She cursed herself for ever dismissing Verena, for not seeing her as a threat. Had she realized sooner that Verena was Evelyn, she would have cut her down before things ever reached this point.



But realization came too late. Far too late.







Meanwhile in Clokron, the interview concluded, and Maxton appeared at Verena's door, knocking politely.


When she opened it, he spoke with rare warmth."Evelyn, I've ordered a party in your honor tonight.Would you consider staying a little longer?"


Though she appreciated his kindness, Verena knew she couldn't delay. Isaac was waiting, and his surgery couldn't be put off.



So she offered a gentle smile and shook her head."Mr. Fairclough, I truly appreciate it, but l've already been gone too long. My family needs me."



Her firm tone told him she had made up her mind,and Maxton didn't press her further. "In that case, I won't keep you. But at least allow Tobin to make the arrangements and escort you to the airport. Surely you won't refuse that?"


Unable to decline such consideration, Verena let out a small laugh. "Alright then. Thank you, Mr.Fairclough."


"You'vegiven me back my life," Maxton replied,smiling as his hand brushed thoughtfully over his beard. "The one who should be grateful is me. I'll let you finish packing."


When Maxton finally stepped away, Verena gathered the last of her belongings and stood before the tall window,phone in hand.



"Isaac, everything's done here. My ticket's already booked for this afternoon..."



She hesitated, and then Isaac's calm, familiar tone drifted back. "Tomorrow, I'll be at the airport to meet you."


Verena's lips curved faintly as she answered, "Alright. I'll see you then."


His reply came soft but certain. "Tomorrow."


No sooner had the call ended than his phone lit up again.


Assuming Verena had called back, he checked the screen, only to find Bobby's name glaring at him.A shadow flickered across his face before he answered and asked, "What is it?"


On the other end, Bobby's voice nearly crackled with energy. "Isaac, tell me-when's Verena coming back?"



"She leaves this afternoon," Isaac said casually. "Her plane will land in Shoildon tomorrow."


"Tomorrow?" Bobby practically shouted. "That's perfect! Let's go pick her up together-she'll love the surprise!"


Isaac's eyebrow lifted, his voice laced with dry amusement. "And you think you count as a surprise?" That barb left Bobby choking for words until he stammered, "I meant the whole family should go together. That way, it really would surprise her."


The line went quiet for a breath, and then lsaac spoke again, his voice measured and unhurried."Fine."







When her call with Isaac ended, Verena stepped outside and noticed Tobin had already arranged a car to take her straight to the airport.


Before she could climb in, Maxton lingered nearby with a look of obvious reluctance. If Verena weren't in a hurry to leave, he would've summoned all his friends for a farewell party before seeing her off.


Not every physician could earn Maxton's admiration.In medicine, Verena wasn't just another talented doctor-she was someone others would rather befriend than risk crossing.


Anyone with sense could see that keeping her close was like holding a winning card against fate itself.


Catching the heaviness in his expression, Verena gave him a warm smile. "Mr. Fairclough, please take care of yourself. I believe we'll meet another time."


Her words eased him a little, and he nodded. "Yes.We will."



Before leaving, she carefully went over Maxton's current condition with Tobin. With time pressing,she offered her final goodbyes and headed off.


By the time she reached the airport, boarding was already underway.


Inside the plane, Verena followed her ticket to a seat in business class-only to find it already occupied.


A young man sat slouched with his arms crossed,cap pulled low, and an eye mask covering most of his face.



He looked as though he had just drifted into sleep.


Verena double-checked the number on her boarding pass, and then leaned forward and tapped his shoulder politely. "Excuse me. I think this is supposed to be my seat."


The man let out a faint groan, clearly annoyed at being disturbed, but something about her voice cut through his irritation.


He tugged off the mask and pushed the cap back,his eyes widening in surprise as he looked up.


"Wait...my sweet Verena? Is that really you?"


Before she could gather her thoughts, Verena found herself swept into a tight embrace.


That familiar voice and the way he called her name left no doubt who it was.


She pressed her finger lightly against his shoulder,creating just enough space between them.


"Ivan? What on earth are you doing here?" Her tone carried both surprise and a faint smile.


Instead of answering, Ivan lowered his gaze to where her finger rested, his expression exaggeratedly hurt."Look at that. You've changed. Feels like you're pushing me away."


A few nearby passengers glanced over, whispering at the unexpected scene.


Ivan, with his mop of natural curls, smooth skin, and sharp features, wore a small blue stud in his left ear that caught the light with every tilt of his head. The whole look screamed trendy and effortless charm.


Yet standing beside Verena, the contrast made it clear-her indifference was stronger than any attention his style could draw.


Unmoved by the curious stares, Verena gave him a once-over, shook her head, and murmured, "You're such a drama queen."


Then she added with a calm practicality,"Check your boarding pass. You're probably sitting in the wrong place."


Ivan fumbled for his pass, glanced at it, and gave a sheepish laugh. "Makes sense. I'm actually in the seat right behind you."


After sliding into the spot behind her, he leaned forward over the headrest, his voice brimming with curiosity. "So, when did you get to Clokron? And what were you up to there?"


Turning slightly toward him, Verena answered without hesitation, "I've been here for a little while.I came to treat someone."


Not letting the silence linger, she returned the question. "And you? Why are you on this flight back to Shoildon?"



With a sly lift of his brow, Ivan gave her a grin."That's something I'll keep to myself-for now."


She let out a soft laugh at his cryptic tone and didn't press further.


Verena shifted the conversation. "How's your health these days? Don't keep things bottled up. If anything feels off,you need to tell me." She remembered all too well how she'd pulled him back from the brink when a bullet missed his heart by barely a hair.


Though the wound had healed, lingering problems still followed him, shadows that required constant care.



At her words, Ivan gave a crooked grin, acting like a mischievous younger brother caught red-handed."Relax. I'm fine. I keep my meds with me all the time,and I'm not dying anytime soon."


Her eyes narrowed as she cut him a look. "Want to try saying that again?"


They might not have been related by blood, but the weight of her stare carried the same authority as an older sister.



Ivan quickly covered his mouth with his hand,feigning guilt. "Alright, my mistake."


Only then did she let the matter drop.


By midday the next day, their plane touched down at Shoildon Airport.


When they stepped through the VIP exit, Ivan wrapped her in a quick, familiar hug.


"I'll head out first," he said with an easy smile. "Once I'm done with what I came here for, I'lI give you a call."



Verena returned the gesture with a light pat on his back. "Sounds good. Take care of yourself."


The moment Verena stepped out of the terminal and into the arrivals hall, her striking beauty and elegant presence immediately caught Isaac's attention.


He was just about to step forward when he noticed a man lingering at her side, face hidden beneath a mask and cap.


The stranger leaned in close, exchanged a few words with her, and then pulled her into a hug. She didn't resist; instead, she smiled and gave his back a natural, easy pat, as though they shared a comfortable closeness. Isaac froze, his chest tightening as one troubling thought crept in. Who exactly was this man with her?
###Chapter 185 Promise Me




Bobby had been keeping his eyes on the exit when the moment caught his attention.


Tilting his head for a better look, he murmured curiously, "Who's that guy with Verena? Pretty sharp-looking, isn't he?"


Isaac's expression tightened, his brow knitting ever so slightly.


Bobby had only spoken in passing and didn't pick up on the slight shift in his brother's expression.Spotting Verena moving in their direction, he broke into a grin and waved enthusiastically. "Verena! Over here!"



Her steps slowed at the sound of his voice, and she turned her head toward the familiar call.


Off to the side stood Bobby in a loose tracksuit,grinning like a fool and waving his arm high. Beside him, Isaac sat in his wheelchair, dressed in a sleek black suit, a bouquet of white roses resting in his hands. His smile was calm, almost tender.


The hall around them was crowded and noisy, yet their presence stood out in the sea of travelers.



Both men were watching her closely, wvaiting for her to reach them, their smiles filled with warmth.


For Verena, the sight stirred something deep in her chest. Since Shawna's death, no one had stood waiting for her with that kind of anticipation.



A soft light entered her eyes, and her lips curved as she walked toward them.



"You're finally back," Bobby said, rushing to grab her suitcase before she could protest.


"Welcome home," Isaac added gently, holding the bouquet out to her.



Verena's gaze lingered on the flowers, her surprise written across her face.
<###Chapter 185 Promise Me	¥120 Points at most

Before Isaac had lost his memories about her, roses were always his choice for her, a bouquet in hand every time they met.


After his memory loss, she had only mentioned once that they were her favorite.


To her surprise, he had kept it in mind since then.


Taking the bouquet, V/erena's eyes lit up with genuine warmth. "Thank you, both of you."


Her happiness eased Isaac's heart, though a quiet weight still pressed against him.


With an effort to sound casual, he asked, "That man we saw leaving with you earlier-was he a friend?"


The question made Verena pause, but only briefly.


She quickly smiled. "Yes. Someone I've known a long time."



Isaac's voice stayed even. "Why not introduce him to us?"


"He and I just ran into each other on the plane," she  explained lightly. "He already had business to take care of."
Believing Isaac might want to know the people around her better, she leaned closer so their eyes met. With a gentle firmness, she added, "When the time's right, I'll introduce you two, alright?"
Her easy honesty unsettled him more than he expected.
Looking away, Isaac remarked, "Fine. Let's just get to the car."
Smart as ever, Bobby slipped into the passenger seat without fuss, leaving Verena and Isaac in the back.
Almost immediately, he turned around, grinning."Verena, you really surprised me this time. I always knew you were capable, but I never imagined you were that capable."
His chatter didn't stop once the car pulled away.
Verena laughed softly. "Don't exaggerate. There are plenty of people far more accomplished than l am." <###Chapter 185 Promise Me                                +120 Poince nt most
Bobby wasn't having it. Clicking his tongue, he said,"Oh, come on. You're Evelyn! If that doesn't count as impressive, then who else could possibly qualify?"
He leaned against the seat back, still grinning at her like a kid.

Shaking her head in amusement, Verena glanced at Isaac. "Has your brother always been this much of a handful?"
When they were together in the past, conversations about family had never been common between them.With an easy smile, Isaac replied, "He's been like that since he was little, always bursting with energy."
Their light banter carried them through the drive until they finally stopped at a restaurant to share a meal before parting ways.
Bobby went to meet up with his friends, while Verena accompanied Isaac back to Seraphina Villas.
Later that evening, inside the master bedroom,Verena carefully placed the roses into a glass vase on her desk. She adjusted the stems and admired the arrangement for a moment before she turned around and caught sight of Isaac sitting behind her without a sound.


Her lips curved into a gentle smile as she leaned against the desk, fingertips brushing the edge.


Tilting her head toward him, she asked, "What do you think? Good?"


Isaac's eyes didn't shift to the flowers at all. Instead,he studied her with unguarded sincerity. "Beautiful,"he said softly.


Her laughter spilled out as she teased him, "I was talking about the flowers."


Shaking his head, Isaac's voice deepened with quiet certainty."I wasn't."


The warmth in his gaze wrapped around her, filling the space between them until silence became its own language.

 
Verena made the first move, slipping onto Isaac's lap with ease. One arm curled around his neck while the other toyed playfully with the buttons of his shirt.


"I didn't know your charm had grown so much these past few days, Mr. Bennett," she teased, arching her brows as her finger slid a little lower,mock-jealous."Tell me,who did you practice on?"


The faint fragrance clinging to her skin pulled at him,tightening his throat. His reply came low and rough."I didn't practice on anyone. I only spoke the truth."


His need to explain himself so quickly carried the same hint of awkwardness he used to have before losing his memory.


Verena gave him a playful blink, her voice light with amusement. "Relax. I was only teasing.Why do you get so flustered?"


Isaac's lips pressed together as his hand moved slowly across her back.


Nervousness gnawed at him.


Whenever it came to her, he could never stay steady. The thought of her drifting away unsettled him more than anything else.


Verena broke the silence first. Her tone shifted,carrying a weight that made him tense. "Isaac,there's something I need to explain to you."


He lowered his gaze to her, his voice quiet but firm."Go on. I'm listening."


She drew in a breath before saying, "The reason l never told you l was Evelyn right from the start..."


Her words trailed off. A faint sigh slipped from her lips as she searched for the right place to begin."When I first came back to Akoitha, I stood in that operating room and watched my grandma die in front of me. I couldn't save her. From then on, every time l picked up a scalpel, my hands wouuldn't stop shaking.I was trapped by that fear."


The impact of her confession tightened something in Isaac's chest.


He had already believed her life in the Willis family had been harsh, but this was a pain he hadn't even imagined.


What kind of strength had it taken for her to carry that burden alone for so long?


His brows knitted together as his arms instinctively pulled her closer, as though holding her tighter might shield her from the memory.


Verena pressed her lips together and added,"|was afraid that if I revealed Evelyn's identity, you would place expectations on me that I couldn't live up to at the time. I worried that if I failed to cure you,all of your hope would vanish. That is why I chose not to reveal the truth-not because I didn't trust you, but because I was afraid. But you can be at ease now.l have worked tirelessly for a long time, and I have completely stepped out of that shadow. The fact that I was able to perform surgery on Maxton and treat him successfully is te strongest proof of that and also the beginning of something hopeful."


Verena's lips curved into a relieved smile as she finished. The pressure she had endured was brushed off lightly.


Isaac cradled her face with both hands, leaning forward until his forehead brushed hers, his breath unsteady.


"Verena, we're husband and wife. Whatever comes our way, we face it side by side. Promise me you won't keep things from me anymore."


The words came out soft, yet they carried the urgency of a plea.


So quiet was his voice that she might not have caught it if they hadn't been pressed so close.


Her nose brushed against his in a tender gesture,and she whispered back with a gentle laugh, "Alright.No more secrets. From now on, you'll know everything."
###Chapter 186 Leave It To Me




Those few simple words, flowing like clear water,brought immense joy to lsaac's heart.


He tilted his head and brushed a kiss against Verena's chin, his eyes glimmering with a depth of affection that words could never capture.


Verena's eyes curved into crescent moons as she leaned down, pressing her lips softly against his.


Isaac responded at once, slowly and tenderly grazing her lips as though afraid to let the moment end.


The desk window stood half open, and a cool night breeze slipped in, stirring the curtains.


In that still night, their breaths wove together,lingering in the air.


Their kiss, first gentle, soon grew fervent,unstoppable, and carried lower with each passing second.


Before Verena had gone abroad, Isaac's sex function had already recovered. This meant that they could now have sex.



The very thought made his heart race with a heat that spread through his chest.


Just as his lips deepened the kiss, Verena suddenly pushed him away.


Isaac frowned, displeasure flashing across his face,his voice carrying a note of grievance."Verena."


Breathless, she leaned close and soothed softly into his ear, "Let's go to the bed."


Guiding him with gentle care, she helped Isaac over to the bed and laid him down.


As soon as he rested against the sheets, Verena looked down at him.



"Verena, you..." Isaac's breath grew uneven, and instinctively, he tried to retreat. But Verena leaned in closer, her nose brushing his,her breath warm and alluring. "Don't worry. Leave it to me."
Her deft fingers slipped to his shirt and removed it in one practiced motion.

Isaac's brows drew together; her skillful ease struck a chord of unease. A thought pierced him, sharp as glass: her first love.

He had often heard that a woman never forgot the first man she gave herself to. And hadn't Verena confessed to her friend, just after their wedding, that she couuld not erase that first love from her heart?That memory must have meant the world to her.
He looked at her radiant face, his jawline taut, his eyes dimmed with melancholy.
Sensing his distraction, Verena frowned, her fingers pressing a little harder against his skin.
Her nails left behind a faint red mark, searing against him like a brand. Isaac's throat tightened; every touch of hers sent shivers coursing down his body.


Verena's eyes gleamed with intensity, her crimson lips curving in a playful smile. "Isaac, kiss me."


Though jealousy tugged at him, he buried it deep, a faint blush stealing across his cheeks. His gaze clung to her, filled with anticipation and longing. She might never love him more than her first, but she had chosen to be his wife. That choice alone carried its own rare weight.


Isaac's heart skipped at the thought. Following her lead, he caught her hand and pressed it to his lips in a tender kiss.


He resolved to surrender to this moment. So long as she remained by his side, even if he was only second in her heart, he would accept it. Once, he would never have dreamed of bowing so low before any woman. But love had humbled him; and even if it meant vanishing into insignificance, he embraced it willingly. Isaac tipped his head back, a muffled groan escaping his throat.


The last rays of the setting sun spilled through the window, cloaking the two of them in a romantic ambiance.


At last, they had become a true couple.


Isaac held Verena close, warmth flooding through him as he tightened his arms around her.


His eyes brimmed with quiet contentment.


Then Verena released his hand and whispered softly,"I'll take a shower first."


Helping him lean against the headboard, she slipped off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom.


The light flicked on, and soon the sound of running water filled the room.



Isaac closed his eyes, fighting to steady his ragged breath.She had clearly done this before. His jealousy reared up once more, sharp and merciless-how he  hated that man who had known her first.

After a moment, he reached for his phone to check the time, noticing several missed calls from his friends, and more than one from Cayden.

Knowing his circle well, Isaac guessed the others were calling out of ide curiosity. But Cayden, the only doctor among them, was different.
So Isaac returned Cayden's call.

The line connected at once.
"Oh, Mr. Bennett, you finally called me back," Cayden teased. Isaac pressed his lips together and replied with calm ease, "I was busy earlier."
Cayden chuckled and went straight to the point. "I called because I've learned about everything Verena did abroad. She's remarkable. With her by your side,I've no doubt she'll heal your legs. At first I doubted,but Evelyn's reputation is solid. This isn't empty talk.So rest assured..." Isaac's gaze dropped briefly to his legs before shifting toward the bathroom door. Delight flickered in his eyes. Verena had promised to do her utmost for him, and he trusted her. If he could stand again-if he could shield her fully as a man should-then no matter what, he would not let her slip away. Even if her first love came back, Isaac would not yield her.
Overwhelmed, he thanked Cayden with unusual haste.

Cayden said goodbye and ended the call.
Soon, Verena stepped out from her shower, her damp hair falling loose, her cheeks faintly flushed.She noticed Isaac staring at his phone, lost in thought.
She sat down beside him and asked, "What's wrong?Who called you?"
Isaac blinked back to the moment, reached out to touch her cheek gently, and answered, "Cayden."
Her eyes softened. "What did he say?" Her smile lifted as the faint scent of body wash clung to her, her skin glowing fresh and dewy.
Unable to resist, he kissed her cheek before replying,"He said you can heal my legs. He told me to trust you."
Verena's smile bloomed."Of course. But let's not talk about your legs right now." She paused, her gaze dropping mischievously. "Didn't you notice how successfully l've cured that part of your body earlier?" The air shifted in an instant, her teasing words steering them back to intimacy.
"Ahem." Isaac coughed, his ears flushing red as he looked away, embarrassed.
Verena laughed softly, amused at his shy expression,her heart lightened by the sight.


At a grand restaurant in Shoildon, Alec and Laura arrived for a dinner party they had been invited to attend.


The moment they reached the arranged table, a cluster of wealthy businessmen rose to greet Alec.


For a moment, Alec felt both honored and bewildered. These were mnen he had long struggled to invite for even the simplest dinner, and never once had they agreed. Why, then, such warm courtesy tonight?


Though he did not fully understand their sudden change of heart, he knew better than to question it aloud. Since they approached him, he naturally received them with equal grace. After all, many of his company matters depended on the goodwill of these very men.
###Chapter 187 Talented Daughter




Confusion showed on Alec's face as he raised his glass with the others for a proper toast.


The dinner was only halfway through when Sawyer Reed, one of Shoildon's most influential businessmen, walked over with a wine glass in hand.


Sawyer greeted Alec with a broad smile. "Mr. Willis,let me raise a glass to you personally."


Caught off guard, Alec glanced around, unsure if he was the intended guest.


Sawyer's reputation preceded him; people at his table were usually important figures in the city.


Alec had tried more than once to meet with Sawyer,but nothing ever came of it.


Just getting an invitation to tonight's event had felt like a stroke of luck-he never expected Sawyer to  make a move himself. Maybe this was Sawyer's way of hinting at some future partnership with Willis Group.
When Alec didn't respond right away, Sawyer grinned. "What's wrong? Mr. Willis, are you not interested in sharing a toast?"
Snapping back to attention, Alec realized the toast was really meant for him and quickly got to his feet.
"You're too modest, Mr. Reed. You set the gold standard in business around here. People like me look up to you-honestly, I should be the one offering a toast." Alec jumped at the chance to compliment Sawyer.
Sawyer just laughed, brushing off the praise with a wave. "Oh, that's nothing. You deserve the spotlight tonight,Mr.Willis."
Alec couldn't help but wonder what had brought on this sudden friendliness.
Sawyer went on, his tone light, as if he hadn't noticed  Alec's confusion. "Honestly, I have to give you credit for raising such a talented daughter. You must be proud-raising someone that capable takes a lot of work. People like me can only hope for the same."
Laura, who sat at Alec's side, couldn't hide the frown that crept across her face.
Talented daughter? That didn't fit their story at all.
Everyone in Shoildon knew things had fallen apart between Alec's family and their oldest daughter,Verena, and Kaia's public antics were still the talk of the city. Laura heard Sawyer's remark but couldn't tell if it was genuine praise or a backhanded dig.
Alec was just as lost, his gaze shifting uncertainly to Sawyer.
He was certain Sawyer must have heard about all of Kaia's embarrassing escapades that everyone in town had gossiped about.
So when Sawyer brought up his daughter's talent, Alec had no idea what angle he was working Was Sawyer mocking them in front of everyone?
The more Alec thought about it, the more his embarrassment simmered. Still, he bit his tongue-Sawyer was far too influential to cross.
A tight, uncomfortable smile was all he could manage.
Sawyer had chalked up Alec's initial hesitation to pride and let it slide.
But when Alec's face showed nothing but confusion,Sawyer was surprised.
"You're serious, Mr. Willis? You really haven't heard?"Sawyer asked, eyebrows raised.
Alec shook his head, frowning. "What are you talking about,Mr.Reed?"
Realizing both Alec and Laura were genuinely out of the loop, Sawyer spoke slowly, as if breaking big news. "Your eldest, Verena, the same Verena married to Mr. Bennett, is actually Evelyn Rowe. She's the world-renowned surgeon everyone's talking about."
The revelation landed with a thud. "What?" Alec and Laura blurted out at the same time.
A group of businessmen at a nearby table caught the outburst and laughed. "This story's been all over the news. Everyone's talking about it, here and overseas.You really didn't know?"
Both Alec and Laura stood there, mouths open and eyes wide, too stunned to say a word.
Had they just heard right?
Evelyn?
Verena and Evelyn were the same person?
The daughter they'd left behind at the countryside had become the famous healer the whole world admired?
This couldn't be real,could it?
Nothing about it made sense. Their stunned faces said it all-they genuinely had no clue.
A businessman nearby pulled out his phone and set it down in front of them.
"Looks like your eldest daughter's been humble,even hiding it from her own parents," he joked.
He tapped the screen and grinned. "Check this out-a replay of the broadcast. Mr. Willis, watch how your daughter owned the stage. She handled questions from the press with such poise, and when she spoke to Maxton, she was both humble and sure of herself.All of us in the business world were impressed."
He moved the video ahead, making sure the moment Verena stepped onto the stage filled the screen.
Both Alec and Laura watched, unable to look away.
The footage showed Verena entering the spotlight,all eyes fixed on her.
Her gaze was sharp, her voice carried easily, and every answer landed with authority. Right beside her stood Maxton, Chairman of Smoothdeed Group.


Alec could hardly believe what he was seeing, his whole expression frozen in shock.


Maxton was a legend-one of the business world's true heavyweights, someone Alec had only admired from afar.


He never even dreamed of meeting Maxton, let alone being linked to him in some way.


Now Maxton was shaking Verena's hand and praising her in front of the world.


Neither Alec nor Laura could tear their eyes away from the video, both transfixed by what they were seeing.


The real shock hit when Verena confidently introduced herself and Maxton stepped in to address all the swirling rumors about her and Tobin.


When Verena revealed she was Evelyn, and Maxton openly vouched for her brilliance as a doctor, Alec felt as if the floor had dropped out beneath him.


He just stared at the phone, his mind racing with disbelief.


So Verena really was Evelyn?


Had he been blind to all of this the whole time?


His eldest child, the one he'd barely noticed growing up, turned out to be not only a top graduate from Pine Hill University but also the legendary healer the world knew as Evelyn.


What else had she accomplished that he had never bothered to find out?



Miranda, the CEO of AuroraNexus, a major force among the world's biggest companies, was apparently one of Verena's closest friends.


Even the powerful chairman of Smoothdeed Group seemed to admire her.


A tremor ran through Alec as the weight of his mistakes caught up to him. He realized too late just  how badly he had chosen.


Deep regret filled him as he remembered leaving Verena at the countryside so many years ago.


Back then, Kaia's birth brought a windfall and rocketed the family's fortunes, making him feel like luck had finally turned.


He started treating Kaia as the family's good luck charm, slowly forgetting about the promises he'd made to Verena when she was little.


But now, faced with the truth, Alec was stunned to discover that the daughter he pushed aside was the one who had gone on to achieve more than he ever dreamed.


Biting back a surge of regret, Alec clenched his jaw and struggled to keep his feelings in check.


Only now did he realize just how badly he'd messed up his priorities.


If he'd understood what Verena was truly capable of,he never would have let her go. The weight of that mistake hit Laura just as hard.


She stood frozen, lips parted, trying to process everything.


Wasn't Verena supposed to be involved with Tobin?


How did she suddenly become the world-famous healer-the same woman who saved Maxton's life?


When did that rebellious daughter of theirs turn into someone the whole world respected?


A deep frown cut across Laura's face as a memory surfaced.



She remembered the first day they had brought Verena to Shoildon, introducing her to Danica and Isaac.


Back then, Laura was convinced Verena's life in the rural backwater meant she was naive, uneducated,and inexperienced.


Before the meeting, she kept telling Verena to claim she graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. But the moment Danica asked, Verena spoke up without hesitation, saying that she graduated from Pine Hill University...
###Chapter 188 You've Truly Let Us Down
Looking back now, Laura couldn't recall a single moment when Verena had purposefully concealed her talents.


In truth, it was Laura and Alec who refused to recognize their daughter's strengths, never once asking how she truly felt or what she faced.


Was it possible that Verena had always possessed such remarkable abilities?


Neither parent had ever reached out with real care,nor had they taken the time to sit down for an honest conversation. Understanding her had never been their priority.


Instead, they simply shaped Verena in the mold of their own assumptions.


That realization hit Laura with the force of a revelation, and waves of regret washed over her,leaving an ache in her heart.


Questions churned in her mind. This was the child she'd carried for months, the girl she brought into the world with so much hope. How had she treated Verena like that?


Frozen where they stood, both Alec and Laura found themselves lost in thought.


Alec recovered his composure first. Surrounded by an audience of powerful figures, he made sure not to betray a hint of emotion. Smiling with pride, he told them, "Verena has always been bright, never once giving us cause for concern. We're thrilled by all she's accomplished. Still, I can't match my daughter's abilities. These days, the business world is filled with risks, and managing a company has never been tougher. All of you are leaders in your own fields, and I hope you'll give us your support moving forward."


Never one to let family drama stand in the way of opportunity, Alec used the moment to strengthen business connections.


With Verena's reputation shining so brightly, the other businessmen were smart enough to show some respect for Alec.


Whatever disagreements simmered beneath the surface, blood ties remained untouchable.


Standing with Alec was a move nobody here would regret.


Glasses were raised all around, and the group repeated, "Certainly, Mr. Willis."


Through the rest of the meal, both Alec and Laura seemed distracted, their thoughts elsewhere.


Once dinner ended and Alec finished small talk with a few business acquaintances, they left for home.


Back at Willis Villa, Kaia lounged on the couch,deeply absorbed in a newly released movie.


The sound of footsteps at the entryway made her pause the film, slip on her slippers, and hurry to welcome Alec and Laura.


A bright smile on her face, Kaia called out, "Dad,Mom, you're home. Come join me-the movie's really good!"


She tugged gently at Laura's hand, hoping for a little warmth.


Instead, Laura pulled away, leaving Kaia's smile to fade. She stared at her parents' clouded expressions,the silence between them was heavy and cold.


From the day she fled home, a wall seemed to stand between her and her parents.


Alec's distant manner made her nervous, and that fear lingered.


Confused by their sudden cold shoulders, Kaia hesitated and finally asked, "Dad, Mom, did something happen?"


Alec snapped, his anger barely contained as he flung his phone toward her. "You still have the nerve to ask? Take a look for yourself! Your constant clashes with Verena have held the Willis family back from reaching real success."


Earlier, on the drive home from the dinner party, both Alec and Laura had watched the entire livestream unfold.


Anger smoldered between them, threatening to boil over. The moment they saw Kaia acting as if nothing was wrong, they unleashed all their frustration in her direction.


Puzzled, Kaia caught the phone and glanced down at the screen.



Verena's face stared back at her from the video.


Caught up in a school competition, Kaia only recently managed to relax and watch a movie, all while remaining oblivious to what had been happening online.



As a result, Maxton's live broadcast had gone completely unnoticed by her.

 
She stared at the screen in confusion, uncertain what to make of it. "What's this about?"


Laura's voice cut in, icy and distant. "Just watch."


As Kaia pressed play, Verena appeared on camera,introducing herself as Evelyn, her tone steady.


Next to her, Maxton openly praised Verena, vouching that she was not romantically involved with Tobin.


"Yes. I am Evelyn Rowe, and I came to Clokron for one reason-to treat Mr. Maxton Fairclough."


Those words echoed in Kaia's head, turning her face ashen.



Confusion settled over her as she struggled to process what she was seeing.


Her hands started to shake, and she nearly lost her balance as the reality hit.


How could this be true?



Hadn't Katelyn always claimed to be Evelyn? How was Verena suddenly revealed as Evelyn? Somebody had to be lying.


Could Verena have pulled off such a deception?


Kaia quickly dismissed the idea.


Verena might have reason to lie, but the chairman of Smoothdeed Group would not, which made his information unquestionably reliable.


Deceiving him was something Verena wouldn't have the courage to attempt.


Could it be that Verena was truly Evelyn?


But where did that leave Katelyn?


Kaia had been told outright by Katelyn that she was Evelyn, and Katelyn had vowed to stand with her in bringing Verena to justice.


Kaia's lashes fluttered, and panic swept across her face.





Realization struck; Katelyn had been the one to mislead her all along. That same resentment Katelyn held toward Verena had been used as a weapon, turning Kaia into a pawn in her schemes.


Her eyes grew wide as everything fell into place.


It was unthinkable. The doctor she'd admired from afar, the very person who had given her a sense of direction and taught her how to fit in, was Verena,her own flesh and blood.


But what did she do to her sister?


What choices had she made since Verena stepped into her life?


Afraid that their parents' love might shift away,she had done nothing but stand against Verena,spreading rumors, setting traps, and wishing her gone for good.


Instead of seeing the truth, Kaia believed every word from Katelyn's mouth, sided with her, and even plotted against Verena.


All this time, Evelyn, the person she idolized and respected above all, had been Verena.


A wave of guilt crashed over her.


Unsteady on her feet, Kaia stumbled backward, tears streaming down her cheeks.


With her voice trembling and lost, she pleaded,"Dad,Mom, I never meant to hurt Verena..."


Alec's cold voice cut her off, "Don't call me that.I have no daughter like you." He left wvithout another glance, heading straight upstairs.


Sobs shook Kaia's shoulders as she watched him disappear.Desperate, she grabbed Laura's sleeve."Mom, please, you have to believe me. If I'd known Verena was Evelyn, I could never have acted this way.She's been the person I looked up to for so long."


Laura's stare remained icy and unmoved.


Had Kaia not targeted Verena from the beginning,maybe things could have been different between Laura and Verena. Still, Kaia constantly pushed her to take sides against Verena, a pressure that eventually shattered their bond as mother and daughter.


That thought made Laura pull away, giving her a final look full of disappointment. "Kaia, you've truly let us down."


"Mom, please,it's not what you think..." Kaia's words broke down into sobs as Laura turned and walked away, refusing to look back.


As her parents walked past without a trace of warmth, Kaia collapsed into tears, her body trembling with each sob.


Regret tangled with bitterness as it consumed her.


If she'd known the truth about Verena, she would have kept her distance from Katelyn, never letting herself be used against her own sister.
###Chapter 189 Vanish From This World Without A Trace
At the Fuller residence...


On the television, the media was busy broadcasting the shocking revelation of Verena's hidden identity as Evelyn.


The sound was muted, leavingonly the flickering images dancing silently across the screen.


Katelyn sat rigidly on the sofa, jaw clenched,eyes locked on the screen as though she could burn holes through the images.


The news of Verena being Evelyn had already spread like wildfire,becoming the talk on every lip.


Katelyn was certain now-her disguise as Evelyn must have been unmasked before Kaia.



But then again,so what? Until she left Akoitha for good, Kaia was still a pawn she could move.


Clutching at that thought, Katelyn reached for the phone on the table and dialed a number.


Kaia, her face hidden in trembling hands, was weeping when the sudden ring of her phone cut through her cries.


The moment she saw the caller ID, her tears boiled into fury. Gritting her teeth, she hissed out the name with bitterness, "Katelyn."


Alec and Laura were both at homne. Kaia couldn't risk a soul overhearing her dealings with Katelyn.


Covering the receiver, she slipped away into the back garden, choosing a shadowed corner before answering.


"Kaia, I need you to do me one last favor." Katelyn's voice spilled through before Kaia could even breathe a word.


That tone-sharp, commanding-dragged Kaia back to all the times she had been fooled into obedience.


Anger erupted, and she roaed, "Katelyn Fuller! I haven't even hunted you down yet, and you dare call me first? Tell me, was I nothing but a tool from the start? You're no Evelyn! You tricked me-used me!And now you expect help? I swear to you, that's impossible!"


The only reason she had ever stood by Katelyn was her belief that Katelyn was Evelyn.


Had it not been for that lie, Kaia would never have touched her shadow.


Yet in the end, she had been duped into harming the very person she once held in admiration.


Hearing Kaia's fury, Katelyn's lips twisted into a deranged smile. A laugh tore out-shrill and cutting,enough to send ice through Kaia's veins.


Kaia's brow furrowed deeply. "Are you insane?"


Suppressing her laughter, Katelyn answered coldly,"Yes, I used you. I'm not Evelyn. Verena is Evelyn. But tell me-does it change anything?"


Her voice slowed, laced with temptation. "Kaia, have you forgotten the humiliation she dealt you? Do you not recall whose hands pushed you out of your own home? She was merciless toward you. Will you still pity her?"


Against her will, Kaia's mind began to replay those bitter memories as Katelyn's words coiled in her ears.



Meanwhile, Katelyn's gaze never left Verena's image glowing on the television.


She pressed on, "Listen carefully, Kaia. Help me just this once, and you help yourself. I promise you,Verena will vanish from this world without a trace.True, I may not be your idol, but we both share the same enemy-shouldn't we stand as one against her?"



Vanish from this world without a trace?



Kaia's grip tightened on the phone, her focus  wavering.


Her voice dropped to a whisper. "She won't trust me anymore."


At that, Katelyn's eyes glittered with a sly smile.


Kaia,the fool, had taken the bait.


Katelyn's lips curved as she answered slowly, "She won't trust you, but she loves Isaac."


Kaia stiffened."What do you mean?"


Katelyn's voice turned to steel. "Tomorrow, I'll keep Isaac occupied. You only need to tell Verena you saw him being forced into a car-and that I was in the same car. Then you lead her to the abandoned factory on the outskirts."


Kaia's heart sank with the realization. "You're planning to kidnap her?"


Katelyn sidestepped the question, her tone low and cold. "Kaia, trust me. Once she's gone, you'll stand as the sole daughter of the Willis family. Soon, the disgrace she branded on you will vanish like smoke in the wind."


On the other end, Kaia fell into silence, the pause stretching like an eternity. Katelyn gave a faint smile."Don't be anxious. I'm not forcing your hand. Think it through, and then give me your answer."


With that, she ended the call.


The steady beeps rang in Kaia's ear, yet she stood frozen, eyes distant.


Questions churned in her chest like a storm. What path should she take?


Hadn't she already stumbled far enough?


Would following Katelyn again not be a step deeper into.a trap?


It was kidnapping. It was murder. CouId anyone walk away from that unscathed?


And above all-Verena was Evelyn.


Could she truly raise a hand against Evelyn?
###Chapter 190 Decision





Kaia shook her head, banishing at once the cruel thought that had creptinto her mind.


No-she could never bring herself to do such a thing.


Indeed, she despised Verena. But her hatred had always rested on the belief that Verena and Evelyn were two different people.



Now the truth stood unshakable: Evelyn was Verena,and no power on earth could undo it.


To Kaia, Evelyn had always held a special meaning,and that bond was something she could never bring herself to destroy.


From childhood, Kaia had known deep down she wasn't truly her parents' beloved child.


Their kindness toward her had come not from affection, but because the family fortune had blossomed around the time she was born.


She understood from early on that the love she received was conditional, fleeting as morning dew.


But Luka's story was different.


From the moment he took his first breath, every family asset seemed destined to fall into his hands.


No matter his choices-wise or foolish-their parents adored him without question.


The heir to Willis Group was always Luka, and that truth could never be rewritten.


Kaia,however, lived a different tale.


She remembered one childhood test she had failed;her parents' eyes brimmed with disappointment,as though she were a burden they might cast aside at any time.


When she excelled in exams, making the family shine before outsiders, suddenly she became their good-luck charm.
< ###Chapter 190 Decision	+120 Points at most

Thus,Kaia buried herself in books, fearing that, if she faltered, she would be discarded just as Verena once had been.



As she grew old enough to understand the patterns,she began staging little "coincidences" to please her parents.


Whenever they secured a business deal, her presence seemed to turn fortune in their favor.


Only then could she breathe easy, wearing the title of their lucky star, shielded from rejection.


But the day she learned Verena was being brought back, a storm of unease rose in her chest.


She feared her parents saw no more use in her, so they had gone to the countryside to reclaim Verena and groom her instead-preparing to abandon Kaia.


That fear was why she had grown so anxious,why she schemed against Verena with such restless urgency, hoping to drive her away.


Kaia admitted to herself at last: her hostility had been born not of malice, but of fear-fear of being replaced.


Yet at the root of it all stood Alec and Laura.


Had they given her the same security they lavished on Luka, would she ever have fought so bitterly against Verena's return?


In the end, Kaia saw clearly: Verena's coldness toward her was merely the harvest of her own sowing.


Had she not struck first, Verena would never have retaliated. Every slight she suffered was but the echo of her own actions.


So often, when we dislike someone, we fail to trace back the cause and effect-until it is far too late.


Now that Kaia knew Verena was Evelyn, her idol of many years, she understood everything in painful clarity.


Verena had not been wrong. She should never have been harmed. Grasping that truth, Kaia drew in a deep breath.


Moreover, she realized, Katelyn had been nothing more than a manipulator using her as a pawn.


Kaia had already erred too many times. She could not afford to carry the weight of a crime on top of her guilt.


Lowering her gaze to the phone in her hand, she made a silent decision.







When Verena returned home, Rhonda hurried toward her.


In a hushed voice, she said, "Mrs. Bennett,your sister is here. I told her you weren't available, but she refused to leave and insisted on waiting. I didn't know what else to say."


Ever since Kaia had moved out of Seraphina Villas,Isaac had instructed the staff to find excuses to turn her away if she ever appeared again. Verena cast a glance toward the living room, and then said softly, "I understand. You may return to your work."


Rhonda nodded and quietly went back to polishing the hallway railings.


Verena walked toward Kaia, arms folded, eyes lowered.





Her voice came out cool and sharp. "What's your purpose this time?"


She remained standing, deliberately refusing to sit,making it clear she had no intention of indulging in a drawn-out conversation.



Her tone dripped with sarcasm-words that, once upon a time, would have provoked Kaia into a fiery retort.


But now, things had changed. This was Evelyn-her idol, the figure she had admired for years. How could she answer back?


All Kaia could do was regret the wrongs she had done.


Biting her lip, she whispered with remorse, "Verena, I won't hurt you anymore..."


The words made Verena's stomach turn; disgust rippled through her like a sudden chill.


" won't waste another moment on this farce," she replied indifferently, turning toward the stairs.


Panic seized Kaia, and she blurted out, "Evelyn wait!"





Verena stopped reflexively and turned her gaze upon her.11SO1you've seen the news too?"


Kaia nodded earnestly, speaking in a rush. "Yes, l know you're Evelyn-that's why I have to warn you.Katelyn is plotting to kidnap you. Please, be careful."


Her words tumbled out with urgency, her emotions laid bare.



But Verena only stared in silence, her eyes fixed on Kaia,offering nothing in return. Just as Kaia was about to repeat herself, Verena stepped closer, looming over her.


After a pause, she gave a cold chuckle. "Kaia, you and Katelyn are working together. Do you really think I'd swallow your lies? Rhonda, see her out."


She turned to leave without hesitation.


Seeing Verena truly meant to walk away, Kaia's heart clenched. With no time left to think, she dropped to her knees.


Rhonda, startled, looked at Verena in confusion."Mrs.Bennett,she..."


Verena frowned slightly at the sight. "What performance is this now?"


Kaia's fists tightened at her sides, her head bowed low. "I'm sorry. I admit it-I feared you'd steal Mom and Dad's love, so I targeted you from the very beginning, trying to force you out. I came to you not just because you are Verena, but because you are Evelyn." She lifted her gaze, eyes brimming with sincerity."Because you're Evelyn, I cannot harm you-and I wvill :not let anyone else harm you either. You may doubt Verena's sister, but you cannot ignore Evelyn's fan."


Something flickered across Verena's eyes, though skepticism still lingered.


Seeing her hesitation, Kaia spoke quickly, almost pleading. "Do you remember a letter you received three years ago? The sender signed as 'Grace.' I never imagined someone as remarkable as you would read it-let alone reply-but you did."


Three years ago, when Kaia was drowning in self-doubt, she had watched Luka bathe effortlessly in their parents' love, while she struggled endlessly for scraps of affection.


The pressure had gnawed at her, leaving her restless,sleepless.


Evelyn had been her only refuge.


Knowing Evelyn was in a hospital in Clokron, Kaia had poured her pain into a letter and sent it.


She confessed that she felt powerless,unloved-that her parents cherished only the "luck" she seemed to bring them.


But as time passed, she no longer knew how to create such lucky coincidences to prove her worth.


She had assumed someone as extraordinary as Evelyn would be buried in countless letters every day, and hers would vanish into the pile. She had never held out hope.


But then, one day...
 ###Chapter 191 Reward





Kaia had penned the letter while at school and mailed it from there, so the return address bore the school's name.


A fellow student, returning from the mailroom, told her that a letter had arrived in her name.


Bewildered yet curious, Kaia made her way toward the mailroom.



When she finally received the envelope and unfolded its contents, she stood rooted to the spot,her heart suspended between joy and disbelief, before she could gather herself again.


"In that letter, you reminded me that ability and skill are the true passports in life. You told me never to force myself into circles; with genuine ability, the circles I long for will one day formn naturally around me." Tears welled in Kaia's eyes and cascaded down without delay. "So I swore to devote myself to medicine, to carve my name as a physician like you.You pulled me back when I was drifting aimlessly.Evelyn, you must believe me-! could never bring myself to harm you."
Her words rang with sincerity, yet Verena's heart remained unmoved.
The damage had already been done, and no river of words could wash it away.
Verena fixed her gaze on Kaia, the name "Grace"surfacing in her memory.
Back then, when she had first read the letter, it was drenched in despair, written by someone teetering on the edge with strong thoughts of ending their life.
As a doctor, her duty was to save lives, so she had replied.
Never had she imagined that Grace was none other than Kaia. Verena's lips curved faintly, almost ironically. "So,you are Grace. And because I am Evelyn,you now hope to reconcile with me?"


Kaia knew full well her sins were too many to erase.Forgiveness was out of reach, yet if she could make even the smallest amends, she would.


Shaking her head quickly, she pleaded, "I know my wrongs are beyond forgiveness. I don't seek pardon -only that you trust me this once. The real danger now lies with Katelyn. She told me that tomorrow she'll keep lsaac occupied, and then I must inform you that lsaac has been taken away in a car-with her inside. She wants me to lure you to an abandoned factory on the outskirts, where she plans to have you kidnapped. If I refuse, she'll simply find another accomplice."


Kaia lifted her face, her expression taut with urgency."Evelyn, beware of Katelyn-she's set on revenge against you."


Verena's eyes narrowed. It was indeed likely that Katelyn intended to strike before her departure. But could Kaia's words truly be trusted?


Verena studied her, her mind already charting a course.





If Kaia spoke the truth, this could be the perfect snare to crush Katelyn once and for all.


If Kaia lied, Verena would strike first. She would lay a trap, ensuring neither of them could rise again.


"For now, I'll trust you. But if I discover you've lied,the price will be one you cannot even imagine."


Kaia's eyes lit up in disbelief, tears shimmering."Evelyn, do you really trust me this time?"


Her reverence seemed genuine. Though Verena did not fully grant her trust, she gave her words weight-yet not without warning.


Folding her arms, Verena leaned closer, her gaze sharp. "As long as you follow my lead, I will place trust in you."


Kaia nodded eagerly, almost breathless. "Yes, yes, I'll  do as you say."


Verena bent down, whispering instructions into her ear.



...


After returning to her room from Seraphina Villas,Kaia pulled out her phone.


She searched her contacts for Katelyn's name and pressed dial.


When Katelyn picked up, her brows arched knowingly. She understood Kaia's deep hatred for Verena, and all seemed to be unfolding according to her design.


"So,have you made up your mind?" she asked.


Kaia gritted her teeth, answering firmly, "Yes, l've thought it through. Verena must not remain in my life."


Katelyn's lipscurled in satisfaction, convinced that when interests collided, family ties snapped like twigs.
What did it matter if Verena was Evelyn? Despite Kaia's admiration, she was still willing to betray her.
In Katelyn's eyes, Kaia was nothing more than a well-placed pawn.
Admiring her manicured nails, Katelyn drawled, "In that case, I'll entrust you with the task of bringing Verena there."
Kaia's eyes flickered with a glint of amusement.With subtle words, she sought to coax Katelyn into revealing proof of her scheme.
Feigning unease, she asked, "Katelyn, are you sure everything is arranged? Suppose I bring Verena to the abandoned factory, and your people aren't there yet-what if she manages to slip away?"
Katelyn scoffed at her supposed hesitation.-"Don't worry. That won't happen. My people will be stationed there an hour before you arrive."
An hour early. Kaia's lips tilted into a faint smile. "That's good,then."


Pausing as if in afterthought, she voiced another doubt. "But once you have Verena, how will you deal with her? I'm merely following your orders to bring her there. If she escapes and reports me, I'll be the one arrested."


"Kaia, you underestimate me." Katelyn chuckled coldly. "Once Verena falls into my grasp, I won't give her a chance to run. She'll disappear without a trace,and even the police will find nothing. Afterward,I'll leave this country. With Verena gone, no one will testify, and suspicion won't touch you."


Kaia nodded slowly. "Alright, that eases my mind."


Impatient, Katelyn wrapped up their conversation briskly. "Enough talk. Tomorrow, after | keep lsaac occupied, I'll have someone send you a photo as proof. Once my people call, you'll take Verena to the factory without delay."


Kaia assured her, "Don't worry. I'll make sure she's there."



With that, Katelyn hung up.


Kaia stared at the screen, her eyes resting on the recording time, a mocking smile tugging at her lips.






Once Kaia left, Verena immediately sent lsaac a message,relaying Katelyn's plot.


Her intent had been merely to inform him, so he could prepare.


Yet unexpectedly, Isaac called at once.


The moment she picked up, his voice came urgent through the line. "Verena, why don't I send someone to drive Katelyn out of the country right now? That way you won't have to risk anything."


Verena said with a calm smile, "That isn't necessary.Since she wants to use this scheme against me, I'll see that she bears the full weight of it. Exile won't restrain her; for someone like her, only prison bars <###Chapter 191 Reward                    曹色 +120 Points at most can."

Sensing his worry, she softened her tone. "I know you're anxious, but rest easy. I'll be cautious."
A low laugh drifted from the other end, surprising her."Why are you laughing?" she asked, puzzled.
Isaac's lips curved gently, his voice tender. "Because this time, when danger came,you told me first."
In the past, she had confided in Miranda, in other friends, or simply borne the burden alone,leaving him in the dark.

Hearing this, Verena couldn't help but chuckle.that really worth celebrating?"
"Of course," he replied without a second thought.
Verena paused, her eyes glimmering playfully. "Then when this is over, I'll give you a reward."
Isaac's tone carried curiosity. "And what might that be?"
Her eyes twinkled as she teased, "A full one-hour  test for the treatment effect." He stayed silent, still confused, and she realized he hadn't grasped her meaning.

Smiling, she explained patiently, "Last time, it lasted thirty-two minutes. This time, let's see how long it can go."
###Chapter 192 The Show Must Go On




A playful note still hung in Verena's voice, her teasing unrestrained. It took Isaac a moment to catch on, and he cleared his throat, hoping to mask his embarrassment.


Color rushed to his ears, but a small, involuntary smile gave him away.


Sensing his shyness, Verena decided to ease up and let the moment go.


"Fine, I'll stop teasing you, for now. But brace yourself, Katelyn's going to show up tomorrow. Be ready."


Instantly, Isaac's demeanor shifted. He replied, all trace of playfulness gone, "I'll have security on standby. Promise me you'll be carefual."


When noon arrived, Isaac exited the elevator and immediately spotted Katelyn waiting in the lobby. His gaze swept over her, impassive and quick.


Without acknowledging her, he allowed Jacob to push his wheelchair right toward the exit.


Katelyn, unwilling to be ignored, called out, "Isaac, I need to talk to you."


A single lift of Isaac's hand stopped his assistant.


He looked at Katelyn, his stare as cold as his tone."Katelyn. There's nothing left between us."


Stung by his words, Katelyn clenched her jaw. Years of friendship meant nothing to him now; he was casting her aside as if she were nobody.


It felt as if Verena stood at the root of it all. Would things have ended like this if she hadn't come along?


Not that it mattered anymore.


Verena wasn't going to end up with lsaac, not if she had no chance of having him herself.


Let them believe in their happy ending. Katelyn was eager to watch it unravel. Her fists tightened, knuckles pale, as she struggled to steady her trembling hands.


Wearing an expression full of remorse, she lowered her voice. "Isaac, I get it-you despise me for all the lies. I'm not here to hold on to you anymore.I understand you never loved me, and I've truly moved on."



A cold glint flickered in lsaac's eyes, a silent smirk forming beneath his calm exterior.


If she ever wanted a career, acting would have suited her well; such a shame she poured her talent into deception instead.


So,she was stalling for time?


He could play her game a little longer.


Relaxing in his chair, Isaac's words cut through the act. "Do you even buy your own story?"


White-knuckled, Katelyn dug her nails into her bag's strap, fighting to keep her anger in check. Forcing a shaky breath, she let her eyes glisten. "You can believe whatever you want. I have my ticket; I'll be gone tomorrow afternoon. Isaac, after everything we've been through, can't you have one last meal with me? Just a meal, nothing more. Think of it as saying goodbye. Once I leave, you won't ever have to see me again."

Inside, Katelyn nearly burst into laughter.

Their paths would never cross again, she'd see to that herself.

By the time she boarded her flight, Isaac and Verena would be nothing more than a memory.

As for her, a new Chapter was waiting, untouched by any of them. The rush of anticipation almost made her break character, a smile threatening to escape.

With a light rap of his knuckle on the armrest, Isaac angled his jaw slightly upward.

Eventually, he replied, voice devoid of warmth, "Out of respect for your parents, I'll give you this one meal."
Inside the restaurant, from her purse, Katelyn drew out a black card and pushed it across the table in Isaac's direction.
Isaac arched an eyebrow at the card. "And what exactly is this meant to imply?"
A soft, practiced smile played on Katelyn's lips."Think of it as compensation. It's meant for Verena,actually. I can't bring myself to face her directly, so l hope you'll give her this card. It's an apology for everything I've put her through."
With a steady hand, Isaac slid the card right back across the table. "I'll make sure my wife hears your apology. But there's no need for the rest."

·.·
At the same time, Verena set out to meet Kaia as they'd agreed.
Flagging down a cab, she soon arrived at a derelict  factory far from the city center. Wild vines crawled over broken concrete, and shards of glass cracked beneath every step.
The place was silent, deserted-nobody in their right mind would come here by choice.

Still, the show must go on.
A quick scan of her surroundings confirmed Verena was alone with Kaia.
Turning sharply to Kaia, she spoke with urgency in her voice. "You told me Isaac was forced into a car.Where is he? Show me where he is!"
Nervous flickers ran through Kaia's eyes before Verena seized her arm. "Where's Isaac? Say it! Say..."Suddenly,a loud crack rang out.
A man dressed in black stepped out from the shadows and struck Verena from behind, knocking her unconscious.

Within seconds, more men emerged, moving in to tie her up tightly.


The leader reached for his phone and sent a message. "Miss Fuller, we have her."
###Chapter 193 She Would See Him Ruined
Katelyn was wearing a mask of remorse before lsaac when her phone suddenly chimed with a message notification.



Her lips curved in a smile, and then she pretended to clutch her stomach, her brows drawn tight in mock discomfort.



Isaac understood perfectly why she was playing this charade.



He chose to act along, his expression turning deliberately cold and impatient as he asked, "What's troubling you this time?"


His tone was as steady as ever, giving Katelyn no reason to doubt him. She pressed her brows together again, her voice tinged with false apology."Forgive me, Isaac. My stomach isn't well-I need to step away to the restroom."


Isaac gave a small nod, granting permission without a second thought.


Katelyn picked up her phone and hurried away.


Once inside the restroom, she unlocked the screen in haste. The moment she saw the message from Elmore Finch, the hitman she had hired, a sinister thrill flickered across her face.


At last, Verena was within her grasp.


She dialed Elmore's number without delay.


The call was answered almost immediately.


Lowering her voice, Katelyn asked, "Are you certain she's been captured?"


Elmore's voice came steady. "Rest assured, Miss Fuller. She's unconscious, tied securely, and we're waiting on you to handle the rest."


Katelyn had given strict orders: no one was to touch Verena until she arrived. Elmore and his men were merely tasked with the capture, not the kill.


For Katelyn longed to witness with her own eyes-Verena kneeling, begging for her life, confessing her faults.


Yet Isaac remained a danger she had to keep tightly in check. He could never be allowed to notice Verena's disappearance.


With this thought burning in her mind, she made another call-to the other hitman she had hired at a steep price.


No pleasantries, no wasted words. She went straight to the point the moment the line connected. "Have you secured Isaac's assistant?"


A raspy voice answered with grim confidence,"You needn't worry. When I strike, failures do not exist. A timed bomb has already been set in the car. Once Isaac gets in, he'll have no escape."


This hitman was bought with heavy coin, and Katelyn placed full faith in him.


Yet she would not allow Isaac an easy death.


"Once he's in the car, stall him. Don't let him perish too swiftly."


If she couldn't possess him, she would see him ruined.




After all, Isaac had not only denied her love but had shamed her without mercy. She would make him pay the full price of scorning her.


Before death claimed him, she wanted him to watch Verena suffer.


Having tied every loose thread, Katelyn left the restroom.


Her smile polished once more, she returned to Isaac."I'm sorry to have kept you waiting."


Isaac's eyes were cold as winter stone. "If there's nothing further, I'll be leaving."


Knowing the hitman had already taken lsaac's car and subdued his assistant, Katelyn's heart eased.


To her, the rest was but a matter of time-once Isaac entered that car, the trap would spring shut.


"Very well. Thank you for meeting me today," Katelyn said, forcing a bitter smile. "Goodbye, Isaac. Once I walk away, perhaps I'll never return. For everything I've done, I hope you and Verena might find it in your hearts to forgive."


Isaac gave no reply, only turned his wheelchair and rolled out of the restaurant.


Katelyn's eyes followed his retreating back as she trailed behind at a measured pace.


She watched Jacob lift him carefully into the car,noticed Jacob's hesitant hands and the sweat standing on his brow, and then her gaze caught on the driver-masked, hidden behind sunglasses.


The man cast her a fleeting glance; their eyes met,and a slight nod passed between them.


Only then did Katelyn feel assured enough to step into her own car.


In her mind, Isaac was already a trapped bird with broken wings, struggling without hope.


But inside the car, Isaac leaned against the seat with quiet composure and asked the driver in a low voice,"Is my wife safe?"
###Chapter 194 I'll Kill You





At the question, the masked driver let his icy facade crack-the same cold mask he had shown Katelyn earlier-and in an instant, his demeanor shifted.


He turned his head, offering lsaac a respectful nod."Rest easy, Mr. Bennett. I've already spoken with Elmore-he'll pretend to knock Mrs. Bennett unconscious just to make it convincing. He knows the line that must never be crossed. Mrs. Bennett will not be harmed."



Yet even with that assurance, lsaac could not shake the thorn of unease, buried too deep in his chest to ignore.


His jaw lifted slightly, his voice steady but edged with steel."Go."


"Understood." The driver snapped the wheel.


Moments later, the black vehicle slid onto the main road.



Certain she had lsaac firmly under her thumb,Katelyn made her way to the abandoned factory on the outskirts to meet Elmore.



She stepped out of the car and found him waiting at the factory entrance, looming like a sentinel on guard.


"She's still unconscious, isn't she?" Katelyn asked.


Elmore, with his bald skull and a centipede-shaped scar etched across his brow, looked like a walking nightmare dressed in flesh.


At her words, he bobbed his head with slavish eagerness.


"Yes, she's still tied to the chair. Out cold."


A cruel smile curved Katelyn's lips, chilling in its delight.


Eager to see Verena collapse to her knees in despair,she strode inside quickly. Elmore hurried in after her.



Outside the factory, a black car idled quietly at the roadside.



Isaac cast a glance toward Jacob in the passenger seat. "What's the situation inside?"


An earpiece clung to Jacob's right ear, while his hands held the binoculars steady as stone.


From where he sat, he had a perfect view of the factory interior.


"Bodyguards, snipers, police-all are already in place. Everything is ready."


Isaac's gaze hardened, cold as tempered steel."Tell them-stay sharp. Verena's safety comes first. Not a scratch on her."



Jacob pressed the earpiece, his voice low as he relayed Isaac's command.


Inside, Katelyn stepped into the factory and spotted Verena slumped in a chair, tied fast, her head hanging.


A rush of warped joy ignited within her, her nerves sizzling as though the storm itself raged inside her skin.


Her laughter shattered the silence, jagged and manic, ricocheting off the hollow walls.


The echoes twisted in the darkness, eerie as restless spirits weeping in the night.


But just assuddenly, it cut off.


"No. This isn't enough. I want her awake. I want her to witness every moment of me breaking her."


Fixing her eyes on Verena, Katelyn stretched her hand toward Elmore. "Water. Now."


He scrambled to pass her a bottle.


Katelyn twisted the cap and flung the contents across Verena's face.


Elmore, long since bought with Verena's money, had staged the earlier brutality. That blow to Verena's head had looked vicious, but landed light.


Verena had slackened on purpose, feigning unconsciousness as she let Elmore tie her down-a snare carefully laid to drag Kátelyn into her own undoing.


Among the men who had restrained her here, only Elmore answered secretly to Verena. The rest? They were Katelyn's loyal hands.


Hearing Katelyn demand water, Verena had already stolen a hidden breath.


As the water struck her face, she forced a ragged cough,letting her head loll weakly to the side.


Wet strands of hair clung to her cheek, her frail,trembling frame making Katelyn shudder with perverse pleasure.


She stepped closer, clamping Verena's chin in a hard grip. "Look at me. Look who stands before you."


Verena cracked her eyes open, feigning shock. "Katelyn?"  A manic grin spread across Katelyn's face. "That'sright. Me. Didn't see this coming, did you? So what ifyou won lsaac's heart? In the end, you still landed inmy hands."
Verena blinked,as though only now realizing herplight, her voice cutting like frost. "Do you evenrealize this is a crime? You'll pay for it in court.
Katelyn's laugh turned low and venomous, her griptightening."Crime? By the time anyone finds you, !'lbe gone overseas. No one will trace it back to meVerena, your end comes from my hand. And l won'let it be quick. Every ounce of humiliation you dealme-l'll return, carved back into you piece by piece.
The more she spoke, the wilder the gleam in her eyesbecame.
Grinding her teeth,she squeezed Verena's jawharder."You always thought yourself above medidn't you? Always looking down on me. Now it's myturn. You'l kneel before me. Beg. Apologize. Cry for mercy."
Katelyn shoved Verena's chin away and barked at Elmore, "Force her down. Make her kneel."
Elmore moved to obey, but before his hand could reach, Verena snapped her head up and spat straight into Katelyn's face.
"You want me on my knees? Keep dreaming. You really think tying me here means no one will know?Isaac's sharp-he'll know it was you. And he'll never let you walk free."
Katelyn had long known Isaac's heart had never been hers-she had swallowed that bitter pill long ago.
He had shattered her once, so completely that she no longer cared for his affection.
But what she could never endure was watching him pour all of it into Verena.
Each time Verena spoke his name, each time she basked in his devotion, it struck Katelyn like a slap across the face. Isaac would not even spare her a glance, and that wound cut deeper than hatred itself.


Rage seared through her, her body trembling with envy and spite.


"Never let me walk free?" Her lips curled into a twisted sneer. "Then you think I'll let him live? Since you're so certain he's coming to save you, I'll make sure you never reunite-except in the afterlife."


She shoved Verena's head downward, forcing her toward the floor.


Through clenched teeth, Katelyn spat, "Isaac can't even save himself. Did you truly think he could save you? I've already sent an assassin after him. There's a bomb beneath his car. One word from me, and he's blown to pieces. But don't worry-before he dies,he'll see it all: his precious woman being humiliated,broken and begging. I'll carve you up and leave the rats to feast on what remains."


Her eyes burned crimson, her voice twisting into something monstrous. Meanwhile, in the black car outside,Jacob tracked the scene through his binoculars.


"Mr. Bennett! Mrs. Bennett's head is being forced down. Katelyn's hysterical-she could snap at any moment."



Isaac's fists clenched, his throat tightening.


His voice cracked out, sharp as a whip. "Move in."


Jacob started to respond, but froze as a flicker caught in his lens-Verena, wrists bound behind her,had flashed the stop sign they had agreed on.


It was her command: hold. Wait.


Jacob relayed instantly, "Mrs. Bennett says wait.Don't move yet."


Isaac's brow furrowed, every instinct screaming to strike, yet he knew Verena's mind worked with its own design.


Through clenched teeth, he swallowed his worries and forced the words."Follow her lead." Inside, Verena kept her gaze locked on Katelyn,wrists bound behind her. The signal had gone unnoticed.


Her brow arched, her voice dripping with scorn."And you think this changes anything? In the end, nothing truly changes. Did you truly believe stealing my name could make lsaac yours? Pathetic. You were never Evelyn. You never had the skill. In the end, you gained nothing-dragging yourself through the mud.When you stole my name, you must have thought yourself untouchable, parading as Evelyn. But the truth? I am Evelyn. Always have been. And you?You're a fraud, too afraid to stand on your own name.You were never my equal. You're trash. Even your hospital job overseas-you clawed your way there through disgrace. Everyone knows. Even bound here,I'll never lower my head. If you think I'll kneel and beg,keep dreaming."



Every word Verena flung struck like shards of glass,each slicing Katelyn's pride raw.

 
Her chest rose and fell in furious heaves, her glare blazing with twisted rage.


Jealousy, fury, and bitter resentment burned like live coals in her eyes.


At last, pushed beyond the edge, Katelyn broke into a wild, unhinged laugh. "So you won't listen, and you won't kneel? Fine. Then I'll carve you apart and bleed you ddry!"


Her gaze snapped toward Elmore. Without hesitation,he pressed a hidden knife into her palm.



Katelyn's eyes blazed red, her face twisted into the mask of a madwoman.


She lifted the blade high, her scream tearing the air."P'l kill you! I'll kill you!"


But in the very heartbeat the knife came slashing down, Verena jerked her bound wrists behind her,flashing the agreed signal.


From the shadows, the sniper-waiting like a coiled hawk-needed no second cue. His finger tightened.


The shot rang out, the bullet slicing through Katelyn's arm with merciless precision.


The knife tumbled from her grip, clattering to the floor as crimson spread swiftly across her sleeve.


She clutched the wound, her face twisted in agony,eyes darting in frantic disbelief.


"Who's there?" she shrieked.


But before her cry could even rebound from the walls, armed officers poured in from every side,weapons leveled and unshaking.
###Chapter 195 One Final Card





A middle-aged police officer leveled his gun at Katelyn, eyes sharp as blades. "Don't move! We're the police. You're surrounded-surrender and cooperate."


Katelyn's face drained of color, disbelief written all over her features as she scanned her surroundings.


The men she had hired to kidnap Verena were already pinned to the floor by the officers. Now, only she and Elmore remained.


Blood still streamed from her arm, the wound burning and stinging as though a thousand needles were driving into her flesh.


Her body quaked uncontrollably; clutching her injured arm, she stumbled back a few steps.


Shock and dread tangled in her chest, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her eyes widened, almost bulging, as she watched police flood in from every corner.


She stood frozen, as if chained by her own terror,unwilling to accept the brutal truth.


"How...how is this possible? How could this be?" she muttered, resentment thick in her voice.


Why were the police here?


Who called them?



Her mind raced like a wheel spinning without end,searching desperately for an answer.


Isaac had already been taken care of by the assassin she sent. It couldn't be him.


And Verena? She had no chance either-Elmore had confiscated her phone right after she was knocked unconscious.


Just as Katelyn's confusion swallowed her whole, she caught sight of Elmore striding over to Verena,loosening her ropes with swift, practiced motions. The sight made her blood run cold.


Elmore-the very man she had paid generously, who had sworn loyalty and promised to help her succeed.


And yet now...


Katelyn's lips quivered in fury, her eyes blazing. "Did Verena buy you off?"


Elmore smirked, arrogance dripping from his expression. "Sorry, Miss Fuller. My loyalty follows only the highest bidder."


"You!" Katelyn sputtered, rage choking her words.


Verena let the ropes slip from her wrists, turning her steady gaze toward Katelyn. "Katelyn, did you truly believe your plan was foolproof?"


With a scoff, she continued slowly, each word deliberate, "Every move you made was already under Isaac's and my control. Didn't you declare that both of us would die? Well, here's the bitter truth-you failed. Neither of us will perish. Isaac and I will live on, and we'll spend the rest of our days cherishing one another."


Verena paused for two measured beats, lifting her chin, her gaze sharp as a drawn sword. "And you-Shoildon's proud heiress-will become a criminal branded for life. You hired killers, and prison will be your mansion now. Isn't that a cruel twist of fate?"


Hearing Verena lay bare her ruined schemes and predict her miserable fate, Katelyn's eyes reddened,veins of fury running through them.


Even now, she refused to believe that her carefully laid net had unraveled completely.


But denial could not change reality.


Every step had been foreseen by Verena; Katelyn had been nothing more than a puppet dancing on strings.


Would she bow her head and admit defeat?



No.



Never.


She had to find a way to turn the tide, to clear her name at all costs.


A crooked smile crept across her lips, twisting her face into something both desperate and deranged.


For all of Verena's wit, she could never have guessed that Katelyn had kept one final card up her sleeve.


Suddenly, Katelyn thrust a finger toward Elmore, her voice shrill with feigned panic. "Elmore! Why did you kidnap Verena?"


Then,whirling toward Verena, she cried out, "Verena,Kaia told me you were taken by Elmore. I came to rescue you, not to harm you! I was about to cut the ropes with the knife to free you. You've misunderstood everything. I never hired anyone to kill. You have no evidence-mere words cannot condemn me. I truly came to save you! If you don't trust me, ask Kaia!"
###Chapter 196 Evidence




Katelyn had a backup plan. She had feared that if she killed Verena and the matter was ever pursued,fleeing abroad would be as useless as running in circles.


She knew her butler valued his son above all else, so she lured him with silver and promises, offering wealth and prosperity for his son's family.


The bargain was clear: if things went awry, the butler alone would shoulder the blame.


Temptation often blinds judgment, and the butler accepted without much hesitation.


Besides, it was the butler who had mostly dealt with Elmore.



As far as Katelyn was concerned, she had clean hands-no thread for the police to unravel. Watching her desperate attempt to escape punishment, Verena narrowed her eyes.


She saw plainly that Katelyn was not strong but merely drowning in her own failure, hiding despair and fear behind a mask of frenzy and feigned bravado.


Verena did not let her savor those delusions. She pierced the bubble without mercy.


"You imagine Kaia would still rush to your rescue now? She isn't like you, hardened by deceit. She's naive, yes-but not so blind as to stain her hands with crime."


Verena's lips curved in a wry smile. "You say you came to save me? That's laughable. Do you think everyone is witless, unable to guard evidence? Kaia recorded every word of your dealings with her. And your butler-the one you believed would gallantly take the fall-I already hold proof of your transactions and your scheme of hiring hitmen."


As if recalling something, Verena cast her gaze around the factory. "Ah, I nearly forgot. From the moment you stepped inside, every word, every move was caught on camera. You can neither flee nor wash your name clean."


A faint smile touched her face as she added slowly,"But take comfort-though you wished for my death,I won't grant you the mercy of dying. Death would free you too easily. Instead, you'll waste away in prison until the end of your days."


Her mocking gaze fell upon Katelyn.


From Verena's eyes, Katelyn read nothing but contempt and cold superiority, as though she were a mere insect pinned beneath glass.


"No...no..."


Katelyn shook her head violently, whispering like someone possessed, "This can't be, I won't lose...I won't lose."


Her chest rose and fell in ragged waves as she staggered backward. She clawed at her hair with both hands, desperate to wake from what felt like a nightmare.


But the tearing pain on her scalp drove home the cruel truth-this nightmare was real.


She had lost.


The realization cracked her completely.


She bent low, cursing under her breath, and then broke into a wild, jagged laugh, her figure trembling like a puppet on broken strings.


Abruptly, the laughter cut off. She jerked her head up, eyes blazing at Verena.


Those bloodshot eyes seemed on the verge of bursting, her features twisted like a demon's mask.


"Verena, do you think this will make me bow my head?"


Her rasping voice echoed through the vast factory,chilling the air itself.


Her gaze darted to the knife glinting on the floor, anda deranged smile tugged at her lips.


"As long as you're dead, I haven't lost!"


She lunged down, snatched the knife, and clutched it in her left hand, raising it high to drive it into Verena's chest.


But the police were quicker than her madness.


Bang-bang-bang!


Gunfire cracked through the factory, deafening and absolute.


Three bullets tore into her arm and shoulder.


Agony ripped through her, and the knife flew from her grasp.


The searing pain spread like lightning, blood gushing down her arm, dyeing her white coat into a grotesque red shroud.


Her vision wavered, legs faltering beneath her.


With a heavy thud, she collapsed unconscious onto the floor.
###Chapter 197 The Chaos Seemed To Draw To A Close
As Katelyn collapsed unconscious, officers surged forward, snapping cuffs around her wrists, ready to haul her toward the waiting police car.


Outside, the crack of three gunshots sent lsaac reeling. His voice was tight with urgency as he ordered Jacob to push him into the factory at once.


The moment his eyes found Verena standing safe and unscathed, a heavy breath of relief escaped him.


Jacob stopped the chair in front of her, and Isaac's gaze swept her from head to toe, searching for the slightest injury.


Once he was certain she was unharmed,he clutched her hand with a desperate strength and lifted his other hand to her face, brushing her cheek as fear clouded his expression. "That was reckless," he said hoarsely. "Promise me you'll never throw yourself into danger like that again."


The words trembled with genuine terror-he had lived through the longest minutes of his life waiting outside.


Even with police and bodyguards positioned all around the factory, dread had clawed at him.


And when those gunshots rang out, knowing she was still inside, the thought of losing her nearly broke him.


He cursed himself silently for ever letting her take the risk.



His eyes, usually so composed, now brimmed with an emotion he struggled to hide.


Verena read the storm in his gaze. She pressed her palm against the hand on her cheek, her smile gentle but unwavering. "Some chances can't be wasted,Isaac. If I hadn't gone through with this, we never  would've uncovered the full scope of Katelyn's crimes. The more evidence exposed, the harsher her punishment will be. And when that time comes, not even the Fuller family's power will be enough to save her."



Though she had a point, Isaac couldn't shake the fear gnawing at him-he should never have let her take such a gamble.


The outcome had been in their favor, but the thought of what might have gone wrong sent a cold dread through him.


He forced the images away, unwilling to imagine a world where she hadn't walked out unharmed.


After steadying himself, he fixed his gaze on her,brows drawn, and his voice softened. "Does your head ache?"



Verena blinked in surprise before realizing what he meant. He was thinking of the strike Elmore had landed on her earlier. Of course, Isaac had to know the truth-that Elmore had been bribed, and the blow had been little more than theater.


Yet the concern in his eyes was genuine,his question sincere.


The tenderness in his expression warmed her in a way she hadn't expected. Smiling, she shook her head and answered, "He barely touched me. It didn't hurt at all."



Relief washed through Isaac at her reassurance, the tension easing from his shoulders at last.


Verena's gaze shifted briefly across the factory-Katelyn's allies were already shackled, marched out one by one by uniformed officers.


Katelyn, still unconscious, was being lifted to her feet.





Justice had caught up to the guilty at last, and the chaos that had plagued them seemed to draw to a close. For the first time in what felt like forever, Verena allowed herself to wish for a quieter life beyond the turmoil.



Drawing her focus back to the man before her,she lowered herself to his level, her fingers slipping around his hands with tender certainty. "Isaac, the obstacles that stood between us are gone now. I can finally start preparing for your surgery."


The possibility of surgery so close at hand left Isaac momentarily stunned.


Hope flickered in his eyes, slowly rising until it lit his entire expression.


Could this mean he was finally a step closer to living like any other man?


The thought alone sent a rush of joy through him,stirring emotions he could barely contain.


A rare smile tugged at his lips, his eyes glimmering with anticipation. His voice came rough, weighed down by the effort of holding back his excitement. "Good. I'll wait for you. For now... let's go home."


"Alright," Verena replied with a gentle smile, her warmth shining through her eyes.


She rose to her feet and began pushing his wheelchair toward the doors.


But as they moved past Katelyn, Verena's gaze strayed to the side. Her brows pinched together instinctively.


Earlier she had felt nothing, but the moment her eyes landed on Katelyn, the scene struck her hard. Blood slicked down the woman's arm, dripping into a dark pool beneath her, the red mingling with dust and shards of debris as officers hauled her to her feet.



The grisly sight twisted Verena's stomach, a sharp nausea rising like a wave she couldn't push back.


Her throat burned with bitterness, the taste of bile forcing her to freeze mid-step behind Isaac's chair.


Her body folded forward against her will, one arm clutching her stomach while the other pressed against her chest as if to hold herself steady.


"Ugh-" The sound broke from her as she gagged,retching dryly again and again. Color rushed to her cheeks, her skin flushed crimson as the violent heaving left her breathless.


The sound of her gagging made Isaac whip his head around, his gaze tightening with alarm. "What's happening? Are you alright?"


Verena pressed a hand over her chest, her face red but resolute. She forced a faint shake of her head."It's nothing serious. Let's just go home."







The air inside the abandoned factory had been thick with dust, clinging to their clothes and hair. By the time they returned to Seraphina Villas, Verena headed straight for the shower, washing away the grime of the day.


When she stepped out wrapped in fresh clothes,Isaac wheeled himself into the bathroom to do the  same.



Left alone in the quiet bedroom, Verena drifted toward the wide floor-to-ceiling window.


She crossed her arms, her eyes fixed on the sky beyond, distant and unreadable.


For a long while she stood there in silence, her thoughts a current only she could follow.


At last, she reached for her phone and dialed a familiar number.



"Evelyn," came Julianna's respectful voice as she answered.


Verena wasted no time on greetings, her tone brisk and decisive. "Julianna, I need you to take care of something for me."


"P'll handle it," Julianna replied promptly. "What are your instructions?"


"Good," Verena replied. "Reach out to every major media outlet. Tomorrow I'll be holding a press conference. The purpose will be to announce the relocation of the overseas hospital to Akoitha."


There was no hesitation on Julianna's end, only efficient compliance. "Understood. I'll notify the press immediately."


Verena's tone softened as she closed out the call."I appreciate your.effort,Julianna. Thank you."


The line went dead, but before she could set her phone aside, it lit up with an incoming call.


Her lips curved into a faint smile when she saw the name on the screen.



"Miranda. To what do I owe the honor?"



An exasperated voice shot back instantly. "Are you insane? You actually revealed to the world that you're Evelyn? Something this huge, and you just blurt it out in front of the media? Do you have any idea the kind of storm you've kicked up?"


Miranda had been drowning in work lately, too consumed by deadlines to keep up with headlines.  Only that morning, while scrolling through international coverage, had she nearly dropped her coffee when she saw Verena's face. The reports confirmed everything-Verena had traveled to Clokron days earlier and performed surgery on the chairman of Smoothdeed Group, saving his life.


But what stunned Miranda most was that Verena hadn't hidden behind her alias. She had announced,publicly and without hesitation, that she was Evelyn.


The revelation had made Miranda lose control in her office, her voice rising in disbelief until she remembered the walls were soundproof.


Had anyone overheard, the cool, decisive image she cultivated as a businesswoman would have shattered on the spot.


After watching the replay of the interview in disbelief,she dialed Verena repeatedly.


Every attempt had failed-until now. This time, she finally got through.Miranda's voice climbed in frustration, her words carrying more edge than usual.


Verena tilted her head slightly, easing the phone away from her ear with a faint smile.


"Why so riled up? Isn't this a good thing? I can't live behind a mask forever, can l?" she teased lightly before letting her tone fall into something steadier."Katelyn was only one case. Who knows how many more are exploiting my name to trick patients? By stepping forward, I cut off their lies before more people suffer."


But Miranda didn't care about frauds or strangers-her worry was for Verena alone.


"Don't you see what you've done? This is the same as painting a target on your back." Her voice softened, though the weight of concern pressed through. "You already know there are plenty of people out there who'd love to hurt you. Now that everyone knows who you really are, you've made yourself more vulnerable than ever." The woman who usually laughed her way through problems now sounded grave, her words heavy with fear.



Verena felt a warmth stir in her chest at the depth of her friend's concern.


"Miranda, do you know why I chose now to reveal the truth?"


"Why?" Miranda asked quickly, her voice still tight.


Verena's gaze wandered to the world beyond the tall windows, her thoughts spilling into words. "In Clokron, I built countless connections, yet I never dared to reveal myself. I knew too well that most people are swayed by greed. That's why, aside from you and Gavin, I kept it from everyone else."


After a thoughtful pause, Verena's lips curved slightly. "But things aren't the same anymore. I have Isaac now. With the Bennett family's influence in Akoitha, they're practically treated like royalty.Anyone thinking of crossing me would have to weigh the cost carefully." Her words carried a quiet joy, laced with steady conviction.



Miranda's brows knitted together in doubt. "You really place that much faith in lsaac? Aren't you worried he could turn on you someday?"


Verena's smile deepened, her voice calm and unwavering. "He's my husband, Miranda. Trusting him isn't a choice-it's a certainty."


The Bennett family's name alone stood untouchable in Akoitha, especially in Shoildon, the capital,their power beyond question.


Miranda sifted through every possibility, but no rival came to mind-no one had the means to oppose them.


For the first time, she found herself admitting that Isaac was, indeed, a man worthy of Verena's lifelong trust.



Relieved,she let her worries slip away with a sigh and quickly shifted her tone back to her usual teasing self.

"I get it now. You've found your knight in shining armor, and here I was wasting energy fretting over you."
###Chapter 198 | Could Spend My Whole Life Watching You
Verena chuckled at the phrase "knight in shining armor" as if it were both ridiculous and charming at the same time.


She lingered in easy conversation with Miranda, their voices weaving together in lighthearted chatter.


The silence in the bedroom was so complete that the faint echo from the phone's receiver stood out with striking clarity.


Isaac had emerged from the bathroom, still drying his hair, and caught the tail end of what was being said.


As the words drifted to him, his chest gave an unexpected jolt, and his heartbeat began to beat faster.



When Verena answered Miranda, her tone made his pulse stumble in disbelief. "He's my husband, Miranda. Trusting him isn't a choice-it's a certainty."


Her voice rang with pride, soft yet radiant with happiness, and every bit of it reached him.


Isaac realized she wasn't pretending for anyone's sake.She meant every word.


The corners of his mouth lifted in a smile as he let that truth sink in.


Contentment rolled through him, thick and warm,wrapping him in the certainty of her faith in him.


He had begun to notice subtle signs that she was thinking more about him lately.


Could it mean she was beginning to feel something deeper for him?


Isaac didn't dare to push his luck. Having this moment, just as it was, already felt like more than enough.


The two ladies' conversation drifted lazily between  topics until Verena caught a flicker of movement in the glass of the windows.


There, in the reflection, Isaac sat motionless in his chair, his eyes fixed steadily on her.


His focus was so deep that he didn't realize she had already noticed him watching.


A playful curve touched her lips as she spoke into the phone. "Alright then. We'll stop here for now. We can talk more when we're both free."


With that, she ended the call and set the phone aside.


When she turned, her head tilted slightly, and a teasing lilt colored her voice. "Tell me, Mr. Bennett,how long were you planning to spy on me from over there?"


"I could spend my whole life watching you," said Isaac, his dark gaze locking with hers while a smile tugged at his mouth.


Not long ago, such a direct call-out from her would  have left him flustered and tongue-tied.



Now, though, he had found his footing.


He could sense the shift in her, faint but unmistakable, as if she were beginning to care for him in ways she hadn't before.


That fragile spark was enough for him to cling to, and he silently vowed to let her see the depth of his devotion.



Verena's eyes widened slightly as she was startled by how smoothly he had turned her jab into something bold.



She had meant only to tease him, yet here he was,tossing back a line that made her heart skip.


She let out a soft laugh as she strolled over, lowering herself onto his lap as though it was the most natural thing in the world.



"Why didn't you say a word? You didn't even bother to ask me to come closer."  Isaac's arms instinctively circled her waist, pulling her against him. "You were busy talking to your friend. I didn't want to cut in."


Her eyes glimmered with mischief as she tilted her head. "So you heard all of it, didn't you?"


He gave a slow nod, the corners of his mouth betraying the satisfaction he didn't bother to hide.


Catching that look, she arched a brow. "And now you're pleased with yourself, huh?"


Her lips curled into a teasing smile, and the playful gleam in her eyes reminded him of a child who had just pulled off a trick.


Instead of answering, Isaac bent forward and captured her mouth, his kiss making it clear how thrilled he was.


"Mmm..." A muffled sound escaped her throat,startled yet sweet, before his kiss swallowed the rest.


Feeling Verena's clear affection for him stirred something deeper in him, a need that grew harder to control.



His breath grew ragged as he pressed closer, desire coursing hot through him.


"Ah..."



The moment threatened to deepen, but Verena suddenly pressed against his chest and bolted toward the bathroom.



Isaac froze, staring after her in disbelief. Had she really just shoved him away?



Had she been so repulsed that she actually felt like throwing up?


Isaac's gaze lingered on the closed bathroom door,unease knotting in his chest.



Was she truly that uncomfortable with him?



No... that couldn't be it.



He brushed a hand across his mouth, remembering the sweets he had eaten earlier that evening.  Maybe the lingering taste had turned her off?



But then again, he had already brushed his teeth and even used a freshener.


There was no way a trace of it should have remained.


Even so, a wave of embarrassment burned through him, tinting his ears pink.


After a moment of hesitation, he wheeled himself quietly to the bathroom and sat there debating.Finally, he raised his hand and gave the door a soft knock. "Verena, are you alright in there?"


Gripping the edge of the sink for support, Verena gagged a few times,though nothing came out.


When Isaac's voice drifted through the door, she glanced over her shoulder. "It's alright. My stomach just flipped for a bit."


She twisted the faucet on, cupped her hands beneath the stream, and rinsed her mouth with cool water. While the water slipped through her fingers, a sudden thought struck her.
For someone as meticulous about her health as she was, random nausea wasn't common. Regular checkups always kept her in the clear.
Could it be...pregnancy?
The idea startled her, leaving Verena staring at her reflection in disbelief.
Her cycle was already three days late, but three days alone wasn't proof of anything.
With a quick shake of her head, she told herself she would schedule a hospital visit tomorrow to be certain.
There was no need to mention it to lsaac yet. She didn't want to spark his excitement only to have it mean nothing.
After taking a steadying breath, she turned off the tap and stepped out of the bathroom. The moment he saw her, lsaac's voice came out tense. "Are you really okay? Should I call a doctor to check on you?" She dismissed the suggestion with a wave of her hand. "No, don't fuss. I just need some water, and I'll be fine."

Relieved but still cautious, Isaac gave a slow nod.
Once she stepped out to get a glass of water, Isaac slipped into the bathroom, grabbed a cup, and began scrubbing at his teeth all over again without a word.

By the time Verena came back carrying a glass of water, she caught sight of him still bent over the sink,toothbrush in hand.
Setting her glass down, she frowned in amusement."You've been at it forever. What on earth are you still brushing for?"

At the sound of her voice, he turned his head, letting out a muffled "Hmm?" through a mouthful of foam.

The bristles kept moving, his words swallowed in   toothpaste and bubbles, making his usually composed self look surprisingly awkward.


The sight made him seem far less intimidating than usual, and oddly enough, there was something almost adorable about it.


Before he could get another word out, she pieced the whole thing together, remembering how she had rushed off earlier.



Leaning casually against the doorframe, she let out a laugh. "Wait... do you honestly think I ran off to throw up because of our kiss?"


His toothbrush stilled, and he muttered through the foam,"Wasn't that it?"


His·brows knitted together, a faint shadow of hurt flickering in his expression, leaving him looking both troubled and strangely pitiful.


Unable to stop herself, Verena stepped forward,resting a hand on his shoulder as her laughter softened. "Of course not. We've kissed plenty of  times. Why would I suddenly feel sick from that? As for the real reason-well, I'll tell you tomorrow."

Verena studied the sharp lines of his face, and then gave his cheek a teasing poke before leaning close to whisper, "Rinse that foam off first."

The moment her words confirmed it hadn't been about the kiss, relief washed over lsaac, loosening the tension that had gripped him.

A faint grin tugged at his lips, unguarded and genuine.

Without protest, he bent over the sink, swished water around his mouth, and wiped away the last traces of toothpaste.

Before he could straighten fully, Verena brushed a quick kiss against his lips, light as a feather.

"My husband is the cutest," she said, her tone sweet but threaded with playful warmth. Color bloomed across his ears at the unexpected praise, betraying the shyness he couldn't quite hide. Noticing it instantly, Verena tilted closer, pressing a soft kiss against his ear just to fluster him more.
That playful kiss against his ear unraveled him completely, sparking a rush he couldn't contain.
His chest tightened, and in one swift motion, Isaac hauled her into his embrace, clutching her as though she was the only thing that could steady him.
Holding her like this felt like staking a silent claim-like she was his, and would always remain so.
"You're the one who started this," he murmured, his voice low and rough, before pressing a trail of kisses -first to her forehead, then the tip of her nose, and finally her lips.
In an instant, the balance between them shifted,and it was he who pressed forward, leading the moment.
Verena sensed exactly where his touch was headed,yet she caught his wandering hand and shook her head. "Not tonight, Isaac."

Her voice trembled, raw and breathless, betraying  both want and restraint. He lifted his gaze, eyes slightly bloodshot, a question flickering in the depths.
Why pull away now, after teasing him like that?
Noticing the frustration in his expression, she leaned close, her lips brushing his ear. "Wait until after l've had my checkup tomorrow. I'll tell you everything then."
Silence lingered as he processed her words, his jaw tight, his thoughts racing.
Could it mean...
A spark lit in his gaze, the possibility striking him al at once. "Could it be that you..."
Before he could finish, Verena pressed a finger gently against his mouth. "Shh. Don't let your hopes run too high just yet-it might turn out to be nothing."
###Chapter 199 Evelyn, I've Come





Katelyn's arrest spread across Shoildon like wildfire.


As the daughter of a powerful businessman, her fal from grace was scandal enough, but the charges-hiring hitmen and plotting murder-set the city ablaze with attention.


What made the case explode further was her target:the wife of the Bennett heir, and the famed healer Evelyn.


The police wasted no time. Their public relations team contacted the media directly, releasing the evidence and laying bare every detail.


Within half a day, the motives, the methods, and the accomplices were splashed across headlines.


Determined to make an example of her, authorities positioned the case as a warning, and it dominated the morning news cycle. Shockwaves rippled through every corner of society.This wasn't just whispered among elites-it became open discussion on the streets.
Online, the uproar was even louder.
One stunned user posted, "Am I reading this right?Katelyn actually tried to kidnap and murder someone. Did she really think her family's name would shield her?"
Another retorted, "Nobody stands above the law. Not the rich, not the royals. Break it, and you pay."
And a third chimed in, commenting, "I thought she was just a spoiled brat leading a promiscuous life.Turns out she's a straight-up criminal. Finally, justice served!"
The final comment ignited a storm of replies across the internet. Some argued Katelyn would never be able to slip past the law, while others cynically pointed to past scandals where wealth and influence allowed criminals to walk free. The thread grew more volatile, emotions boiling over as sides clashed.
Then, a cooler voice broke through the noise."Calm down, everyone. The evidence against her is airtight -there's no way she's walking away from this. And don't forget who she targeted. Verena is married to the future chairman of Bennett Group, and Evelyn's reputation as a healer is legendary. No one in their right mind would dare cover for Katelyn."
That reasoning settled the argument quickly,silencing both skeptics and defenders alike.
From there, the discussion took a new direction,focusing on why Katelyn had gone so far.
"High society is rotten-fraud, abductions, murder.Nothing surprises me anymore. People have said for years that Katelyn was obsessed with Isaac. Looks like the jealousy over Verena being with him openly drove her over the edge. She's completely unhinged." "At least she failed. If she'd actually pulled it off,justice would've been a joke." The online chatter raged on, but in another corner of the city, Danica had just woken and switched on the morning news.
The screen flashed with footage of Katelyn lunging at Verena with a knife, followed by clips of her ranting like a woman unhinged.
Danica stared, stunned into silence, her mind reeling long after the broadcast ended.
She sank back into the sofa, her eyes wide with shock,her chest heavy with regret.
The sheer depth of Katelyn's madness was beyond anything she had ever allowed herself to believe.
The thought of how close Verena had come to death made her grip the armrests until her knuckles whitened.
She had always known Katelyn was unpredictable,but never in her worst fears had she imagined this level of cruelty.
Memories rushed back-how she had let herself be manipulated, lashing out at Verena with cutting words and cold indifference, all because of Katelyn's poison.
When international news first revealed that Verena was actually Evelyn, Danica had seen the truth laid bare. Yet pride and stubbornness had kept her from acknowledging it fully.
Looking back now, she felt nothing but shame for allowing herself to be played so easily, for letting her relationship with Verena shatter over lies.
Even after she finally knew the truth, she had clung to her pride, too proud to extend a hand, too proud to admit her fault.

Now, regret gnawed at her, heavy and merciless, for the suffering Verena had endured at Katelyn's hands.
If she could turn back time, Danica would have stood by Verena without hesitation, shutting out the poisonous whispers of others.
But time didn't bend to regret. What was done was unchangeable.
All she had left was the choice to make things right.
Danica's brows drew together as she sank deeper into thought.
She resolved then and there to find a way to apologize to Verena with sincerity.
She didn't expect forgiveness overnight-but perhaps it would quiet the guilt gnawing inside her.


At ten o'clock sharp, Verena's press conference was scheduled to begin.
Reporters had filled the hall early, equipment ready,questions rehearsed.
Cameras clicked into place, microphones tested,anticipation building like a hum in the air. "She's here! She's here!" someone whispered, and instantly every head turned toward the stage.

A figure in a khaki coat walked out, her posture elegant, her slightly wavy hair cascading down her back like a sheet of silk.

Her face was striking-refined features, luminous skin, and eyes so bright they seemed to hold light of their own.

For many reporters, it was their first time seeing Verena in person, and her beauty stunned them. But it was her quiet strengthn that truly held the room.

Verena stepped to the podium with poise, a soft smile curving her lips as she inclined her head in greeting. "Good morning, everyone. I trust you all already have an idea why I called this press conference."

Her voice carried a quiet elegance, delicate yet steady, drawing the room into her rhythm.

Despite their awe at finally seeing the elusive figure in person, the reporters remained focused, aware that today's announcement would ripple across the medical world.



Today's announcement carried weight-Verena was set to reveal the relocation of her world-renowned hospital back to Akoitha, a headline no reporter dared miss.



One journalist leaned forward eagerly. "Mrs. Bennett -or can I call you Evelyn?"


Her smile was warm but measured.11Ofcourse.Either is fine with me."



The follow-up came quickly. "Evelyn, can you confirm whether the hospital will indeed be moved to Akoitha? And if so, when will it happen?"


Pressing her lips together for a moment, Verena answered with clarity and poise, "The plan to relocate has been in discussion for some time. Today I'm making it official. As for when-it won't be long before this vision becomes reality." Another reporter raised their voice above the clicking of cameras. "Evelyn, your hospital is known for offering free care to underprivileged patients overseas. After the move, will this practice continue here at home?"



Verena's reply came without hesitation, her tone steady yet full of conviction. "Of course. To me,every life carries the same weight, and everyone deserves the chance to live. But reality is crueler to the poor. They're the ones who struggle most to even see a doctor-that is their misfortune. So wherever my hospital is, my promise remains.We'll continue providing treatment to those who truly cannot afford it. But let me be clear, free care isn't for those who have the means but simply don't want to spend. A hospital isn't a charity. That's why we have a team dedicated to carefully verifying every case."



Her words were clear, compassionate, but firm.


Verena wasn't naive. She offered mercy, but never at the cost of fairness. The policy drew a line: only the truly helpless would receive free treatment, while those with resources would shoulder their own responsibility.
Moved by her stance, the reporters broke into applause, the room filling with the sound of respect.
At the very back, a young man stood silently, his presence almost overlooked. Gold-rimmed glasses framed his refined features, lending him an air of restraint and intellect.
While the others clapped, he remained still, his hands tucked into his pockets, his eyes locked on the striking woman at the podium. The intensity in his gaze carried words he barely whispered, "Evelyn, I've come."
But his voice was drowned beneath the wave of applause,swallowed by the noise that celebrated her resolve.
###Chapter 200 Are You Nervous





The interview was live-streamed, letting the audience follow every word and gesture in real time.


Outside the interview hall, a black sedan rested by the roadside, its polished surface glinting like a mirror beneath the sun.


Inside, Isaac sat quietly in the back seat. Sunlight spilled through the window, tracing the outline of his tall figure. His long eyelashes left a faint shadow under his eyes, and the sharp lines of his profile carried a calm strength.


From this angle, he seemed almost gentle.


His gaze never left his phone, as though the world outside had ceased to exist. His expression was steady, yet his focus betrayed the gravity of what he was watching.


On the screen, Verena appeared under the blaze of lights, surrounded by cameras.
Confidence and grace poured from her as naturally as breath. With her chin lifted ever so slightly, her eyes held a quiet fire, both resolute and serene.

Each question from the reporters met with her crisp,eloquent replies-words rich with wit and poise.
Isaac realized how mistaken he had been to think she had once drawn near for the Bennett family's wealth.

After all, she was already exceptional, her reputation and networks abroad far beyond what most could dream of.
So from the beginning, perhaps she had cared for him, even if just a little.
Watching her radiance on stage, lsaac felt his heartbeat quicken, awe and admiration rising like a tide.

Every smile, every graceful motion of hers rippled through him like a pebble dropped into still waters,stirring emotions he could no longer contain. Verena-she was his.
Time in the car stretched on. In the driver's seat,
Jacob twisted his neck, easing the stiffness in his muscles.
When his eyes drifted to the rearview mirror, he froze, mouth falling open in disbelief.

The reflection showed lsaac-usually stern,composed-smiling openly, his white teeth bright against a faint blush.
He looked, for once, not like the distant CEO of Bennett Group, but like a youth hopelessly smitten.
Earlier that morning, after dropping Verena at the interview venue, Isaac had pulled out his phone,waiting patiently for the live broadcast to begin.
Though Isaac had connected his Bluetooth earphones, Jacob was certain his boss was tuned in to Verena's interview.

Such a lovesick sight was rare, so Jacob couldn't resist a tease. "Mr. Bennett, are you not going to rein it in a little? Your smile is nearly reaching your ears."
Isaac lifted his eyelids slightly.
"Is that so?" His tone was calm, yet the smile not only lingered but widened, his gaze softening into something openly adoring.
Jacob wondered if all men in love lost themselves like this.
"Jacob."
Startled by the sudden call of his name, Jacob straightened, expecting some command.
But when he met Isaac's eyes, his boss tilted his chin with quiet pride and asked, "Do you know Evelyn?"

For·a moment Jacob was dumbstruck. Since when had Isaac learned to show off? Truly, love reshaped a man in ways both startling and strange.
He kept such thoughts to himself, though his hesitant look betrayed him. "Uh... Mr. Bennett, of course | know. The news about your wife being Evelyn has been everywhere."

At that, Isaac flipped his phone around, showing the screen.
His voice brimmed with unconcealed delight.′′My wife."

Jacob blinked, caught completely off guard. On the screen, Verena's poised figure commanded the stage.
Only then did Jacob realize-his boss wasn't asking for information; he was flaunting his happiness.
Left with no choice, Jacob bobbed his head vigorously. "Yes, yes, Mr. Bennett, your wife is truly remarkable."
Isaac's smile deepened."I think so too."
With that, he turned his attention back to the broadcast,content.
Nearly twenty minutes later, the interview concluded.Jacob slipped out of the car first, opening the door in readiness.
As Verena stepped out of the building, she greeted him with a warm smile before getting in. "Thank you,and sorry for keeping you waiting."
Jacob quickly shook his head. "Not at all."
Inwardly, he muttered that the waiting itself hadn't been difficult-what had been difficult was enduring Isaac's endless display of affection.
Earlier that morning, Verena had already shared her schedule with Isaac. Now, once Jacob had shut the door, he returned to the driver's seat and steered them toward the hospital.
Inside the car, Isaac reached for a bottle of mineral water he had kept ready. His long fingers twisted the cap with ease before handing it over.
"Thank you," Verena murmured, taking a sip to ease her throat.
Just minutes ago, he could only glimpse her through a screen. Now she sat beside him, close enough to ervous touch.


The world seemed to still. His pulse surged as he breathed in her faint fragrance, her presence filling every corner of his senses.


His eyes clung to her, brimming with devotion.


"I watched the live broadcast," he said softly.


After drinking, Verena handed back the bottle. Isaac capped it again and set it aside, their movements so natural they needed no words.


"How do you think I did?" she asked, her smile both playful and searching.


Isaac tilted his head slightly, his eyes a pool of tenderness.


"In my eyes, you're the best-beyond compare."


"Do you really admire me that much?" Verena teased with feigned surprise. "Then I must work even harder to live up to your trust."


The sunlight danced in her clear eyes, and her lips  glistened faintly as she spoke. Isaac swallowed hard, forcing his gaze to the window to resist the urge to kiss her-after all, they weren't alone in the car.
Half an hour later, they arrived at the hospital.
Verena guided Isaac into the elevator.
Luckily, the corridors were quiet today, and after registration, only twenty minutes passed before it was her turn to draw blood and check her HCG levels.
At the door of the examination room, Isaac took her hand and pressed a tender kiss upon it, whispering,"Don't worry. No matter the result, I'll stand by you."
The warmth in his eyes melted into hers, filling her heart wvith comfort.
Almost unconsciously, Verena touched her abdomen with her free hand, as though feeling for the life that might already be stirring there. She smiled gently. "I'm going in now."


As she disappeared into the room, Jacob approached Isaac. "Mr. Bennett, let me take you to the waiting lounge."


When the examination was done, Verena returned and sat beside Isaac. Immediately, he clasped her hand, their fingers intertwining.


"What did the doctor say?" he asked, his face tense with both hope and unease.


Verena gave a soft smile. "The results will take two hours..."


Only then did lsaac realize how worked up he had been, forgetting the wait required.


Sensing his anxiety, Verena looked at him with gentle eyes and asked softly, "Are you nervous?"
###Chapter 201 Good News


Isaac's eyes flickered for an instant, and he hesitated before a gentle smile curved his lips. Reaching out he tucked a stray lock of hair behind Verena's ear and murmured,"I'm not nervous."

Of course, that was a lie. Inside, his heart was a tangled knot of nerves.

Yet, seeing Verena already on edge, he feared that if he admitted his own unease, it would only weigh her down further.

But Verena knew him like the back of her hand. How could she not see through the thoughts he tried to hide?

She raised their clasped fingers, laying bare his disguise. "But your palms are damp, and you're holding me as though my hand were the only rope keeping you from drowning."

As Isaac instinctively tried to loosen his grip, Verena.held on even tighter, her touch steady and strong.

"Isaac, being nervous is only human. There's no shame in admitting it. And even,if we don't have a child this time, there will be many chances ahead. We have a lifetime together, don't we?"

The firmness of her grip and the calm in her words washed over him like balm, easing the storm inside.

She was right-time was on their side.

Still,when faced with the woman he loved most, Isaac was stripped of his composure and left simply an ordinary man.
白
At times, he foolishly clung to the idea that a child would be the bond tying them forever, proof she would never walk away.

Realizing how childish that thought was, he silently rebuked himself before answering, "You're right. Sooner or later, it will happen."

As they waited for the results, Isaac never left Verena's side. Jacob received several urgent calls, yet any project that demanded Isaac's presence wvas either turned down or postponed without hesitation.

Two hours later, the doctor finally called Verena's name and handed her the test report.

With a warm smile, he announced, "Congratulations! According to the results, Mrs. Bennett is indeed pregnant."

For a heartbeat, Isaac froze, stunned as though time itself had stopped.

Then, his eyes lit up, and a smile too bright to suppress broke across his face.

He clutched Verena's hand and looked at her, his voice trembling."Verena... we're going to have a baby. Is it real?"

His gaze overflowed with joy and disbelief.

Ever since the accident, he had not dared to dream of a child of his own.

And now, the words he had longed for struck his ears like music.

The news was as beautiful as a dream to him.

It was a blessing so dazzling he could hardly trust it, afraid that if he blinked, it would vanish like a dream at A dawn.

Verena handed him the report, her eyes alight with warmth and happiness."It's true, Isaac. We're going to be parents."

Though the doctor had witnessed countless couples rejoice over such news, he couldn't help but be moved by the depth of their emotions.

Smiling, he added a gentle reminder. "For now, everything looks normal. But in the days ahead, Mr. Bennett,please pay close attention to your wife's diet and rest. Regular check-ups will be essential for a smooth pregnancy."

Isaac,still reeling from the joy, absorbed the words slowly before nodding firmly. "I will always look after my wife's health. Thank you, doctor." After the consultation, Jacob drove the car up from the underground parking lot.

Verena guided Isaac out of the elevator, pushing his wheelchair gently.

The moment he saw Jacob, Isaac broke into a wide smile. "Jacob, I'm going to be a father."

His eyes shimmered with hope, filled with a light that spoke of boundless anticípation.

Catching on at once, Jacob offered heartfelt congratulations. "Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. You'll have the healthiest, brightest, and most adorable baby in the world."

Verena returned his words with genuine gratitude. "Thank you for your blessing."

Isaac, still concealing the full tide of excitement within him, gave an instruction brimming with generosity."Jacob, arrange for all employees' salaries to be increased by twenty percent this month, along with an additional bonus."

It was his way of sharing joy with the entire company.

Jacob's eyes brightened at the news of a bonus, and he bowed deeply. "Thankyou, Mr.Bennett.I'll spread the good news at once."
###Chapter 202 | Never Knew You Could Be So Clingy


After the check-up, Isaac and Verena returned to Seraphina Villas.

The moment they got out of the car, Verena carefully wheeled Isaac inside.

Seated in the chair, Isaac kept holding the medical report, reading it again and again as if it contained the secret of life.

On the way back, he had already told Verena he wouId not be going to work today.

Verena hesitated for a beat, and then stopped in front of him to confirm, saying, "Isaac, are you truly not going to the office? At the hospital, I noticed Jacob taking several calls that looked urgent."

Isaac clasped her hands, his deep eyes lit with a gentle smile. "Nothing is as important as you are to me.Besides, I want to spend more time with you."

He had long wished for an excuse to linger at home with her, and now, with the baby on the way, he had every reason to hold on tighter.	元

4A small smile tugged at Verena's lips as she tilted her head and teased softly,"Isaac, I never knew you could be so clingy."

Her tone was light as a feather, her eyes tender, as though she were gazing not at a man of stature but at a boy unwilling to let go of his toy.

Isaac,caught off guard,showed a fleeting trace of awkwardness.

Verena chuckled, and then quietly moved behind him to continue pushing him forward.

When they entered the living room, they saw a dignified middle-aged woman seated gracefully on the sofa.

Hearing the sound, Danica rose with a welcoming smile. "Isaac, Verena, you're back."

Isaac's smile vanished in an instant, and shadows of conflicting emotions stirred in his eyes. The memory of how Danica had once judged Verena unjustly, misled by Katelyn's poisoned words, burned within him. He replied in a tone that carried both distance and restraint, "Mother, do you have something to tell me?"

"I'm not here for you." Danica lowered her gaze, guilt flickering across her face.

She turned toward Verena, her voice low. "I'm here... to apologize to Verena."

Her eyes lifted again, filled with regret and sorrow. "Verena, I was wrong. I should never have wronged you.l let Katelyn's lies cloud my judgment, and I made a grave mistake."

Remorse weighed heavily on her words. "I even sided with outsiders and said cruel things to you, almost placing you in danger. Verena, can you forgive me? I truly know my fault. If you give me the chance, I will do my utmost to make amends."

Her eyes brimmed with tears as she spoke.

Danica was genuinely brokenhearted-not only for misjudging Verena but also because her choices had driven a wvedge between her and her son.

She had done it all in the name of Isaac's well-being, yet her efforts had cut both him and Verena deeply
A
Before Verena could respond, Isaac spoke first, his voice firm before Danica. "Verena, don't trouble yourself with my feelings. If you wish to forgive her, do so; if not, you needn't force yourself. I don't want you to compromise for my sake. She is my mother, my duty, and I'll carry that burden."

Danica's heart twisted with both sorrow and relief.

Sorrow,because her son-whong she had always sought to protect-spoke to her now with such coldness.

Relief, because she could finally see him breaking free of his silence, speaking his heart with clarity,something she had long wished for.

Isaac's words warmed Verena deeply.

In truth, she bore no grudge against Danica; yet neither did she feel any great attachment. She understood that Danica's actions had sprung from a desperate love for her son, even if twisted by another's manipulation.

And since Isaac always placed her above all, Verena wished, in return, to spare him from the bitter tug-of-war between wife and mother.

After collecting her thoughts, Verena pressed her lips together and spoke calmly."Danica, I've heard your words, and I hope you hold fast to them. Take this as a lesson, and please refrain from interfering in Isaac's and my personal matters again. This is not just my stance but his as well. I can forgive you this time-but if such a thing repeats, I will have no choice but to keep my distance."
###Chapter 203 Verena's Wellbeing Came First


Verena spoke her mind openly, and Danica, watching quietly, felt a quiet admiration stir within her. A subtle smile tugged at her lips.

She admired Verena's straightforwardness. After all that had unfolded, how could Verena possibly remain without a trace of anger in her heart?

If a mere apology had made Verena shower her with praise, that would only have unmasked her as insincere.

Yet Verena's frank warning-though not easy on the ears-was proof of her honesty and her good nature.

Recalling Verena's identity as Evelyn, Danica found her heart strangely at peace.

Verena had no need to curry favor with her. As a legendary healer, Verena could use her influence and connections to confront her if she wished. But Verena didn't do that.

That alone revealed two things-Verena respected Isaac, and more importantly, she truly loved him.
加
Danica felt blessed to have such a thoughtful and capable daughter-in-law.

The more she reflected, the more her satisfaction grew, yet so did the sting of regret for her past actions.

She reached out gently, clasped Verena's hand, and spoke from the heart. "Verena, you have every reason to be upset. I was in the wrong. But rest assured-I give you my word, I will never again intrude in matters between you and Isaac."

Her gaze was steady, her voice firm, her manner utterly sincere. Verena believed her and answered with a soft smile and a nod.

Seeing forgiveness in Verena's eyes, Danica felt a heavy stone lifted from her chest. Turning slightly, her gaze fell upon Isaac, who was holding a folded sheet of paper.

She had noticed it when they entered, but at the time, her mind had been wholly on apologizing.

Now that peace had been restored, curiosity prompted her to ask, "Isaac, what's that in your hand?"

Isaac knew well that Danica's mistakes were all tied to him. Watching Verena forgive her, he felt a mix of gratitude and faint sorrow.

At Danica's question, Isaac blinked, the corners of his lips curling into a smile.

He handed her the paper and said, "Take a look."

Danica accepted it, curiosity bright in her eyes. As she read, her eyes widened in shock. The document nearly slipped from her trembling fingers.

She looked at Isaac and Verena, her voice quivering. "Is... is this true?"

Isaac clasped Verena's hand, his voice calm yet full of depth. "It's absolutely true. We just came from the hospital-we're going to have a baby."

Verena touched her still-flat stomach tenderly, her smile gentle. "The doctor said everything looks perfectly normal."

Hearing their words, Danica's heart leapt with joy. Her dignified features blossomed into a radiant smile.60

Her eyes gleamed with delighnt and relief. "This is wonderful! Soon I'll be a grandmother-there will be a little grandchild in the house!"

Her excitement brimmed over; she clutched.Verena's hand tightly."Verena,thank you!"

She said it again and again, gratitude welling up for both the continuation of the Bennett family and for Verena's care in restoring Isaac's health.

Danica had once believed Isaac might never have children. But then Verena came, healed him,and changed the course of fate.

Though she had heard Isaac's sex function was cured, never had she imagined such a swift and.profound result-a long-awaited grandchild, at last.

Evelyn's reputation was indeed well-earned.

And now, that remarkable woman was her daughter-in-law.

Danica steadied her heart and silently made a decision.

Taking Verena's hands warmly in her own, she declared, "This is a blessing beyond words. I've decided to give you ten percent of my shares, a guarantee for both your and the baby's future."

But Verena, raised self-reliant and never accustomed to handouts, found such a gift difficult to accept.

She shook her head gently, smiling politely as she refused. "Danica, I appreciate your kindness, but I really can't accept this gift..."

Danica had expected her hesitation. Before Verena could finish, she pressed on, "I've thought this through for a long time. I'll divide twenty percent of my shares into two-half for you, half for Bobby's wife when he marries. It's simply a token of my love as an elder. Please,my dear, accept it?"

Verena bit her lip and lowered her head, caught between gratitude and reluctance.

Isaac leaned toward her, his voice soft but steady. "You've earned this. Accepot it."

Meeting Danica's earnest gaze, Verena finally nodded, her voice quiet yet clear. "Alright, I'll accept. Thank you,Danica."	50
A
Danica's face lit with joy. With her offer accepted, she immediately called Rhonda to discuss dietary care for the coming months. She also gathered the household staff, instructing them that Verena's well-being would now come first in all matters.

Not stopping there, Danica herself prepared a pot of nourishing soup before getting ready to leave.

Verena invited her to stay for dinner. And when she saw that her daughter-in-law harbored no trace of resentment, Danica's heart swelled with both shame and gratitude.

After dinner, the three lingered in conversation until at last Danica took her leave.

Since Verena was newly pregnant, Isaac worried about her tiring easily and guided her upstairs early to rest.

But just before bed, Verena's phone rang.
###Chapter 204 Thank You, My Love


"Evelyn, the hospital is fully prepared for its grand opening, and it has been officially named Evelyn Model Hospital. As per your instructions, the invitations for tomorrow's ceremony have all been sent," Julianna reported over the phone.

After a long season of waiting, the medical team had finally relocated, and now the long-anticipated day of opening was athand.

Verena replied gently, "Alright, I understand. Julianna, you and the team have worked tirelessly during this time."

Julianna, who had always regarded Verena as both idol and guiding star, quickly replied, "Evelyn, what are you saying? This is all part of our duty. Besides, we're deeply grateful for the generous salary you provide."

Verena chuckled softly. "Very well then. Once this busy spell is over, I'll treat everyone to a good meal."

Julianna's voice brimmed with delight. "Truly? Then, on behalf of everyone, thank you, Evelyn!"
6
The next day arrived.

The news of the hospital's relocation had already rippled far and wide, and the media were keenly awaiting the exact hour of the opening ceremony.

Naturally, the day's ceremony did not slip past their sharp eyes.

By early morning, the topic of Evelyn Model Hospital's grand opening had already climbed onto the trending headlines.

The ceremony was arranged at a restaurant not far from the hospital grounds.

As Verena stepped out of the car, her eyes caught sight of a red carpet unfurled, its crimson glow.sparkling beneath the sunlight, carrying with it the spirit of festivity.

On either side, roses swayed lightly in the morning breeze, their fragrance faint yet lingering. Mostly red and pink, the blossoms were fresh and lively, their beauty enhanced all the more by the striking carpet beneath.

A spark of surprise flickered in Verena's gaze. She had never arranged for flowers-least of all roses,her most beloved.

But in a moment, she understood.

Turning her head, she glanced at Isaac with a bright smile. "Darling, were these roses your doing?"

Hearing her voice, Isaac lifted his eyes, and for an instant his heart seemed to stumble.

Since she had to welcome the guests, Verena wore a sapphire-blue gown. Its delicate fabric shimmered faintlyunder the sun, outlining her graceful figure with quiet elegance.

Her partly curled hair was swept back in a neat style, the rest cascading over her shoulders. Around her slender neck rested a sapphire necklace, giving her the poise of a swan in still water.

As she leaned toward him, her radiant face shone with cheer, her words lilting and warm.

Isaac froze for a moment, dazed, while Jacob, standing at his side, stepped in,with a smile. "Mrs.Bennett.Upon hearing the hospital was ready, Mr. Bennett immediately ordered flowers-roses,specifically-knowing they are your favorite."

Verena hadn't expected such thoughtfulness, and joy welled up in her heart.

She smiled, asking playfully, "Really?"

A faint blush crept across Isaac's handsome features. Though he wore a calm front, he couldn't help but 自seek assurance."Do you like them?"

In that instant, he seemed less the composed man and more a shy youth. Verena's smile deepened."Of course I do. I love them, especially since they're from you, darling."

She stepped closer, bent down, and pressed a soft kiss upon his cheek before whispering in his ear, "Thank you,my love." Then, straightening quickly, she turned and moved forward, gracefully lifting the hem of her gown.

Her last words carried a playful, almost musical note.

Isaac's heart fluttered like a bird loosed from its cage, leaving behind a sweet feeling.

His gaze remained fixed on her retreating figure.
###Chapter 205 We Have Cut All Ties


As Verena stepped into the main hall, she greeted the guests warmnly and raised a glass in their honor,though it was only filled with fruit juice.

That detail was no accident-Isaac had arranged it thoughtfully in advance.

After a while, mindful of Verena's health, Isaac suggested she take a rest in the lounge, while he remained behind to host the guests.

She could feel the care behind his words and, without protest, accepted his suggestion.

Outside the lounge, elegant flower baskets from the guests lined both sides of the corridor, a silent parade of courtesy and good wishes.

Verena paused, letting her eyes linger on them, when her gaze caught a card tucked among a basket of lilies. The names Alec and Laura stood out boldly.

She had never invited them.	5

It was clear they must have seen the news reports and hurried here, eager to flaunt their blood ties with her.

Verena's brows drew together in a faint frown.

Just as she was about to instruct someone to remove the basket, Alec's voice drifted from behind her."Verena."

She turned, only to find Alec anc Laura approaching with wide, eager smiles.

Alec's familiar, flattering tone made her stomach twist with diståste.

She stood quietly, her expression cool, watching the hypocritical pair draw near.

Before she could speak, Alec hurried forward, his grin stretching wide. "Verena, you've really accomplished something remarkable. As your parents, we're truly proud of you. Having such an outstanding daughter is

our greatest pride. You've been clever and capable since childhood, and we always believed you were destined for greatness."

His words dripped with sycophancy, his smile so forced that the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes bunched like crumpled paper.

As he spoke, he kept stealing glances at Verena, trying to read her reaction.

Laura quickly nodded in agreement, adding, "Yes, Verena, you've always been our pride. Please, don't hold the past against us."

Once, she had disliked Verena openly. But the tide had turned.

Now Verena was not only Isaac's wife, but also revered far and wide as Evelyn, the healer spoken of almost with awe.

Laura dared not let such wealth and status slip away like sand through her fingers.

With that thought, her smile only grew brighter.

The couple continued their chatter, piling one insincere compliment on top of another, as though a stream of empty words could wash away the wounds they had left behind.60
A
They never noticedthe flicker of mockery in Verena's eyes.

To her, their act was nothing more than a hollow charade.

Lifting her chin, she fixed them with an icy stare. A faint scoff escaped her lips.11SO1,now you've come to compliment me? Do you think I would so easily forget the hurtful words and actions you once threw at me?"

Her voice was sharp as a frosted blade, every word cutting with cold finality. "When you thought I was worthless, you feared | would disgrace you. Now that I stand here, it is I who fears you'll disgrace me."

Her eyes narrowed on Alec as she continued, "Out of respect for my grandma, l've let you off, which is the only reason Willis Group still stands. But if I find you trading under my name, don't blame me for being merciless. If others bring me up in your presence, you had better be honest and tell them the truth-that we have cut all ties."
Her words struck Alec like cold iron, and his face turned ashen. Regret gnawed at him.

He had assumed that, with so many eyes watching, Verena would swallow her anger and give a courteous reply to spare him humiliation.

But he had never imagined she would turn so unflinchingly cold.
###Chapter 206 To Massage Your Feet


Verena made no effort to lower her tone; instead, she deliberately raised it a few notches, ensuring that every guest present caught her words.

Even those who hadn't been paying attention quickly had the message whispered into their ears, one after another.

The moment her words reached them, the guests halted their conversations, curiosity stirring like ripples on water.

Feeling all eyes upon her and Alec, Laura's face drained of color.

She opened her mnouth in panic, trying to defend herself."My sweet girl, it's notwhat you think. We only came here to celebrate..."

Verena's cold voice sliced through her plea. "Don't call me that. It's revolting."

Her gaze was frigid, void of warmth. "As you once looked down on me, so I now look at you. I once craved a mother's affection, but all  see before me is a failed mother-one who could not even protect her daughters."

Laura stood there in shock, speechless, while Verena pressed on, her words sharp as thorns. "I envied Kaia's place, and she feared I would take it from her. But the truth is plain: we've come to this point because of you both. You're the true culprits, unworthy of the title of parents. What's lost cannot be reclaimed. Don't deceive yourselves into thinking you can mend it. The hourglass has already run out. My only wish now is that you stay far from my life and let me live my own."

With that, Verena turned decisively and walked away.

Her feelings toward Kaia were knotted with both aversion and regret.

After all, no child was born evil. Yet a single good deed could not erase Kaia's past cruelty.

If Verena hadn't once saved her under the name Evelyn, Kaia would never have awakened to her mistakes.

Still, the heavier blame fell on Alec and Laura.

Growing up in such a household was Kaia's lifelong misfortune.

Verena's tone had been resolute, her words piercing like blades, leaving Alec and Laura no room to breathe.

Humiliated before so many guests, their pride crumbled into dust.

Shame weighed heavily, but alongside it came a tide of regret they could not put into words.

For a fleeting moment, both seemed utterly drained of strength.

Laura was tangled in a storm of emotions, replaying Verena's words, while Alec sank into remorse.

He finally opened his mouth, his voice hoarse. "Verena, Verena..."

Laura too tried desperately to salvage the situation, calling after her, "Verena, don't treat us this way."

But before they could catch up, several tall bodyguards strode in under the stunned eyes of the guests
With swift efficiency, they escorted Alec and Laura out, ignoring their protests and pleas.

Their figures were soon swallowed by the hall's entrance.

A heavy silence descended over the hall. Guests exchanged glances.

Then, whispers began to spread like sparks in dry grass.

"I'd heard rumors that the Willis couple never cared for their eldest daughter, but I didn't think it was true,"0woman in an elegant gown murmured.

"Not just neglect. Didn't you hear? Verena was so wounded she severed ties completely," a man in a gray suit whispered back.

"Judging,from her words, she has no intention. of reconciling with the Willis family. And rightly so-some parents deserve such a cutting response111another guest remarked, admiration flickering in his tone. Everyone present now understood exactly where Verena stood.

From that moment onward, few would accept an invitation from Willis Group without hesitation.

Verena slipped into the lounge, and Isaac soon followed.

She stood with her arms folded, gazing out the window, her eyes distant, so lost in thought she didn't even hear him enter.

Seeing her slender back, Isaac's heart ached.

"You were supposed to rest. Why are you still standing?" he asked softly.

Verena turned at his voice, a faint smile tugging at her lips, before walking over to sit on the sofa.

"Why are you here?" she asked.

Isaac wheeled himself closer, took her hand gently, and said with steady warmth, "Don't be sad. You did the right thing. Don't torment yourself with thoughts. You still have me, and I'll always remain by your side."

Pausing, his gaze softened as his other hand brushed over her abdomen."And now, there's the baby too.
The baby and I will protect you together."	分
4Verena's lashes quivered, her nose tingling with emotion.

How could she not be moved?

She too was human, with longings and wounds. Like any child, she had once dreamed of curling into her parents' embrace.

She even remembered the tenderness Alec and Laura once showed-before Kaia was born.

But wealth and power had a way of twisting hearts.

Verena shook her head gently. "I'm not sad for them. I only feel it wasn't worth it-for myself, and for my grandmother."

Her stubborn resilience carried a quiet dignity that stirred sympathy. Isaac lowered his gaze, his throat tightening.

Then,without a word, he leaned down.

When his cool fingers brushed her ankle, Verena instinctively flinched back.

She looked at him in surprise. "What are you doing?"

"Taking off your shoes, to massage your feet," he replied simply.

Verena lowered her eyes. Strictly speaking, pregnancy made heels unwise, but the gown demanded some height, so she had chosen block heels.

They weren't high, but standing so long had left her feet aching.

She hadn't noticed until now, but as soon as he mentioned it, the discomfort surfaced.

She hadn't expected him to notice so keenly.

Warmth welled in her chest.

Without another word, Isaac slipped off her shoes.

Her feet were delicate, her toes smooth and neat; they could have easily graced a model's catalogue.

Isaac rested her foot on his lap, his fingers pressing lightly, applying just the right pressure to ease her ankle.

His expression was intent, wholly focused on her comfort.

Watching him, Verena's lips curved into a soft smile.

She reached out, stroked his hair gently, and whispered, "My husband is truly good to me."

Isaac's hand paused briefly before he smiled.

Lifting his eyes, he looked at her, his gazeglimmering.

Though she had called him that before, the words still made his heart flutter. After some time in the lounge, Verena wanted to take a look at her new hospital. Isaac clasped her hand firmly. "I'll go with you."

The hospital was close-barely ten minutes' drive from the restaurant.

Inside,Verena carefully pushed Isaac along the corridor.

She checked each room in detail, ensuring everythning was in order, before heading straight to the operating theater.

The advanced equipment gleamed under the lights, the pristine atmosphere commanding respect.

Verena knelt before Isaac, her voice tender."Isaac, all the preparations are complete. I can schedule your surgery for tomorrow."

At her words, joy flickered in his eyes, yet his brow soon furrowed.

His gaze drifted to her still-flat stomach, and he sad gently,"There's no hurry. You're carrying our child now; don't exhaust yourself. The surgery can wait. Your health matters most."

Though Isaac yearned for the day he could walk again, compared to Verena's well-being, the dream suddenly seemed less urgent.
###Chapter 207 Surgery


Verena knew Isaac said that because he was worried about her health, yet she couldn't bear to let him wait any longer. Besides, in the early days of her pregnancy, nothing would be greatly affected.

With resolve glimmering in her eyes, she declared,'"No, your surgery must be done tomorrow."

Isaac parted his lips, wanting to argue, but before words could leave him, Verena softened her tone and continued, "Isaac, I know myself better than anyone. You don't have to worry about me. You've waited long enough-this is your moment. The surgery cannot be delayed a single day more."

Her voice was gentle, yet firm as iron wrapped in silk.

"I am a doctor. I know what is best for my patients, and what you need most right now is that surgery. You must regain your health."

She lifted her hand slowly, letting her palm rest on his cheek in a tender caress. "Trust me. My team and I are fully prepared. I promise I'll protect both myself and the baby before I even touch the scalpel.Alright?"

The warmth of her palm seemed to sweep away the storms in Isaac's heart.

After a long silence, he nodded faintly. "Alright, then the surgery will be tomorrow."

The next day, when news spread that lsaac would undergo surgery, not only Danica and Bobby,but his close friends also rushed to the hospital.

The corridor was thick with tension, yet beneath it ran a current of hope.

Cayden,Stevie, and Leonardo sat on the benches, eyes fixed upon the glowing sign above the operating room door.

Danica's face was drawn tight with worry, her hands clasped before her chest. Sometimes she closed her eyes to whisper silent prayers; sometimes she looked toward the door as though it might open any moment.

She trusted Verena's skills, yet anxiety still gnawed at her heart. She also knew Verena bore a double burden: operating while carrying new life.

Gratitude welled up in her chest like a tide she could not hold back.

Beside her, Bobby stood stiffly, his hands pressed against his hips, lips locked into a straight line. Sweat beaded on his forehead though the corridor was cool.

He raised his wrist again and again, checking his watch for what felt like the hundredth time.

"It's already been three hours," he muttered, anxiety creeping into his voice.

Every minute outside the operating room dragged like an hour.

Faces grew solemn, eyes flickering again and again toward the tightly sealed doors.

Inside the operating room, all of Verena's focus was on Isaac, lying under the bright lights.

Once, her hands had trembled at the mere touch of a scalpel after her grandmother's death,yet now they moved with the steadiness of stone, every cut and stitch precise.

She had no room for fear, no room for hesitation-only the unshakable thought that Isaac must make it through. The operating lamps shone harsh and white, the occasional clash of instruments echoing in the stillness.

Sweat beaded on Verena's forehead, and Julianna swiftly dabbed it away with a towel.

"Clamp," Verena ordered, her voice crisp and unwavering.

Julianna responded at once, placing the instrument in her hand.

The operation stretched past four hours.

When at last the lights dimmed and Verena stepped out, weary yet upright, everyone surged toward her.

Danica's voice trembled between hope and dread. "Verena, how is Isaac?"

All eyes fixed on her-Bobby's, Cayden's, Stevie's, Leonardo's. A faint smile curved Verena's lips. "The surgery was a success. Don't worry. With proper care, his recovery will be steady."

A collective sigh of relief broke through the corridor like a dam giving way.

Danica's eyes filled with tears as she clasped Verena's hands. "Thank you, Verena. Without you, Isaac might have been bound to a wheelchair forever."

Bobby's voice cracked as he brushed at the corners of his eyes. "Verena, it's a blessing you are here.When my brother wakes and learns he can soon stand tall again, he'll be overjoyed."

Cayden,himself a doctor, understood the weight of what Verena had carried, especially with her pregnancy.

His respect deepened as he spoke. "You need to rest. Hours on your feet-it must have taken so much out of you."

Stevie added quickly, "Yes, Verena, you can't overexert yourself. Think of the baby too."

Leonardo nodded solemnly. "That's right. Rest now-we'll let you know the moment Isaac wakes."

Verena hesitated, unwilling to leave Isaac's side, but Danica gently took her hand. Her voice was soft, yet full of motherly concern. "Go and rest for a while. You've carried out such a long surgery. I'll stay here and call you the moment he opens his eyes."

Looking into Danica's earnest gaze, Verena finally relented andnodded.

Surrounded by so many who cared, she could at last let herself pause.

Three hours later, Bobby pushed open the lounge door. "Verena, my brother's awake. He says he wants to see you."	b

Verena rose at once.

At the ward entrance, Julianna hurried forward with a report. "Evelyn, his heart rate,blood pressure, and all other vitals have returned to normal. He is conscious, no complications." Verena nodded with quiet relief. "Good. Thank you."
She entered the room.

Isaac lay in the bed, his eyes filled with tenderness as they followed her every step.

For the first time after the accident, he felt he might truly stand by her side like any other man-able to hold,protect, and embrace her.

"Is it really possible?" His voice quivered, half question, half prayer."Can I truly recover fully... walk again like before?"

Verena sat beside him, her smile calm and reassuring. "Your body indicators are all normal. Don't worry.Once the surgical wounds heal, we'll begin rehabilitation. For now, you must rest and let time do its work."

She leaned forward to check the monitors carefully, and then kissed his forehead with quiet affection."Believe me, you will recover well."

Isaac's eyes reddened as emotion surged through him.

His lips trembled, his voice hoarse yet filled with devotion. "Verena... thank you."

In that moment, he vowed silently to give his all in recovery, to waste none of her sacrifice.

Knowing he needed rest, Verena stayed a little longer before stepping outside. Julianna approached swiftly. "Evelyn, there's something I need to report."

"What is it?" Verena asked.

"Our medical team is large, but many remain abroad. With the hospital now open and your name carrying weight, patients flood in daily. Yet our staff is too few-both doctors and nurses are stretched thin. We cannot sustain this pace unless tive recruit quickly."

Verena gave a thoughtful nod. "You're right. We need.more hands urgently. Handle the arrangements,butl want to personally review the final interviews."

Julianna inclined her head. "Understood. I'll begin right away."
###Chapter 208 Interview


During this period, Verena remained in the hospital, caring for lsaac with steadfast devotion, hoping that once his wounds closed, she could guide him into rehabilitation training.

Inside the VIP ward, the sunlight slipped gently through the curtains, painting streaks of warmth across the cool-toned room.

On the hospital bed lay lsaac, sleeping soundly. His sharply defined brows softened in slumber, his long lashes casting delicate shadows beneath his eyes. Below his straight nose, his thin lips rested in a faint,restrained curve.

His hair, usually styled to precision, now fell in a natural disarray, lending him an air of ease and casual charm.

Verena lingered at his bedside, watching quietly. After a while, she rose to fech the thermos on the table,carefully pouring it into a basin until faint wisps of steam spiraled upward like whispers.

She tested the water with her hand; once satisfied with the warmth, she soaked a towel, wrung it out, and gently heldIsaac's hand in hers.

Though Verena's hands were long and slim, they seemed delicate beside Isaac's, almost childlike.

His palms were broad and firm, fingers strong and well-shaped, with joints that spoke of power. His hands could easily envelop hers whole, like the sea swallowing a stream.

Verena was never one to admire hands, yet she had to concede-such hands were worth lingering over.

Catching herself drifting, she gave a tiny shake of her head.

She pressed the warm towel gently against his hand, her touch tender and unhurried.

Sensing the soft care through his dreams, Isaac gradually stirred. His vision blurred at first, then cleared,and before him was the familiar figure. Her hair cascaded down her shoulders, with a few strands catching the sunlight like threads of gold.

Her eyes were fixed on him, full of quiet care.

The sight stirred his heart with a flood of mixed feelings.

In the past months, he had never imagined that a woman would marry him while disregarding his frail condition.

Then Verena appeared.

He had never thought his sexual potency could be restored.

Then Verena appeared.

He had once believed the wheelchair would be his lifelong shackle.

Then Verena appeared.

He had thought hope had deserted him for good.

But she walked in, and light followed. Isaac watched her, captivated, until she lifted her gaze and saw that he was awake. She smiled softly."You're awake?"

She set the towel aside and carefully helped. him sit upright against the headboard.

Isaac's eyes brimmed with longing, but soon his brows knitted and a muffled groan escaped.

After surgery, mishaps could spring up without warning.

Verena's heart tightened; she asked quickly, "What's wrong? Do you feel pain?"

Seeing her anxious face, Isaac gave a faint smile: His tone carried mock grievance. "It hurts..."

Startled, Verena immediately leaned in to check, lifting the blanket.

But before she could, Isaac caught her wrist. She froze, confused-until she noticed the playful curve at his lips.

In that instant, she understood. He was teasing her.

Her worry flared into irritation. "Is i amusing to trick me?" she scolded.

"Yes," he replied with disarming calm. His voice was warm, and with a gentle pull, he drew her into his arms.

Before she could argue further, he kissed her deeply.

To him, nothing compared to this-her eyes full of him, her heart beating for him.

It made him feel whole.

Greed even whispered to him: may he bury her first love in the shadows of the past, never to return,leaving only him in her heart.

The kiss trembled with tenderness, sending shivers through them both.

Verena wrapped her arms around his neck, responding with a smile as shedeepened the embrace.

Their breaths quickened, echoing clearly in the silence of the room.	介

Then, as if struck by déjà vu,a scene flashed in Isaac's mind-familiar, too familiar.

A hospital, a woman, a kiss...

The woman looked exactly like Verena, feeding him fruit as he lay in bed, and he-holding her hand and eagerly kissing her.

What was happening?

A strange unease coursed through him.

Verena noticed his pause and pulled back gently:"Isaac, what's wrong?" she asked softly.

Isaac frowned, deep in thought. "I feel that..."

But the words faltered. The more he tried to recall, the hazier it became.

Flickers of images came and went-sometimes sharp, sometimes veiled-like looking through fogged glass.

His head began to throb, needles of pain pricking sharper the harder he tried to recall.

Many people would feel that a situation had happened before.

For Isaac, this feeling of déjà vu had visited more than once.

He forced himself to calm down. Perhaps he was simply overthinking.

Not wanting Verena to worry, he held her hand, shook his head gently, and said, "Maybe I didn't rest well.I'm fine, don't worry."

Though she knew he was hiding something, Verena also knew his body better than anyone after daily checks-nothing had shown amiss.
 
She nodded softly. "Alright, then rest a little longer. I'll be here."

··· After Isaac drifted back to sleep, Verena slipped out of the room.

"Evelyn!"

She turned to see Julianna hurrying over.

"Julianna, what is it?" Verena asked.

Julianna reported with respect, "Evelyn, the doctor interviews have been completed. We've shortlisted several excellent candidates, and we await your final decision."

The hospital's growth depended on a strong team, and so every step of the selection had to be weighed carefully.

Verena nodded. "I see. Prepare the documents and notify them to come tomorrow morning."

"Yes, I'll take care of it immediately," Julianna replied. The next morning, after sharing breakfast with Isaac, Verena made her way to the interview office.

Two hours passed. Each candidate displayed skill, experience, and composure-meeting the hospital's standards in every way.

At last, the final candidate stepped inside.

Verena instantly sensed something different about him.

He was the youngest of them all.

His posture was upright, his features softened by a gentle face, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his high nose bridge. His amber eyes glimmered with quiet brightness.

He carried himself with steady composure and kindness, leaving a favorable impression at once.

Verena smiled and gestured. "Please, have a seat."

The man's lips curved faintly. "Thank you."

As he sat, Verena glanced at his résumé and mentioned his name."Simon Moss."sound of it, Simon raised his brows ever so slightly, a subtle smile playing at his lips. "That's me," he said warmly, nodding.

The polite greeting gave way to the formal interview.

Verena fixed her gaze on him. "From what I know, you are gifted and capable. More importantly, the hospital you served before ranks among the finest in Clokron, almost on par with Evelyn Model Hospital. Tell me-why choose to come here?"
###Chapter 209 Because Of You


"Moreover." Verena lowered her head again, her gaze fastening on the résumé before her. She went on,"According to your file, your family should be living in Clokron. Tell me-why choose to part ways with your family and step away from such a promising position, only to apply for work here?"

Her eyes never left the papers in her hand, blind to the steady gaze Simon had fixed on her.

Across the desk, Simon's eyes clung to her every movement.

Her head was slightly bowed, sunlight spilling through the window and wrapping her in a warm halo.

The angle revealed her slender neck, smooth and delicate, almost inviting a touch. The soft light painted her earlobes with a gentle pink glow.

A strange warmth stirred in Simon's chest, the seed of obsession quietly blooming. For a heartbeat, he longed to pull her into his very being, as though nothing else would ever be enough.

Yet when Verena lifted her head, the fleeting madness vanished from his expression.

Simon straightened with practiced ease, pushing his glasses up with a calm, natural gesture.

His voice carried a quiet modesty as he replied, "First, thank you for your praise. As for why I chose this hospital-the reason is straightforward. Its reputation is second to none. Around the wold, it stands as a place most medical graduates could only dream of joining. I, too, have long hoped for such a chance. But..."He paused, looking directly at Verena. "There's another reason that matters even more."
5Verena tilted her head ever so slightly, waiting for him to continue.

"Because of you."

Her puzzled gaze met his. Simon's lips curved faintly, though his eyes remained steady and solemn."You are held in the highest regard throughout the medical field. I have admired your accomplishments for years.Your skills are unquestionable, and I hope to learn under you-to refine myself, and ultimately serve more patients."

Verena lowered her gaze slowly, his words stirring her thoughts.

The calm confidence in his tone revealed a man who could weather storms without faltering.

And indeed, his reasons were not unfounded; many doctors had joined because of her reputation.

Her fingers tapped lightly against the table, producing a faint rhythm as her mind wandered.

Simon's eyes drifted to her hand, noting the elegance of her slender fingers.

The white blouse she wore, with its flowing sleeves, revealed the smooth line of her wrist when she moved.

The loose cuffs fell back just enough for his eyes to travel further, catching a fleeting glimpse of her skin-soft, smooth, almost dangerously tempting.

His gaze lingered, heavy with unspoken desire.

In that instant, time seemed to pause; the quiet room held only her gentle presence and his growing obsession. A sudden wave of possessiveness surged through him, tightening his jaw and stiffening the muscles beneath his sleeves as he fought the urge to reach for her.

After a weighted silence, Verena broke it with a composed voice. "Mr. Moss, your extensive experience and the many medical awards you've earned speak for themselves."

She rose to her feet, extending her hand with a smile. "Mr. Moss, you fully meet our hospital's recruitment criteria. Welcome aboard. I looktforward to seeing what you can contribute."

Simon's eyes fell on her delicate hand, a flicker of madness flashing like lightning across his calm expression.

Yet it had gone unnoticed by Verena.

He stood slowly and reached for her hand, touching it lightly-an elegant brush more than a shake. Outwardly, he was the very picture of a gentleman, poised and dignified.

Yet beneath that facade raged a storm of restless desire.

He lifted the corners of his mouth, offering a warm, assuring smile. "Rest easy. I will prove myself with action, and I will not fail your expectations."

Verena nodded, her eyes soft with approval. "I look forward to your performance."

She withdrew first, letting his hand fall away.

But beneath the table, Simon's fingers brushed against his palm, almost caressing the warmth she had left behind.

That brief contact burned into him, refusing to fade.

He clenched his hand tightly, as though to trap the sensation before it slipped away. His longing deepened,sharp as iron.

He had to have her.

Whatever it cost, he would have her.	 After the interview, Verena rêturned to Isaac's VIP ward.

She entered just as Julianna finished examining him.

Verena asked softly, "How's his recovery today?".

Handing her the record booklet, Julianna smiled. "Thanks to your care-and your husband's good health to begin with-his recovery looks very promising."

Her phone buzzed several times from her coat pocket.

Turning off the alarm, she said, "Evelyn, I have an operation scheduled. I'll need to go now."

Verena pressed her lips together and nodded. "Alright, go ahead."

Julianna left quietly, her steps light and swift. Verena lowered her gaze, scanning the records carefully. Soon, her expression brightened with relief.

Turning toward Isaac, lying in bed, she said with joy, "Isaac, your wounds are healing beautifully."

She set the booklet aside, moving closer. "If all goes well, you'll be ready for rehabilitation training in a week.Are you excited?"

Isaac still found their recent days difficult to believe.

The happiness before him felt like a fragile dream.

His brows drew together, uncertainty flickering in his voice though hope glimmered underneath. "Verena,can I really make it?"

Could he truly walk again, live again as any other man?

Verena tilted her head, her lips lifting into a quiet smile as she guided his hand to her abdomen.

"Of course. I believe in you. And so does our baby. We both trust you."

Isaac froze, stunned by the unwavering faith in her eyes. In that moment, the shadows of doubt scattered,replaced by a resolve he hadn't known he still carried.

A week flew by like a passing cloud.

Verena had crutches ready, her voice soft with encouragement."Isaac, today we begin your training. Don't be nervous. I believe you can do it."

Though a trace of unease lingered in his eyes, Isaac nodded firmly.

Seeing his determination, Verena supported him carefully as he stood.

Slowly,Isaac lowered his feet to the floor.

But just as hope began to stir, his legs gave way.

He collapsed to his knees with a harsh thud, the sound echoing through the quiet room like glass shattering

Verena caught him in alarm, her brows knitting tightly. "What's happening? Why would this happen now?" She had watched his recovery day after day; this should have been the best stage for progress. How could she have been wrong?

Isaac kept his head lowered, staring at his powerless legs. A crushing wave of defeat and frustration washed over him, draining his spirit.

But when he looked up and met Verena's anxious eyes, he forced a gentle smile. "I was prepared for this from the start. Don't worry. I won't give up."

Though calm on the surface, his voice trembled faintly, betraying the storm within.

Verena pressed her lips into a line, her brows furrowed. "Isaac, don't push yourself. Give me a moment."

She helped him back into bed, and then hurried out to call Julianna for a full examination.

Because of her pregnancy, she could not enter the radiation zone and had to wait outside.

She leaned against the wall, her hand instinctively resting on her abdomen. Her brows pinched as she fell deep into thought.

What could have gone wrong? She had almost personally overseen his health checks every day for weeks, and no issue had ever shown itself.

If not a physical setback,then... could it be something rooted in the mind?
###Chapter 210 A Psychological Hurdle


As Verena mulled over Isaac's condition, a set of quick footsteps rang out in the hall.

"Verena!"

"Verena."

She turned to find Danica and Bobby hurrying toward her.

Since Isaac's condition might be caused by his mental state, it made sense for his family to be involved.Right after Isaac was taken to the exam room, Verena had made sure to call them both.

Danica remained dressed in her business suit, a clear sign she had hurried straight over from the office.

Her voice was shaky with worry. "Verena, what's happened to Isaac?"

Bobby chimed in, just as tense, "Yeah, didn't the surgery go well? Why isn't my brother able to stand?"

Verena recognized their worries, but as a doctor, she knew panic had no place right now. What mattered most was uncovering the cause.

She met Danica's gaze, her voice steady. "Danica, the operation went smoothly. Isaac's wounds are healing perfectly, and he should be starting rehab today. But something's keeping him from getting up, and it isn't physical."

Verena paused for a moment, and then continued, "If all the tests come back clear, we're likely looking at a psychological hurdle, Danica, I heed you to walk me through everything that happened the day of Isaac's accident. It could be the missing piece we need for him to move forward."

Danica gave several quick nods before saying,"Okay, I'Il tell you."

Her eyes grew distant as the memories flooded back, tears gathering as she recounted the events.

"When I got there, Isaac and his father were in the back seat. A truck had slammed into their car on the overpass, killing the driver on impact. My husband had thrown himself over lsaac to shield him,creating just enough space to protect him. His body was crushed, both legs skewered by metal rods from the truck, one even went through Isaac's thigh. My husband's blood was all over him... and he died before he could say a single word. Isaac was the only one who made it out alive."

Wiping her eyes, Danica's voice cracked. "He hasn't been able to walk since then. He shut everyone out,barely talked to us. Things only started to change after you came into his life."

Bobby tried to comfort her, tears rolling down his face. "Mom, Isaac's going to pull through."

Hearing the story, Verena felt her own eyes sting as a deep ache settled in her chest.

Listening to Danica's story, Verena understood that Isaac's struggles all traced back to the accident, a trauma that had left him unable to move forward.

Maybe that was why he couldn't remember her, either.

If Isaac was ever going to stand again, he'd have to confront the pain he carried inside.

Danica worried that, even after such a successful operation, Isaac might stumble at this crucial point.

Her voice shook with desperation as she turned to Verena. "What should we do now? How can we help Isaac?"	A

Noticing how on edge Danica was, Verena kept her voice gentle. "You don't have to be afraid. Isaac's made a full physical recovery. What's left is for him to face what's happening in his mind. I'll be there every step of the way. Let me handle it."

A bit of hope flickered in Danica's eyes. Tears of relief welled up as she repeated her gratitude. "Thank you,Verena.I really believe you'll hel him through this."

Just then, the exam room door swung open and Julianna rolled Isaac out.

Julianna gave Danica a borief nod, and then told Verena directly, "Evelyn, everything came back normal.
Should I gather the team so we can plan our next steps?"

Verena took the results in stride; they were exactly what she'd expected. It was clear now that the problem was psychological.

Lowering her gaze, she replied, "That won't be necessary, Julianna. I know what to do. You go ahead and get back to your work."

Julianna gave a quick nod. "Of course. If you need help, just let me know."

Danica and Bobby hurried over to lsaac.

"Isaac, how are you feeling?" Danica's voice was gentle as she squeezed his arm. "You look thinner than before.I'Il cook your favorite meals and bring them to the hospital."

Isaac looked as if he wanted to say something, but Bobby spoke up first, bowing his head apologetically."Isaac, I promise to listen to you from now on. I'll focus on school and start learning about the company during my breaks. I won't make you worry about me again."

Danica's usual stern look faded, replaced by soft affection in her eyes.

Even Bobby's attitude had changed; his words were-quiet, careful not to upset Isaac.

They didn't normally act like that. Isaac's brows knitted together without him realizing, puzzled by their sudden shift in behavior.

Were they treating him with such caution because they didn't believe he'd recover?

Watching his mother and brother walk on eggshells around him, Isaac felt a heavy wave of helplessness and grief.

He let his gaze fall and gave a quiet sigh. "You don't have to act so carefully. When I first woke up after the accident,I accepted everything that had happened. Life in a wheelcair isn't the end. I've been down this road before; it's just something familiar now."

A small smile touched his lips. "Honestly, I'm fine. I've got Verena and our baby by my side. I haven't lost hope, and I plan to make the most of every day. So don't feel sorry for me. Just keep living your lives like you always have." But his words, meant to reassure, only deepened Danica's and Bobby's sadness.

Neither of them was a doctor, and neither truly understood the battles Isaac was fighting inside.

Being his family, they couldn't help but fear that lsaac might end up confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

When there was no hope, it had been easier to accept. But now, with the possibility of a miracle so close,the reality was even harder to swallow.

Verena watched Isaac trying to smile for his family's sake, and her heart ached for him.

She moved closer, resting a comforting hand on his shoulder.

"Isaac, it isn't what you think," she said gently. "Your exams show you're completely healthy. After the operation, your legs healed perfectly; they're no different from anyone else's now."

No different from anyone else's?

Her words caught Isaac off guard.

Then why couldn't he stand? Catching Isaac's puzzled look, Verena spoke gently."Dyou recall what happened during the car accident?"



Isaac's expression shifted, memories flickering behind his eyes. She continued, "The reason you can't walk isn't physical. You're struggling with something deep inside. That kind of obstacle can be overcome, and you're not alone. Our hospital has a specialist who works with both physical and emotional healing. I'arrange everything for you, and I'll stay by your side through it all. There's nothing to be afraid of; I'lI be with you every step."

Her reassurance settled over him like gentle spring rain, washing some of the pain away.

A flush of emotion brightened Isaac's eyes. At that moment, it didn't matter to him if her heart belonged to someone else. All he needed was her care and presence.

He reached out, brushing her cheek softly. "Alright,I'll trust you and do whatever you say."
###Chapter 211 My Specialty


Verena wasted no time. She instructed Danica and Bobby to escort lsaac back to his hospital room, while she herself headed straight to her office to arrange Isaac's medical records. Once the files were in order,she turned on her heel and walked directly toward the psychology department.

At the entrance, she lifted her hand. Her slender fingers curled lightly, and her knuckles tapped against the door.

Knock,knock, knock.

The sound drew the attention of several psychologists inside, heads turning one after another.

When they saw Verena, one of the doctors quickly stood, asking with caution, "Evelyn, are you here for an inspection?"

Evelyn Model Hospital carried a reputation outwardly forits gentle and compassionate care.

But behind closed doors, the truth was sterner.

To remind every doctor of the weight of their duty and to prevent even a hint of negligence, random inspections were held across all departments.

Such measures were meant to separate the-wheat from the chaff, exposing those who treated responsibility lightly.

And that was why her sudden appearance had set their nerves on edge.

Reading the unease on their faces, Verena smiled, her tone calm."NO,I'm here to see Dr. Moss."

At once, the tension drained from their shoulders. A square-faced doctor stepped forward, answering,"Dr.Moss went to collect some documents. I'll call him for you."

Verena nodded, her smile poised between authority and approachability. "Thank you. Please ask him to come to my office." Not long after she returned to her office, there came a knock at the door.

Verena set aside the documents and looked up. Standing at the threshold was Simon.

She smiled faintly, tilting her chin. "Come in."

Simon entered and sat opposite her desk.

"Evelyn, did you call me for something?"

He fixed his gaze on her, quietly thrilled she had sought him out.

Verena nodded, her tone steady. "Yes. I need to discuss something important-about my husband."

The smile on Simon's face froze. Her words pierced him like a sudden blade.

The hope that had just flared in him was smothered as if by a cold downpour, leaving behind bitterness and anger.

When his colleague mentioned Verena had summoned him, he had imagined she wanted something personal, perhaps even to ask about his familiar face. But no-she spoke of another man.

Jealousy ate away at him, though he forced himself to keep a mask of composure.

He curved his lips into a gentle smile, feigning curiosity."Oh? And what seems to be troubling your husband?"

Verena slid Isaac's medical records toward him. As he reached to take them, his fingers brushed against hers. A tremor ran through him, stirring restless desire.

He steadied himself quickly, lowering his eyes to the documents.

While he studied them, Verena spoke. "I remember your resume. Your main discipline was psychology, with clinical practice added later. And the hospital you worked at in Clokron is famous for its psychological department. That's why I'd like you to treat my husband." As Simon leafed through Isaac's records, a faint, icy gleam crossed his eyes. So, even after all this, Isaac still clung to life-tenacious to the point of defiance.

Yet his thoughts soon twisted. What appeared as Isaac's strength was, in Simon's mind, merely borrowed time.

The last survival had been nothing more than a stroke of luck, a coin tossed in his favor. But fortune, like a fickle companion, rarely walks the same road twice. This time, Isaac might find Lady Luck turning her back.

Still, outwardly, Simon's expression softened into a warm smile. "Of course. That's my duty."

Verena leaned forward, explaining carefully,"Isaac was in a car accident months ago. The driver and his father died instantly. His father shielded him with his own life, giving Isaac a chance to survive. But his legs were gravely injured. Recently, I operated on him myself. His body shows he can begin rehabilitation, but he's still unable to stand. His father died saving him. I believe the loss of his father has left him trapped in a shadow of grief."

She paused, her lips curving with a sorrowful smile. "The accident not only disabled him-it erased his memories of us. He's forgotten the love we once shared. Now, he believes our marriage is nothing more than a family arrangement. He's burdened with loss, and he's forgotten me. I hope you can help him heal and restore what he's lost."

As Verena spoke of Isaac, her mind slipped into their past, and joy lit her face. A blissful smile, like sunlight breaking through clouds, touched her lips.

But to Simon, that smile was unbearable.

He longed to grip her shoulders, to shout that he was the one who truly loved her.

And Isaac? What was Isaac?

A man fated for a wheelchair-how could he compare?

In Simon's eyes, only he was worthy to stand at Verena's side.

Yet she chose Isaac. What made Isaac better than him?

The thought made his eyes narrow, a storm brewing beneath the calm.

If memories had been erased, then why let them return at all?

Suppressing his dark thoughts, Simon adjusted his glasses, his voice smooth. "His symptoms match post-traumatic stress disorder. After severe trauma, the brain often hides away, shielding itself. Forgetting becomes a kind of armor, a defense against further harm."

He looked at Verena and added slowly, "This is a psychological issue-my specialty."

Simon's career was filled with cases that proved his skill. Verena had no reason to doubt him.

"I knew I chose the right person." Gratitude filled her eyes, her smile soft. "Dr. Moss, I'm entrusting my husband to you."

Simon's lips curved. "I will cure him."

His voice was gentle, his smile sincere. Yet in his eyes flickered a madness that went unnoticed. Verena arranged Isaac's psychological treatment for the next day.

She knew such sessions required privacy-just patient and doctor.

But still, unease stirred in her. She wanted to see Isaac's reactions with her own eyes.

She feared that Simon, however skilled, might ask a question that would reopen wounds instead of healing them.

So she discussed it with Isaac first. With his consent, she decided to install surveillance in the therapy room to observe quietly.

Naturally, she also informed Simon.

Before Isaac entered the room, noticing his unease, Verena bent down, holding his hand. Her voice was warm and low."Think of it as an ordinary chat. Don't be nervous. I'll be right outside."

Isaac's hand brushed her cheek, his voice calm and deep. "As long as I know you're outside, I won't be nervous."

He gazed at her tenderly, and she returned his look with a sweet smile, eyes glowing with affection.

Together,they painted the picture of an enviable couple.

But for Simon, the sight was torment. Jealousy gripped him tight, his fists curling at his sides as he tore his gaze away.
 ###Chapter 212 That Man Is Hostile Toward Me


While Verena waited quietly on a bench outside, Isaac and Simon entered the therapy room.

Once the door closed, the two men sat across from one another.

Simon's eyes drifted briefly to Isaac's legs, a faint trace of mockery flashing beneath his calm expression.

Eventually, he fixed his eyes on lsaac and spoke in a soothing tone. "There's no need to be uneasy, Mr.
Bennett. Life has handed you a challenge, but with my guidance, you'll be back on your feet soon."

Inwardly, Simon sneered at the idea of Isaac being back on his feet.

His real intentions were hardly so benevolent.

A subtle squint tightened Isaac's gaze, sharpening it with a hawk-like intensity.

In that split second, he sharply registered the very first glance cast toward his legs.

As someone used to navigating the business world's dangers, Isaac had learned long ago to trust his instincts; he'd encountered plenty of people who didn't wish him well.

He knew he hadn't imagined that glance.

A genuine professional would never be so blatant,

Psychologists typically made an effort to avoid focusing on a patient's disability, knowing how sensitive those wounds could be.

For someone already in a fragile state, that kind of behavior would feel like pouring salt on an open wound.

Isaac quickly sensed that the therapist seated across from him was behaving strangely.

With a courteous nod, Isaac kept his suspicions hidden. "Thank you for your help, Dr. Moss."

Simon's smile faltered just a touch. "If you're ready, let's get started." He leaned forward, folding his hands atop the table and locking eyes with lsaac. "Tell me, how did your injury happen?"

Isaac's voice stayed steady. "It was a car crash."

Simon let out a light laugh. "Would you mind sharing more? Who else was in the car? What injuries did everyone sustain? And how were you feeling in the moment?"

He maintained a polished, gentlemanly air, but the chill in his eyes never faded, a coolness that hinted at something hidden beneath the surface.

No one understood it more clearly than lsaac did.

Simon's line of questioning was nothing more than an attempt to poke at his wounds and watch him flinch.

That alone was enough to put lsaac on high alert.

He knew when to trust his gut.

Any psychologist worth their salt wouldn't push a patient toward discomfort o shame in their very first meeting.

If someone did, it was a sign they shouldn't be trusted with anyone's care.

Even though it was his first experience with psychological treatment, Isaac had a fair grasp of how it worked.

No reputable doctor would begin a session by asking questions that are provocative.

Even someone just starting out would know better, let alone a professional at Evelyn Model Hospital.

He looked up with a steady gaze and answered, "I saw it all happen. The driver died instantly. My father passed away right next to me."

His words were delivered with such composure that they offered nothing for Simon to latch onto.

Still, Simon tried to dig deeper. "Your father's death was right before your eyes. What exactly was happening then? What was going through your mind?" As Simon recalled the car accident and what lsaac had been through, something almost gleeful flickered beneath his calm surface.

Isaac's stare never wavered, cold and inscrutable, filling the room with a silent threat.

That unsettling gaze snapped Simon out of his self-indulgence. He took a quick glance at the nearby monitor, suddenly aware his tactics were crossing the line.

With a practiced smile, he shifted the conversation. "Or maybe... let's talk about your relationship with your father.What was it like?"

Isaac's usually unreadable expression softened for a moment."We were close."

Simon didn't let up. "So, since the accident, you're refusing to acknowledge reality? You won't accept either your father's death or your own condition?"

Isaac's eyes dropped, his lips pressed together in silence.

Simon pulled an old-fashioned pocket watch from the drawer, the kind often used in traditional hypnosis."If you won't talk, Mr. Bennett, then let your dreams speak for you. Facing your pain is the only way to break through those mental barriers and speed up your recovery." He held the pocket watch in front of Isaac, his voice slipping into a slow, soothing rhythm. "Keep your eyes on the watch. Just relax, and let your attention follow its movement. Imagine yourself sinking into a comfortable chair at the end of a long day. As the watch swings, your breathing slows, your muscles unwind,and your mind quiets down... You can trust me. Your father wouldn't want you to stay trapped like this..."

He repeated these calming phrases, but Isaac's gaze never wavered. His eyes remained sharp and clear,showing no sign of slipping into hypnosis.

Noticing Isaac's resistance, Simon's expression hardened for å moment. It was obvious Isaac wasn't about to let his guard down.

If Isaac refused to cooperate, Simon could use that as an opportunity to linger around Verena.

After setting aside the pocket watch, Simon straightened up and addressed Isaac. "Excuse me. I'll step out for a moment."

The sound of the door opening made Verena glance up, expecting the session to be finished, but only Simon emerged.

She quickly asked, "Dr. Moss, how is my husband doing?"

With a regretful sigh, Simon answered, "Evelyn, your husband hasn't opened up to me. That makes the treatment especially difficult. Right now, it's essential that I earn his trust. If I could spend more time with your family, I might gain a better understanding of his situation and his real feelings."

Verena,knowing how guarded Isaac could be, asked for more."Dr. Moss, what would you recommend?"

"I have an unconventional suggestion," Simon replied, deliberately letting a few seconds pass before continuing.

Verena urged him on, "Please, go ahead."

He adopted an apologetic tone. "If you're willing, I'd like to stay at your home for a while. This intensive approach means I'll be close to the patient around the clock. Living together would help me observe his mental state in real time, giving me a chance to understand him and offer more comprehensive care."

Such arrangements weren't ancommon for certain therapies.

From a clinical standpoint, living with the patient allowed for constant observation and timely interventions.

Emotionally, it could build trust and improve communication, which often sped up recovery and led to better results.

Verena considered the idea, but with clear caution. "I'll need to check with Isaac first."

Isaac's comfort and willingness mattered most.

Forcing this arrangement on him would only create more problems.

Simon nodded with a faint, courteous smile."Of course."

That ended the session for the day. Back in the hospital room, Verena relayed Simon's proposal to Isaac.

Isaac didn't say yes or no. Instead, he looked right at Verena and said quietly, "That man is hostile toward me."

It took Verena a few seconds to piece together who he was referring to, and a frown crossed her face.

"Are you saying Dr. Moss has something against you?" she asked, a note of uncertainty in her voice. "Did something happen between you two before?"

Isaac gave a firm shake of his head. "No."

Trying to reassure him, Verena smiled and gently cupped his face in her hands. "Maybe you're reading into things too much. Dr. Moss went through every step of our vetting process, my assistant double-checked all his qualifications, and everything checked out. He's highly respected in his field. Maybe it's just your nerves making you extra cautious?"

Still, Isaac couldn't shake his gut feeling. "I've never crossed paths with him before. But I'm telling you,there's something about him. Maybe it has to do with you. Verena, sometimes a man can sense another man's true intentions."

From the first moment he had met Simon, Isaac sensed an undercurrent of animosity.

He became even more certain when he caught that quick, assessing look Simon gave his legs during their session.

Verena sat up straighter, sifting through her memories as she tried to recall any meeting with Simon.

After a few moments, she shook her head. "I can't think of any past interactions with him. We only met at his interview. I kept my identity private until I treated Maxton, and I hardly ever appear in public. Even if he admired my work, that wouldn't explain any hostility toward you, would it?"

Isaac lifted his gaze to her, a faint crease in his brow. "Verena, do you doubt my judgment?"

Verena dropped her eyes and grew quiet.

Even if it seemed far-fetched for Simon to have a grudge, she couldn't ignore how uncomfortable Isaac felt. It wasn't normal for a patient to put up walls with a psychologist right from the start.

Maybe his suspicion was justified.

She pulled herself together, noticing the troubled look on Isaac's face.

With a gentle touch, she rested her hand on his shoulder and leaned in to whisper,"Don't look so worried.You're my husband, and I trust your judgment most. I'll quietly dig into his background and find you another doctor if you want. How does that sound?"

Her quiet promise soothed him, and Isaac's expression softened, his lips curving into a genuine smile.
###Chapter 213 Digging Into Someone


A ripple of secret satisfaction stirred in Isaac's chest.

Sure enough-wearing the mask of misery before Verena only pulled her closer, as though pity itself were a rope he could tug at will.

Maybe Simon wasn't entirely useless after all.

The man had even claimed he wanted to move into lsaac's house to build trust and make communication easier.

Isaac scoffed. A man knows another man.

To him, the truth was as plain as day-Simon's intention wasn't about the therapy; he was after Verena.

While Isaac's thoughts churned like restless waves, a shadow flickered by the window's edge.

From the frame alone, he knew exactly who it was. And in that instant, certainty slammed into him.

His gaze turned razor-sharp; with a sudden narrowing of his eyes, he seized Verena and pulled her straight into his lap.

She gasped, startled-only then realizing she had already been swept into his arms.

She blinked, confusion clouding her. "What do you want?"

Isaac tilted her chin with two fingers, forcing her gaze to lock with his.

Heat blazed in his eyes, his voice low and magnetic."Kiss me."

The command carried steel, but beneath it lingered the spoiled edge of pleading.

Verena's self-control teetered. She tapped his shoulder. "We're in a hospital." "No one's watching." Isaac's glance slid deliberately toward the window, his lips curving into a sly smile."And you're my wife. So what's one kiss? Come on, what's the harm? Are you kissing me or not?"

His last words rolled out low and velvety, brushing against her ear like a whisper that both teased and tempted, leaving her nerves tingling.

Verena's eyes swept over him, her pulse stumbling faster.

Barely a fist of space lay between their chests, each breath snaring the other's until it seemed they breathed as one.

Isaac's brows cut sharp lines, his eyes dark yet gleaming with a dangerous light. And those lips were full,curved, and waiting with unspoken temptation.

His jawline was cleanly carved, rugged yet devastatingly handsome. His hair fell just tousled enough to add a reckless edge.

From head to toe, he was impossible to resist.

Once again, Verena couldn't deny it-her taste in men was flawless. In the end, her fragile self-control snapped.

"Fine,just once."

Verena shut her eyes and brushed her lips against his, already starting to pull away.

But Isaac's hand clamped firmly at the back of her head, dragging her closer as his mouth crashed down,deepening the kiss without mercy.

A low, stifled groan escaped from Verena's lips.

Isaac's scent, his heat-every inch of him consumed her.

Eyes half-open, Isaac flicked a cold glance toward the window.

The shadow flinched, and then vanished in a hurry. Isaac's lips curled with a mocking smile.

Only Verena had ever managed to make him feel small. But in front of others, he was confident of himself.

···

Water thundered from the hospital sink, splattering against porcelain in an endless rush.

Simon bent low, scooping a handful to his face.

The icy spray stung his skin, but it could not quench the inferno clawing inside his chest.

Jealousy raged, wild and merciless, a fire that refused to burn out.

His hands clamped onto the sink, muscles taut, eyes drilling into the reflection staring back at him.

Why Isaac? Why in God's name him?

Even crippled, the man still commanded Verena's devotion. Isaac was already showered with blessings,and he still held the one thing Simon craved beyond reason.

Longing soured into bitterness, and bitterness fermented into hate. He could not comprehend it A

Back then, Verena had saved them both. So why did she choose lsaac?

Because the Bennett family name weighed heavier on the scales?

Fate had turned cruel, merciless-a cosmic joke. Simon wanted nothing more than Verena, yet still had to wrestle for her like a beggar at the gate.

The mirror mocked him as his own lips twisted into a crooked grin.

His jaw locked tight, eyes narrowing with ruthless resolve.

His course was set. By hook or by crook, he would claim Verena. And Isaac... Simon's eyes glowed dark, venom dripping in the silence.

If Isaac had cheated death once, then death could still claim him again.

Last time, his father had pulled him back from the abyss.

This time, no such miracle would intervene.

Life rarely dealt the same hand twice.

If Isaac's pride lay in his family name, Simon would shred that pride to pieces.

He could not topple Isaac on his own, but somewhere,someone could.

Simon's grip tightened until his knuckles blanched, veins standing out like cords of iron.

···

Isaac trusted his instincts-and his instincts whispered that Simon stank of hidden motives.

Before leaving for work, Verena quietly promised she would dig into Simon's past.
Isaac hungered for answers even more than she did. So he told her to leave it in his hands.

Verena offered no protest; she only nodded.

Once she left, Isaac lifted his phone and called Jacob.

"Jacob. Dig into someone for me. His name is Simon Moss. He's a shrink, new at Verena's hospital."

"Yes,Mr.Bennett. I'll begin immediately." Jacob's voice cut through, sharp and precise.

Isaac ended the call, his fingers tapping thoughtfully against the phone's edge.

He recalled Simon's stare-unsettling in its stillness, watchful as a hawk, calculating to the last detail.

Simon was no harmless shrink. And since Jacob's digging might not strike deep enough, Isaac didn't hesitate-he dialed another number."Stevie."

"Isaac? Calling me out of nowhere? How are you feeling? Are you alright? Want me to come over?"

The questions poured out in a torrent, but lsaac sliced through them with a sharp interruption. "No need. I'm fine.K<eep your focus on work."

With clear reluctance, Stevie sank back into his chair, the motion heavy with unease.

"Then tell me-how's recovery? Didn't Verena say rehab was beginning soon?"

Isaac's gaze drifted toward the window, his voice flat. "I tried. Failed."

"What happened?" Stevie blurted. "The surgery-did something go wrong?"

"The surgery was fine. The problem's in my mind."

"Psychological?" Stevie asked.

"Exactly." Isaac's voice dropped cold. "I need a favor."

Stevie froze, bewildered. "Isaac, I'm a hacker, not a shr nk. You've got the wrong guy. Wrong number maybe?"

A rare, dangerous smile tugged at Isaac's lips. "I don't need therapy. I need you to dig into someone."
###Chapter 214 Something Interesting


Stevie frowned in confusion. "Dig into someone? What happened?"

Isaac's face was grim, his gaze sharp as steel. "His name's Simon Moss. Born in Clokron, though his roots trace back to Akoitha. He recently joined Verena's hospital as a psychologist. After my first attempt at rehabilitation failed, Verena thought my condition might be psychological, so she arranged for him to treat me. But the moment our sessions began, I felt something off. His hostility toward me isn't even subtle."

His voice sank lower, carrying the weight of suspicion. "I'm convinced he's got hidden intentions where Verena is concerned. I want you to dig up everything on him."

If anyone could do it, it was Stevie-his hacking skills were unmatched, and Isaac knew he'd leave no stone unturned.

Hearing the mention of someone openly hostile to Isaac, Stevie bristled, his protective instincts flaring."Don't worry, Isaac. If he tries anything, I'll make sure he regrets it. But..." He hesitated, and then voiced his concern. "Are you certain he's after Verena? Could this just be your feelings talking?"

It wasn't doubt about Verena's appeal. Stevie simply knew how consumed lsaac was by her. His possessiveness was legendary, and Stevie feared that intensity might be coloring his judgment.

Isaac caught the undertone in Stevie's words, but he dismissed it without hesitation. His gut had never steered him wrong, and the malice he'd felt in Simon's stare was far too real to ignore.

"I'm not that oblivious, Stevie," he said, his voice low but firm.

The weight in his tone made Stevie straighten instantly."Alright, I get it," he replied quickly. "Maybe I was reading too much into things. Don't worry, Isaac. I'll dig into Simon Moss until there's nothing left hidden."

A faint smile tugged at Isaac's lips. "Thanks."

Stevie let out a light laugh on the other end. "Come on, Isaac, we're best friends. No need for thanks. Just focus on getting better at the hospital and leave the rest to me."
After the call ended, Isaac finally allowed himself a brief rest.

When he woke again, his phone buzzed with a call from Jacob, who reported in a steady tone. "Mr.Bennett,we've finished the initial background check. Simon Moss graduated from Wrafpost University, one of the most prestigious schools in Clokron. Afterward, he was recruited by a leading hospital there. Former colleagues describe him as cheerful, proactive, and empathetic. He's even known for taking in stray cats and dogs. Professionally, his reputation is strong as well-he's received several highly regarded medical awards. I've already sent the detailed report and photos to your email. Please review them when you have the chance."

Cheerful.Proactive. Empathetic.

Isaac's eyes narrowed, something about that portrait grating against his instincts. The words painted a flawless image, yet it all felt... off, like a mask too perfect to be real.

Pressing his fingers to his brow, he spoke quietly. "Understood. You can.return to your work."

"Yes, Mr. Bennett," Jacob answered respectfully before the linè went dead.

Isaac's brow furrowed. Jacob's report was just surface fluff that told him nothing of real value. If there were answers, they would have to come from Stevie.

Three days slipped by quickly.

In that time, lsaac submitted himself to Verena's routine examinations. Every day, she worked her hands carefully over his legs, massaging them with patient diligence.

Then, one morning, his phone buzzed. Stevie's name lit the screen.

Isaac answered immediately, "What did you find?"

On the other end, Stevie was quiet for a beat before replying, "Isaac, I dug through everything I could. His records are spotless. His background lines up perfectly. Nothing suspicious turned up, even after. I ran the checks multiple times. I thought I might've missed something, but no-there's nothing."

Isaac parted his lips, ready to speak, but Stevie's tone shifted suddenly, lightened with amusement. "But...I did stumble across something interesting."

Isaac arched a brow. "And what's that?"

Stevie's chuckle carried through the line. "Didn't you say you thought he was eyeing your wife? Turns out,according to what I found, Simon isn't into women at all. He's interested in men. Could it be you're reading too much into things because you're a little too protective of Verena?"

Interested in men?

Isaac's expression darkened, a flicker of conflicting emotions flashing across his face.

Isaac couldn't shake the unease. Simon's record might have been clean on paper, but his instincts told a different story. That flicker of hostility in the man's eyes had been real, and Isaac was certain Simon was interested in Verena.

Whether or not the rumor about him preferring men was true didn't matter. The truth would come out with the right test.

On the line, Stevie sounded almost incredulous at Isaac's silence. "You really don't believe me? Isaac,my intel's solid-it's never wrong."	 Isaac steadied his thoughts before answering, his voice low but resolute, "We're not dismissing him that easily. Keep a close watch. Even if he's truly interested in men, there's no guarantee that's the full story.Anyone who could pose a threat to Verena stays under scrutiny."

There was a pause, and then Stevie agreed without hesitation. "Got it. I'll keep digging. If anything shifts,you'll be the first to know."

···

In her office, Verena sifted through Isaac's recent test results, carefully analyzing the subtle changes in his psychological state. His progress was undeniable-steady, visible improvement across the board.

Pleased,she immediately dialed Ivan's number. The call connected almost instantly, and his exuberant voice spilled through the line. "Verena! You won't believe this-we must be on the same wavelength, because l was just about to call you."

Even without seeing him, she could picture the sparkle in his eyes and the mischievous curve of his lips.

Her own mouth lifted into a faint smile. "Enough joking, Ivan. I have something serious to discuss."

Ivan's laugh carried easily through the line. "Alright then, what's so urgent?"

Verena straightened in her chair, her tone all business. "I need you to track down the top psychologist overseas-Luther Owen. If I recall correctly, you've crossed paths with him before?"

"Luther?" Ivan's chuckle deepened. "I've known him for years. Consider it done. But actually, there's something I need to ask you too."

With one concern already lifted off her shoulders, Verena exhaled softly. "Go ahead."

Ivan's instincts as a hacker had always kept him cautious. Sensitive matters were never for phone calls. His tone dropped, firm and deliberate. "Not over the line. Let's sit down face-to-face."

Verena knew him well enough not to argue. His habits were ingrained, and she respected them."Fine111she replied smoothly. "This afternoon." Later that day, she arrived at the quiet coffee shop they'd chosen. The staff guided her to a private booth tucked away in the corner.

Ivan was already there.

He sat sprawled comfortably in a loose black utility jacket, his curls falling naturally around his face. A glint of blue caught the light-the earring on his left ear. Dark sunglasses rested low on his nose, just enough to reveal the sharp gleam of hazel eyes underneath.

Even in such a casual getup, he carried the same effortless presence as always-laid-back, yet impossible not to notice.
###Chapter 215 Was It You


Verena slipped into the booth and sat opposite Ivan, who hadn't taken his eyes off her since the moment she walked in.

"Why are you staring at me like that?" she asked.

Elbows resting lazily on the table, Ivan flashed a sly grin. "It's been a while. You've grown even more radiant."

That day, Verena wore a snow-white silk blouse, a black ribbon tied at the collar into a bow that looked casual yet refined-an elegant balance between grace and authority.

Matched with deep blue skinny jeans that hugged her slender legs, her attire, paired with her striking features, made it nearly impossible to look away.

Ivan's words weren't just hollow flattery;they carried weight.

But Verena shot him a sharp glare. "You never change, do you? Still can't keep yourself in line."
Her voice carried the tone of an elder sister chastising a younger brother-stern on the surface, yet threaded with warmth.

Feigning remorse, he clasped his hands together, bowing his head. "My fault, Verena. I was out of line."

Her lips curved despite herself, but she quickly straightened. "Enough games. Tell me-what's this about?Did you run into trouble again?"

If it hadn't been serious, Ivan wouldn't have insisted on a face-to-face talk.

He shook his head slowly. "No. It's not about me.It's about you."

Verena's brows drew together. "Abot me?"

"Yes." Ivan's nod was grave. "A few days ago, I hacked into a site." Her eyes narrowed. "What kind of site?"

"An assassin's website," he replied evenly. "I was poking around out of boredom and stumbled onto something-a contract from months ago. It was tied to your grandmother."

Shawna-Verena's one tender spot, the very wound that never healed.

She shot to her feet. "What happened to my grandmother?"

Seeing her agitation, Ivan reached out quickly, pressing her back into the seat."Don't get worked up. Let me explain first. Hear me out."

He unlocked his phone, pulled up a screenshot, and slid it across the table.

Verena's eyes locked on the image. Her body trembled as though struck by a thunderbolt.

It was an anonymous contract, the bounty modest but clear in its one demand: the woman in the attached photo must die. The image was Shawna-snapped secretly, without her knowledge.

Ivan frowned. "Strange, isn't it? Your grandmother was just an ordinary woman. Yet the person who offered the bounty wanted her death masked as an accident. Who would go to such lengths?" Staring at the photo, Verena's hands shook uncontrollably.

Rage surged like a storm tide; her eyes burned red, and the world blurred.

"So... Grandma was murdered," she whispered through clenched teeth.

Her heart ached imagining Shawna-gentle, kind, unaware-forced into fear she never deserved.

And guilt cut deep; Verena loathed herself for failing to shield her.

Watching her shoulders quake, Ivan laid his hands gently on them, his voice low. "The bounty was marked as claimed. The job was carried out. Don't torture yourself too much, Verena."

Months ago, Verena had rushed back to Akoitha.

Ivan had heard from Julianna then-it was for a funeral. Verena's fists tightened, nails digging into her palms. Her mind reeledd, racing through possible culprits.

Shawna, who harmed no one, quarreled only over trivial village matters-none of which could ever justify this. Rural folk wouldn't even know such a website existed.

Could it be...

Verena's eyes narrowed to slits. One name surfaced. Laura. The only person in this world who'd rather Shawna hadn't lived.

Without another word, she bolted from the booth, ignoring Ivan's startled calls behind her.


···

Verena sped to Willis Villa, every mile burning with fury.

The moment she stepped out, the household staff, who once treated her with cold indifference,now hurried over, all smiles and bows.

One of them said, "Mrs. Bennett, welcome! Here to see Mr. and Mrs. Willis? Someone has already gone to announce your arrival. Please, this way..."

"Move!" The word shot from her clenched jaw, her eyes cold as a winter'sblade.

The servant froze, shivered, and scrambled aside.

Verena stormed forward. Laura and Alec descended the staircase, their faces bright with delight as though dawn had broken inside their home.

The servant's report had seemed impossible, for Verena had publicly driven them out of her hospital's opening ceremony.

Yet here she was.

Their smiles widened.

"Verena,,my dear, you missed your mother after all, didn't you? I knew it. No rift lasts forever between mother and daughter." Laura's face glowed as she reached for Verena's hand. But the very next heartbeat shattered her illusion.

Verena seized her wrist and clamped down on her throat with the other hand.

Alec's eyes widened in horror. "Verena, stop! That's your mother!"

But Verena's fury drowned out his plea. Her eyes blazed with fire as she demanded, "Was it you? Did you send someone to kill my grandmother? Answer me! Was it you?"

Laura froze, stunned as though lightning had struck.

She had expected reconciliation, not accusation.

Her voice shook as she struggled against Verena's grip. "I... I don't know what you're talking about...It wasn't me, I swear...I wouldn't dare..."

Her eyes were wide, full of fear and confusion, as though Verena had cast her into a nightmare without warning.

The air itself grew suffocating, heavy with tension.

Verena stared at Laura's trembling form, and then shut her eyes briefly. Her anger eased, just slightly.

At last, she loosened her hold and drew in a sharp breath, forcing herself to calm.

Released, Laura staggered back, clutching her throat as a fit of coughing wracked her.

Color rushed into her cheeks, her heart pounding-in fright.

She had seen something terrifying in Verena's face-like an animal cornered, baring its fangs,ready to tear into flesh.

Slowly, Verena's eyes opened again, her gaze fixed on Laura..

No... it wasn't Laura.

She knew it deep down.

Laura might have disliked Shawna, but Shawna's quiet country life posed no threat. There was no gain in plotting her death.

Verena took a step back, confusion replacing fury.

If not Laura,then who?

Who would stoop to targeting a defenseless old woman?

Or-was this somehow about her identity as Evelyn?

Yet she had always been cautious. Abroad, her identity and family ties remained hidden from prying eyes.

Her temples throbbed; her head felt heavy with questions. She turned sharply and walked away.
###Chapter 216 We Must Find Who Killed Shawna


Isaac's long road of recovery after surgery had finally reached its end. Verena, ever thoughtful, had arranged everything beforehand, making sure he could be discharged in time to rest at home before takíng steady steps toward his rehabilitation exercises.

After leaving Willis Villa, Verena went directly back to Seraphina Villas.

On the second floor, she pushed open the door with quiet care and lifted her gaze-only to find Isaac sitting on the sofa, a newspaper spread in his hands.

The gentle rustle of turning pages echoed in the silence, though his eyes were distant, as if he were waiting for something rather than truly reading.

The lamplight spilled softly over him, outlining his fine profile with a calm glow.

Verena lingered at the doorway, and warmth welled up in her heart.

She knew-he was waiting for her return. And yet, in the next breath, sorrow struck her chest like a sudden tide.

Looking at his straight but slender back, Verena understood why the barrier in his heart was so hard to break.

The thought that Shawna had died because of her pressed down like a weight, leaving her almost breathless.

If only she hadn't been so intent on proving herseIf, on making Laura and Alec regret abandoning her; if only she hadn't drawn so much attention abroad-perhaps Shawna would have been spared.

Though Verena knew what was done could never be undone, her heart still drifted toward the "if onlys" of a life that could never be lived.

After learning that Shawna's passing was no accident, Verena felt the echo of Isaac's pain.	 She knew he carried blame in hisown heart-believing his father's death was his fault, punishing himself with each breath.

She could relate. She, too, blamed herself for failing to protect Shawna.

A tear slipped down as Verena crossed the room, kneeling gently before Isaac and resting her head upon his lap.

Her tenderness made Isaac lower the newspaper, his body instinctively ready to respond to her closeness.

Just as his hand settled on her shoulder and words formed on his lips, her choked whisper reached him."Isaac, I'm so sad."

His hand froze; his chest tightened.

Never before had Verena shown such raw vulnerability before him.

Her tears soaked into his trousers, leaving a damp trace that seared his heart.

Isaac could not bear it. Taking her hand, he drew her up and gathered her into his arms.
She sat on his lap now, her brows knitted, her hair slightly in disarray, a fragile picture etched by sorrow. Seeing her tear-streaked face, Isaac's eyes softened with a mixture of tenderness and ache.

He brushed away the tears with infinite care, as though he were holding something too precious to risk breaking.

"Verena, what happened?" His voice was low, almost trembling.

She bit her lip hard, unable to form a reply.

The sight tore at him even more. Still wiping her tears with his thumb, he guessed, "Is this about my legs?"

Her silence felt like confirmation, and he tried to soothe her. "You've given everything, more than anyone could. If my legs never fully heal, I can accept that. What matters most is having you by my side. But... if you feel weighed down, I won't hold you back." His voice was rough, carrying a sorrow he couldn't hide. Meeting her eyes, he added softly, "Please, don't cry anymore."

Realizing he had misunderstood, Verena shook her head quickly."NO1it's about my grandmother..."

"Your grandmother?" His expression faltered. "But she's already-"

She had spoken of her grandmother before; he knew she was gone.

"Yes, Grandma has left us." Verena's eyes reddened further as she gritted her teeth. "But I just learned her death wasn't an accident-it was murder."

Isaac's gaze flickered in shock."What?"

"A friend stumbled across an old bounty posted on a dark trading site... and the target was my grandmother." She paused, her voice tremmbling. "It's all my fault. If I hadn't drawn enemies abroad, if I hadn't left her vulnerable, she would never have been hurt. She must have felt so alone, so helpless. She must blame me for not protecting her."

Tears streamed as she leaned into Isaac's shoulder, soaking his shirt.

Her sobs pierced him like a knife.

He used to think Verena didn't need him as much as he needed her. Yet, when she finally needed him, he realized his own helplessness, his inaboility to lift her grief. He despised himself for that.

Listening to her cry, he wrestled with disbelief-how could someone stoop so low as to target the elderly?

But with Verena in his arms, all he could do was comfort.

He held her tighter, his warm hand moving gently across her back, a steady rhythm of reassurance.

"Shawna loved you dearly. She could never lay blame at your feet. The guilt is not yours to bear-it belongs only to the killers. Even if they struck at her because of you, the crime is theirs, not yours, Victims.should not shoulder the sins of their tormentors. I know your heart is breaking, but we cannot drown forever in sorrow. The way forward is clear-we must find who killed Shawna, and only then can justice be done." Verena slowly lifted her head, her reddened eyes now shining with fierce determination.

She bit her lip, raised her chin, and declared, "You're right, Isaac. I won't let my grandma's death be meaningless.I swear I'll uncover the truth and see that the guilty pay dearly."

Her trembling lips and tear-streaked face told him how much effort it took to speak so firmly.

He kissed her cheek softly, murmuring, "Forgive me. I shouldn't have asked for calm when your heart is torn. Cry if you must-let it all out. We'Il fight for Shawna's justice together. Remember, you are never alone.You have me."

His words broke down the last wall of her defenses.

She clung to him tightly, sobbing with a force that shook her whole body.

It was as though every pent-up grief finally poured out.

Isaac held her in silence, his hand patting her back with the patience of someone soothing a child.

Time slipped away unnoticed until her sobs subsided.

Looking down, he saw her asleep against his chest, traces of tears still glistening on her lashes.

Her nose was stuffy from crying, her lips parted slightly, making her look almost like a wronged child.

As the evening chill settledin, Isaac quietly picked up his phone and asked Rhonda to bring a blanket.

Rhonda soon entered, carrying one. She paused-at the sight-Verena fast asleep in Isaac's embrace, while he held her with such quiet devotion.

No wonder he had asked for silence; he was lulling his wife to rest.

Warmth spread in Rhonda's heart, and she thought to herself-lsaac truly treated his wife with great tenderness.
 ###Chapter 217 | Could Hold You Forever


As night descended and the city lights flickered on, Verena finally stirred from her slumber.

Almost by instinct, she tried to stretch, only to find her arm blocked by something firm-an anchor in the vast tapestry of shadows.

Blinking awake, she discovered she had been sitting on Isaac's lap, nestled within his embrace.

The moment her eyes opened, Isaac folded the newspaper he had already read several times.

"What time is it now?" Verena's voice was slightly hoarse, a labyrinth of lingering tears and sleep.

Isaac glanced at his phone."Three minutes past eight."

Adjusting herself to sit straighter, Verena recalled returning home around six. It struck her that she had drifted into sleep for nearly two hours, time slipping away like sand between fingers.

Thinking on it, she lowered her gaze to the snug blanket around her, and then looked back at lsaac."HOW could you hold me for so long? Aren't your arms tired?"

He paused mid-movement, his tone soft but resolute. "You were asleep."

Understanding his reluctance to wake her, Verena felt her heart soften, as though tenderness could transcend sorrow. The ache of Shawna's murder was soothed a lot by his gentleness. "Why didn't you.wake me to sleep in the bed?" she asked.

"You looked so peaceful. I hadn't the heart to disturb you," Isaac replied, his eyes deep pools of unspoken affection.His voice, low and tender, orchestrated the moment. "Besides, I like holding you like this."

"Really?" Verena teased, a light spark weaving into their intricate exchange. "Then why don't you hold me al night?"

He answered without hesitation,"I'd love nothing more.I could hold you forever." A bright smile spread slowly across her face at his words.

"You're a master of sweet talk," she said playfully, her tone dancing like notes in a kaleidoscopic symphony.

Leaning forward, she brushed her lips gently against his. "Here's a reward."

Isaac's eyes lit instantly, the curve of his lips betraying an inner joy that words could hardly capture.

In his eyes, that kiss was indeed a reward-captivating, enigmatic, and overwhelming. His heart brimmed with excitement, unable to contain the tide.

Looking at her with eyes that sparkled like stars, he murmured,′′One isn't enough."

With that, he pulled her closer by the waist, kissing her deeply until her lips were left swollen, only then realizing his embrace had been perhaps too fervent.


···

Verena's playful suggestion that Isaac hold her all night was never meant seriously.

Soon, she slid off his lap and sat beside him on the sofa.
60
After that brief interlude of affection, reality beckoned, and they returned to the crucible of pressing matters.

During her sleep, Isaac had held back his questions, but now he could not.

"Verena," he called gently.

She turned her head with curiosity. "What's up?"

His face turned serious. "Think carefully. Before Shawna's tragedy, did anyone abroad know your true background? List them all so we can narrow down the suspects."

Verena picked up the glass of water, sippoed, and then held it between her palms.

She squinted, delving into memory before confirming, "Before my grandma's incident, only four people knew:Gavin, Julianna, Miranda, and Ivan. None of them would betray me. No one else was told." Isaac's eyes deepened. "They're allpeople you trust?"

"Of course." Verena nodded firmly. "Gavin and Julianna are my trusted assistants, even confidants. They'd never harm my grandmother-there's no motive. Miranda and I are close, but we walk entirely different paths; she wouldn't benefit from harming my family."

And then there was Ivan...

Isaac hadn't expected that the man Verena could never quite forget also knew her identity. His thoughts flickered to the tattoo etched on her chest, and his fingers clenched unconsciously as he asked, "What about lvan?"

"Even less likely." Setting down her glass, Verena spoke with unshaken certainty."IVan would sacrifice his life for me. Of the four people, he's the one I trust most."

Isaac studied her silently. The mention of Ivan carried a trust she never extended to any other man.It was etched into her, like initials carved into stone.

That realization weighed heavily on him, a paradox he could not untangle-a mixture of devotion and jealousy. Yet, he buried it deep. Now was not the hour for envy.

He couldn't add to Verena's burdens at this moment.

He tightened his fists, striving to orchestrate his turmoil into silence. "If only these four knew and you trust them, then perhaps one of them revealed it unknowingly. You should ask if they slipped during conversation."

Verena lowered her gaze, contemplating the suggestion before nodding. "You're right. I'll arrange to meet them now."

"Shall I come along?" Isaac offered.

She shook her head. "No. I'll be back soon."

With that, she stepped away, phone in hand, dialing quickly. "Julianna, are you free now?"

"Yes,Evelyn," Julianna responded warmly. "What's going on?"

Opening her car door with one hand, Verena replied, "I need to ask you something in person."

Julianna knew if Verena wanted to talk face-to-face, it had to be about something important. "Alright, I'm heading out now."

Verena smiled faintly. "Good, I'Il send you the address."

After sending it, she called Gavin.

"Evelyn, this late? Don't tell me you want me to take you out for drinks again?" Gavin teased, alluding to the night when she was in a boad mood and ended up having him buy drinks for her.

Fastening her seatbelt, Verena chuckled. "Not this time. It's important."

His tone shifted instantly. "Then send me the address. I'll be there."

"Okay," Verena said, relieved. Within half an hour, the three sat together in a quiet bar.

After Gavin and Julianna sipped their light drinks, Verena spoke directly. "I called you both because I need to ask something."

Both leaned in with curiosity as she continued, "While abroad, did either of you ever reveal my true identity?"

They exchanged a look, and then after pondering, shook their heads. "Absolutely not."

Julianna spoke first. "Evelyn, I understand the weight of your secret. Since learning it, I've guarded it fiercely, always mindful, never careless."

Gavin nodded. "At the hospital, you were always Evelyn. Nobody knew more, not your country, not your roots-nothing of the truth." Their earnestness left Verena momentarily adrift.

She had shared her background only after trust had been woven into their shared tapestry, believing their discretion a shield.

With surveillance, elite guards, and Ivan contolling the hospital's network, exposure had seemed impossible.

And yet, here they were, in a labyrinth of betrayal with no clear culprit.

The more she pondered, the more the path twisted.

Seeing her troubled brow, Gavin leaned closer. "Evelyn, is something troubling you?"

Julianna studied her intently. "Are you in danger? Let us help."

Closing her eyes, Verena rubbed her temples. "Nothing much, just investigating."

"What kind of investigation?" Julianna pressed.

Verena sighed. "About my grandmother's death." Gavin pieced it together. "Your enemies murdered her, didn't they?" Julianna gasped,eyes wide."Truly?"!

"Yes," Verena admitted quietly.

"How can we help?" Gavin asked immediately.

Julianna clasped Verena's hands. "Let us help you find the culprit."

Verena squeezed her back, offering a faint smile. "Thank you,but not now."

They understood-her refusal was not out of politeness. Timing mattered.

Gavin nodded. "When you need us, say the word."

Verena's smile brightened. "I won't hold back." She remembered her promise to lsaac before leaving and didn't linger. Finishing her glass of water,she rose.


With Gavin and Julianna offering no leads, only Miranda and Ivan remained.

However, Verena immediately ruled out Miranda.

Miranda was carefree to a fault; even if she had slipped, she'd never recall.

Questioning her would be pointless.

Thus,the next morning, Verena arranged to see lvan.

Crossing his arms, he greeted her with mock severity. "Verena, you owe me an apology. Yesterday you left halfway through our talk and ignored my calls. You've got some nerve!"

Despite his scolding posture, the youthful defiance in his expression created a paradox of humor and reprimand, leaving the moment strangely amusing.
###Chapter 218 Carl Aguilar


A light laugh slipped from Verena as she slid a piece of toast onto lvan's plate."Consider this my peace offering. Breakfast on me should count for something, right?"

Ivan took a bite, chewing leisurely before speaking."Verena, you can fool others, but not me. I know when something's weighing on you."

"You've still got that sharp eye," Verena teased, though her smile dimmed as she lifted her glass of milk.After a sip, her tone grew steady. "There's something I need to ask. While we were abroad, did you ever let my true background slip to anyone? Think carefully. There's no rush."

The question didn't surprise him; he knew exactly what she was circling around. "So you're ready to dig into the truth about your grandmother's death."

She didn't bother to confirm, but the silence was enough. Ivan straightened, setting his toast down."Alright.I'll give it some serious thought." As minutes stretched on, Verena finished her milk while he sat in heavy contemplation. Finally, Ivan exhaled and said, "I've always been careful. I promise I never revealed who you realy are to anyone."

A crease formed between his brows, and he leaned back, clearly unsettled. "But if your grandmother was truly murdered by your enemies, then why target her? What would your enemies gain by killing her instead of coming after you directly?"

Verena's eyes dropped to the table, her thoughts circling the same troubling question.

Ivan broke the silence, his tone measured. "If I'm being honest, aside from hurting you, there doesn't seem to be much point. Grief fades eventually, and you'd recover. It wouldn't weaken you long term or give them any real advantage. Unless..." He paused, rubbing his chin as the idea took shape. "Unless their goal wasn't to kill you at all, but to use your grandmother's death to block you from doing something."

A crease formed between Verena's brows, her expression sharpening. "But what would they want to stop me from doing?" she asked quietly, confusionflickering in her voice."Back then, I didn't have many patients whose lives depended solely on me. So it couldn't have been about stopping me from treating someone."

Ivan exhaled, frowning deeply. "That does sound far-fetched. Still, if not that, then what else could justify such a move?"

Verena pressed her lips together, staring blankly at the table as her mind churned through scattered possibilities.

The silence thickened until Ivan suddenly lifted his head, his eyes flashing. "Wait-something just came back to me, Verena."

Her gaze snapped toward him, alert."What is it?"

"| remember a phone call we had before you came back to Akoitha,"he said slowly."You mentioned you might accept Isaac's pursuit and be with him...Hold on!"

Ivan's voice shot up, sharp with urgency. "Think about it-wasn't Isaac in that car accident right around the time you came back? What if the whole thing was orchestrated to stop you from being with lsaac? They drew your attention away with your grandmother while going after lsaac." Verena's brows pulled tight, her eyes clouded with confusion. "Stopping me from being with lsaac...but why would anyone go that far?"

Ivan leaned forward, rapping his fingers against the table for emphasis. "Why else? Do you realize how many people you've saved? If I hadn't already given my heart to someone, I might have fallen for you myself after the way you helped me back then. Plenty of those you pulled out of danger couldn't help but admire you."

At the word"admire," Verena's face darkened, anger flashing in her gaze.

"So because of some twisted obsession, someone thought killing my grandmother would keep me away from Isaac?" Her voice shook with fury. "They dare call that admiration? It's sick. If that's the truth, then whoever is behind it will pay dearly when I find them."

Her rage struck a chord, and Ivan's own expression hardened. "Anyone that vile deserves to be ripped apart for what they've done."

Verena's hands curled into tight fists, every ounce of rage she carried forced back down into her chest.

Her voice was low, unsettled. "But besides Isaac telling me how he felt, none of the patients I treated ever confessed anything like that."

"Are you sure?" Ivan muttered, scratching the side of his head as if chasing a thought.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "Hold on-I just remembered someone."

Her gaze sharpened instantly."Who?"

Ivan's tone grew grave. "Back during the Dragon Quarter riot, you saved two men. One was Isaac. The other was a thin, sickly young guy. I'll never forget the way he stared at you. It was... strange. And he used to trail behind you at the hospital, though he tried to stay out of sight. I caught him more than once."

"You mean Carl Aguilar?" Verena asked, doubt flickering in her expression.

Ivan gave a firm nod."Yes. Carl."

Carl Aguilar. A patient she had pulled from the brink. He was painfully thin, his frame almost skeletal, his eyes hidden beneath messy strands of hair.

He rarely spoke, always quiet and withdrawn, yet when approached, he'd respond with a soft smile that seemed harmless enough.

Could it really have been him?

The thought hovered, but Verena quickly dismissed it with a shake of her head. "No. That's impossible. He had no means, and he never knew who I really was."

Ivan, unwilling to let it drop, leaned in with his reasoning. "You've been looking only at the people you trusted enough to tell directly. But what if the one behind your grandmother's death learned your background in passing, without you ever realizing it?"

Verena understood then that narrowing her suspicions to only a handful of people was a mistake. "But Carl hasn't reached out to me since he left the hospital," she said, her brows knitting together in doubt.

Ivan leaned back in his chair, arms folded across his chest. "That guy always rubbed me the wrong way.Around you, he played the part of the polite, cheerful patient. But men like him often keep another side hidden.My advice? Look into him."

Verena's fingers drummed softly against the table as she weighed his words.

Ivan wasn't wrong-sometimes a man could see through another man's facade more easily than a woman could.

If Carl really harbored feelings for her, he certainly wouldn't have let her see anything dark or dangerous.

No one ever reveals their ugliest side to the person they admire.

Ivan had a sharp eye, and his instincts rarely missed. If he was wary of Carl, there had to be a reason.

At last, she stilled her hand and lifted her head, her tone firm. "You're right. I'll start investigating him."

Once her decision was made, hesitation had no place. Rising from her seat, Verena prepared to act on it immediately. "Heading out so soon? You're not even going to sit a little longer and finish breakfast?" Ivan called after her.

Verena lifted a hand in a casual wave. "I've settled the bill aIready. Relax and enjoy the rest."

Once she parted ways with him, she pulled out her phone, scrolled to a number she rarely used, and pressed the call button.
 ###Chapter 219 Familiarity


A moment later, the call connected.

From the other end came a deep, steady voice. "What do you need me to look into?"

Samuel, a private detective Verena had relied on for years, was one of the few people she trusted without hesitation.

They spoke with the ease of old comrades-direct, efficient, and without wasted words.

Lowering her voice, Verena said, "I need you to investigate someone. His name is Carl Aguilar. A year ago,he was discharged from my hospital in Clokron. I've had no contact with him since, but I must know his background and his whereabouts after that. I saved him during the riots, and we barely interacted, so l know little about his life. That may make things harder for you, but please gather as much as you can. Don't worry -your efforts will be compensated the same, no matter the result."

Samuel gave a low chuckle, half in jest."After all these years, I've weathered storms and handled hundreds of cases like this. If | weren't capable, I wouldn't still be standing in this business. Rest easy-it's in good hands." Verena replied, "Alright. I'Il be waiting for your good news."

As her words ended, she stepped through the revolving doors of the restaurant-and halted.Someone was standing directly in her path.

She lifted her gaze."Dr. Moss?"

Simon, dressed casually, greeted her with a twinkle in his eye..

Adjusting his glasses, he spoke warmly. "Evelyn, what a surprise. I didn't expect it to truly be you."

Verena ended the call and slipped her phone back into her coat pocket.

She wasn't sure whether Simon had overheard her earlier words. Maybe not, since she had spoken softly and finished before crossing the door.

Out of courtesy, Verena gave a polite nod and a faint smile. "Are you here for breakfast too?"

Though simple, the curve of her lips carried a brightness that outshone mere politeness.

Simon's eyes flashed briefly with a hunger he struggled to conceal. He longed to draw her close.

Clenching his jaw, he forced that desire into silence, masking it with a gentle smile. "Yes. I've heard this place serves an excellent breakfast. Would you join me?"

Excitement shimmered in his eyes, his lips curving into a hopeful arc.

Unaware of the emotion flickering behind his gaze, Verena shook her head. "I've already eaten, but enjoy your meal, Dr.Moss."

She turned to go, but Simon quickly called out, "Evelyn."

She paused, curiosity in her expression.

Stepping forward while keeping a respectful distance, Simon smiled warmly.11|wanted to ask about Mr.0Bennett's condition. He hasn't come for therapy these past days. Is there another plan, or does he not trust my abilities?" Simon already knew Isaac's vigilance against him was the real reason.
-
He only sought an excuse to prolong his talk with Verena.

Without missing a beat, Verena answered smoothly, "You were chosen by me personally, so your abilities are unquestionable. It's just that my husband's condition cannot be rushed. A period of rest at home may be better for his recovery."

Glancing at her phone, she added apologetically, "I'm sorry, but I have to go now."

Simon leaned forward eagerly."Let me give you a ride."

She shook her head gently."NO,,thank you..." But before she could finish, a voice cut in from the side. "Hey, my dear Verena..."

Verena turned. "Ivan, what are you doing out here?"

Ignoring her question, Ivan first sized up Simon. "And who might this be?"

Verena made the introductions. "This is Dr. Simon Moss, a new psychologist at our hospital."

Then she turned toward Simon. "This is my friend, Ivan Calderon."

Simon's gaze lingered a fraction too long on Ivan, jealousy sparking before he smoothed it away with his practiced gentleness.

He inclined his head with a polite smile. "Nice to meet you."

Ivan, outwardly charming yet cautious with strangers, responded with a cool nod and a faint smile-acknowledging the courtesy, nothing more.

Then he looked back to Verena, answering the question she'd asked earlier. "You wondered why/I came out here?"

He grinned, shaking his head in playful exasperation."YOu forgot your handbag. Lucky for you,l've got sharp eyes."	 He handed her the bag, which she accepted with a smile. "Right-you do have eagle eyes indeed."

Ivan puffed up at once, resting an elbow lightly on her shoulder as he boasted,f course."

Their laughter spilled out easily, filling the air with warmth and harmony.

Simon stood silently aside, watching, the sound of their laughter cutting deep into his chest.

His eyes blazed with jealousy, fists clenching so tightly his knuckles whitened. He struggled to control the surge of frustration within him.

So unfair!

Why could Ivan share her laughter? Why could Isaac have her? Verena had drawn back only from him.

That radiant smile-he believed it should be his alone.

Simon's expression darkened, his gaze toward Ivan sharpening like a blade.

In his heart, Verena belonged to him, and no one else. Yet Ivan's presence had torn that fragile illusion apart,feeding his possessiveness and his envy.

Grinding his teeth, Simon fought the urge to seize her away then and there.

He knew the moment was wrong. He could not let Verena glimpse the madness burning in him. Still, a silent vow seared his thoughts-lvan would pay.

Verena playfully pushed Ivan's hand off her shoulder. He feigned a pitiful look, but out of the corner of his eye caught a flicker on Simon's face.

Ivan hesitated. The look was gone in an instant, yet he was certain he hadn't imagined it.

After their playful exchange,Verena straightened, composed again. "Alright. I have things to do. I'll be off now."
00
She nodded to Simon in parting and turned to leave.

As Verena walked away, Simon departed in theopposite direction.

The two parted paths, while Ivan remained where he was, his gaze tracking Simon's retreating figure.

There was something strangely familiar about him.

Ivan lowered his head, brows furrowed, searching his memory, but nothing surfaced.

He was certain he had never met Simon before. And yet, that,feeling of familiarity lingered, stubborn as a shadow.
###Chapter 220 One Of The Most Difficult Cases


Ever since Verena asked Samuel to investigate Carl, she had been anxiously waiting for his response.

That particular day, right as she reached the hospital, her phone sounded with a message alert.

After parking, Verena stepped out of her car and rummaged through her bag to grab her phone. The screen glowed, revealing a message from Samuel.

Opening it quickly, she read every word with full attention.

Samuel's message said, "Verena, I must admit, the man you wanted me to check out is one of the most difficult cases I've seen. After Carl left your hospital in Clokron, he vanished in just a few months, almost as if he never existed. I searched every avenue and used every tool I had, but his background remains a blank.The only thing I could track down were a handful of photos showing places he visited before disappearing.I couldn't find anything else that would help."

Three photos appeared at the end of the message.	 Each one was shot at night under poor lighting. Judging by his silhouette and the hair falling across his eyes, Verena could barely recognize Carl in them.

Even with those photos, it wasn't enough to move forward.

Verena pressed her lips together and furrowed her brow, frustration rising.

Carl's name echoed in her mind.

He had come into her life out of nowhere and slipped away just as suddenly.

She lowered her eyes and sank into thought, searching for answers.

If Ivan was right in thinking Carl killed Shawna just to keep her away from lsaac, then his sudden disappearance only made everything seem more suspicious. Looking up, Verena's eyes caught a hard glimmer. It struck her that Ivan might actually be right.

Her mind filled with scenes, each one rolling by like a movie-Shawna lying lifeless in bed, her own frantic dash back home, and Isaac tangled in a wreck on the roadside.

Piece by piece, the puzzle was coming together.

Verena's fingers clenched tight around her phone. The deeper she thought, the clearer it became that something wasn't right.

Isaac's accident didn't seem random anymore. It screamed of something planned, something dark.

Fury crashed over her, and she slammed her fist into the nearest hospital wall.

She made a silent promise to herself. She would get to the bottom of this. For Shawna, she would find justice and expose whoever caused Isaac's crash.

Somehow, she would track Carl down.

As she moved toward the hospital entrance, Verena's mind raced. The tangled thoughts pressed down,making her dizzy.介

As she walked into the lobby on the first floor, the room seemed to spin around her. She could not tell if it was the world that swayed or just her own body.

She tried to reach for support, her hand stretching out for a column, but her strength failed. Her knees gave way.

That was the moment she realized the problem was her own body, not the building.

Her hand flew to her stomach, a protective instinct for the baby. Then her vision faded as she collapsed to the floor.

Cries of concern rose from.the people nearby, and they hurried to help. Right then, someone pushed through the crowd.

Simon's face was pale with panic as he rushed to catch her. Before he could reach her, another figure shouldered Simon aside with force.

Gavin shoved him out of the way."Step aside."

Without hesitation, Gavin gathered Verena into his arms and raced her into the hospital.

Simon stumbled back, but a fierce anger flared in his eyes as he watched Gavin whisk Verena away.

In the next instant, Simon darted after them.

Moving quickly, Gavin brought Verena into a hospital room, called for doctors right away, and then grabbed his phone to reach lsaac.

As soon as Isaac got the call, he dropped everything and sped over to the hospital.

When he arrived, Verena had already regained consciousness. She was lying in bed, an IV drip beside her,with a doctor checking her.

After the doctor wrapped up the exam, Isaac's voice trembled, "Doctor, what caused her to pass out? Is she going to be alright?"

The doctor replied with a reassuring tone,"Thhere's no need to worry. She's pregnant, and all the stress and exhaustion led to a bout of anemia. That's what caused her to faint. She just needs time to rest, eat well,and avoid stress. It isn't anything serious. Give her a few days to recover, and she'll be just fine."

Hearing this, Isaac finally released a shaky breath, feeling relief wash over him.

Once the doctor left, Isaac moved closer to Verena, gently holding her face in his hands. His eyes were full of concern and regret.

"I let you down," he admitted softly. "If I'd been paying more attention, I would have noticed how tired you've been."

Verena tried to smile, but her throat felt parched and she struggled to find her voice.

He saw her discomfort right away, poured her a glass of water, and helped her drink.

Verena's fingers rested lightly on his hand, his touch bringing a sense of peace she needed. After she sipped some water, she murmured softly, "Didn't the doctor say I'll be fine? You shouldn't blame yourself. Besides, I'm a doctor too. If anything was wrong, I'd know before anyone else. Just trust me."

Isaac looked closely at her pale features, noticing the stubborn set of her brow.

He understood exactly why she had collapsed-she had been running herself ragged trying to uncover Shawna's killer.

W/ith his own brows drawn tight, Isaac's voice came out firm but caring. "Verena, I get how much this means to you. I've already asked Jacob to keep investigating. Whoever killed your grandmother will pay. But right now, you need to think of yourself first. Remember, you're carrying our child."

That steady look from him sent a pang through Verena's heart.

She thought about confessing it all-that the car crash and Shawna's death seemed connected, maybe even the work of the same person.

She almost told him that it could have been twisted jealousy that had cost his father's life.

Verena hesitated, shaking her head slightly. The loss of his father already weighed so heavily on Isaac, guilt slowing his recovery. If he learned the truth nowv, it might break him for good.

There were just too many secrets tangled up together. She decided she would wait until lsaac's legs healed before revealing everything.

She saw the worry in his eyes and tried to reassure him with a gentle smile, her hand resting protectively on her belly. "I understand. For your sake, and for the baby, I'll be more careful from now on. That's a promise."

Her answer seemed to finally bring Isaac a bit of relief.

Gentle sunlight poured into the room, falling softly over Verena's weary face.

Isaac reached for her hand, his grip gentle. "You haven't had a good night's sleep in days. Just rest now. I'm right here with you." Verena looked up and met the warmth in his gaze. A gentle comfort spread through her chest.

She gave him a small nod, her eyelids growing heavy.

The last few days had been a blur, and rest had always slipped out of reach. Now, though, the exhaustion settled over her, and she drifted off to sleep within moments.
###Chapter 221 A Test Would Strip The Veil Away
  Isaac sat quietly beside Verena, his hand clasping hers.Her serene face lay bathed in the calm of slumber.and for him, the world seemed to pause.



His eyes brimmed with tenderness, affection resting there like a gentle tide.



The room was hushed save for the steady rise and fall of Verena's breathing, Isaac dared not stir: even the faintest sound might shatter the fragile dream she was lost in.



At length, once assured that she was fast asleep, he carefully released her hand and drew the quilt snugly around her.



Bending low, he brushed a feather-light kiss across her forehead, as though he were touching the crown jewel of his life.


Only then did he wheel himself to the door and ease it shut in silence.



The moment he lifted his gaze, Simon appeared,standing guard like a shadow outside the hospital room. Isaac had noticed him earlier, yet in his haste to see Verena, he had chosen not to acknowledge him.



Seeing Isaac emerge, Simon strode forward."How is Evelyn? Is she alright?"



Some men were simply hard to like, and Simon was one of them.



Isaac's eyes narrowed, a glint of steel flashing in their depths.


His voice carried a chill as he said, "Dr. Moss,you seem unusually concerned about my wife."



Every word rang with suspicion, his gaze locked onto Simon as if he could peel away the truth with sheer scrutiny.


Though bound to a wheelchair, Isaac's bearing radiated an authority that no injury could strip away.


Simon, however, felt only contempt. The sight struck him as laughable, and inwardly he sneered.


How could a man in such a state dare to posture so proudly and call Verena his wife? It was nothing short of absurd.



Jealousy and resentment smoldered in his chest,yet his face wore a polite smile. 
One day,he vowed silently. Verena would be his.



As for Isaac-the cripple-before his final fall, Simon would make certain he tasted every ounce of pain that life had poured on him.



The thought itself was intoxicating.


His fists clenched at his sides, nails biting into his palms as he fought to keep his emotions hidden.



With a polished smile, Simon answered smoothly,"Evelyn is not only the director but also someone l have respected for years. As her subordinate-and yes,an admirer-it's only natural that I care for her. Surely,there's no harm in that?"



His eyes did not waver; they held Isaac's stare like a challenge, as though declaring that his concern was beyond reproach.


Isaac's voice hardened, each word dropping like ice."Remember your place. She is my wife. Your concern must have boundaries. Cross them, and the price will be heavy."



Simon's jaw tightened, but his lips curved faintly. "Mr.Bennett, you are overly cautious. Evelyn seems fine,so I shall return to my duties."


He turned, stepping into the elevator. The instant the doors slid shut, the pleasant mask slipped,leaving only shadow across his face.



...



Danica came rushing to the hospital as soon as news of Verena's collapse reached her.



Her arms were laden with bags of health supplements,her eyes brimming with concern. "Verena,what on earth happened? How did you faint so suddenly?"


She hurried to the bedside, setting the bags down with anxious care.


"You must take better care of yourself. Now that you're expecting, you have to guard against exhaustion."



Turning to lsaac, who was calmly peeling fruit,she scolded, "And you-look after Verena properly. If anything happens to her, you'll answer to me."


Before Isaac could reply, Danica pressed on, her attention swinging back to Verena. "Darling,remember to rest between work. Health comes first.You're carrying more than yourself now-you must think of the baby. And don't forget the supplements l brought. Strengthen your body, or you'll suffer later.Understood?" Moved by her earnestness, Verena clasped Danica's hand and nodded. "Thank you, Danica. I'll be careful."


Isaac gently offered Verena the freshly sliced fruit,adding in a steady tone, "Mom, don't worry. I'll make sure she's well cared for."



Danica's sternness softened into a smile. "That's what I like to hear."



Warmth filled the room like sunlight breaking through clouds.



As the two women fell into lively conversation, Isaac quietly withdrew to the balcony.



But peace eluded him. The thought of Simon hovering near Verena gnawed at him.



He could not-would not-allow danger to reach her again.



Lifting his phone, he dialed Jacob.



"Mr. Bennett," Jacob's familiar voice answered promptly, "what can I do for you?"


Isaac's gaze swept the skyline, his tone calm yet edged with command. "I asked you to monitor Simon's movements. Report."



Jacob, ready as ever, replied at once, "According to  my findings, Simon moves only between the hospital and his home, rarely venturing elsewhere..."



Isaac listened in silence, his long fingers tapping against the armrest of his wheelchair.


The breeze tousled his hair, sharpening the austere lines of his face.



"Rarely ventures elsewhere?" he murmured. "Besides coming to the hospital, when was the last time he went out, and where?"



"This morning-at a restaurant," Jacob answered.Then, as if recalling belatedly, he added, "And he happened to run into your wife there."



Ran into Verena?



Isaac's lips pressed into a firm line. Alarm rang like a bell in his mind.



"One more thing," Jacob said suddenly, "Simnon almost never eats out. He orders takeout."



Takeout?



Isaac's tone sharpened. "Send me the record of his orders."


 
"Understood." Jacob complied swiftly. As the information reached him,Isaac's eyes narrowed.


The orders came from small, nondescript eateries,many of them unhygienic, unworthy even of casual dining.



Something felt off.


Simon had once been investigated by/Stevie,who confirmed his obsession with cleanliness.



Why, then, would such a man consume food from questionable restaurants when better choices were readily available?


Suppressing his unease, Isaac asked, "And how often does he take out the trash?"



Jacob, ever thorough, replied without hesitation,"Every few days at most."



Isaac's suspicion deepened. A man who ordered takeout daily yet discarded trash only once in several days hardly fit the image of one obsessed with order.


This contradiction gnawed at him. The Simon others saw was not the Simon that truly existed. That tidy,polished image he showed the world was nothing more than a carefully painted facade.



In truth, what people believed they saw was never the  man he truly was.



Yet the question lingered-why maintain such a mask?What drove him to bury his real self beneath layers of pretense?



Even his public claim of being gay seemed to yield no clear advantage,a riddle without an answer.


Whether it was fact or fabrication-sooner or later, a test would strip the veil away.
###Chapter 222 A Difficult Task
Isaac pressed his lips together and instructed firmnly through the phone, "Jacob, find out what type of men Simon fancies. I need the answer now."


Jacob answered without delay, "Understood, Mr.Bennett."



The moment the call ended, Jacob leapt into action.Barely twenty minutes passed before he rang back.



Isaac picked up, and Jacob's voice came crisply over the receiver. "Mr. Bennett, according to what I've gathered so far,he seems to prefer men who are neat and well-mannered,with gentle features."



Neat and well-mannered, with gentle features...



Isaac straightened, his fingers tightening around the phone as the image of a clean-cut, striking face flickered through his mind.



His lips curved faintly. In a composed tone, he instructed, "I see. Keep tracking his movements closely and inform me at once if anything changes."


With that, he ended the call, his gaze drifting toward the window as if weighing invisible scales.
After a brief silence, he dialed another number.



The line clicked, and Slater's casual voice came through. "Hello,Isaac?"



Isaac drew in a breath before speaking directly."Slater,I need your help. Would you be willing?"



Slater answered without hesitation, his tone resolute,"Of course. You're my friend, almost like an older brother. We may not share blood, but we grew up side by side. Back then, whenever Bobby and I caused trouble, you took the blame for us. Helping you now is the least I can do. For your sake, I'd walk through fire."


Slater might sound slick, but beneath the polish lay genuine loyalty. His words, while dramatic, carried no falsehood.



To Isaac,he had always been like a younger brother.



A faint smile tugged at Isaac's lips as he drawled,"No danger involved. I simply need you to test someone."


"Test someone?" Slater echoed with curiosity. "Who is it?"



Isaac forwarded Simon's photo. "This man is rumored to be interested in men. I need confirmation.Approach him a few times, keep it subtle, but make sure there's some physical contact. Watch carefully  how he responds."



Slater stared at the photo in silence, his voice eventually breaking the pause, laced with surprise and discomfort. "Isaac, you want me to test a guy? And he's into men? Did I hear that right?"


His brows knitted as he studied the picture,muttering,"His eyes... they look shifty, like someone scheming."



Isaac knew the request was no easy pill for a straight man to swallow.



He exhaled softly. "I realize this isn't simple, but you're the only one who can manage it. Truly, you're my best option."


Slater's brows furrowed until they nearly touched."Isaac, at least tell me-what's the purpose?"


Isaac's gaze sharpened. His voice lowered. "Forgive me, but it's not something I can explain now."



Silence pressed in again. Slater's forehead creased deeply. Inside,he wrestled with the task.


He would risk danger for lsaac without hesitation,but this-approaching a man attracted to men-felt like climbing a wall higher than any peril.


At length, he let out a long sigh. "Alright. You're like a brother to me. I'll shoulder this challenge." A gleam softened lsaac's eyes at his agreement."Thank you, Slater. I know this isn't easy. Think of it as a favor for me. When the day comes, I'll return it without fail."



Because Isaac had been away from Verena's bedside for a while, he kept the call brief, ending after confirming the matter.



The instant the line went dead, Slater collapsed into his gaming chair, clutching his head as he groaned,"Good grief! What mess have I landed myself in?"


He sat there, brooding for a moment, and then sighed in resignation.



The die had been cast-he couldn't back out now.



But charming women had always been second nature to him; trying to win over a man was an entirely different battlefield. The very thought made him shudder.



Alone, he knew he wouldn't survive this test.



No matter how he looked at it, he needed a strategist.



But who?



He narrowed his eyes, flipping through mental images of his friends. Suddenly, one face popped into focus.


He snapped upright, eyes wide. "Bobby's always full of schemes. Talking this through with him might just work."



Without wasting another second, he typed out a quick message. "Hey Bobby, need to discuss something.Meet me at the usual spot."



Bobby, already online, replied at once with an "OK"emoji.


Half an hour later, the two met in a chic café.



"So, what's the deal?" Bobby asked lazily, lounging with one leg crossed over the other, his attention glued to a game on his phone.



Slater parted his lips, hesitant. "Could you...help me figure out how to win someone over?"



Bobby sipped his coffee, still absorbed in his screen,assuming it was just another girl.


"Who is she?" he asked absently.



Slater, awkward, pulled up the photo on his phone and held it out. "This person."



Just as Bobby's character neared defeat, his fingers flew faster. Hearing Slater's words, he glanced briefly at the photo.



Handsome,Bobby thought-then froze.



Wait.



His casual mask shattered. His phone slipped from his hands and clattered to the floor.



A passing waiter kindly retrieved it, but Bobby was too stunned to thank him.



His eyes widened as he gaped at Slater, jaw slack.


A few beats later, he burst out, "You've got to be kidding me!"



Slater darted nervous glances around, relieved the café wasn't crowded. Otherwise, the scene would have been mortifying.



He hissed under his breath, "Keep it down, will you?"



"How can l?" Bobby exclaimed, his voice trembling."This is earth-shattering! Since when are you into guys?"



The thought spun in his head, almost too much to digest.



Then, with mock suspicion, he clutched his chest."Don't tell me you've had your eyes on me all along.Good thing I'm straight-otherwise, who knows?" Slater rolled his eyes at Bobby's shamelessness. "I've been straight for over twenty years! This is lsaac's assignment." He shoved the phone toward him.


Bobby blinked in disbelief. "My brother asked you to do this?"



Slater nodded firmly. "Exactly. Otherwise, do you think I'd be chasing after a man?"



Bobby narrowedhis gaze. "Didmy brotherexplain why?”



Slater shrugged. "He said it's confidential for now."



"I see." Bobby rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "If it's from my brother, he must have his reasons."


Slater stared at him, almost laughing at the double standard.



If Slater had volunteered this, Bobby mocked him endlessly. But the moment Isaac was involved, Bobby flipped sides like a coin.



Slater shook his head, feeling their friendship weighed down by bias.


Still, the main issue loomed. He sighed. "The truth is,I have no interest in men at all. That's why I need your advice."



Bobby eyed him suspiciously. "As if I'd be interested." Slater gave a wry grin. "But you always come up with plenty of ideas."



Bobby didn't argue. He took the phone, studying the photo with a measured gaze.



"Handsome," he admitted slowly. "But something about him doesn't sit right. He looks like trouble."


Slater agreed instantly. "Exactly what I thought."


"By the way," Bobby asked curiously,"why would Isaac choose you of all people?"



Slater shook his head. "NNo idea. He just said I'm the best option."



The best option?


Bobby shifted his gaze back to Slater, his grin spreading with mischief.
###Chapter 223 Slater's Sacrifice
Slater lifted his eyes and found Bobby staring at him,that eerie grin curling his lips, a smile so chilling it sent shivers racing down Slater's spine.



His own lips twitched, wariness creeping across his expression. "Do me a favor-don't look at me with that sinister smile. It's downright unsettling."



Resting his chin on his hand, Bobby's tone turned teasingly cryptic. "Perhaps I'vefigured out why lsaac picked you to seduce this man."



The word "seduce" carried a sting, yet curiosity got the better of Slater. Tilting his head, he asked softly,"Why's that?"



Bobby, catching the innocence in his face, smirked with mischief. "Just look at yourself-those wide eyes are more enchanting than most women's. Your skin's smooth and luminous, and that neat oval face could fit into one hand. Aren't these the marks of a perfect romantic lead? Trust me, men will be drawn to you."



Though Slater often seemed carefree, at heart he was shy. Bobby's description painted him in strokes too bold;his cheeks warmed, and panic flickered in his gaze."What nonsense are you spouting? Keep this up,and I won't talk to you again."



Bobby burst out laughing at his flustered response."Alright, alright. Don't get worked up. I'll stop teasing.Let's shift to lsaac's task-you're ready for it, aren't you?"



The mention of business cleared Slater's embarrassment. He leaned forward eagerly. "You already have a plan?"


Bobby tapped at the phone screen. "Didn't my brother send you the file? It maps out Simon's daily schedule, the routes he takes. Isn't the meaning obvious?"



Slater blinked, still uncertain. "Meaning what exactly?"



Clicking his tongue, Bobby sighed. "An encounter,my friend. We need to stage an accidental meeting. If you want to dress it up,call it fate-serendipity."


Realization struck Slater, and he drew a steady breath."No time to lose then. Let's get started."




.··


By evening, the hospital stood quiet, washed in the  warm glow of sunset.



Outside, Slater paced at the entrance, glancing repeatedly through the lobby doors.


A crease formed between his brows, puzzlement taking hold.



Isaac's document had clearly stated Simon would be finishing work around this hour.



The sun was nearly swallowed by the horizon-so why hadn't he appeared?



Just as Slater's patience began to fray,his earpiece crackled. Bobby's low voice came through. "Slater,he's on his way out. Time to move."



At once, Slater masked himself in innocence, his gaze drifting casually toward the approaching figure


Yes-it was Simon.



Then,Slater stepped towNard him.


As they drew level, Slater-suppressing his discomfort -feigned a stumble, twisting his foot and letting himself fall.



In a breath, he toppled into Simon's arms, clutching his broad shoulders for balance. From afar, Bobby's face carried mixed emotions.



It wasn't distaste for two men together-only that it felt strange to witness such closeness firsthand between his best friend and a stranger.


Slater's eyes squeezed shut, his body stiff,bracing himself as though the mission demanded a small sacrifice.



But Simon's response cut the script short.



No sooner had Slater fallen against him than Simon pushed him away, faint disgust flickering across his face.



The reaction was nothing like Slater had envisioned.


Still, he didn't let his shock surface. He stayed in character.



Color flushed his cheeks as he ducked his head, eyes brimming with apology. "I'm so sorry-terribly sorry.I stumbled and bumped into you."



Simon gave him a quick glance, a polite smile touching his lips though his eyes stayed cool. "It's fine."


He turned as if to leave.



Surprise swelled in Slater's chest. Hadn't Isaac claimed he was the best option? Hadn't Bobby said men would  be drawn to him?



Then why this?



Refusing to admit defeat, Slater caught Simon's sleeve.Simon turned back, frowning.


Slater knitted his brows lightly, teeth grazing his lower lip,his face carrying both pain and fragile appeal. "I...I saw the pen in your pocket. You must be a doctor,right? I think I twisted my ankle-maybe even hurt the bone. It aches badly. Could you take a look?"



Simon's face remained composed, his tone steady."Sorry, I'm a psychologist, not an orthopedic doctor."His voice was calm, stripped of emotion. "I'll call a nurse to guide you to the orthopedic department instead."



He pulled out his phone, quickly arranging for a nurse to bring a wheelchair.


Once done, he pressed his lips together and told Slater,"Wait here. The nurse will be right out. I have other matters-so I'll be leaving now."
###Chapter 224 The Attempt Had Fallen Flat
Slater hadn't expected things to go this way, and the blunt rejection left him stunned.



Simon's voice·wasn't just cold-it carried an unshakable finality.


The response rattled Slater, and inside he cursed furiously. What the hell? Wasn't Simon supposed to be into men? Wasn't his type exactly what Simon liked?



He had thrown himself forward with confidence,yet Simon's reaction was beyond strange. Was this all an act of false restraint?



Remembering the bold confidence he had flaunted when Isaac assigned him this mission, Slater tightened his fist with renewed resolve.



There was no turning back now. Isaac had trusted him with this, and he'd see it through no matter what.


Driven by that thought, he called out quickly, "Hey,hold on a second!"



As Simon walked away without the slightest pause,Slater shoved down his revulsion, hurried after him,  and caught his hand. He forced a bashful smile as he mumbled, "If you don't mind,could you give me your number? I just want to connect... nothing else,just as friends."



The contact sent Slater's mind into chaos. For all his years, he had never once held another man's hand,and the sensation felt unbearably awkward.


If his friends ever learned of this moment,they'd laugh him into the ground.


Despite the turmoil raging inside, he kept his face composed, feigning shyness with practiced ease.



The sudden grip made Simon halt in his tracks.



When he turned, the sight of Slater's coyness and strange, hopeful gaze churned something unpleasant in him. Revulsion rose fast, seeping into every nerve.


He ripped his hand free with sharp finality,the movement sharp and merciless, leaving no doubt about his disgust.



Slater froze, staring at his own hand left hanging midair, confusion clouding his eyes as he searched Simon's face for an explanation.



Strength radiated from Simon's movement, far more than Slater had expected. The look Simon gave him was cold, every trace of it drenched in disdain.



His reply came short and cutting. "No. I can't."


Without another glance, he strode off, each step quicker than the last, as though fleeing something filthy.



Left behind, Slater just stood there, dumbstruck,watching the man's back fade into the distance.


A nurse soon pushed a wheelchair out from the hall,her tone kind as she asked, "Sir, do you need a wheelchair?"



Words failed him, so he only nodded.



Lowering himself into the seat,he leaned back,rubbed his chin, and tried to make sense of what had happened.



He had been bold, practically throwing himself out there,yet it had fallen flat.


That didn't make sense. WVasn't he good-looking enough?



Confidence had always been his shield, and within moments,his brief self-doubt shifted into frustration.



No, the problem wasn't him. From Simon's expression, it was obvious this wasn't simply about disinterest.


A man who truly liked other men wouldn't recoil that violently, even if he didn't find the person attractive.



Whether it was pushing away Slater's attempt at contact or recoiling in disgust when asked for his contact information, Simon's responses came off as openly hostile and deeply repelled.


The way he carried himself was no different from a straight man who felt cornered by unwanted advances from another man.



Clicking his tongue in frustration, Slater muttered under his breath, "Did Isaac mess this up? That guy's supposed to like men, but he's acting straighter than Bobby ever did."




...



From a hidden spot not too far away, Bobby had watched the whole exchange, his eyes narrowing as he pieced it together.


Something about the situation gnawed at him, though he couldn't put his finger on what felt wrong.



Once he caught sight of Simon slipping out of the hospital,he hurried after him. He kept close, following Simon all the way down to the underground parking garage, figuring he'd watch the man leave by car.



But Simon's next action threwv Bobby for a loop.


Simon reached the parking lot, shrugged off the jacket Slater had touched, and tossed it into a nearby trash bin with zero hesitation, like the thing was contaminated.



Without missing a beat, he made his way to the restroom tucked into the corner of the garage.



Bobby straightened his collar, trying to look relaxed while tailing him.



He wandered over and gave Simon a casual glance,clocking the fact that Simon wasn't inside a stall.Instead, he was hunched over the sink, furiously scrubbing his hands under blasting water.


It was the back of Simon's left hand that caught Bobby's attention. The skin was raw and flushed,thanks to how hard he was scrubbing-Slater had grabbed that hand earlier.


As Bobby strolled past, Simon murmured, "Hell no.That guy is definitely into men. That's just messed up."



The words made Bobby stop for a beat, surprise  flickering across his face.



He pushed onward and ducked into a stall, acting like a passerby.


After a couple of minutes, once the sound of rushing water faded,Bobby stepped out with his hands shoved in his pockets.



He watched as Simon disappeared down the corridor,his eyes clouded with uncertainty.



Hadn't Slater said Simon was into men?



Simon never would have looked so rattled if he was just dealing with some random admirer.



It hit Bobby all at once. The only explanation was that Simon had absolutely no interest in men.



...


Slater had pushed the envelope as far as he dared.



The assignment wasn't about seduction, just gauging Simon's reaction, exactly how Isaac had laid it out. By that measure, the job was done.



Both Bobby and Slater hung around in Isaac's office,waiting for the verdict.



Roughly thirty minutes crawled by before the meeting  wrapped up and Isaac entered his office.



Seeing his brother, Bobby could hardly contain himself. He shot forward, blurting out, "Isaac, you won't believe what happened today-"



With a quick wave, Isaac silenced Bobby and signaled his staff to exit the room.



The office emptied out,leaving only the three of them.



Taking his spot behind the desk, Isaac glanced Bobby's way. "You decided to jump in, too?"


The words sounded easygoing, but Bobby instantly worried he'd overstepped. He shot Slater a look,quietly pleading for backup.



Catching on to the signal, Slater quickly spoke up."Isaac,please don't fault Bobby for stepping in. I was the one who asked him to lend me his thoughts. You know how sharp he is and how he's always brimming with clever plans. We managed to finish this task only because of the strategies he came up with."



Isaac's gaze lingered on Bobby, but a smile finally crept in. "That much I know."


Relief washed over Bobby and he broke into a wide,satisfied grin.



The smile slipped from Isaac's face as he focused on  the issue at hand. "So, tell me-how did Simon react?"
###Chapter 225 Being Despised
Slater immediately complained with a pout, "Isaac,you can't imagine how much he despised me. I pretended to twist my ankle and deliberately fell against him, but he only shoved me aside. Later, I held his hand and even asked for his number. Not only did he refuse, but he also shook me off with such disgust-as though he had swallowed something bitter."



Isaac's eyes flickered slightly. He had always harbored doubts about Simon's inclination toward men,yet after this attempt, even he found himself somewhat taken aback.



"That's hardly the whole story," Bobby interjected mysteriously, lifting his brow. "You didn't see what happened after that."



Slater knitted his brows, curiosity aroused. "What else happened?"



Bobby straightened and turned to Isaac. "After Slater tested Simon, I grew curious and trailed him into the underground garage. Guess what?" He paused deliberately before continuing. "The very first thing Simon did was toss his jacket into the trash, and then rush to scrub his hands, muttering under his breath,'Hell no. That guy is definitely into men. That's just  messed up.'"



Before Isaac could speak, Slater erupted.



"Unbelievable! I forced myself to swallow my revulsion and didn't despise him, yet he dared to despise me!"



Bobby burst into gleeful laughter, almost bending over with the force of it.


But when lsaac's face hardened, Bobby quickly sobered,cleared his throat, and asked seriously,"Isaac,why did you send Slater to test him? What's the real purpose here? Does this man threaten you somehow?"


Isaac did not wish to drag Bobby into tangled conflicts.With a calm glance, he replied, "Mind your studies instead of poking your nose into matters better left alone."



Bobby fell silent, stung into wordlessness.


Earlier, he had asked Slater about Isaac's reasons,but Slater admitted Isaac had explained nothing.


Now, even pressing lsaac directly, he met the same wall.



Catching the disappointment etched across Bobby's face,Isaac said firmly, "That's enough. You both may leave now." Slater nodded. "Alright, Isaac. We'll see you later."



With that, he tugged Bobby's sleeve, leading him from the office.



Once the door closed, silence settled back into the room.



Isaac clasped his hands together, fingers tapping lightly against the desk as his expression deepened in thought.



Earlier,he had asked Stevie to investigate Simon,who had even produced photos of Simon with a former male partner.



Yet,judging by what Slater and Bobby/had described,Simon's reactions made little sense.



If he truly had once desired men, even if his heart had shifted toward women later, he would not have denounced his own past so harshly.



For desire of that kind was not a coat to be worn and shed at whim; it was etched into one's nature.



A man who had once loved men would not recoil in such disgust-especially when faced with someone like Slater, who fit the very type Simon had preferred.



Isaac pondered quietly. Something suspicious lurked beneath the surface.



His lips pressed into a thin line, brows furrowing,though his gaze remained unnervingly steady.



What could twist a person's nature so dramatically?



Isaac blinked, his eyes dark and contemplative.


Two possibilities emerged: perhaps Simon had suffered deep wounds from a same-sex relationshipin the past, or perhaps the man standing before them now was not Simon at all.




...



After Verena fainted,she remained in the hospital for two days.



During that time, Danica visited frequently,each time arriving with a pot of nourishing soup she had carefully prepared.



Though Verena grew weary of drinking them, she couldn't turn away Danica's kindness in the face of such earnest care.



In truth, on the first afternoon after she collapsed,Verena wanted to return to her work once the IV drip ended.



But under Danica and Isaac's unyielding insistence,she had no choice but to rest those two days.



Finally, on the afternoon of the second day, she was cleared for discharge.



Isaac peeled an apple with quiet patience and handed it to Verena. She bit into it, her smile blooming like sunlight.



Her bright eyes curved with joy, and Isaac felt a gentle stirring in his chest. "You look truly happy," he said softly.



Verena nodded, her grin unwavering. "At last, I can go back to work. My grandmother's matter has already been delayed two days-it mustn't wait any longer."


Though she promised to care for herself, Isaac knew her mind had been tied to Shawna's murder the entire time.



Taking her hand, he said gently, "Verena, Shawna's case is complicated. It won't be solved overnight.Even if you return to work, put your health first. Leave Shawna's matter to me. You just look after yourself -and our baby."



Her gaze softened, brimming with warmth and happiness.


Isaac considered everything on her behalf,arranging every detail, making her truly feel the essence of happiness.


Outside the room, Simon arrived to visit. Yet just as he was about to enter, his eyes fell on the tender sight within: Isaac pressing Verena's hand against his face,the two wrapped in intimacy.



Simon froze, pulling back into the shadow of the doorframe, his gaze fixed upon them, his heart twisting as theirs entwined.



Verena lowered her eyes, stroking her belly tenderly.In a hushed tone, she whispered, "Baby." Then, looking at lsaac, she asked, "What name shall we give our child?"



Isaac pondered, and then shook his head with a faint smile. "No name comes to mind yet. But they are ours,and I'll be sure to give them a name like no other."



He leaned forward, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead."One day,we'll watch them grow-babbling,taking their first steps, falling in love, marrying, and starting a family. The three of us will know the truest joy this world has to offer."



Their smiles met in quiet harmony.



Meanwhile,Simon's hand clamped onto the doorframe,his knuckles whitening as his nails dug deep into the wood. His eyes widened, his face contorted in a twisted rage.



What foolish dream was this? What fantasy was Isaac weaving?



Simon was certain Verena's future belonged to him alone.



His glare burned into Isaac, so full of venom it seemed capable of tearing him apart.


Jaw clenched,Simon swore silently to himself.



This time, Isaac would be crushed. Whether his proud name or his fragile life-Simon vowed to strip it all away.
###Chapter 226 Your End Is Near
Night swallowed the city whole, and the wind howled through the streets like a warning bell. A sudden downpour struck, sending pedestrians scattering for shelter.



High above, on the top floor of a towering high-rise,rain pounded the windows in relentless waves, each impact sharp as musket fire.



Inside, a single floor lamp burned dimly in the living room, its hazy glow wrapping the room in a murky gloom that blurred the line between shadow and substance.



Thunder split the heavens,lightning flooded the room,revealing takeout boxes cluttering the coffee table, a trash bin spilling over, flies circling above it like vultures waiting on decay.


Simon sat motionless on the couch in a striped shirt,a dagger spinning lazily between his fingers.



His stare clung to a photograph on the table-the face in it was Isaac's.



A glint flickered in his eyes, cold and cruel, while the  corner of his mouth lifted with the ghost of a smile.



Moments later, he picked up the phone and dialed a number so feared, most men would never dare breathe it aloud.



He waited. At last, the line clicked open.


A deep, glacial voice filled his ear. "If I recall, our deal is over."



No greeting. Only menace-like a devil rising straight from the pit.


Once, Simon wouldn't have dreamed of making this call.



But tonight was different. Fear no longer lived in his eyes.



His lips curved, chilling and deliberate. "Mr. Sampson,of course our deal is done. But this call is for something else-something greater. A piece of news that will astonish you... and I promise, it won't disappoint."


Far away, Luis Sampson leaned back in his chair, black trench coat draped loosely, a half-burned cigar between his fingers.



He squinted, silence holding for several beats before his voice uncoiled, slow and mocking. "Is that so?  Then speak."



Simon's tone hardened, every word deliberate."You've searched for your sister for over ten years.I can tell you now-I know where she is."



At once, Luis surged to his feet. His eyes blazed, long -buried emotions tearing free.



"Where is she?" His voice trembled, urgency cracking through.



Yet even then, discipline pulled at his reins. "How do you know? Ten years without a trace-and suddenly you claim certainty?"



At this, Simon's chuckle slid low and dark. "Mr.Sampson, not all things can be explained. You scoured the world with empty hands, and I found her without even meaning to. Sometimes, fate mocks us with coincidence. And as for your sister-l'd never dare joke. Not with you."



Luis narrowed his gaze, knowing Simon wouldn't dare lie-not unless he longed for the grave.


Slowly, he sank back into his chair. The thought of his long-lost sister-the family he had longed for through years of sleepless nights-now dangled before him,setting his blood alight with hope. "Where is she?" His voice cracked again, hoarse.
"Where is my sister now?"



Simon could taste the hunger in his words. His gamble was taking root.


He lifted the dagger, letting its edge glint against the dim light.



"You want her?" His smile warped into something feral. "Then help me topple a man. We'll settle details face-to-face."



A heavy silence followed. Only static whispered faintly through the line.



For Simon to demand such terms meant one thing: he was certain Luis would accept. After all, this was the sister he had chased through more than ten relentless years. Everyone knew-his sister was the one chink in his armor.



Simon savored the moment, convinced the whole chessboard was his to command.



On the other end, Luis drew slowly on his cigar, and then released a perfect ring of smoke that floated upward.



The haze curled around his features, blurring them,sharpening the authority in his posture.



His chin lifted slightly, eyes glinting with lethal frost.Each word dripped with death's certainty-and none who knew him doubted. He never bluffed.



Yet Simon held his ground. Madness burned in his stare; his mouth twisted into a grin that bordered on delirium.



His laughter ripped through the room, jagged and shrill, a sound that scraped bone. Tears welled up in his eyes before he fell still.


"Of course, I know." Simon's bloodshot eyes dropped to the photo on the table. "By day, Mr. Sampson,you're the polished head of a glittering jewelry empire.By night, you rule the underworld with an iron hand-merciless and absolute. If I dare threaten you,it is because I no longer fear death, nor the hell you command. I desire only one thing..."


With a savage thrust, he drove the dagger through Isaac's photo. "Help me annihilate Isaac Bennett. Wipe him out so completely that not even his bones remain.Do that-and you'll see your sister."



A low chuckle slipped from his lips. "Refuse? Then take my life-l welcome it. But know this: your sister vanishes forever. For a man who has nothing left to lose, threats are weightless. Bribery, however, works. And you, Mr. Sampson, are wise enough to see it."



On the other end, Luis crushed his cigar out,jaw clenched hard.



Simon was pressing on the one wound he could never ignore-his sister.


Without this trump card, if Simon dared to threaten him like this, his -corpse would already be cold.



After a long silence, Luis rose, sliding his hands into the deep pockets of his coat. His eyes turned to ice,his tone deadly calm. "I'll hear you out. Face-to-face."


He ended the call. Then, with a flicker of command,he told the shadow behind him, "We're going back."



On Simon's side, once he heard the words, he hurled the phone aside.



In the dimness, his lips curled slowly, a cruel light kindling in his eyes.


For a moment, silence ruled. Then a low, eerie laugh crawled from his throat, thick with malice and triumph -as if a demon had been set loose.



Outside, thunder roared, rattling the windows,yet his laughter rose higher, nearly drowning the storm.



Lightning cleaved the sky, flashing across hisface-  half shadow, half glare-turning him monstrous,his eyes wide and predatory.



In his mind, one refrain repeated endlessly-Isaac Bennett,your end is near.
###Chapter 227 A Million For A Ride
At Shoildon Airport, amid the constant shuffle of travelers in the crowded hall, a man strode forward with unhurried confidence, and at once, all eyes seemed drawn to him.



His back was straight, his steps measured, carrying the quiet authority of someone accustomed to command.



His face,chiseled with cold precision, was made all the more striking by eyes sharp as a blade, eyes that carried a chill like winter frost. A faint scar traced across his skin-a silent reminder of past battles,lending him a rugged,unforgettable charm.



Though countless glances followed him,Luis remained unmoved,his gaze fixed steadily on the path ahead.



Yet,the moment he stepped out of the airport and realized the driver he had arranged was nowhere in sight, a faint crease lined his brow.


Just then, his phone rang.



He answered, displeasure flashing briefly in his eyes."Where's the car?" An anxious voice came through the line. "I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sampson. The driver met with an accident on the way. I've already dispatched a replacement,but it may take some time..."



Luis cut in, his tone clipped. "How long?"



The assistant faltered. "The new driver is a distance away, and with traffic this heavy, at least... an hour."


An hour.



That was longer than the time he had promised to meet Simon.



For a man of Luis' stature, others usually bent to his schedule. Yet, paradoxically, he was the sort who would never break his own word.


To put it bluntly, he had a streak of obsession with punctuality.


Lifting his chin, his gaze fell on a sleek black Bentley slowly rolling toward him.


He spoke into the phone, voice calm as still water."Don't bother."



With that, he ended the call and slipped the phone neatly into his coat pocket.



Inside the Bentley, Verena gripped the steering wheel  with one hand, her eyes steady on the road ahead.



Suddenly, a tall man in a black trench coat came into view, striding directly toward her car as though intent on blocking her path.


Broad daylight, in a law-abiding society-what was he thinking? Was this some poorly thought-out ploy?



Verena eased the car to a stop and lowered the window.



"Sir, is there something you need?" she asked evenly.



As the window slid down, Luis finally saw her face clearly, and for a fleeting moment, his eyes sparked with interest.



The woman before him was strikingly beautiful-slightly upturned eyes laced with quiet allure, a nose sharp in its symmetry, and lips naturally red,untouched by any makeup.



She was the kind of beauty that could turn heads without trying.



Yet what made her stand apart was the frost in her gaze-cold, distant, like the pale moon on a midwinter night, both breathtaking and beyond reach.



Luis regarded her with a trace of admiration. Beauty was common, but beauty wedded to pride and distance-such women were rare gems indeed.



After a pause, he reined himself in and spoke with measured courtesy. "Would you be willing to take me to Nandita Restaurant? I'll make it worth your while."



And, as if to ward off disbelief, he added lightly, "One million."



As the man stood by the car door, free of the glass between them, Verena had a full view of his face.



She was momentarily taken aback, but recognition soon dawned.



She had seen him in the news, and Miranda had spoken of him often-a figure wielding immense power within Akoitha's underground forces.



A reputation so formidable that one had to see him in person to believe it.



Indeed,impressive.



A wealthy heir through and through, tossing out a million as casually as spare change.



Such status left little room to suspect deceit.



Nandita restaurant? It lay barely five hundred yards from her hospital.



Verena tilted her chin, gesturing lightly toward the back seat. "It's on my way. Get in."



Once Luis settled in, Verena set the car in motion again.


She drove with one hand steady on the wheel, the other resting against the window frame, her slender fingers tapping a casual rhythm.



At a red light, the car slowed to a stop.


Verena glanced into the rearview mirror, her eyes narrowing slightly.


If memory served her right, the latest reports had placed him abroad, expanding his empire.


Yet here he was, back in the country in less than two months.



Sensing her gaze, Luis looked up and caught her eyes in the mirror.



Unperturbed at being discovered, Verena shifted her attention away, only to notice his hand, like hers,drumming lightly against the window with the same idle rhythm.



Luis seemed to notice as well, and his brow lifted ever Their eyes met again in the mirror.



One second.



Two seconds.



Three seconds later, both allowed a faint smile to appear.
###Chapter 228 You Think I'm Omnipotent
 The traffic light flicked green.



Verena shifted her gaze from the rearview mirror,tapped the accelerator, and the car glided forward with steady ease.



Women like her-pleasing to the eye and pleasant in company-were a rarity. Luis' eyes lingered, drinking her in. "You're beautiful."



Verena, eyes fixed on the road, accepted it without the faintest fluster. "Thanks. You're not bad yourself."


Through the mirror, Luis glimpsed her composed,unshaken expression-no trace of surprise, not even a flicker.The steadiness of it stirred his curiosity.



Most of the women he had known seemed to draw from the same three stock replies whenever praise came their way.



Some wore false modesty, hands fluttering, saying,"Oh, not really." Others leaned into arrogance,chin tilted, saying, "Of course." The rest, secretly thrilled,covered their delight with a polite smile. Rarely did he meet one like this woman-unashamed to take a compliment, gracious enough to return it,yet utterly detached, no trace of vanity or pandering.



Luis' lips curved faintly, appreciation deepening.



It was their first meeting, yet somehow conversation with her already felt as easy as breathing.


On impulse, Luis slipped out his phone, leaning a touch forward. "Miss, mind if we swap contact information?"



Verena lifted her lashes, shooting him a flat glance in the mirror. "Not happening. I'm married."


Luis paused for a heartbeat, and then the truth struck him-she had taken it the wrong way.


A quiet smile touched his lips. "Don't get me wrong.Not in that way. I just hoped to make a friend."


Verena had heard that excuse more times than she could count.



A worn-out pickup line-yet she hadn't expected the leader of Akoitha's underworld to stoop to such a clumsy one.



Her laughter was soft, but her words were sharp. "You don't strike me as a liar. But the credibility of that line?  Zero."



Rejected, yet Luis showed no	flinch-no embarrassment, no awkward shuffle.



He tucked his phone away and gave a light nod. "Then I won't press."



Verena offered the faintest smile, nothing more.



Silence settled like a veil over the car.



Soon,the destination came into view.



Verena guided the car smoothly toward the curb, and then clicked the locks open.



"Here we are, sir-Nandita Restaurant."



Luis pushed the door open and stepped out.



Circling to the driver's side, he drew a black card from the inner pocket of his coat.


Matte black, etched with intricate patterns, the card carried a regal, mysterious weight-every inch of it a declaration of power and wealth.



He handed it to Verena. "Your tip-ten million inside.Password's six zeroes."



Verena blinked, momentarily stunned. She stared at the card in her hand, and then back at him.
Her eyes said it all, as though she were looking at a fool.



She held the card between long fingers, one brow arched. "Didn't we agree on one million before we left? How should I return the rest to you?"


Her gaze remained clear, steady, and utterly untouched by the lure of an absurd fortune.


Luis felt his admiration for her surge once more.



He smiled, hands slipping into his pockets. "Keep the rest. Call it a bonus. Think of it as thanks for the emotional value you gave me in the car. Somehow,you eased my mood."


Emotional value? Verena echoed inwardly, browS knitting.



She hadn't lifted a finger to "add value."



"It was just a ride. Ten million for a taxi? Don't you think that's over the top?"



To Luis, ten million was pocket change. For a family ruling both sides of the law at its height, money had long since become the pursuer, not the pursued.



He shook his head. "Not over the top. Not a fare.The ten million is for you." Verena's eyes narrowed, her brows drawing together in a tense knot.



This was the first time she saw someone use such an indirect method to coax a woman into being his secret lover.



She gave a sharp snort and flicked the card at his chest. "Yes, you're rich. But clearly, integrity isn't part of the package."



With that, she pressed the button, the window sliding shut.



The car swung round,pulling away fast.



Luis looked down at the card lying on the ground,his brows knitting.



Had he been too forward?



He swore-once he knew she was married, he'd buried any ulterior motive.



Still, the awkwardness barely clung.


Watching her car fade into the distance, Luis checked his watch, and then turned toward the restaurant.







Upstairs, in the VIP suite of Nandita Restaurant, Simon pushed open the door. At the head of the table sat Luis.



Adjusting his glasses, Simon offered a polite smnile."Apologies. I'm late."


Luis barely stirred. His voice was flat. "I just got here."



Simon seated himself opposite, fingers neatly laced on the table.



No invitation from Luis. No courtesy. In days past, that kind of audacity would have earned broken limbs-if not worse.



But today Simon showed no fear, for he held something Luis wanted.



Luis saw through him clearly. Were it not for greater priorities, Simon would already be a memory in the ground.



A man like Simon, bold enough to claim an equal seat?In another world, he would have been laid to rest ten thousand times already.



Luis cut straight to the marrow. "On the phone,you said you wanted someone taken down. Who? Show me."



Details couldn't be tossed over a call. And with his mind consumed by his missing sister, Luis hadn't given  much thought to the name Simon had dropped.



At the words, Simon slid a file across-prepared long ago-on Isaac.



Luis flipped it open. His eyes narrowed the instant he saw the contents.



He tossed the papers aside, voice icy. "You're asking me to move against Isaac Bennett, CEO of Bennett Group? Do you have any idea who that man is? The weight he carries? Not just in Shoildon-his family's reach grips every corner of Akoitha's business world.Even politics-names you wouldn't dare whisper.What,you think I'm omnipotent?"



Simon bristled, fury and jealousy burning hot behind his stare. His fingers tightened, knuckles whitening,rage coiling beneath his skin.
###Chapter 229 I'll Do It



Simon pressed a smile onto his face, but there was nothing warm about it. "This won't be easy, I know.Going after Bennett Group is going to cost a fortune,no question. But come on, Mr. Sampson, you're not the type who sticks to the rulebook. Isn't the slow and steady approach a waste of your talents? You've got influence in places most people can't even imagine.Why not use some of those connections to solve this?"


His words curled around Luis, low and persistent.


After Simon finished laying out his plan, Luis let the silence settle between them, unbroken and tense.



The whole room seemed to freeze, the air thick with anticipation.



Luis locked eyes with him for what felt like forever, his stare hard and unyielding. He radiated the kind of power that made people shrink back.



He began to drum his fingers on the table, each tap sharp and deliberate, like a warning.



Despite trying to appear collected, Simon started to feel that silence pressing down on him, stealing his breath. Just when Simon was sure his request was about to be shot down, Luis finally spoke. "I've got no vendetta against Bennett Group, and lsaac and I stay out of each other's way. You realy expect me to waste everything I've built going up against someone like that, all because you asked? Simon Moss, that's just wishful thinking."



Luis narrowed his eyes, voice dropping lower."You found my sister, right? I can find her,too."


He rose from his seat and made for the door.



Watching him walk away, Simon's nerves snapped.The thought of losing his only leverage sent him into a panic.


He jumped up, voice rising with urgency. "Maybe you can find your sister, but let's be honest, you don't have a single lead right now. I know her name. I know her address. If you turn me down, I swear you'll never see her again. And if you ever do, she'll be a corpse,not a reunion."



Whoosh!



No sooner had Simon finished than Luis spun on his heel. In a flash, he snatched a knife from the table and pressed it hard against Simon's neck, the blade cool and unforgiving against skin. The sharp edge hovered right over his artery.



"Don't you think I can kill you before you even have a chance to lay a finger on my sister?" Luis spoke softly, but the threat in his voice could cut glass. His eyes locked onto Simon with a sharp, unyielding glare,burning with controlled rage.



Simon had never come face to face with this kind of menace before. For a split second, he stared down at the knife, real fear flickering in his eyes.



But the fear didn't last long.


He straightened, forcing a cocky grin, letting it twist into something far darker. "I know you could kill me in a heartbeat. Guys like you crush people like me without even blinking. Still, everyone's got a weak spot, don't they?"



His eyes glinted with unhinged malice as he continued,"Your sister is hidden so well you'll never sniff her out,and my men know what to do if I don't check in. I'm not scared to die. But can you really stomach the idea of her being so close, only to end up dead because you slipped? Wouldn't that be a tragedy?"



A muscle ticked in Luis' jaw, the tension visible in the lines of his face.



He swallowed his anger almost instantly, steadying  himself in the moment.



Luis' eyes narrowed, as if he was already planning Simon's downfall.


Luis finally sank back into his seat. "Alright, I'll go along with it. But I need proof first. Tell me something about my sister. Without that, there's no reason for me to trust a word you say."



He flicked the knife onto the table and calmly wiped his hands with a napkin, like he'd just brushed off some dirt.


Simon eased himself back into his chair, quietly seething as he watched Luis, resentment churning under his skin.



Still, powerless against Luis, Simon bit back the anger brewing inside him.



Reading Luis' doubt, he reached into his coat and produced a photograph, already prepared for this moment.



"Take a look at this," said Simon, sliding the photo across the table. "I caught this picture by pure luck. It matches the one you put out on the missing persons notice."



The image focused tightly on a scar, its placement on the body impossible to guess. Luis' eyes widened, a spark of disbelief lighting his features before joy swept in to take its place.


A smile crept across his lips. His eyes gleamed,and his pulse thundered in his chest.


That scar was his doing-his memory couldn't be clearer.



He remembered how tiny his sister was back then.



She'd started fussing, and thinking she needed water,he had hurried to bring her some.



He hadn't realized the cup was filled with boiling water, and his grip slipped just as he neared her crib.



Water and glass hit the floor. Moments later, her cries broke his heart.



He recalled kneeling down to find the skin above her left knee red and blistered, already puckering.



That burn later healed into a butterfly-shaped scar-one he'd never forgotten.



The photo looked right, but Luis wasn't about to let his guard down.



He steadied himself, and then spoke with forced calm."I put word out everywhere. That scar's become famous. Anyone could fake it with a little help from a surgeon."



Simon expected as much. He gave a knowing nod."True. You spread the word far and wide, and plenty of people have seen that detail. But you never told anyone exactly where the scar was, didyou?"


"You really think you know?" Luis kept his voice even,not giving anything away.


With a smirk, Simon leaned in, eyes glinting. "If I didn't know the truth, I'd never dare sit here. That butterfly scar-it's justabove her left knee,isn'tit,Mr.Sampson?"



Luis' eyes snapped wide, shock flickering across his face as he stared Simon dowNn.



Catching that reaction, Simon couldn't help but let out a low laugh. "Still doubting me, Mr. Sampson?I think I've made it pretty clear your sister's the one I've got."


A lump formed in Luis' throat, but he kept silent for a moment.



There was no room for denial. He knew Simon was telling the truth.


She was his world-he could never walk away from her, no matter the cost.



If it meant putting his own life on the line,he wouldn't hesitate for a second.



The Bennett family ruled Akoitha's business world,leaving the Sampson family trailing far behind in that arena.



However, when it came to dominance in the underworld, the Sampson family stood unmatched at the top.



That said, crossing a powerhouse like the Bennett family would still leave scars on everything he'd built.


But for the chance to see his sister again, no risk seemed too great.



Fixing Simon with a cold glare, he silently promised retribution.



He would play along for now, but once his sister was safe, Simon wouldn't get the chance to gloat.


After wrestling with his thoughts, Luis finally gave a stiff nod. "All right. I'll do it. But if anything happens to my sister while you're holding her over my head,you'll regret ever crossing me. That's a promise."


Simon flashed a sly, self-satisfied grin. "Naturally. I look forward to working together, Mr. Sampson."


With a sharp, cold snort, Luis turned his back on Simon and strode from the room without another word. Simon couldn't have cared less about the contempt thrown his way. His expression revealed the dark pleasure he took in it all.



Suddenly, his voice cut through the silence,cold and smug. "Isaac Bennett, I've always said-no one takes what belongs to me."
###Chapter 230 Take A Guess At What He Found (Part...

After tossing the bank card back at Luis, Verena pulled out of the driveway, steering straight toward the hospital.


By the time she reached the underground garage,her mind was already shifting into work mode.She parked quickly, rode the elevator to the lobby, and the sharp,sterilescent of disinfectant reminded her exactly where she was.



She pushed open the door to her private lounge,but before she could even take her bag off her shoulder,it burst open.



Startled, she turned, only to see Julianna rush in with panic etched across her face. "Evelyn,we just brought in a patient. The condition is critical, and only you can take the case," she said in a rush.



The weight of those words wiped every trace of calm from Verena's features. She pivoted on her heel and strode quickly toward the operating room.



Julianna stayed close, speaking rapidly as they walked.She filled Verena in on the patient's failing condition,her voice tense but steady. In the preparation area, Verena slipped into her sterile gown and gloves. She looked at the nurse beside her."Is the anesthetic already given?"



"Yes, everything's ready," said the nurse with a nod.



With that, Verena shot a glance back at Julianna."We're going in."



Julianna, already suited up, returned the nod and followed her inside. The moment they entered, the room tightened with silence.



The only sounds came from the rhythmic beeping of the equipment and the faint rustle of sterile fabric.



Verena's eyes locked on the screen showing the patient's vitals.



The scalpel pressed into her palm as soon as the nurse passed it over, and Verena shut out everything except the task at hand.



Each second dragged like an hour, her knitted brows refusing to ease, a clear sign of the struggle before her.



Time slipped into hours, and sweat began to sting her eyes. Still, she never faltered. Her hands moved with sharp accuracy, every cut and stitch a desperate bid to keep the patient alive. She knew there was no margin for error. One slip could mean death right there on the table.


When the sweat threatened to fall, a nurse stepped in quickly, blotting it away so Verena's concentration never wavered.


The room held its breath, silence thick enough to feel,broken only by the faint sounds of monitors and instruments.



At last, after four relentless hours, Verena lowered her hands. The battle was finished, and the surgery was done.



Verena finally stepped out of the operating room,her shoulders sagging from exhaustion. Julianna quickly passed her a bottle of water and spoke with relief."The patient pulled through. He's already been moved into observation. Evelyn, let me handle things from here. You should get some rest in the lounge."



Verena lifted the bottle to her lips, easing her dry throat before asking, "And what about you?"



Julianna shook her head lightly. "You were the one leading the whole operation. I'm fine. I can nap on this chair if I need to, and the nurses are right here to help."


For a moment, Verena lingered, torn by the thought of leaving when the patient's state was still so fragile. Catching that hesitation, Julianna tapped her own belly and gave a gentle smile. "You need to thinkof the baby too. Go on,take a break."



A small smile touched Verena's face as she rested a hand on her stomach. "Alright then. I'll go rest. Let me know the second anything happens."



Back in her lounge, she sank into the chair,hoping for even a short nap. The chance never came. A knock sounded before her body could fully relax.



"Please, come in," Verena called out.



The nurse edged the door open and spoke in a hushed tone. "Evelyn, someone tried reaching you several times while you were in surgery."



Verena nodded once. "Alright. Thank you. Go on back to your duties."



As soon as the nurse left, she pulled open the drawer and took out her phone.



The screen showed a string of missed calls from Ivan.Without hesitation, she tapped his number and returned the call.


She assumed it had to do with the psychologist he had promised to help her contact. The line connected almost instantly, and his voice came sharp with irritation. "Verena, where have you been? Why didn't you pick up?"


Verena pressed her lips together, her voice quiet when she finally answered, "I'm sorry. I was in the middle of surgery."



"Oh, I see." Ivan's voice shifted the moment he realized she had been working. "So that's why you missed my calls. I'll keep this quick so you can rest.I managed to get in touch with Luther,the psychologist for your husband. We spoke a few days back,and he rang me today to confirm. Unless something delays him, he's leaving Clokron tonight and heading straight for Shoildon."



At that, Verena's weariness lifted as if it had never been there.



Hope flickered through her chest, bright and unstoppable.



Luther's reputation preceded him, and she had long believed that someone of his caliber might be the key to Isaac's recovery.



Relieved,she eased into her chair, her lips curving with genuine gratitude. "That's wonderful, Ivan. I can't thank you enough." He gave a soft click of his tongue. "Come on now,we're like family. You don't need to thank me. Just promise me you'll rest. An operation like that usually takes two or three hours, and you've pushed yourself too hard."



When the call ended, she powered off her phone and leaned back, prepared to let her body finally relax.



Her peace lasted only moments. The door burst open,and Julianna hurried inside, her face pale with panic."Evelyn, something's gone wrong. The patient's heart just stopped. You have to come now!"



Verena shot to her feet and rushed toward the resuscitation room without a second thought.


The battle began all over again the instant she stepped inside.



Everything slowed-the room hushed, save for the frantic breaths and the hurried movements of her hands as she fought for the patient's life.



Nearly an hour passed before the crisis eased, and the heartbeat on the monitor steadied once more.
###Chapter 231 Take A Guess At What He Found (Part...
Dusk had already settled beyond the windows by the time Verena stepped out of the resuscitation room.



Her movements were slow and uncertain, and the exhaustion etched across her face left no doubt about how drained she truly was.



Back in the lounge, her phone started buzzing, cutting through the silence.



She checked the screen, saw the name flashing, and answered with a faint smile tugging at her lips.



Isaac's soft voice filled her ear the moment the line connected. "Verena, are you done for the day? I'm outside the hospital, waiting to take you out for something to eat."



She let out a quiet breath, gathering just enough strength as she responded, "Alright. I'll be down in a minute."



Once the call ended, she slipped out of her lab coat,pulled on the jacket she had brought, and headed out of the lounge.
The hospital lobby gave way to the evening air, and just outside, Isaac's car stood waiting at the entrance.The driver caught sight of her and stepped forward to open the door.



Verena offered him a polite thanks before climbing inside.



The first thing she noticed was a sleek cake box balanced in Isaac's hand, his long fingers holding it with ease.



Her lips curved as she accepted it and settled it onto her lap, peeling back the ribbon. "What made you decide on cake?" she asked with genuine curiosity.



Isaac busied himself with the utensils and answered with a hint of hesitation, "I thought sweets were something every girl liked."



The affection behind the gesture warmed her chest,though she couldn't resist teasing him. "Oh? You seem awfully confident in knowing what women like, Mr.Bennett."



His calm unraveled as he hurried to explain, "No, no.I didn't figure it out on my own. I just... came across it online."



Usually so self-possessed, he always unraveled whenever she aimed her playful words at him. Her laugh bubbled up before she could stop it. "Relax,I was only joking."


She scooped a small bite of cream with her fork and tasted it slowly.



Isaac lowered his gaze, his eyes following her movements in silence.



By the time she reached for the third bite, his voice broke the quiet. "You're upset today."


It wasn't phrased as a question.



Her hand froze midair as he added gently, "Tell me,Verena. What's weighing on you?"



Her eyes lifted, locking with Isaac's steady gaze,the weight of his silence urging her to speak.


It startled her how easily he saw through her. She had thought her mask was intact, but he read her as if she'd never tried to hide a thing.



A long time together had made them fluent in each other-one glance, a shift in tone, even the smallest gesture could expose the truth.



Inside,Verena let out a quiet sigh. The day had been consumed by endless monitoring of the patient's fragile condition, leaving her no chance to rest. Even so, the haunting matter of Shawna's death lingered unresolved, gnawing at her every thought.


That weight made her chest tight, her nerves restless,her heart uneasy.



Her carelessness had cost Shawna her life, and Verena had carried the weight of that mistake ever since she knew Shawna's death wasn't an accident.



Even now, she hadn't uncovered the whole truth yet and hadn't found justice for Shawna.



The guilt pressed down on her,sharper every time she thought of her grandmother.


Still, Verena refused to share this with Isaac. He was already carrying enough on his shoulders.



So she brushed it off and said, "I just ran into someone absolutely wild today."



Isaac trusted her without question. When she said that,he just nodded and said, "Who was it?"



Verena let out a quick laugh. "You're not going to believe it. Luis Sampson, of all people."


Isaac was surprised. Luis Sampson? Wasn't he the influential figure ruling the Akoitha underworld?



Isaac's expression tightened while Verena added, "He  literally cut me off in traffic at the airport just to ask for a ride to Nandita Restaurant. Since it was on the way, I agreed to take him, but during the drive, he asked for my contact information like it was no big deal..."



A sudden realization flickered across Verena's face.She glanced over at Isaac, catching the way his lips pressed into a straight line and how his dark eyes seemed bottomless.



He might have kept his emotions under wraps, but Verena could see right through him.


Jealousy was written all over his silence.


A laugh slipped out of her as she leaned in close, her voice dropping to a playful whisper. "Relax, Isaac.I let him know I'm a married woman and shot him down right away."



That seemed to do the trick. Isaac's mouth curled into a genuine smile, his features softening.


Switching topics, Verena added, "Oh, before I forget,the psychologist will get here tonight. He's coming in from Clokron to Shoildon, so therapy can finally get underway. Just so you know, I won't push you into anything. Take your time and tell me when you're ready."



Her words seemed to catch lsaac off guard. For a  moment, he just stared, and then hope sparkled in his eyes.



He gripped her hand, steady and sure, before saying,"With you in my corner, Verena, I can handle anything."


A gentle smile appeared on her lips as she placed her hand on his and said, "I'm not going anywhere."



Isaac drew her closer, pressing a warm kiss to her forehead.



As another thought surfaced, he grew serious."There's something important I need to share with you,Verena."



Intrigued, Verena gave him her full attention. Isaac continued, "I've been digging into Simon's background.He's not exactly what he seems. According to the information I got, he's only interested in men. But the way he watches you doesn't match up with that, so I asked Slater to figure out the truth. Want to take a guess at what he found?"
###Chapter 232 Unshakable Faith
"What's the outcome? I thought Simon was only interested in men," said Verena.



Isaac's brow creased as he met her eyes. "That's what everyone who knows him believed, but Slater's little experiment told a different story. Simon barely reacted. If anything,he looked repulsed. I checked his background before all this, and I'm sure Slater is his type. If Simon really fit the profile, he should have shown at least a spark of interest. But there was nothing. Actually, it was the complete opposite. He even recoiled from the whole situation. And then there's his supposed obsession with cleanliness-turns out,he lives off takeout and lets the trash pile up for days. That doesn't line up with anything in our records.The Simon you see now is nothing like the Simon I investigated. It's almost as if we're dealing with two separate people."



Verena stared at him,bewildered. "Are you telling me the Simon working at the hospital isn't even the same person as the one from your investigation reports?"



She wasn't questioning Isaac's instincts-just struggling to make sense of it all. "I read through every part of his resume when we hired him. It was flawless. The authorities checked his background,and no one found the smallest problem."



But now, nothing added up.



"How could someone just switch identities like that?Even with plastic surgery, you can't just copy a person down to the last detail. And what's more, how did he get through all our background checks without leaving a trace? What is he really after in my hospital?"


Her questions hung in the air, and the tension grew thicker by the second.



She tried to steady her breathing, but a chill crept up her spine, as if she were standing at the center of a mystery she couldn't escape.



Isaac met her gaze, every word measured. "He's here because of you, Verena."



Disbelief clouded her eyes as she struggled to accept it.



"But I've never even spoken to him before," she said,her voice barely above a whisper.


Isaac studied her. "You say you never met him, but are you certain he wasn't watching you all along?"



Verena pressed her teeth gently to her bottom lip, deep in thought.



Questions spun through her mind. She wondered if Simon had been playing a much bigger game all along,slipping into the hospital with his own secret motives.Still, one thing never wavered-her faith in Isaac remained unshakable.



If there was even a chance Simon was hiding something,she refused to sit by and do nothing.


A new resolve filled her eyes as she finally broke the silence. "I'll figure out a way to get close to Simon. If he's not who he claims to be, I want to see how he pulled off such a perfect imitation."



A darker look passed over Isaac's face, and he met her determination with a slow nod. "Okay. Just watch yourself,all right?"


A faint crease formed on Verena's brow as her mind wandered to another possibility.



Out of nowhere, the name Carl floated to the surface.



Was it possible?



Suddenly, she let herself consider every wild theory she'd tried to ignore.



What if Simon and Carl were one and the same? The timing fit. Carl had vanished. There was a possibility he had slipped into Simon's identity while the real Simon was...



A chill ran down her spine.



Was the real Simon being held somewhere? Or had something worse happened to him?


Verena massaged her temples, eyes fixed on the world slipping by outside the car window.


Streetlights and shadows flashed past, and for a moment, it seemed like danger itself was moving just out of sight, waiting for its chance to close in.
###Chapter 233 Did He Do Something To You
After finishing dinner at a restaurant, neither Isaac nor Verena felt like lingering there any longer.They went home soon after that.


Back at Seraphina Villas, both got swept up in work,typing away in silence. Isaac eventually slipped off to the bathroom for a shower,leaving Verena alone with her thoughts.



She sat at the desk, barely moving,the glow from her laptop casting shadows across her face. Isaac's earlier words kept looping in her mind, a jumble of doubts and half-formed suspicions making it impossible to focus.



Giving up, Verena shut her laptop softly, rose to her feet, and shuffled over to the window.



Her lips pressed into a thin line as she folded her arms tighter across her chest. The city lights glittered before her, yet her eyes held no interest in the view.


Her mind kept circling back to the unsettling news she'd received earlier that day, refusing to let it go.


If the doctor she had recently hired wasn't the real  Simon after all, then who exactly was stepping into that role?



The question sparked a memory of her conversation with lvan.



If Ivan was right, then Carl had feelings for her during his time as a patient.


He'd disappeared soon after leaving the hospital,vanishing like smoke.


Was it possible he'd resurfaced with a new face and a new name? Could he have slipped back into her world just to get close to her again?


Maybe he knew she and Isaac had feelings for each other, and to stop them from being together,Carl used her grandmother to distract her while he went after Isaac himself.



All of it was nothing more than a swirling storm of guesses.



Sorting out whether Simon and Carl were the same person would take more than hunches-Verena knew she had to be patient, to watch and wait until the truth revealed itself.



Her thoughts kept circling back to her grandmother's death,which had happened not long after Carl left the hospital. Still, another puzzle nagged at her. Simon and Carl barely shared any resemblance...


With arms locked across her chest, Verena stared out into the night. There was no warmth left in her gaze;all that remained was a cold determination that refused to back down.



If Simon really was Carl, if he'd gone so far as to reinvent himself just to get close, then Verena knew he was the one behind her grandmother's death-and the reason Isaac had been hurt.



She promised herself she wouldn't let him escape justice when the truth finally surfaced.


While she stood at the window, her mind miles away,everything around her faded into the background.



Isaac came out of the bathroom, spotting her silhouette against the city lights. Quietly, herolled across the floor and stopped beside her.


He tilted his head up, studying her distant stare.Understanding flickered in his eyes, mingling with quiet affection.



Verena stayed fixed on the view, completely unaware that Isaac was so close.



With a gentle touch, he slipped his hand into hers. Her  fingers felt ice cold against his skin.



A small frown appeared on his face. "Your hands are like ice. You need to dress warmer."



He wrapped both of his hands around hers, letting his warmth seep into her.



The contact finally snapped Verena out of her reverie.She turned, searching lsaac's face for words she couldn't quite form.


He didn't pry, just smiled and said softly,"It's late.We should get some sleep."



His voice carried easily through the hush of the evening,warm and steady.



Fatigue tugged at her, and she managed a soft smile."Yeah,I think I need it."



When morning arrived, sunlight filled the dining room with a golden glow. Verena and Isaac sat at the table,breakfast nearly finished.


As Verena finished the last bite of her meal, Isaac slid a glass of warm milk in front of her. His voice was low and caring. "Don't forget your milk."



She took the glass, beaming. Her voice turned gentle as she replied, "Thanks, honey."
Every time she called him that, Isaac felt a spark inside.


No matter how many times he heard it, the word always seemed to mean more.



A gentle smile played on his lips as he watched Verena, his eyes filled with a softness reserved only for her.


She took a slow sip of milk, the creamy line left behind catching Isaac's attention.



He leaned in, his touch light as he brushed away the milk from the corner of her mouth with his thumb.



Verena's face lit up at his gesture, her lips curving into a bright,playful smile.


Isaac's heart skipped. There was a new sweetness in her that made him want to close the distance between them.



Unable to help himself, he reached for her chin,drawing her closer as he moved in for a kiss.



Before he could, Verena's hand pressed gently to his chest, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Not so fast -someone might be watching," she whispered, tilting her head toward Rhonda.



Rhonda, catching on, quietly disappeared into the  kitchen.



Isaac caught sight of the rosy flush on Verena's cheeks and paused, his grin softening into something even warmer.



It was rare to see her blush from shyness, and he found it charming every time.



He leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek,lingering for a heartbeat.


Their quiet moment was interrupted by the ring of Isaac's phone on the table.



Noticing Jacob's name flash on the screen,Isaac realized his assistant was already waiting outside.


He picked up, kept it short. "I'll be right there," he said,and ended the call.



Turning to Verena, he asked, "Want me to drop you off at the hospital?"


Verena offered a quick shake of her head. "I've got a few things to handle at home. You go on ahead."


He gave her a nod, grabbing his bag. "Okay. I'll see you later."



She waved her hand. "Have a great day, honey," she said with a cheerful smile. Once Isaac was gone, Verena reached for her phone and dialed Gavin.



The moment he picked up the call, she didn't waste a second. "Gavin, are you free right now? I need to talk to you about something important."


Gavin wasted no time replying, "Of course. I just left my place."



Verena reached the café about twenty minutes later and chose a small table by the window. After a short wait, she spotted Gavin coming through the door.



She raised her hand and called out, "Gavin, over here!"



He crossed the room, slid into the seat across from her, and offered a sheepish grin. "Sorry if I kept you waiting."



Verena just smiled and waved it off. "Don't worry,I barely sat down myself."



Gesturing to the cup in front of him, she added,"I got you a cappuccino."



A grateful smile spread across Gavin's face as he took a sip. "Thanks, Evelyn. So, what's on your mind? Who are we talking about today?"

 
Verena leaned back and took a sip of water, her gaze  thoughtful. "Do you remember Carl Aguilar?"


Gavin's brow furrowed in concentration, and then his eyes widened a bit. "You mean that guy you rescued during the Dragon Quarter riot in Clokron?"



"That's the one." Verena confirmed with a nod.



Back then, Gavin was serving as her intern.


Once she finished Carl's surgery, the responsibility of overseeing his rehabilitation training mostly fell to Gavin.



Curiosity sharpened Gavin's tone. "What's got you bringing up Carl all of a sudden?"



The memory of Verena's doubts over Shawna's death flashed through his mind, and he leaned in,voice lower. "Did he do something to you, Evelyn? Are you in danger?"


Verena didn't give him a straight answer. "There's nothing solid yet, Gavin. I'm still looking for proof."
###Chapter 234 It Really Was Him
Verena dropped her gaze, her fingertips drumming a soft rhythm on the tabletop while her thoughts wandered.



Bits and pieces about Carl drifted through her mind,but nothing ever settled into focus.



He was just another face in the steady stream of hospital patients-no detail strong enough to anchor him in her memory.



An idea sparked.Her head snapped up as she turned to Gavin. "Do you think there's any chance we could get our hands on the old security footage from when Carl was a patient in Clokron?"



She remembered that the hospital kept cameras in every room. If she could review those recordings,maybe she'd spot something-a gesture or habit that would reveal more than a name ever could.



People could change their faces, but the little things always gave them away.



Gavin blinked in surprise but recovered quickly. "It's been a long time, so I can't promise anything. Still, I'll  check the system. If there's anything left, I'll send it your way right away."



"Thanks, Gavin. I appreciate it," Verena replied,offering a grateful nod.







After she and Gavin went their separate ways, Verena made her way to the hospital.


She arranged for a quick meeting, and once it wrapped up, Gavin's call came through.



Verena answered with a warm greeting,"Hey, Gavin.How are things on your end?"


He sounded apologetic as he spoke slowly. "I just finished checking Carl's hospital records at Clokron hospital. Turns out, he was admitted about a year ago.The security footage there gets wiped after a year.Evelyn, I tried, but I can't get the video anymore."


Verena jumped in gently, her voice reassuring."Don't worry about it, Gavin. I know someone who's a pro at this kind of thing. For him, pulling up deleted footage is simple. You've already done a lot for me, so there's no need to feel bad. I just need to nail down when Carl was admitted."



That seemed to lift his mood, and he let out a small laugh. "You know, hearing you say that makes me  feel a lot better. I won't keep you any longer, then."


When their call ended, Verena pulled up lvan's number and gave him a ring.



Ivan answered and greeted casually,not sounding the least bit surprised, "What's up,Verena?"


She got straight to the point. "Where are you right now?"



He seemed to be playing a game, as she could hear him mutter something under his breath before replying, "I'm at my place. Planning to drop by, or is this just a check-in?"



Ivan never could stand staying in hotels for long, so he'd found himself an apartment on the outskirts of Shoildon instead.



The place gave him more space and peace of mind,away from prying eyes and interruptions.



"I need to talk to you in person about something important," said Verena.



The next second, the sound of a game ending blared in the background, and Ivan tossed his mouse aside in mock frustration. "Honestly, Verena, could you at least try to act like you care about my feelings?"


Verena couldn't help but laugh. "Cut it out. This is serious. Just send me your address and I'll come over."


"Okay. I'll send it over right away," said Ivan without missing a beat.


The moment she ended the call, Verena saw Ivan's message pop up with the address.



Before heading out, she dialed the internal line and left Julianna with a few clear instructions. After that,she grabbed her bag and made her way to the elevator.



Soon enough, she drove her car out from the underground parking lot and merged onto the main road.



About thirty minutes later, Verena pulled up at lvan's apartment building.


Once she stood at the door and reached for the bell,it swung open in front of her.


Suddenly, Ivan shot forward like a whirlwind and wrapped her in a tight hug.


Overflowing with excitement, he exclaimed, "Verena!I haven't seen you in days. I missed you so much."


Verena was caught off guard and patted his head lightly. "Let go already, or you're going to squish me." After hearing her, Ivan let go at once.


Taking off her jacket, she hung it neatly and followed him inside.



Without missing a beat, lvan presented a box of cookies as if he had conjured them from thin air. He was grinning from ear to ear. "Verena, look what I got.These cookies are amazing. Seriously! You have to try one."



He picked out one of the prettiest cookies and offered it to her. After giving it a try, Verena nodded and said, "You're right. These are actually really good."


Seeing her reaction, Ivan's eyes lit up with pride."|told you! If I like something, I know you'll like it too.Take a few boxes with you when you leave."



She found herself laughing, watching him with amusement.



Plenty of girls had a weakness for desserts, but lvan was honestly the only guy she knew who loved sweets this much.



She gave him a gentle reminder. "I didn't come all this way just to eat cookies, Ivan. I need your help with something important."



Ivan grinned and nodded. "I know, but we can talk  business while we snack. There's no reason to skip the cookies."



Leading the way,he guided Verena to his office.


Upon stepping inside, Verena felt as if she had wandered into a place filled with intrigue and advanced technology.


Instead of bright overhead lights, the room was shrouded in shadows, with only the blue glow from several monitors flickering across the space.



One wall was completely taken over by an enormous screen, displaying rows of complicated codes and strange symbols, making the entire place feel like it was hiding a hundred secrets.



A sleek black desk stood in the center, both simple and imposing in its design.


Arranged neatly across the surface were multiple powerful computers. Nearby, piles of technical books and documents were stacked, some open and crowded with colorful sticky notes and handwritten comments.



Taking it all in, Verena felt a rush of admiration and pride for him.



Ever since she had first met Ivan, she suspected he was destined to become a tech genius.

Most of the time, she only needed to ask him for information and never got a real look at where the magic happened.



Now, standing there, Verena realized just how much the once-shy, uncertain boy had changed.


Ivan had built a career that anyone would admire,and he had always been the one his friends turned to when problems needed solving.


Verena could not help herself. She reached over and ruffled his hair,letting out a soft laugh. "Look at you,Ivan.You really have grown up."



Despite the confident front he liked to put on, Ivan immediately looked away and pulled up his collar,trying to hide the color rising in his cheeks. He pretended to brush off her words. "I'm twenty now,Verena. Of course I'm not a kid anymore."



Verena had seen his shy side more times than she could count. She simply watched him, her smile deepening as she studied his face.


That made Ivan squirm even more, and after a moment he clicked his tongue. "Alright, alright. Didn't you come here for something else? Just say it. What do you need me to check?"



Verena dropped the teasing and answered bluntly." want to check the hospital's surveillance footage from when Carl was admitted to my hospital in Clokron last year. The system wiped the video automatically after twelve months."



Ivan nodded and almost started typing, but then paused and looked over his shoulder. "Hold on. Did you say Carl?"


Verena confirmed it right away. "That's right. I'm talking about Carl. Carl Aguilar."


For a second, Ivan's eyes grew wide with surprise."Wait a minute. So it really was him?"
###Chapter 235 Visitor



When Verena last sat down with Ivan, he had voiced his suspicions-he believed Carl had hidden intentions toward her when he was in the Clokron hospital.


That meeting had led Verena to investigate Carl's background and whereabouts.


Tonight, her focus shifted. What she wanted now was the restoration of the surveillance footage from Carl's hospital stay in Clokron.



The request required no further explanation.


Verena kept silent, her gaze locked on the computer monitor, sharp and unyielding, every line of her face carved with concentration.



One look at her expression was enough for lvan to know exactly what she expected of him.



Without another word, he plunged into his work.



His hands flew across the keyboard, striking the keys in a rhythm that filled the room like a relentless drumbeat.



The world outside seemed to fade away,leaving only the rapid clatter of typing and the low mechanical hum  of the machine.



Verena leaned forward slightly, her lips pressed together, her heartbeat quickening as she waited for the screen to reveal its secrets.



An hour crept by, until at last Ivan leaned back with a small nod-the surveillance had been recovered.



The blurred haze of static gave way to sharpened images, and Verena's eyes never wavered from the screen.


A file opened, a video running just past twenty minutes. Ivan gave a quiet sigh, a note of resignation in his tone. "The footage is old, the data fragmented.It takes time to process, so I can only restore it piece by piece. You'll have to watch it in sections as it loads."



Verena nodded in understanding,determination steady in her voice. "That's fine. As long as it comes back,I'll watch every second."



She pulled a chair closer and settled beside him, her eyes fixed on the screen.


In the hospital bed lay Carl, motionless, his long,disheveled hair falling across his face, strands nearly hiding his eyes.



His body looked wasted away, his face so sunken it carried the hollowness of a man decades older than  he was.



Sliding the timeline forward, Verena watched the footage and saw him lying in bed for hours, barely moving,a shell stripped of vitality.



Even through the grainy screen, there was something sinister about him, a heaviness that radiated like he was born to despise the world.


Simon, by contrast, was the complete opposite.


That man projected warmth, his presence bright,almost refined, every gesture polished with elegance that carried the air of quiet nobility.



Verena struggled to reconcile the two. How could this broken figure in the video be the same man she knew now as Dr. Moss?



It was as if two entirely separate people wore the same name.



How could anyone undergo such a drastic transformation?


"Wait, check this out!" said Ivan, who'd been watching closely. He pointed at a different section of the footage and leaned in with interest. "Is he actually yanking at his own hair?"

 
Verena followed the direction of his finger,narrowing her eyes.



Ivan dragged the timeline back a few seconds and eplayed the clip.


Onscreen,Carl lay blank-faced in the hospital bed,his expression an empty void.


A nurse arrived to change his bandages, something outine and simple, but Carl refused outright, his esistance firm and unyielding.



wShe spoke to him softly, trying to coax him into eFooperating. What happened next was completely uunexpected.


oon an instant, Carl exploded with fury. Without a hint ebf warning, he clutched at his own hair and began yanking it violently, turning the calm moment into something deeply unsettling.


Shaken by the sudden outburst, the nurse rushed to call for backup. Several male nurses came running to estrain him before things spiraled even further out of control.



As the video cut off, Ivan frowned and gave a slow )shake of his head. "What do you think? Is he dealing with some kind of rage problem, or does he have a nabit of hurting himself?"


 
'Verena replayed the clip from beginning to end,her es narrowing as she spoke in a low, steady tone. "It oks like he has no outlet for his emotions. When the essure builds too high, he forces it out by hurting nself."



an quickly loaded another piece of footage and inted at the screen. "And it isn't just once.He does is a lot."



erena shifted her gaze to watch closely.

7's face tightened as he shook his head. "I always nought he was unnerving... especially the way he ob id to look at you."

doiq
"a comment struck Verena sharply,and she suddenly ognized it as a crucial thread in uncovering Simon's ort eidentity. Determined, she clicked through to the next set of files.



One recording showed her performing a routine examination on Carl.



At the time,she had treated him like any other patient,paying no mind to what might have been going on behind his eyes.



Now, watching through the lens of the camera,she saw it clearly-Carl's gaze never left her, brimming with twisted layers of admiration, longing, and something darker.



A chill ran through her as she realized she had been oblivious to his fixation.



When the examination ended and she walked out of the ward,his stare grew hungrier,almost feral,tracking her until she vanished from sight.


His hand drifted back to his hair again, tugging violently, as though the sting of pain was his anchor to reality.



It felt like he was hurting himself on purpose, as if the pain was the only way he could prove to himself that everything around him was real and not just something imagined. The whole thing gave off an eerie, unsettling vibe that was hard to shake.



Ivan's fists clenched at his sides, his voice rising with fury. "That bastard gives me the creeps! How dare he look at you like that? If I had the chance, I'd beat him until he regretted it."



Verena felt her skin crawl at the memory of Carl's stare and the twisted smile that had lingered on his face.



Yet instead of shrinking back, she now had a clearer sense of her next step.



Turning to Ivan with a calm smile, she said,"When the time comes and I finally catch him, you'll have your chance to help me settle the score."



Ivan's eyes widened, his tone urgent. "Wait-are you saying you already have a lead? Do you really think you can corner Carl this soon?"


Verena leaned back into her chair, folding her arms,her expression sharp as her gaze locked on the glowing monitor.


Her chin lifted slightly, her lips curving with confidence. "Carl is closer than anyone thinks. I only need to push the right buttons, and he'll show himself."
No matter how carefully someone disguised their face or reinvented themselves, the patterns shaped from childhood always slipped through eventually.



And Simon...



It didn't matter what name he carried or what mask he wore. If he was the one who murdered her grandmother and dragged Isaac into ruin, then she would make sure he paid in full.







At the same time over at Bennett Group, Isaac rolled his chair out of the meeting room just as Jacob came up to him with a report. "Mr. Bennett, someone's here to see you."



"Who is it?" asked Isaac, his tone calm and unconcerned.


Jacob cleared his throat and answered with measured care,"It's Luis Sampson from Sampson Group."
###Chapter 236 Discussing A Collaboration
Jacob paused,and then continued, "Luis says he's here to talk business with you, Mr. Bennett."



Luis Sampson?.



The name caught Isaac's attention and made him wary.



He thought back to just yesterday when Verena mentioned Luis asking for her contact information.Now the man was here, pushing for some kind of partnership.


Isaac did not buy it for a second. There had to be more going on.



With a slight tilt of his chin, Isaac instructed firmly,"Bring him to my office. I want to see what he's after."


Jacob gave a nod. "Right away, sir."


A few minutes later, Luis walked into the office and immediately spotted Isaac behind his desk.



Isaac sat with perfect posture, his sharp suit only adding to his air of authority. There was something striking about his appearance-the straight nose, thick  lashes, and dark, thoughtful eyes.



Luis nearly laughed to himself. It was no wonder so many women in Shoildon had once set their sights on Isaac.



But those days were gone, swept away by life's changes.



After collecting himself, Luis put on a polite smile and bowed slightly. "Mr. Bennett, sorry for dropping in without warning."



Isaac's eyes lifted, catching Luis with a cold, searching look.



Though Luis was smiling, his gaze stayed frosty.



It was obvious to lsaac that Luis had something more in mind than just business.



Showing hostility toward someone polite never came easy. With that smile, Luis had given him no valid reason to shut the door on him.



Wearing a faint smile, lsaac motioned toward the cushioned chair across from him. "Mr. Sampson,think nothing of it. Please, make yourself comfortable."


Luis took the offer, settling into the chair with one leg crossed over the other. The polished shine of his designer shoes gleamed under the light. 
is leaned back in his chair, letting a quiet stillness attle over the office before either of them spoke.



long moment passed before hefinally addressed saac, voice steady and sure. "People might call this our first introduction, Mr. Bennett, but in reality,our oaths have already crossed in the world of finance and ousiness news."



He looked at Isaac with unwavering focus.


With a reserved response, Isaac acknowledged him,Ris face unreadable and calm.



Luis wasted no time circling the main issue. "I'll put aside the pleasantries. Let's talk business."


His fingers drummed softly on the arm of his chair as he began to outline his offer."There's a saying about Shoildon's clear skies and the wealth hidden beneath themn. My goal is to launch the most ambitious real estate development in this country and the neighboring areas, but I've run into a problem-your company holds several crucial properties I need. I'm willing to offer you a ten percent stake in the project if you agree to hand over those sites. It would be a win for us both."



The offer hovered in the air, and the office felt even quieter for a moment. Isaac met his proposal with a narrowed gaze, a spark of calculation lighting his features.


He let the silence linger, and then replied with deliberate calm, "It's an interesting proposal, Mr.Sampson, but we're both aware those properties outstrip the value of your entire plan. So, what you present as generous is actually asking too much.Bennett Group is not in the habit of striking uneven deals. We've always had our pick of partners."



Luis didn't flinch; he had expected Isaac's reaction. He wore a faint smile as he responded, "If the offer doesn't meet your expectations, Mr. Bennett, I'm open to making adjustments. But I do have one condition."


Isaac's brow lifted, recognizing immediately that the true motive lay within that one condition.



He gave Luis the space to speak his mind.



Luis added, "I want in on your company's next entertainment investment. Let me buy a stake and join the project. What do you think?"


Isaac gave a low, humorless laugh, his stare turning even more direct. "You really are a strategist, Mr.Sampson. First, you come in with a hefty demand,then you try to look generous while reaching for our most valuable venture. It's true that businesspeople chase profits, but we don't start trouble with those on  our level. You and I work in different spheres-opposite sides of the business map."



His words hung in the air, his eyes holding the trace of a smile that never touched his lips. His strong features remained utterly composed.


"And if my information's right, Mr. Sampson, you moved your sights overseas just last month. Why pivot to Shoildon now? Your sudden interest makes me wonder about your real intentions."


Once he was done speaking, Isaac stayed perfectly still, sitting upright in his wheelchair without the slightest shift in posture.


Even with Isaac's reputation for shrewd negotiations,Luis stillfound himself caught off guard by just how sharp the man was.



Throughout their exchange, Isaac cut straight to the heart of every issue, never missing an opportunity to press any advantage he found.


Though he never really thought he could corner lsaac easily,Luis realized just how tough his opponent could be.



A small, amused smirk played at Luis' lips,his fingers tapping even faster on the armrest.



As he watched Isaac's steady calm, a flash of genuine respect crossed Luis' face. It became obvious why Isaac, the eldest Bennett son, had earned such a strong name for himself so early on. The man thrived in this high-stakes world.



In that moment, Luis appreciated that he had never made the mistake of underestimating Isaac.



Regaining his composure, he lifted his chin and showed not a hint of discomfort after being called out.



"Mr. Bennett, you don't miss a thing," he remarked,giving a polite nod. "Of course, everyone in business is out for gain. But I'm not here to stir up conflict.What I want is a deal that benefits us both."



A deal that benefited them both?



Isaac's features never softened. His gaze stayed razor -sharp as he leaned back, his words ringing with certainty. "You must know, Mr. Sampson, Bennett Group already sits at the top here in Shoildon."



A thin smile flickered across lsaac's lips as he continued, "Why should I split ouradvantage or hand you the chance to profit? I don't know what you're really after, and our company only works with partners whose intentions are clear. We build our business on sincerity,not mystery."



His message needed no explanation. For Isaac, the conversation had reached its end.



Luis took the rejection in stride, simply watching Isaac in silence. Before either man could say another word,a sudden buzz from Isaac's phone broke the tension.



That incoming call brought an immediate change to Isaac's expression, softening the edge that had lingered moments before.



A glance at the screen caught Luis' attention, and he noticed the contact name: "My Darling Wife."


Isaac picked up right away, greeted by Verena's soft,melodic voice. "Honey, what are you up to?"



At the sound of her voice, all the tension melted from Isaac's face and a gentle smile appeared.He nearly forgot about his guest, only to catch himself at the last second.



He pressed the intercom and gave Jacob clear instructions. "Jacob,please see our visitor out."


The room was so still that Luis could clearly hear the woman's voice echoing from the call.


The sound gave him pause, a flicker of recognition crossing his mind. He couldn't shake the feeling he'd heard that voice before.



Brows knitting together, he searched his memory for  the connection.


Before he could work it out, Jacob appeared by his side,politely gesturing toward the door.


Snapped out of his thoughts, Luis rose to his feet and turned to lsaac. "Mr. Bennett, take some time to consider it. I believe you'l come around."


He followed Jacob out,leaving the office behind.
###Chapter 237 Surprise



After the elevator doors slid open, Luis found himself answering a call from his assistant.



Half-listening, he wandered through the lobby, the routine work updates barely registering. His mind kept circling back to the woman's voice he'd heard on Isaac's call earlier,leaving him oddly distracted.


Out of nowhere, someone brushed past, bumping his shoulder.



"My apologies!" Two pleasant voices overlapped-Luis ' magnetic voice and a gentle woman's.


After offering the courteous apology, he moved along and disconnected his phone.


A sudden realization hit him. That voice rang a bell.


Luis paused, turned to look behind him, but only caught a glimpse as the elevator doors closed. The woman's face slipped out of view before he could be sure.



Recognition struck. He was sure the voice belonged to the young woman who had given him a ride the day before. Now it seemed clear-the voice from lsaac's call matched the one he'd just heard in the lobby.


As he pieced it together, Luis' eyes widened in disbelief.



Could it be? Was she really Isaac's wife?



The thought left a trace of unease on his face,lines creasing his brow as he considered the implications.



If his plans ever put him at odds with Isaac, she might get caught in the crossfire as well.


Luis thought back to the one time he'd met her, and the memory still carried a quiet kind of ease that hadn't faded.



He liked her-not with any romantic longing, but in the way one appreciated calm in the middle of noise.



There was something about being near her that simply felt safe.



As that thought settled in, a sharp focus lit up his eyes.



Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone and placed a call to one of his men.


"Find out who Simon Moss has been talking to lately,"said Luis, his tone firm and deliberate. After relaying his orders, he ended the call and squinted thoughtfully at the closed elevator doors.



Finding his sister took priority before he tangled with Isaac.



If Simon had managed to track her down, Luis felt confident he would not be far behind in the search.



Whatever his motivations, Luis had no interest in making lsaac an enemy. Their exchange today had proven Isaac was not someone to take lightly.


He drew a steady breath, cast one last look behind,and walked out of Bennett Group.







Once inside the elevator, Verena heard Isaac's confused voice come through her phone. "What's this surprise about?" he asked.



A sly smile tugged at her lips as she teased, "I'm keeping it a secret for now. You'll see soon enough.Bye!"


She hung up before he could reply, ending the call on a playful note.



The elevator doors opened with a soft ding, signaling her arrival at the correct floor. Verena stepped into the bright hallway, her steps echoing as she made her way down the wide corridor.



Jacob spotted her right away and stood to greet her,calling out, "Mrs. Bennett, have you come to visitMr.Bennett? I'll let him know you're here."


She cut him off with an easy smile. "There's no need for that, Jacob. I'd rather go in on my own."


He nodded in agreement. "Of course, Mrs. Bennett."


With that,Verena smiled back and continued toward the office at the end of the hall.


When she reached the door, she gave it a soft, polite knock.



Inside, Isaac was buried in a stack of documents,his mind miles away from everything else.



When he heard the gentle tapping, he didn't bother to look up and simply called out, "Come in."



He then returned to his work without missing a beat.
###Chapter 238 Play A Little Game
Once she heard Isaac's answer, Verena opened the door and stepped inside.



The moment she entered, Isaac came into view,completely absorbed in his work.



He sat with his back straight and head lowered, giving all his attention to the paperwork spread across his desk. The set of his jaw and his serious expression made him look unapproachable.


Sunlight poured through the window, casting a warm glow over his sharp features.


His brow was knitted in concentration, lips pressed into a firm line, radiating a sense of unwavering resolve.



Verena stood quietly, her eyes resting on him with a mix of affection and admiration.



After a short pause, she crossed the room and stopped at the edge of his desk.



Isaac noticed movement in his peripheral vision and,assuming it was Jacob coming with an update, asked without looking up, "What is it?" The only reply was silence.



Isaac paused, a trace of impatience crossing his face,and spoke again. "I'm waiting for your answer."


Still, no one responded.


Confused and a little frustrated, Isaac finally lifted his head.



But when his eyes landed on Verena, all irritation faded and the world seemed to stop.



For a moment, Isaac could hardly believe she was really standing there, not just a voice on the phone.


His eyes lit up with happiness, shining as brightly as stars on a clear night, and Verena couldn't help but notice.



With warmth in his voice, lsaac asked, "What brings you here today?"


Verena answered with a radiant smile, "I thought it was my turn to pick up my husband for once. It wouldn't be fair if you always did the honors, would it?"



She stepped closer, looped her arms around his neck,and grinned. "Surprise! I hope you like it."


Her words came out light and cheerful, brightening the room like a chime in the breeze. A wave of happiness rushed through Isaac, his eyes lighting up with pure delight.


He cleared his throat, trying to sound casual. "Actually,I still have a bit of work left to finish."



Verena's smile softened as she replied in a low voice,"That's alright. I'll be right here until you're done."


She curled up close, wrapping her arms around his neck in a gentle, affectionate embrace.



The space between them disappeared, their breath mixing,bodies pressed together. Isaac's posture went rigid for a moment, though he tried to keep his attention on his paperwork. Still, his thoughts kept drifting back to her.



The soft brush of Verena's hair grazed his cheek,sending a faint tickle across his skin.



Her gentle scent floated all around him, drawing him in and making it impossible to focus. The feeling was both comforting and irresistible.



Minutes slipped by as lsaac lost himself in the moment, forgetting all about his documents, which sat untouched on the desk.



Noticing how easily he was distracted, Verena let out a playful laugh and said, "You've been staring at the  same page for ten minutes, Mr. Bennett. I think your productivity might need some work."


Color rushed to Isaac's ears, and he quickly flipped to the next page to hide his embarrassment.



Verena caught the flush on his face and grinned,delighted by the effect she had on him.



A playful spark lit up in her eyes as she said,"Why don't we play a little game?"


Isaac glanced up from his papers. "What kind of game do you have in mind?"



Her grin turned sly, making her look every bit the fox."What if we try something daring right here in your office?"



Her words caught lsaac completely off guard, and color immediately flooded his cheeks. His heart raced at the thought.


Verena let out a giggle, leaning in to whisper, "Relax,I'm only teasing you."


She started to pull away, but lsaac reached out, his grip firm around her wrist as if he couldn't let her go.


Before she could move, he drew her close and pressed a deep kiss to her lips. The world outside faded away, leaving only therush of warmth and the rapid beat of their hearts.


Opening her eyes, Verena was met with the burning intensity in Isaac's gaze, so different from his earlier gentle shyness.


Noticing her hesitation, Isaac pulled her even closer and kissed her with even more longing.



Verena let out a quiet gasp, and then eagerly responded, matching his energy.


She could feel his breath, hot and rapid, brushing against her skin and sending shivers across her body.


Isaac's hands trailed down, fingers quickly undoing each button of her blouse with practiced ease.



Just as the last one came undone, Verena snapped back, grabbing his hand to stop him.


Her cheeks turned pink as she quickly reminded him,"Don't forget,I'm pregnant.We really can'tright now..."


The moment she spoke, lsaac froze. A slow breath escaped him, and a longing settled in his eyes. He leaned into her, nuzzling her neck like a child looking for comfort. "What am I supposed to do? I'm suddenly not sure I even want kids anymore," he whispered. His hair was slightly tousled, brushing her skin, giving him a vulnerable and lovable look. Verena ran her hand through his hair, somewhere between laughter and disbelief. "Honestly, you make such a hilarious dad."
###Chapter 239 Using Verena As Leverage Against Simon
A lingering warmth filled the office,still echoing the intimacy they'd just shared.



Verena's face glowed with a blush as she slipped away from Isaac's embrace, her hair slightly mussed and lending her an easy, captivating charm.


She spoke softly. "You go ahead and finish your work.I'll be over here reading a magazine, so you won't be distracted."



Though Isaac's eyes lingered on her with clear longing,considering her pregnancy, he knew he couldn't go any further now.



He gave a gentle nod."Alright."


Verena crossed to the sofa,picked up a magazine,and flipped through the pages in a relaxed way.



Isaac turned back to his paperwork, but every so often he looked over at her, watching the golden afternoon light surround her with a gentle glow.



Being quietly waited for brought a warmth he hadn't expected. That thought made him smile to himself, eyes soft with affection as he gazed at Verena.



···


Later that evening, in one of Shoildon's upscale nightclubs, a hazy VIP room hummed with low lights and curling smoke.



Luis lounged on a plush leather sofa, dressed sharply in a black suit, exuding effortless ease as he leaned back.



His fingers tapped out a steady rhythm on the armrest while a heavyset, middle-aged man beside him launched into a desperate plea.



The man, all smiles and anxious bows, looked at Luis with hope and urgency. "Mr. Sampson, please. Only you have the power to help me."


His words dripped with both flattery and desperation,as if Luis was the only chance left.


Luis barely spared him a glance, his expression cold and uninterested, eyelids half-lowered in complete indifference.



He gently swirled his wine, watching the deep red shimmer beneath the soft light. His voice was ice-cold when he finally replied, "You want my help? What makes you think you deserve it?"


The man looked ready to plead further, but Luis ' phone buzzed before he could speak.



One glance at the screen, and Luis gestured to his security team.


Without wasting a second, they moved in and hauled the middle-aged man out with zero regard for formality.



Everyone else in the room got the message and slipped out in silence.


Left alone at last, Luis answered the call.


The voice on the line wasted no time with formalities."Mr. Sampson, our search revealed Simon recently returned from abroad and immediately took a job as a psychologist at Evelyn Model Hospital."


That caught Luis' interest. "Evelyn Model Hospital?What draws him to that place?"



A short pause, and then the report continued."It was considered the leading hospital in Clokron. The founder, Evelyn Rowe, gained fame for taking on tough surgeries at a young age and has built a reputation for medical breakthroughs. Most of the hospital's prestige is thanks to her. Powerful business leaders in Clokron hold her in high regard. The hospital only relocated to Akoitha not long ago.Since Simon studied medicine, it's possible he looks up to Evelyn. She's a big name in the industry, and admiration isn't out of the question."



Luis leaned back, quietly rubbing his chin as he mulled it over.



For all his experience reading people, Luis doubted someone as secretive and ruthless as Simon truly idolized anyone.



Wanting to get close to Evelyn had to mean Simon was chasing after something important.


The low light caught the glint in Luis' eyes as the thought struck him.



Was it possible Simon's real target was Evelyn herself?



With new suspicion, Luis asked, "Do you know what Evelyn looks like?"



His assistant answered right away, "You'll find plenty if you search 'Evelyn Rowe' online, sir. There are even clips of her speaking at press conferences."



Taking the advice, Luis hung up and looked up Evelyn's name. The results flooded in instantly, with article after article covering her story.



At the top, two videos stood out: one where Evelyn revealed her identity during the Fairclough family's press conference in Clokron, and the other showing her cutting the ribbon at her hospital's grand opening.


He clicked one of the videos at random,but what he saw made him freeze in surprise.



The woman on the screen was the same one who had given him a lift days before, and the same woman he'd seen at Isaac's office.



Luis muttered to himself, "Her again?"



It truly was a small world.



A moment later, a mysterious smile curled across his lips.


His eyes flicked to a search suggestion beneath the video: "Bennett Group CEO's Wife, Verena Wilis,Revealed as Dr. Evelyn Rowe,the Legendary Surgeon."



The name Verena caught his attention.



Luis narrowed his eyes, realizing the truth.



So she really was Isaac's wife. With that revelation, the puzzle pieces finally clicked into place.



Simon's complicated schemes to target lsaac had nothing to do with chasing power or wealth-they were all for this woman.



Verena. That was her name.



Luis let out a quiet, mocking laugh, his eyes growing cold as ice.



Simon had tried to use his sister to manipulate him into going against Bennett Group.


Now,Luis realized he could turn the tables, using Verena as leverage against Simon.


After all, Simon had it right-Luis was never one to back down when he set his sights on something.



With this new angle, Luis was certain he would find his sister soon.




...


Inside Evelyn Model Hospital, the hallways remained calm as nurses and doctors quietly carried out their tasks.



But that calm didn't last-within moments, a sudden noise tore through the stillness. A towering figure swept into the hospital, his black trench coat trailing behind him and his eyes sharp with intensity.



It was none other than Luis.



He walked right up to the nurses' station, hands buried in his pockets and chin tilted up, barely sparing them a glance. "I'm not feeling well. Go fetch your top doctor-Evelyn. I want her to see me."


The nurses glanced nervously at eachother,unsettled by his intimidating aura but still mindful of their responsibilities.


One nurse stepped forward, her voice hesitant. "Sir,you'll need to fill out a registration form first and wait your turn..."


Luis' patience snapped. "Stop wasting time. Just get her."



The nurses fumbled for a response, never having dealt with anyone quite as stubborn or striking as this man.



Relief swept through them as Julianna came into view.



Quickly, they flagged her down and filled her in on the situation. After listening, Julianna recognized his type right away.People like this didn't respond to force, and strog-arming him would only make things worse

###Chapter 240 Don't Lay A Hand On Her
Julianna faced Luis directly and asked in a steady tone,"Sir,are you looking for Evelyn?"



Luis cast her a fleeting glance, and then gave a curt nod. "That's exactly why I'm here."



Keeping her voice calm, Julianna explained with a professional smile, "She spends her days on urgent and complex cases. Seeing her right away may not be possible. How about this-I'll examine you first, and then we can decide if she's needed?"



Luis arched a brow, his impatience showing. "So patients here get ranked like numbers on a list? I already told you what I want. Let me make it clear again-I will only see Evelyn."


A breath slipped from Julianna's lips as she realized arguing further would lead nowhere. "Very well. I'll bring Evelyn to you."



She turned crisply on herheel and walked away.



The raised voices had drawn attention, and nearby staff exchanged glances as the tension spread through the halls. At the same time, Simon was focused on paperwork when he overheard a colleague muttering in confusion,"It's the strangest thing. There's a man outside insisting on Evelyn. He doesn't look sick at all, just full of attitude. Honestly, it feels like he came here to stir up trouble."



Those words made Simon freeze mid-action, his expression instantly hardening.


Without wasting a moment, he set his pen down and rose quickly. "Where is this man causing problems?"


The colleague, startled to be addressed, pointed toward the corridor. "By the nurses' desk, right over there."



With the location clear,Simon immediately strode off toward the nurses' station.



Meanwhile, Julianna had already gone to Verena's office.



Julianna entered with worry written across her face,her brows drawn tight. "Evelyn, there's a man outside demanding to see you. He refuses to listen to reason,and from what I can tell, he doesn't seem ill at all.He's making a scene, and I'm afraid the disturbance will affect other patients. I've run out of options, so l came straight to you." Verena calmly saved her work, closed her laptop,and rose to her feet. "Alright. Let's go. I'll handle it."


Together, they stepped out of the office and walked down the corridor.



As they passed through the hall, Verena caught the nurses whispering to one another in low, excited voices.


"Honestly, I didn't expect someone that good-looking to be so impossible to deal with."



"He may be a nuisance, but you can't deny he's easy on the eyes."



The murmurs reached Verena easily, and curiosity flickered within her.



When they reached the nurses' station and she finally saw the man in question, her steps faltered.



It was Luis.



One look at him told her there wasn't a trace of illness anywhere in his appearance.



Recalling how he had tried to get her contact information the last time they met, Verena fixed him with a sharp stare. "Mr. Sampson,why exactly are you here?" Luis gave a careless shrug, his tone light. "Isn't it obvious? I'm sick, and I came to see a doctor."



The mischievous gleam in his eyes said otherwise,and Verena knew instantly he was here for trouble, not treatment.



She straightened her shoulders, her tone cold yet measured."If you're truly unwell, the process is simple.Register at the front desk, follow the proper procedure, and the attending physician will handle your case. This hospital runs on rules, not personal whims. If you keep disrupting the order here,I'll have security escort you out immediately."



Luis' eyes stayed on Verena, dressed neatly in her white coat. Maybe it was the uniform itself that gave her such an air of steady composure.


Pulling the flicker of admiration from his gaze, he let a mocking smile curve his lips. "Do you honestly believe those guards could lay a hand on me?"


Verena already knew the truth. If he revealed who he really was, no one in the hospital would dare intervene.



She studied him, her expression sharp and knowing, as if she had already unraveled his thoughts.



"Mr. Sampson, a man like you wouldn't waste his time without reason," Verena said flatly. "You coming here  means you've already done your homework on me. So tell me, what do you want? Are you here to pick a fight?" Her voice carried no trace of fear, only a calm challenge.



Luis fixed his gaze on her face, delicate yet steady,and for a fleeting moment, something almost like reluctance stirred in him.



If it weren't for his sister, he wouldn't have wanted to stand on the opposite side of this woman.


Bracing himself, he let out a cold laugh. "And what if I am here to stand against you? If you don't want that,then you'll agree to my terms."


He advanced slowly, closing the space between them.


Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Simon hurrying toward them. Luis, unfazed, lifted his hand with deliberate intent, reaching as if to brush his fingers against Verena's face.



Before he could make contact, Simon lunged forward and threw a punch. Luis had already seen it coming and slipped aside with ease.



Simon's glare burned into him, carrying a warning sharp enough to cut. "I'm telling you now. Don't lay a hand on her."



In that moment, he looked every bit like a wolf  standing guard over its cubs.


Luis regarded Simon with a faint, almost mocking curve of his lips.


For all the fear simmering beneath Simon's exterior,he still dared to stare him down and even tried to throw a punch.



That single act told Luis everything he needed to know -Verena mattered to Simon far more than he had anticipated.



Satisfied with what he had uncovered, Luis no longer felt any need to remain.



He shifted his gaze back to Verena, his striking features softening into a deceptively polite smile."Evelyn, forgive the disturbance. Another time,perhaps,we'll talk properly."


Without giving her a chance to answer, he strode toward the elevator and disappeared from sight.


As the air settled, Julianna quickly ushered the curious staff away, reminding them to get back to their duties.



Simon rushed to Verena's side, his hands gripping her arms anxiously. "Evelyn, tell me you're alright. Did he hurt you? Did he lay a hand on you?"



Her eyes dropped briefly to his tight hold, as if  measuring something silently within herself.


With deliberate calm, she slipped her hands free and met his gaze. "I'm fine, Dr. Moss. You need to take a breath-you're far too wound up."


Though her tone was gentle, there was a quiet edge beneath it, almost like a test.


The word "wound up" landed hard, exposing the emotions Simon tried so hard to hide.



His composure cracked for just a moment, panic flickering across his face before he forced a thin smile."Naturally. We're colleagues, after all. Looking out for one another is only right, isn't it?"


Unease bled through his voice, his eyes betraying him even as he tried to smooth it over.



Verena studied him closely as she mulled over his reaction. When someone explained too much,it often meant they were hiding something.



After a quiet pause, she masked her suspicions with a faint smile. "You're correct, Dr. Moss. Colleagues should look after one another. I truly am fine, but thank you for worrying about me."



She ended the moment with grace, turning on her heel and walking away.
###Chapter 241 I'll Drag Your Sister Into The Grave Wit...
Beneath the low ceiling of Evelyn Model Hospital's underground garage, the air was heavy with silence.


Luis lounged against the sleek side of his car, one leg crossed over the other with careless elegance. A cigar rested between his fingers, while his other hand slipped into the pocket of his tailored trousers.



His gaze was lowered,half-lidded,as though he were weighing thoughts too dark to share.



After a pause, he lifted the cigar to his lips and drew in a slow breath, letting the smoke roll lazily from his mouth,twisting into the dim glow of the garage lights.



Every so often, a sly, unreadable smile curved across his face, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.



The rhythm of hurried footsteps suddenly broke the quiet,echoing off the concrete walls.


Luis' eyes snapped open, sharp and alert, settling on the figure rushing toward him. With the smallest twist of his fingers, he snuffed out the cigar.



Watching Simon close the distance, he allowed a  smirk to tug at his lips. "Didn't think you'd show up this quickly."



It meant that Verena indeed mattered even more to Simon than Luis had thought.



The words landed like a challenge, and Simon knew at once that Luis hadn't come by chance. His showing up here, demanding Evelyn's presence, was far too deliberate.



Luis had figured something out. He must have sensed the truth Simon tried so hard to bury-that Verena was not just a colleague to him.



But no matter how far Luis tried to push,Simon swore he'd never let Verena pay the price for their feud.



Rage surged through him, his eyes rimmed red as his voice broke into a roar. He looked like a cornered animal ready to fight.


"You stay the hell away from Verena!" he shouted,glaring at Luis with venom. "You think you can use her to play your games? Is that what this is about? Looking for your sister?"



Simon's jaw clenched tight, the words spilling from between his teeth like venom. "Take one more step toward her, and I'll make sure your sister never lives to see daylight again." The instant Simon mentioned his sister, the careless amusement in Luis' eyes vanished, replaced by a feral blaze that burned hot and merciless.



With a speed that gave Simon no chance to react,Luis' hand shot forward and clamped around his throat,squeezing so tightly it seemed Simon's windpipe might snap.



A heartbeat later, Simon's head was driven against the car window with brutal force, the sound of bone striking glass echoing again and again through the empty garage.


Luis' grip didn't falter; his strength was overwhelming,every movement filled with cold intent.



The window rattled under the repeated impact, its surface quivering as though it might splinter at any moment.



"Did you really think dragging my sister into this would frighten me?" Luis snapped, his narrowed eyes gleaming with lethal menace.


"You schemed to push me against Isaac because of Verena, didn't you? You love her so much you'll risk everything for her? Fine. Then maybe I'll end her life first-and watch whether you still dare touch my sister."



The venom in those words struck Simon like a blade,  cutting into the place he was most vulnerable.



His face turned a deep shade of red, his eyes bulging with panic and fury as the lack of oxygen stole his strength.



He scratched at Luis' iron grip with frantic desperation,forcing out a hoarse growl. "Isaac... won't ever let you hurt her."



As the words left his mouth, Simon was struck by a heavy sense of helplessness.



No matter if it was Luis or Isaac standing before him,he always seemed to be nothing more than a piece on their board, moved at their will.


Even when he thought he had their weakness in his grasp, they somehow managed to turn the situation around in an instant.



Noticing the distant look clouding Simon's face, Luis lifted his chin with quiet arrogance,his stare locking firmly on him as though to drive the point home."You said it yourself. I don't need to play fair when it comes to Isaac. If I decide Verena's life is mine to take,I can think of a hundred ways to end it. Go on, test me, and you'll find out just how far I'll go."


Simon's glare burned hotter than fire, his face twisted with rage, veins throbbing at his temples as though he were seconds away from exploding. The sight only seemed to thrill Luis further, a cruel spark lighting in his eyes.



"Hold on," he said suddenly, tilting his head with a mock look of thought. "Killing Verena might be too easy. If you're that obsessed with her... wouldn't it break you more if I took her for myself instead?"



The suggestion made Simon's eyes blaze with such fury it was as if he could set Luis alight on the spot.



His fingers clawed helplessly at the hand crushing his throat, each rasp of breath dragging out ina hoarse,broken sound that carried both desperation and hate.



His body shook as he forced the words out, his voice unsteady. "Go ahead... I dare you."


Luis' voice dropped to a chilling calm. "For my sister's sake, there isn't a line I wouldn't cross."


His fist shot forward in the next instant, smashing into Simon's face with brutal force. "Tell me now-where is she?"



The blow sent blood spilling from Simon's mouth,yet instead of defeat, a twisted laugh erupted from him,dark and bitter. "No wonder they call you king of the underworld. You strike hard,you strike smart-you know how to make people break. But you seem to forget something..." Lifting his head, he stared up with wild,unflinching eyes, a crooked smile pulling at his lips. "I'm insane.I have nothing to lose. Weakness doesn't matter to a madman,because I'll always have a way to make you bleed. You think Verena can be your weapon against me? Think again."



Simon raised his chin defiantly, his voice dripping with venom. "If Verena dies, I'll drag your sister into the grave with her. And if you ever dare lay a hand on Verena, I'll unleash the filthiest scum on earth on your sister until she suffers worse than anything you can imagine."



Bang!



Luis' rage exploded like a gunshot, and before Simon could even draw his next breath, his fists came crashing down in a violent barrage.



Every strike was heavier than the last, each one powered by pure fury, slamming into Simon's stomach with bone-cracking force.



Simon coughed out a mouthful of blood.


And still, through the blood, a jagged laugh spiled from Simon's mouth. "Ha... ha... I've already won.None of you can stoop as low as I can. You cling to your sister's safety, but I've got nothing left to lose.If Verena is dragged through hell, then your sister will be  dragged right beside her-and I'll burn the both of us to ash."



The sound of his laughter scraped against the walls of the garage, cruel and jarring.


Luis' fists didn't stop, pummeling until Simon's face was twisted between agony and defiance.Even beaten down, Simon managed to spit out his venom."Mr.Sampson, stop lying to yourself. There's only one path if you want answers about your sister. Take my bargain,join me against Isaac, and keep your filthy hands away from Verena. If you don't, you'll never know peace,and neither will your sister."



Seizing him by the collar, Luis slammed him back against the car door, his eyes blazing with disgust as he hissed through clenched teeth.



"Crazy bastard."



Simon's words weren't empty bluffs-he would actually follow through with such twisted threats.



Luis' hand quivered at his side, his knuckles aching from the blows.



He couldn't risk it. No matter what it took, he wouldn't gamble with his sister's life.
###Chapter 242 The Perfect Moment To Test Simon
Luis stood in stillness, his eyes dark as a moonless night,fixed on Simon with a glacial intensity.



That stare carried such weight it felt like it could strip Simon bare, reaching into the very core of him.



When the tension grew unbearable, Luis finally spoke,his words cutting through the silence like shards of broken ice. "I'll move against Isaac if that's what you want. But hear me well-my sister remains unharmed.The moment I find she's been touched, I'll make sure you pay for it in ways you can't even imagine."



His fingers tightened once more around Simon's throat before he flung him aside, the impact sending Simon crashing to the ground.



The air itself seemed to vibrate with the raw violence radiating from Luis.



Lowering his gaze, he spared Simon one last look,filled with contempt, before stiding toward the waiting car.



The driver's door swung open, the engine roared to life, and in seconds the garage was filled with nothing  but the echo of tires screeching against the ground.



Simon remained sprawled on the ground, his body wracked with coughing fits as he clutched his bruised neck.



A twisted grin tugged at his lips,but beneath it lay the tremor of fear he couldn't quite conceal,sweat soaking through the back of his shirt.



It struck him then that he had completely stirred up Luis' anger.



Isaac and Luis were each powerful in their own right,and Simon knew the only path to victory was to set them against one another until one destroyed the other.



And that was his chance. If he played it right,he would come out on top.



Before Luis uncovered the whole truth, Simon planned to use him as a weapon to strike Isaac down.



Once Isaac was gone, Verena would finally belong to him.



The thought grew like wildfire, feeding his obsession and sending a rush of madness through his veins. In the aftermath of Luis' disturbance, Verena retreated to the lounge, her nerves too unsettled to return to her work.



She leaned against the pale wall, her lashes lowered,her face solemn and still.



The memory of Luis confronting her played over and over in her mind, refusing to fade. His towering stance,the sharp edge of his words... But for what reason?


He had caused a storm, yet left without so much as lifting a finger, like a shadow drifting through only to unsettle her.



The more she turned it over, the more puzzling it became.What exactly was he after?



Could it have been some petty retaliation because she had refused him her contact information before?



Impossible. A man like Luis Sampson wouldn't stoop to something so childish.



Her thoughts shifted, recalling another detail from earlier-the way Simon had rushed to her side.



He had grabbed her arms so firmly, his face stricken with panic, asking over and over if she had been harmed. That wasn't the behavior of a casual colleague offering polite concern.



The look in his eyes had carried years of buried affection, the sort of desperate protectiveness one reserved only for someone deeply cherished.



Her brow creased slightly as she pieced the fragments together.



After sitting with the thought, her mind cleared,and a sharper idea began to take shape.


Maybe this was the perfect moment to test Simon for herself.



If he truly was Carl, then everything,the panic,the protectiveness,would make perfect sense.



With resolve settling in, Verena rose and stepped outside.



Her white coat trailed lightly as she walked toward the psychology department, where the staff were immersed in charts and patient notes.



Her eyes scanned the busy office, but Simon was nowhere to be seen.



Just as she was about to inquire, a weary-looking doctor stretched and yawned before catching sight of  her.



At once, the doctor straightened, suppressing his yawn and preparing to greet her formally.



Waving him off quickly,Verena kept her voice low,unwilling to draw any attention. "No need to stop what you're doing. I just need to know-where did Dr.Moss go?"



The doctor gave a faint hum of acknowledgment,lazily lifting a hand toward the door at the far end of the hall. "He just headed into the archive room. Said he needed to look something over."


Verena inclined her head with a polite smile. "Got it.Thanks for letting me know."


Without another word, she turned and made her way down the corridor, her steps steady, the sterile light bouncing off the polished white walls.


The brightness of the hallway only deepened the chill in her eyes, eyes that now held none of the softness she had shown seconds earlier.



At the archive room, she pressed a hand to the door and nudged it open, greeted by the faint musty scent of aging paper.



Inside, the narrow room was crowded with shelves,each crammed with heavy files and thick medical  texts.



Many of the volumes had clearly been shipped in from Clokron.



Pale sunlight streamed through the slanted blinds,breaking into stripes of gold and shadow across the floor. Dust drifted lazily in the beams, some rising,some sinking, as though time itself had slowed.



By the shelves stood Simon, a thick psychology book resting in his hands, his entire focus buried in the words before him.



Verena leaned casually against the shelf opposite,arms folded, watching him with sharp interest.


The crisp white coat hung neatly over his frame,paired with tailored dark trousers. Gold-rimmed glasses rested on the bridge of his nose, and his short,well-kept hair revealed a broad, polished forehead above deep, self-assured eyes.



He stood like a man sculpted to draw attention, the kind of figure countless women would find impossible to ignore.



The Carl she remembered,disheveled and forgettable,had completely vanished. His har had once grown out in all directions, long bangs hanging over his eyes and hiding the shape of his face,leaving behind only a blurry, unremarkable impression. Now, even trying to picture that old version of him felt like trying to remember a shadow.



The transformation was so drastic, it was hard to believe they'd ever been the same person.



Verena's brows drew together as she examined him closely, searching for any signs of cosmetic alteration -but nothing stood out.



With questions still swirling in her mind, she pulled herself together, straightened her posture, and let out a deliberate cough to catch his attention, pretending the encounter was accidental. "Dr. Moss, what a surprise! Are you here looking through the archived files too?"



Her head angled slightly, the curve of her lips carrying the trace of a playful smile.


When Simon lifted his eyes and spotted her, surprise flickered across his face before it quickly gave way to a glimmer of happiness.



Had she really chosen to start a conversation with him first?



Could it mean that his outburst of concern earlier hadn't driven her away after all?


A rush of warmth filled his chest, though he buried it  swiftly, answering with steady composure, "Yes...quite the coincidence indeed."



Verena's smile deepened. "I noticed you as soon as l walked in. I thought about greeting you,but you were so focused on your book that I decided not to interrupt. You seem to take your work very seriously."


Her curious gaze lifted toward him, soft but probing.


The moment their eyes met, Simon felt himself falter.


Her stare was so clear, so luminous, it felt like light piercing straight through him.



It was the same look she'd once given him long ago -during the chaos of the Dragon Quarter riot, when her hand had reached for his like salvation descending from the heavens.



His heart hammered wildly in his chest, loud as a drum he couldn't silence.



Was she truly interested in him?



Did she actually want to know more about who he was?



The thought consumed him, filling him with a restless yearning for her to step into his world, to unravel the pieces of him he kept hidden. Drawn to her as if by gravity itself, Simon finally nodded, his lips curling into a gentle smile. "I first fell in love with studying psychology in high school."



The word "high school" lingered in the air.


Verena lowered her lashes, her voice quiet. "I see."
###Chapter 243 Almost Exposed
After a moment, Verena broke the silence, her voice soft but sincere. "I wanted to thank you again for helping me earlier."



Simon blinked, momentarily thrown off. It took him a second to recall the incident with Luis.



The memory of how he almost exposed his connections to Luis sent a faint pang through him,but he quickly masked it with a smile. "It's nothing. Friends and colleagues look out for each other, don't they?"



Verena stole a quick glance at him, but his calm expression betrayed no sign of trouble.


She had expected something more, some sign of discomfort, but he remained utterly calm.


Reaching for a book on the nearby shelf, Verena flipped it open, her fingers brushing the pages with an absent sort of grace.


Simon, content with the quiet, said nothing more either.



The silence in the archive room was broken only by  the soft rustling of pages, making the stillness even more noticeable.



His gaze drifted back to her.



She was standing with her head slightly bowed,her hair tied neatly, fingers delicately turning each page as if lost in thought.


The sunlight filtered in through the window, bathing her in a warm glow. Her long lashes cast faint shadows under her eyes, and the pale pink of her lips almost beckoned him closer. Her skin seemed to shimmer,glowing softly in thelight.


Simon's breath quickened, and his heart thudded loudly,echoing in his chest.



There she was, the woman he had dreamed about for so long,standing just feet away.


An intense,unspoken longing burned in his eyes.


He wanted to hold her, to let the emotions he had buried deep inside burst free.


With each passing thought, his hatred for lsaac deepened.


Isaac had taken what should have been his.



Isaac was the one who had claimed the life, the love,  that was rightfully his.



Why did Isaac always get to take what he wanted with such ease, while Simon was left in the shadows,struggling for a chance?



Isaac.



The solution was simple in Simon's mind: eliminate Isaac,and Verena would be his.



The stillness lingered between them before Verena's casual voice broke through. "How old are you, by the way?"



Her question cut through Simon's swirling thoughts,pulling him back to reality.



He turned to face her, his gaze faltering just for a moment before he answered, his voice steady,"Twenty-six."



A flicker of surprise crossed Verena's face. "So young?
Dr. Moss, you've already achieved so much at your age.Your girlfriend must be amazing as well."


For a brief moment, Simon's eyes dulled, and he shook his head. "I don't have a girlfriend."


Verena leaned forward slightly, her curiosity piqued."Oh? Haven't met anyone who caught your eye?" Simon stared at her for a beat, his silence speaking volumes before he finally replied,"There is someone."



She tilted her head, intrigued. "What's she like?"


His gaze never wavered from hers. "She's beautiful.Brilliant. Kind-hearted."


Verena's eyes softened. "Does she feel the same way about you?"



A sharp ache twisted inside Simon. His grip tightened on the book in his hands, and the bitter sting of unspoken emotions surged.



If Isaac weren't standing in his way, Verena might have fallen in love with him by now.


The words slipped from his mouth through gritted teeth, laced with a hint of desperation. "She will.Eventually."


The words were as much a promise to himself as they were to Verena.



Verena sensed the underlying turmoil in his eyes.Before she could press further, Simon's voice cut through the silence. "I've gathered the materials,Evelyn.I'll head out now."



Without another word, he turned and left the room, leaving Verena standing in the quiet, her mind racing.


A small frown tugged at her lips. Simon was a master at hiding his feelings. This attempt to probe felt far too shallow.



It seemed she would need to take a bolder approach...
###Chapter 244 I've Got A Plan
Night had settled over Seraphina Villas, and the peaceful study was bathed in soft lighting.



At her desk, Verena wrapped up a few charts and files she had brought home from the hospital.


Emerging from the bathroom, Isaac glanced around,puzzled to find the bedroom empty. In the hallway, a servant carrying a glass of milk passed by.


Isaac intercepted her. Knowing Verena was working at the study, he said, relieving the servant of the glass,"Let me handle that. You can go rest."


The servant nodded and disappeared down the stairs.



Isaac opened the door and wheeled himself into the study. Verena looked up when she heard the door,her lips curving into a soft, welcoming smile.



"What brings you by?" she asked, voice warm.


Coming over, Isaac set the milk down with care,the warmth of the glass lingering on his palm.



He reached out, lightly touching the tip of her nose."You get so caught up in your work, I'm worried you'll forget your husband needs attention too," he teased. Verena laughed, standing and moving with ease to settle into his lap.



With both hands, she framed his face and pressed a kiss to his lips. "Forget you? Never. How could lignore my charming husband?"



The playful reply made Isaac's chest tighten with happiness, though he kept his tone earnest. "That's not all I'm worried about. You shouldn't be pushing yourself. Late nights aren't good for you, especially now."



Her eyes softened, and Verena nodded. "I know. It's nothing complicated tonight,just a little paperwork to get out of the way."


Even so, Isaac's concern didn't fade.Sensing his worry,she took his hand, guiding it to rest against her waist,her voice taking on a playful note. "My back feels a little stiff. Think you could give me a massage?"



The moment she asked, Isaac's expression shifted to gentle worry, and he started working careful circles against her lower back.



His hands were steady and gentle, as though she were something fragile and dear to him.



"I'm sorry you're feeling uncomfortable," Isaac whispered,his voice low. Verena's back pain carried a trace of truth, though she leaned on it more than necessary. Pregnancy often brought a dull ache to the lower spine, yet she was only at the beginning, and the strain had not grown sharp enough to trouble her deeply.



With a bright smile, she answered, "Thinking about our baby makes everything feel easy."



Isaac's hands worked skillfully, soothing every bit of tension from her lower back.



Verena nestled closer, letting herself melt into his warmth,listening to the steady thump of his heart, a look of peace settling over her features.



For a while, neither of them spoke, and Isaac started to think she had drifted off. Out of the blue, she said,"Something happened at the hospital today. Luis showed up and made a scene."



Luis' name hung in the air.



Isaac frowned. First, Luis tried to ask for Verena's number. Then, he pushed for a partnership with Bennett Group. And now, he stirred up trouble at her workplace.


At the thought, Isaac's demeanor shifted in an instant,his eyes turning cold and sharp. "I've clearly been far too patient with him," he muttered. Catching the tension in his voice, Verena gave his hand a gentle squeeze. "Let's not dwell on Luis. He didn't do anything serious, just barked at a couple of nurses.What caught my attention was how Simon reacted."



Curiosity flickered in Isaac's eyes. "What did he do?"


Turning the silver cufflink on his sleeve between her fingers, Verena replied, "It was exactly like you suspected. Simon acted really protective of me-he burst in as soon as he heard Luis was there,stood up to him, and even grabbed my arms to make sure I was all right. There was real worry in his eyes. If we were just coworkers, he wouldn't have cared that much.After that, I approached him and tried to probe, but he clammed up. I couldn't figure out if he's hiding something."



A thoughtful look came over lsaac as he continued to massage her waist, his movements never pausing.


"I think I've got a plan," she chimed in.


His voice was gentle when he asked, "What do you have in mind?"



It dawned on Verena that his hand was still tracing gentle circles on her back.



With a gentle touch, she guided his arms around her  waist and leaned in until her lips brushed against his ear.



Holding her close, Isaac pressed his chin softly to her shoulder, letting his breath trace along her neck,wrapping the moment in warmth.



She tipped her head, her words a soft whisper meant for him alone.



When he hesitated, Verena let out a playful laugh."What's this? Are you getting jealous?"



His cheeks flushed a shade deeper. He blinked, voice quiet but honest. "It wasn't the first time I got jealous,anyway."


That answer only made her grin wider. Isaac gave a sheepish cough before continuing,"I'll stay outside,and I'll ask Jacob to keep an eye out, too. If Simon tries anything, he'll regret ever setting foot near you."



Noticing how serious he'd become, Verena slipped her hand under his chin, lifting his face with a teasing smile. "Turns out Mr. Bennett can be pretty fierce when it comes to protecting his wife."


The look she gave him stopped him cold. For a heartbeat, he lost himself in the sparkle of her eyes and the curve of her lips, completely disarmed.


There was nothing but adoration in his gaze, his longing laid bare for her to see.



Then, without a word, Isaac cupped the back of her head and pulled her in for a deep, lingering kiss. Morning sunlight spilled into the penthouse suite.


Simon, barely awake, groaned and fumbled for his phone,half-heartedly checking his notifications.


A message from Verena suddenly appeared, jolting him fully awake.


He sat up straight, blinking hard as if to make sure he wasn't dreaming, and hurried to open her message.



Verena asked, "Dr. Moss, if you have time this morning,would you like to join me for breakfast at nine thirty?I'd like to talk with you about something personal."


All trace of sleep vanished. Simon read her invitation over and over, a wide grin breaking across his face, his heart pounding with excitement, eyes alight with anticipation.



Verena had actually sent the invitation herself.


She'd reached out, asking him to meet with her-just the two of them. It wasn't for work. No one else would be joining. This was a private meeting.



For someone who usually kept her distance, her invitation for a private meeting meant something,even if just for breakfast.


Simon couldn't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe,she cared about him more than she let on.



The idea took root in his mind, making his heart race the longer he considered it.


Hope lit a spark in Simon, pulling him from bed with a burst of energy. He hustled to the bathroom,splashed water on his face, and spent a long moment in front of the mirror, perfecting every strand of his hair.



His closet became a stage as he weighed one shirt against another, fussing over jackets and ties until he found the look that felt just right.


The prospect of having breakfast alone with Verena had him smiling like a schoolboy with a secret crush.



Half an hour later, Simon stood at the entrance of the restaurant, nerves fluttering in his stomach.



He stepped inside, caught sight of Verena waiting at a corner table, and hurried over. "Sorry if I kept you waiting," he said, his voice stumbling over itself. Verena's eyes swept over him as he drew near.



There was no missing the effort he put in.


A crisp black suit framed his shoulders, every seam and button in perfect place.



His hair looked freshly styled, glinting softly under the lights, and not a single lock dared to stray.


A gleaming watch rested on his wrist, and his shoes were so spotless, they looked brand new.



She realized she had never seen Simon put together with this much care before.
###Chapter 245 Found No Answers
With a subtle smile, Verena glanced away, her voice soft as she said, "I haven't been here for long."



Simon had just·settled into his seat when Verena spoke again. "Dr. Moss, to be honest, I invited you today to apologize for my husband's situation."



Her words caught Simon off guard. He froze for a moment, his fork suddenly still in his hand,the smile on his face faltering.



So it was about lsaac after all.



A wave of irritation washed over him, mixing with an undercurrent of jealousy.



What was it about that man that always seemed to dominate their conversations?



What made Isaac so special?



Why was she so obsessed with him?



His frustration grew as he realized how he'd missed the implication in Verena's message earlier. The personal matter... it was Isaac.


Though his mind was in chaos, Simon swiftly hid his feelings,managing a faint smile.



Nothing else mattered; just being able to see her was enough.


He believed that, no matter her intentions or her heart's loyalty to another man, he could still take his place in the end.


He adjusted his posture and cleared his throat, doing his best to keep his voice steady. "Mr. Bennett's case is complicated, but I'm confident I can help him.Evelyn, are you sure you don't want me to continue his treatment?"



Verena took a sip of her coffee,and then replied softly, "Dr. Moss, I truly appreciate your help, but l must honor my husband's wishes. If he's unwilling,I won't press him."



Each time she spoke of her husband with such affection,it gnawed at Simon, making the jealousy simmer just beneath the surface.



Simon's grip on the fork tightened, his knuckles whitening as the storm of emotions within him swirled,threatening to break free. Noticing his tension, Verena spoke calmly. "Dr. Moss,perhaps you don't understand. The bond my husband and I share goes beyond what most couples experience. Our love is so deep that we never impose on each other. Do you understand that, Dr.Moss?"


Her words, soft yet piercing,stirred a whirlwind inside Simon, each syllable fanning the flames of his frustration.



Without thinking, he raised his hand, fingers instinctively trying to pull at his hair to calm the rising tension within.



The moment Verena noticed it, she went on high alert.



It was something Carl did right before he lost control of his emotion.



But Simon's hand dropped instead to adjust his glasses,his face tight as he forced a smile.


"I see," he said stiffly, his voice tight. "Your relationship with Mr. Bennett seems truly special."


Verena's brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of suspicion crossing her expression.



Throughout their conversation,she had probed subtly but found no answers. She wondered if it was because Simon had no connection to Carl, or because he was  just exceptionally skilled at hiding it.


When their conversation wrapped up, so did the meal.


As they stepped outside the restaurant, Simon politely suggested, "Evelyn, how about I give you a ride?"


Shaking her head, Verena replied, "There's no need."


He ignored her refusal, opening the passenger door and offering her a hand to help her in.



As Verena was about to speak, a familiar voice cut in,"It seems you're having some trouble understanding,Dr. Moss. My wife has made herself perfectly clear,hasn't she?"



With a steady, authoritative tone, the voice allowed no space for doubt.


Turning around, Verena and Simon saw Jacob wheeling Isaac in their direction.



A twitch flickered at the corner of Simon's mouth as he clenched his fists by his sides.


A bright smile spread across Verena's face as she rushed toward Isaac. She kissed his cheek before turning to Simon. "I'm sorry, Dr. Moss. My husband's been waiting for quite some time."


 
She then addressed Isaac with a warmth that seemed  to fill the air. "Shall we go, darling?"


Her voice, laced with joy and affection, made Simon's stomach churn.



Within moments, Verena helped Isaac into the car.The engine roared to life, and they began to drive away, the sound of the car fading as it disappeared down the road.



Simon remained seated in his car, staring through the rearview mirror at the black car retreating into the distance. The image of Verena's kiss on Isaac's cheek replayed in his mind, fueling the flames of jealousy and anger that burned in his chest. His heart seemed to sink deeper with every passing second, drowning in bitterness.



Why did his feelings for her seem so insignificant to Verena, while Isaac, who offered nothing, had captured her entirely? It made no sense.



A sharp pang of pain flickered in Simon's eyes. He was overwhelmed with a loss he couldn't quite express, a bitterness too raw for words.



Frustration and confusion twisted within him.



His head dropped as he tugged at his hair, the intensity on his face bordering on frightening.



When he finally looked up, his fingers gripped strands  of broken hair, and his eyes were bloodshot, veins standing out against the skin of his face, making him look almost unrecognizable.
###Chapter 246 You Must Have Shared A Close Bond Wit...
Inside the car, Verena settled into the seat,letting out a soft sigh before shaking her head at Isaac. "Simon's too cautious," she murmured, her voice tinged with frustration. "I've' tried everything, but I still can't find any clear answers."


Isaac turned toward her, his hand gently resting on her shoulder as he spoke in a soothing tone. "Don't worry,we'll take our time. His carefulness means he's hiding something. But in the end, everyone slips, no matter how meticulous they are. Secrets always find their way out."



His words, warm and reassuring, eased some of Verena's tension, though the worry in her eyes lingered.



She found her gaze drifting outside the car window,her mind still restless.


The city skyline stretched in the distance, a sea of tall buildings cutting through the sky.


People hurried along the streets, while cars zoomed past in a blur. Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, each one racing back to the conversation with Simon,replaying every detail as though it was happening in real-time.



His gaze was sharp and unreadable, and his words were so carefully chosen that she found herself with no way to argue.



She was desperate to uncover who was behind Shawna's murder and Isaac's accident.


She knew she needed to act, and fast.


Isaac, unaware that his car crash had been no accident,assumed her current demeanor was because she regretted not finding Shawna's killer sooner.


He pulled her closer, his arm wrapping around her shoulders as he spoke softly. "Verena, trust me. We'll keep pushing. A breakthrough will come, and when it does, we'll make sure Shawna gets justice."



Verena met his gaze and nodded quietly. "We'll do it together."



Her thoughts were resolute. She was determined to uncover the truth, not only for her grandmother but for lsaac as well.



She repeated the promise to herself, her resolve growing stronger with each passing moment. At Seraphina Villas, Verena pulled out her phone and made a call.



When the call connected, she spoke politely. "Hello,Dr. Owen. This is VVerena. We had scheduled my husband's psychological treatment, but I understand there was a delay. Could you let me know when we can proceed with the treatment?"



Isaac's treatment had been scheduled to begin once Luther landed in Shoildon.



But the day after Luther's flight landed, he sent Verena a message explaining that urgent matters had come up, causing a delay in starting the treatment.


A week passed, and with no updates, Verena decided to take matters into her own hands and called Luther herself.



His voice greeted her apologetically. "I'm truly sorry,Mrs. Bennett. I had an emergency case that needed my attention, and that's why there's been a delay.I hope you can forgive me for the inconvenience."



With a soft smile, Verena spoke in a calm tone. "Dr.Owen, you're simply doing your job. As a doctor myself,I understand how important it is to prioritize." Luther let out a warm laugh. "You're incredibly understanding. Ivan has really made a wonderful friend in you."



Before Verena had a chance to respond, he added, "If it's convenient for you, I can set things up immediately and begin your husband's psychological treatment. How does that sound?"


Since Verena wasn't required at the hospital today and Isaac was working from home, she agreed, "That works perfectly."


Curious, she asked, "Dr. Owen, where would the treatment take place?"


His response was steady. "There's no need for a specific location. The treatment should happen somewhere the patient feels comfortable and safe.What matters most is that it's a place where he can let down his guard."



The idea of a comfortable and safe place lingered in Verena's mind.



After a moment, she realized that for lsaac, home would be the only place where he could truly relax and open up.



After hanging up, Verena knocked softly on Isaac's study door. He looked up from his paperwork, his gaze shifting to her. "Verena, what's going on?"



She walked over, gently took his hand, and knelt down beside him.



Looking up into his eyes, her voice soft, she said,"Isaac, I just spoke with Luther. I gave him our address,and he'll be here in an hour for your treatment."



For a brief moment, Isaac was taken aback,his grip on her hand tightening without thought.



Noticing his reaction, Verena softly asked, "Isaac, are you afraid?"



He shook his head quickly, his gaze filled with a mix of emotions. "I'm not afraid, just a little nervous.But with you here, I'm okay."



His eyes held a blend of uncertainty and emotion,speaking volumes without a single word.



Isaac felt a strong desire to begin the treatment,hoping to free himself from the weight of his internal struggles and finally stand before Verena as a man unburdened,ready to protect her from any harm.



But doubts clouded his mind. He worried he might fail,that he could never live up to her expectations. The fear of waiting endlessly without results, and the terror of facing the truth gnawed at him.



Noticing the storm of emotions in his eyes, Verena leaned in, gently pressing his hand against her cheek.



"Isaac," she said, her voice soft and soothing. "No matter what happens, I won't care. We're a team, and that bond won't ever change."



Her words, tender and reassuring, echoed in his heart,leaving a lasting ripple.


He lifted her face gently, his lips brushing against her forehead in a soft kiss. "Okay," he whispered. "I'll change and get ready."



An hour passed.



The servant's announcement echoed through the house. Luther had arrived.



Waiting by the living room entrance, Verena and Isaac watched as a burly, bearded man in his middle years entered.



He moved with purpose, his calm demeanor giving off an air of authority.



Verena extended her hand in greeting. "Dr. Owen."



With a warm smile, Luther took her hand and said,

"Mrs. Bennett, you're even more beautiful in person."



Verena returned the smile, her voice polite."Thank you,Dr.Owen."



She then gestured to Isaac. "This is my husband,Isaac Bennett."



Isaac met Luther's gaze, offering a small smile as he greeted. "Hello,Dr.Owen."



Luther raised an eyebrow in surprise, his admiration clear as he gave lsaac a thumbs-up. "Mr. Bennett,you're not just good-looking, but you're so young,too.I've heard you hold a big part of Shoildon's finances.You're impressive!"



Business news was something Luther regularly kept up with, so a successful figure like Isaac was always on his radar.



Meeting Isaac in person left Luther in awe of his impressive accomplishments at such a young age.


Isaac gave a modest nod, his smile soft. "Dr. Owen,you're too generous."



Luther laughed, shaking his head in good-natured disbelief. "Mr. Bennett, you're too humble."



He looked first at Verena, and then turned to lsaac."Mr. Bennett, are you ready to begin? Should we start  the treatment now?"



"Alright, Dr. Owen," Verena said with a nod. "Please follow me."



She gently wheeled Isaac toward the elevator,with Luther following closely behind.



They ascended to the second floor and made their way into the study.



Turning to Verena, Luther spoke. "I'm afraid I'll need you to step out for a moment, Mrs.Bennett."


Verena nodded in understanding, bending down to plant a kiss on Isaac's cheek before offering a smile."Believe in yourself."



She turned and walked out of the room without another word.



A soft click echoed as the door closed.


Isaac's eyes remained fixed on the door for a moment,unaware that Luther was quietly observing him.



"Mr.Bennett."



Isaac snapped out of his thoughts at the sound of Luther's voice, his gaze shifting toward him with curiosity. Luther held a porcelain cup in his hand, offering a friendly smile as he asked, "Would you care for a cup of coffee?"



He carried himself with ease, as though greeting an old friend.



Isaac gave a subtle nod, accepting the offer.


After pouring a cup of coffee, Luther handed it over and settled onto the sofa across from Isaac, smiling."I heard your wife has helped heal your legs, and there's no major issue now. With timne,I'm sure you'll make a full recovery."



Where Simon would have jumped into questions,Luther took a different approach. His voice was calm and confident, with no trace of interrogation, as though he were simply chatting with a friend.


Isaac gave a small nod, his voice quiet. "Yes, but I still can't stand."



Luther took a moment to blow on his coffee,his voice steady. "That's perfectly natural. Everyone has their own challenges, their own stories."



Isaac's gaze met his, a flicker of surprise passing through his eyes.



Luther didn't push for more? "Mr. Bennett, you must have shared a close bond with your father, am I right?" Luther asked, continuing the conversation.
###Chapter 247 He's Been Torturing Himself
Hearing Luther's words, Isaac felt a flicker of confusion. He furrowed his brow and asked, "How do you know that?"



Luther gave a slight tit of his head, his gaze shifting to the display rack beside the bookshelf. "It's simple," he said quietly. "There's your wedding photo with your wife, and another photo with your father. The way they're placed together speaks volumes about the bond you share."



Isaac followed Luther's line of sight to the photograph.


It had been taken long before his accident, during a casual outing with his father, captured by a professional photographer who walked by them.


Isaac and his father weren't ones for photos. This was the only one that seemed to pulse with life.



In the image, his father's hand rested on Isaac's shoulder, a broad grin lighting up his face.


Teenage Isaac appeared carefree, a soft smile lingering at the edges of his lips. A sliver of sunlight cut through the frame, giving the moment a serene glow.



Isaac's gaze softened as he took it all in.



He nodded slowly, a hint of pride weaving ino his voice. "Yeah, my dad and I, we got along great. To me,he's the best father anyone could ask for."



Noticing the shift in Isaac's expression and tone,Luther smiled warmly.


It was a good sign, seeing Isaac open up, even just a little.



Taking a slow sip of his coffee, Luther leaned in slightly and remarked in a calm, soothing tone,"I don't often come across father-son bonds like yours.Care to share any funny or memorable stories from your time together?"



Isaac blinked, falling into a quiet pause.



Luther wasn't surprised by his silence.



He didn't pressure Isaac to respond, nor did he fix his gaze on him. Instead, he poured himself another cup of coffee, savoring it slowly and complimenting its quality, as though the conversation was nothing more than a casual observation with no hidden intent. With his easygoing nature and unhurried way of speaking,Luther made it feel like lsaac wasn't being rushed into anything.


Slowly, Isaac relaxed, his guard slipping away.


He paused for a moment, his gaze lifting slowly, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips as memories surged back to him.



"My father was never like the traditional image of a dad. He wasn't cold or strict. He was always kind,with a smile for me, no matter what. He and my mother were opposites in so many ways. For him, family always came before anything else. When I was sick as a kid, my mom would check on me quickly and then go back to her work, leaving me with the servants.But not my dad." Isaac's eyes grew softer, his expression almost distant. "Whenever I was unwell,no matter what clients he had or how busy his day was,he'd leave everything behind. He'd rush home to sit with me, make sure I took my medicine, wipe the sweat from my forehead. He wouldn't go back to work until I was fully recovered."



He continued, "With my mother, there was no room for mistakes. But my father always told me that mistakes were part of life, and that as long as I could learn from them, it was all right. From childhood to adulthood,whatever I decided, he was always there-  supporting me, encouraging me. What meant the most to him was spending time with us. He never missed a birthday, no matter what. Even if work kept him late, he'd make sure to show up, just so he could be with us."



His voice was a little rough but held a warmth that was undeniable.



Luther gently intertwined his fingers on his lap,his eyes steady on lsaac's. "It sounds like your father really cared for you. Most fathers aren't like that, Mr.Bennett. They value independence over everything else. You're very lucky to have had such a devoted father."



Isaac let out a soft chuckle, nodding in agreement."Yes,my father is truly a wonderful man."



His words hung in the air for a moment, before his gaze dropped to his legs. His eyes began to shimmer,and the once-clear world around him blurred into a haze.



Luther, with his years of experience as a psychologist,recognized the shift instantly. He knew that calling upon cherished memories often led to an undercurrent of longing, and sometimes even guilt.



Shifting the conversation, Luther tossed out a lighthearted question. "Mr. Bennett, you strike me as a man of strong will. Your father, it seems, couldn't quite bring himself to discipline you. But your mother -was she more inclined to take on that role?"



Isaac chuckled, a brief, amused sound escaping him.


Luther,ever the master at reading the room, steered the conversation subtly. In their easy banter,he picked up on more of Isaac's state than he had expected.



When the conversation seemed to reach its natural end, Luther felt it was the right moment to take his leave. He set his cup down, stood with a fluid grace,and said warmly, "Mr. Bennett, it's been a pleasure.I must be off now. Thank you for your time today."



Isaac looked up at him, a moment of hesitation flickering in his eyes, clearly caught off guJard by how swiftly the session had come to a close.



Usually, a therapy session would stretch for at least an hour or two, but this one barely hit forty minutes.



More than that, there was no weight lifting off his shoulders, no sense of release like he was accustomed to after these meetings.



Instead, it felt like a casual chat-no pressure, no psychological burden.



Isaac's lips curved into a subtle smile as he turned to Luther. "Thank you, Dr. Owen. Let me show you out." 
Verena was lounging on the sofa in the living room,casually reading her newspaper.



When she heard the elevator doors slide open, she glanced up, lowering the paper as she saw lsaac and Luther come out.



"All done already?" she asked, raising an eyebrow in surprise. She hadn't even finished the newspaper.


Luther ran a hand over his beard, his smile widening as he nodded. "That's it for today's session. I've got some things to take care of,so I'll be heading out now."


Verena stood and walked over, offering him a polite smile. "Alright, let me show you out."


Together, Isaac and Verena accompanied Luther to the front gates, watching him climb into his car before it pulled away. Once the car disappeared from view,Verena turned her attention back to Isaac.



He appeared calm, more relaxed than he had been earlier.



Still, she couldn't shake the doubt lingering in her mind about the brevity of the session.



With a thoughtful look, she crouched slightly,her voice soft but inquisitive. "Isaac, what did you think of Dr.Owen?" Isaac glanced up, his eyes momentarily catching the light. A flicker of something passed through his gaze.


Thinking back to the fond memories he had shared of his father during their conversation, he replied with certainty, "Verena, you've found a really good psychologist."



His brief response brought a wave of relief to Verena.



She had been concerned that Isaac might resist the new psychologist, unsure of whether he would warm up to someone unfamiliar.



But now,hearing him speak so positively about Luther,it was clear that lsaac had accepted him, which was a good sign.


They made their way to the second floor. Isaac returned to his study to dive back into his work, while Verena headed to the bedroom.



Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window,she pulled out her phone and dialed Luther's number.



"Dr. Owen, it's Verena."



Luther wasn't caught off guard. It wasn't unusualfor family members to want a private conversation about a patient's progress, away from the patient's ears. Without wasting time, he got straight to the point."Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Bennett's condition may seem straightforward, but it's actually much more complex and difficult to treat."



Verena's heart dropped at his words. While she was aware of lsaac's struggles, hearing Luther's blunt assessment made the weight of the situation feel heavier.



Her brow furrowed as she waited, silently bracing for whatever he would say next.


After a brief pause, Luther's deep, steady voice broke the silence. "Mr. Bennett and his father had a bond that was even stronger than I had expected. But with such closeness came an overwhelming sense of guilt.It became clear to me during our talk that he feels responsible for his father's death. I could almost feel him asking himself why his father had to die in that car accident, instead of him. This constant self-blame weighs heavily on him, like a chain he can't escape,keeping him from confronting the truth. That's why,even after the surgery's success, he still struggles to walk normally." Luther let out a long sigh and added,"He's been torturing himself over this."



Verena's eyes welled up as she thought about Isaac's usual silence, the way he always carried such heavy burdens alone. A deep sorrow tightened in her chest She took a shaky breath, fighting back the tears, and spoke to Luther on the phone. "Dr. Owen, my husband's condition is far more complicated than it seems. I'll be depending on you moving forward."



Luther's voice was steady and reassuring. "It's my job.You can count on me."




···



The next day, inside the CEO's office of Bennett Group, Jacob stood holding a report, detailing the company's affairs from the last two days.



His words were laced with concern, his brows drawn together in frustration.



But the man across from him remained as calm as ever.



Isaac sat at his desk, one hand supporting his weary head,his fingers gently massaging his brow.



He stared blankly at the papers spread before him.



Once Jacob finished speaking, he looked at Isaac,whose posture was slightly slouched, making it hard to gauge his thoughts.


After a long, tense silence, it was clear that lsaac had no intention of speaking first. Jacob opened his mouth, and then hesitated, unsure how to proceed.


Finally, Isaac's voice cut through the stillness. "Say what's on your mind."


That simple prompt was all it took to release the tension. Jacob could no longer hold back his frustration.



"Mr. Bennett, Luis Sampson is completely out of line.He's blatantly disregarding business ethics!" Jacob blurted out, his voice rising with urgency.
###Chapter 248 You've Arrived Right On Time
"Our company's latest project was moving forward without a hitch, until Luis suddenly barged in, waving hefty sums to tempt away several of our key people.Two project leaders were even taken. The breach-of -contract clause was supposed to hold them in place,yet Luis willingly paid the penalties and dangled irresistible salaries. Naturally, who wouldn't waver?With their departure, the entire project has now ground to a halt."



Jacob's brows knitted tighter, frustration and disbelief churning together as he thought of those who had defected."How could they abandon ship so easily? Mr.Bennett, you've always treated them fairly."



He muttered under his breath, "Luis leaves no stone unturned.When straightforward methods fail,he shifts to underhand tactics."



Isaac listened in silence, his head inclined slightly. "It's nothing but business, never personal," he replied, eyes half-closed in a detached calm. "And he's made sure to act accordingly."



Jacob hesitated. Having worked by lsaac's side for  years,he knew his composure in storms of every kind.Yet even so, he hadn't expected such serenity in the face of a rival so aggressive.


Isaac looked almost aloof, as though viewng the struggle from the stands rather than the arena.



It was a state of mind that most seasoned businessmen would envy but seldom attain.



And once again, Jacob found himself admiring Isaac's poise.



He sighed, torn, and asked, "Mr. Bennett, what path shall we take now?"



Isaac pressed his lips together, offering no immediate answer.



What was Luis' true motive in all this?



Could it be Verena?



Isaac doubted it.



Luis had managed the Sampson family's affairs with meticulous care. He was not the sort of man to risk everything on impulse over a brief encounter with a married woman.



They had met only twice. That was hardly enough to stir such depth of feeling -certainly not enough to justify his recent moves.



Isaac lowered his gaze, lost in thought.



Luis' direct assault must be driven by something deeper.



Could he be carrying out another's orders?



And if so, who in Shoildon could wield enough influence to command Luis?



And for what cause?



Isaac slowly raised his eyelids and instructed,"Jacob,alert the HR department to launch immediate recruitment. We must fill the vacant roles before the project collapses entirely. Also, look into every person Luis has met since his arrival in Shoildon."



Jacob straightened."Understood, Mr. Bennett. I'll see to it at once."



With that,he turned and exited.


Isaac laced his fingers, thumb pressing lightly against his palm.


His gaze lingered on the closed door, but his thoughts circled the unseen chessboard Luis had set. Luis was pressing him to make the first move to reach out.



Isaac let out a quiet snort, and then pressed the desk intercom.



"Get in touch with the CEO of Sampson Group, Luis Sampson.Tell him the CEO of Bennett Group invites him to a meal."




...


At an upscale golf course in Shoildon, Luis stood in black-and-white sportswear, a baseball cap shading his face.



His stance was firm as he gripped the club,swinging it in one fluid motion at the waiting ball.


The strike rang out crisp and clean.


The ball sailed high, tracing a perfect arc before rolling neatly into the hole.


An attendant handed him a towel. Luis accepted it and dabbed casually at his face.



Just then, a man in a black suit approached and reported in a low tone, "Mr. Sampson, Isaac's secretary called. He invites you to a meal."



Luis' eyes revealed no surprise; his lips curved in a  faint, unhurried smile. "A meal with Mr. Bennett? How could I possibly decline? Tell them I'll be along shortly."


The man inclined his head."Yes,sir."



Luis let his gaze stretch over the endless green ahead,a glint of anticipation flickering quietly in his eyes.



Isaac.



He was genuinely curious to see what sort of ripple Isaac would reveal.



...


Inside a private suite of Shoildon's finest restaurant, a crystal chandelier shed dazzlinglight across the room.The table gleamed, laid with elegant tableware and unopened bottles of premium wine.



Isaac occupied the head seat, his dark eyes still as a hidden depth.



His hands rested easily on the arms of his wheelchair;his posture straight, exuding natural authority.


Jacob stood to one side, glancing at his watch.


Leaning closer, he asked, "Mr. Bennett, the hour has come. Shall we begin serving?"



Isaac parted his lips, but before words emerged, the  door opened softly.



Luis strolled in at a measured pace, trailed by a suited man.



He cast a brief look over the suite before fixing on Isaac.



A faint smile played on his lips."Mr. Bennett, I trust I'm not late." His voice pierced the hush of the room,tinged with sincerity.



Luis had a habit of arriving early, yet this time he arrived with perfect timing-solely to see how lsaac would react.



At his entrance, Jacob needed no further instruction.He signaled the waitstaff to bring in the dishes.



Isaac lifted his gaze slightly, eyebrows arching, and then shook his head, a subtle smile in his tone. "Not at all, Mr. Sampson. You've arrived right on time."


Their mouths curved in courtesy, but their eyes betrayed no warmth.


Luis took the seat opposite Isaac with ease, leaning back into his chair. He crossed his long legs, folded his arms, and wore a smile that hovered between charm and mockery. "Indeed. When my assistant told me you had invited me, I was flattered. I even rushed to shower and change before meeting you." His eyes locked on lsaac, hungry to catch even the faintest flicker of reaction.



But Isaac's calm held firm.



His lips carried a trace of amusement,even letting slip a quiet chuckle before Luis' words had settled.



Luis raised an eyebrow, a hint of inquiry glinting in his gaze.



Isaac reached for the crystal wine glass before him,the red within gleaming like a secret flame under the light. He swirled it lightly, watching the liquid ripple."Mr. Sampson, neither of us delights in pointless ceremony. I've no wish to play games at this table."


Luis narrowed his eyes, surprised by the direct thrust.


"I've heard of your recent extravagance-buying away my people. Tell me, is this your way of sounding the trumpet,declaring war on Bennett Group?"



Isaac lifted his gaze, pinning Luis with a look sharp enough to pierce.


Luis' tapping fingers froze at the question. His eyes lowered, shuttering his thoughts.



The silence thickened, taut as a bowstring on the verge of release. At length, Luis laced his fingers together, resting them with practiced ease on the table. A smile curved,faint but sly. "Mr. Bennett, you misjudge me. I merely spotted talents worth cultivating and offered them brighter prospects. That hardly amounts to a declaration of war."
###Chapter 249 What Was His Purpose

Despite Luis' words, the challenge in his eyes was plain to see.



Isaac let out a cold sneer. "Mr. Sampson, your polished phrases sound impressive, but I know my people and what they're capable of. You deliberately waved fat salaries in front of them. Do you think I'm oblivious to your intention?"



In the past, Luis and he had walked their paths without conflict.



Yet now, out of nowhere, Luis had chosen to set himself against him.



It was hard to believe there wasn't something hidden in the shadows.



Luis' smile slowly faded as he straightened in his chair,his gaze hardeninglike steel. "Mr. Bennett, since you prefer honesty, I'll be direct. The strong always rise to the top. I'm only gathering talent for my own cause. If you take that as a declaration of war... so be it."



His words landed with the weight of a loaded pistol,cocked and ready. The two men locked eyes, and silence thickened between them.



Isaac frowned, his gaze sharpening into a cold blade,pressing down with invisible force.



Luis lifted his chin, meeting that icy glare with composure, though a sinister edge lurked beneath his calm.



The meal wound down, leaving behind an unspoken clash that hung heavy in the air.


Luis picked up a napkin, dabbing at the corner of his lips. His sharp gaze slid to Isaac, a faint smile tugging at his mouth. "Mr. Bennett, thank you for the hospitality. This meal was entertaining. I wonder when fate will allow us to drink and talk again."



Isaac's lips curved ever so slightly as he replied,"Whenever the thought strikes you, I'll be ready,Mr.Sampson."



Each phrase carried meanings deeper than the surface.Luis chuckled, shook his head lightly, and rose."Then I'll take my leave."



Isaac inclined his head, his voice low and steady. "Take care."



He tilted his chin, eyes following Luis until the man  vanished beyond the private room door.



Only then did Isaac's expression harden.



Luis was clearly determined to oppose him to the bitter end.



But what gain could he possibly hope for by crossing the Bennett family?



What,in truth,was his purpose?



Outside the restaurant, the driver spotted Luis and quickly swung open the rear door.


Luis slipped inside, and the car rolled slowly down the road.



He leaned against the seat with a studied laziness,eyes closed, though his brows furrowed faintly.



His assistant hesitated before speaking. "Mr.Sampson,are you truly set on opposing Isaac? Challenging the Bennett family in Shoildon is like rowing against the tide-risky and unwise. Isaac's standing in the business world is formidable. You should think carefully."



Luis kept his eyes closed, his voice low, calm, almost dismissive. "It's only a smokescreen-to keep him guessing."



The assistant frowned, clearly/ puzzled. "Sir, I still  don't understand..."



Luis opened his eyes slowly, a fierce light flashing through the narrow gaze.



His tone turned cold. "Simon used my sister as leverage, forcing me into conflict with Isaac. But why would I drag both of us into ruin?"


He paused, fists tightening unconsciously, veins swelling on the backs of his hands. "Simon is vile.Once I find my sister, he will answer for it."



For now, he bowed to Simon's demands, if only to protect his sister's life-until he could secure her safety with his own hands.



...



At Bennett Group, the conference room doors swung open as Isaac wheeled himself out.


Jacob,waiting nearby,stepped forward with a file in hand, bowing slightly. "Mr. Bennett, the investigation into Luis has yielded results."



Isaac lifted his gaze, motioning him to go on.



Jacob cleared his throat and scanned the report."Since arriving in Shoildon, Luis has kept a low profile.Other than a few dinners with business leaders, there is little worth noting." He hesitated before adding, "However, the very day he arrived, he met with Simon Moss...."



Isaac's hands on the wheelchair froze, a mocking smile curling his lips.



So-that was the thread tying Luis' every move.



He saw no need for further probing. This alone was enough to prove there was an unseen bargain between Luis and Simon.



Back in his office, lsaac reached for the phone without delay, dialing Verena's number.


The moment the call connected, he spoke with urgency. "Verena, Jacob's investigation confirmed it -Luis and Simon are connected. Their arrival in Shoildon is far from coincidence. I suspect they've been in league all along. Simon is certainly not what he pretends to be. You must guard yourself at the hospital. Better still-dismiss him."



His voice was taut with worry, his brows drawn deep in concern.



The thought of such a threat near Verena was unbearable.



On the other end, Verena was briefly startled but quickly steadied herself. "Isaac, I understand your  fears. But to drive him away now would be like alarming the snake before striking. Don't worry, I'll deal with him in my own way. Besides, I still have things to uncover."



She wanted to confirm if Simon was in fact Carl, and if he had harmed her grandmother and Isaac.



Yet Isaac's unease lingered, his brow locked in a frown.



With the enemy lurking in shadows, Verena's safety was not something he could gamble with.



After a pause, he said firmly, "Then I'll arrange bodyguards at the hospital. Verena, don't refuse me this-it's vital you remain safe."



Hearing the anxiety in his voice, Verena softened with a smile. "Alright. I'll listen to you."


Just then, a knock echoed at Isaac's office door.



He looked up to see his secretary waiting, report in hand.



He was about to send her away, but Verena,having overheard, said gently, "It seems you're busy. I won't keep you. Go on with your work."



Isaac frowned faintly but gave in, lowering his voice."Very well. We'll talk later." Sensing his reluctance, Verena reassured him with a warm smile. "I'll come pick you up in three hours."


At those words, his eyes brightened, and a rare smile spread across his face.



When the call ended, Verena's expression grew solemn.



She pondered for a moment, and then searched her contacts and dialed an international number.


The call was answered swiftly, and Verena spoke clearly. "Hello, Dr. Joyce? This is Evelyn. I need your help with something. Are you available now?"
###Chapter 250 A Special Patient
A mature woman's voice came through the speaker."Of course, Evelyn. Say whatever's on your mind."


Verena replied; "I need your help to confirm something for me."



While she spoke, she clicked the mouse and forwarded Simon's photo to Astrid Joyce. "Could you take a look at this picture and tell me if you think he's had any cosmetic work done?"



The image was an official hospital ID photo, a standard shot required of every physician on staff.



Astrid, a renowned plastic surgeon whom Verena had met while abroad, received the photo on the other end.



A stretch of silence followed before Astrid finally answered, her tone apologetic, "I'm sorry, Evelyn.There's no way I can say for sure. Cosmetic procedures are advancing so quickly, and there are surgeons who do incredibly natural work. With just this photo, it's impossible to know if he's had anything done. The only way to give a proper opinion is to examine him in person and study the small details in his face."



That answer made Verena pause, her teeth gently pressing into her lower lip as a new idea occurred to her.



"Would you consider this, Astrid?" Verena continued."If I cover your expenses, could you meet him in person? I'll arrange for the two of you to be introduced. Your answer means a lot to me, and I hope you'll agree to help."



Astrid replied warmly. "Evelyn, I'll never forget that you once saved my husband's life. Of course, I'll do this for you."



Verena's voice softened with gratitude. "Thank you.I appreciate it."




···



Announcements echoed through the airport, flight information repeating in several languages, always in a gentle female voice.



Verena waited by the arrivals area in a tailored pair of black trousers and a light beige silk blouse.



Her blouse draped perfectly, the soft fabric hugging her frame and catching the light at the collarbone.The slightly open neckline revealed a touch of skin,while her subtle makeup highlighted her calm and
 poised demeanor.



People passing by couldn't help but glance her way,but Verena's focus stayed on the exit, her head held high.


A tall, blonde woman emerged and scanned the crowd.


Spotting Astrid, Verena walked over with a wave and a smile. "Astrid, I'm here."



Astrid's face lit upo as she hurried over, pulled Verena into a hug, and kissed her cheek. "Evelyn, it's been ages! You're even more beautiful now."


Verena's smile matched the warmth of the moment."Thanks, Astrid. I'm glad to have you here in my homeland."



Glancing at the busy terminal, Verena suggested, "It's a bit crowded. Let's talk more in the car."



The car glided down the road, scenery blurring past the windows.



Verena hadn't spoken yet when Astrid broke the silence. "Evelyn, I need some background on the man you want me to evaluate. What kind of work is he in?Details like that help me figure out how to approach him and whether there's been any cosmetic work done."
Verena took a moment to think before responding,"He works as a psychologist at my hospital. He keeps to himself most of the time and approaches everything with precision."



Astrid's brows knitted together. "A psychologist,huh?People like that usually have their guard up, which makes them tough to reach."


A quiet pause filled the car, but then Verena broke into a confident smile. "I believe I've got a plan."


Their eyes met. Verena's gaze shone with certainty,while Astrid's confusion quickly shifted into understanding.



A small smile tugged at Astrid's lips. "Evelyn, you have my word. I won't let you down."


Matching her energy, Verena gave her a bright grin before telling the driver, "Let's head back to the hospital."



At the Psychology Therapy Room of Evelyn Model Hospital, Simon gave a reassuring pat to his patient's shoulder, his tone gentle. "Stick to a steady routine after you leave. Early nights and mornings will help you rest and feel more balanced. If falling asleep is tough, don't push yourself too hard. Try unwinding with calming music or a warm bath." He added, "Reach out to people close to you. Don't lock yourself away. If anything's troubling you, share it with someone you trust."


The patient, eyes ringed with fatigue, bowed deeply."Thank you, Dr. Moss."


Simon watched him disappear through the door,a small smile on his face.



The moment the door closed behind his patient,Simon's entire demeanor shifted. The friendliness faded in an instant, replaced by an icy,almost emotionless look, as if everything before had been nothing more than a performance.



He took a sip of coffee and called out, his voice echoing in the quiet room, "Next,please."


The door creaked open at his invitation.



A tall woman with blonde hair and blue eyes stepped in, clutching at her sleeves, her pallor betraying obvious nerves.



Simon studied her for a second before offering a gentle smile. "Ma'am, can you tell me your name?"



Astrid quickly darted her gaze away, deliberately putting on a look of fear. "My name is Kelly Mills." Her voice was slightly raspy,as if she'd been crying.



Simon inclined his head and gestured toward a chair."Have a seat, please. Let's talk."



"Thank you," Astrid replied while sneaking glances at his face, examining every feature.



There was nothing she could confirm from the photo alone.



But now that she was seeing Simon in person,her perspective began to shift.
###Chapter 251 Discern Whether He Had Truly Undergone Plastic Surgery
Astrid had to concede-the cosmetic surgeon who worked on Simon was remarkably skilled. Yet, under closer scrutiny, faint traces of the scalpel still lingered.


As for exactly which parts had been altered, a more deliberate study would be required.


Steadying her nerves, Astrid seated herself across from him.



Simon poured a steaming cup of coffee,his movements unhurried, and slid it gently toward her.With a tone as soft as silk, he said, "Ms. Mills, if anything weighs heavily on your heart, you can share it with me. I'm certain I can be of help."


Astrid gave a slight nod, her fingers trembling as she  accepted the cup. "Thank you, doctor," she whispered.


Lowering her gaze, she took a careful sip, as though summoning courage drop by drop, and then slowly began, "I... my husband... he always beats me. I live each day like walking on thin ice, never knowing when he might lose his mind. Six months ago, he struck me so brutally I nearly died. That was when l finally divorced him."


Her eyes drifted away, as if she dared not stare into the abyss of those memories, her whole bearing that of a true victim.



"But ever since then-these six months-l've been haunted by nightmares. My mind feels worn thin, my temper frays for no reason. His vicious face rises again and again in my thoughts. He shadows me like a monster."



Astrid raised her eyes, fixing them on Simon, her lips quivering. "I'm terrified, doctor. So terrified..."


Simon's brow creased, but his voice remained calm,  almost soothing. "Don't be afraid. You're safe here.Drink some coffee. Let your shoulders rest. Tell me-what is the fear that grips you most? I will help you untangle it."


Astrid pressed her lower lip, hesitating, as if weighing her words carefully. In truth, her mind wNas working elsewhere-how to catch the subtletes of his expression without drawing suspicion, how to discern whether he had truly undergone plastic surgery while concealing her real motive.


From their exchange so far, Astrid could tell-Evelyn had not exaggerated. The man in front of her was every bit as cautious as she had warned. He was no easy nut to crack.


Fortunately, Astrid had crossed paths with many psychologists before; she knew how to hold her ground with Simon.


Her lips quivered as she muttered, "He became vicious after drinking. The house would be torn apart, furniture shattered. He struck me, kicked me,and once..."  Her voice faltered into silence. Simon, pen paused mid-note,lifted his head to look at her.


Astrid clutched the coffee cup tighter, her hands shaking as though seized by a chill. Her eyes lost focus, drifting into the darkness of some dreadful memory.Fear was written all over her face.


Simon leaned closer, his hand gentle on her shoulder."Ms. Mills, are you alright?"


Suddenly, as though jolted awake, Astrid recoiled sharply. The hot coffee spilled from the cup, scalding the back of her hand. She let out a muffled cry of pain.


In the next instant, panic overtook her. The cup tilted,and the remaining coffee splattered onto Simon's face and pristine white coat.


"Oh no! I'm sorry, doctor-I didn't mean to. I was just so frightened." Astrid leapt to her feet, panic and guilt rushing over her features. Repeating her apologies, she snatched a tissue from the table and leaned toward Simon.  Feigning nervous haste, she dabbed at the stains on his face. Yet her true focus lay on his jawline.


As she wiped, her fingertips brushed his jaw ever so lightly, tracing its shape, memorizing its feel.
###Chapter 252 Cooperation





Astrid's fingertips brushed lightly against Simon's jaw, and for a fleeting second, he froze as though turned to stone. Then, as if jolted by an unseen current, he shoved her away in haste.


The force he used was too much-Astrid staggered back, nearly losing her footing.


Only then did Simon realize his reaction had been far too severe. His head dipped, his deep voice carrying a shade of remorse. "I'm sorry, Ms. Mills. I lost my composure."


Astrid studied him with a discerning eye, and then shook her head slowly. "It's fine," she said, her tone even.







After leaving the hospital, Astrid descended into the underground parking lot and dialed Verena's number. When the call connected, she spoke with deliberate calm, her tone brimming with confidence. "Evelyn,from my experience and professional eye, I can say with certainty-Simon has undergone plastic surgery.The lines of his face, the symmetry of his features,they bear the marks of alteration that can't deceive my eyes."


Verena's eyes lit with sudden clarity. Her vague suspicions had just been confirmed.


Now, she could be nearly certain of one thing: Simon was Carl.


Verena steadied her racing thoughts, answering firmly, "Thank you, Astrid. I've already transferred the payment to your account. Please check."


Astrid smiled. "If you need my help again, don't hesitate to call."



A few pleasantries passed between them, and then the line went dead.



Verena lowered the phone, moving toward the floor- to-ceiling window of her office. Arms folded, brows drawn, she gazed into the city's distant haze.


She recalled Isaac's earlier warning-that Luis and Simon might share some hidden bargain.


Luis now had his sights set on Bennett Group,and his hand was clearly joined with Simon's.


But why would a man of Luis' stature stoop to help Simon?



Unless... Simon possessed something against him.Or Luis carried a weakness Simon had seized.



That would explain why Luis, proud as he was, found himself·bound to Simon's cause against Bennett Group.



Verena's eyes narrowed. The knot to this puzzle seemed tied to Luis.



With that thought, she turned back to her desk, lifted her phone, and began to type a message.


At the same time, Luis had just stepped out of a meeting. Glancing at his phone, he noticed a message from an unfamiliar number.


He was about to dismiss it outright when the opening line caught his eye.


He opened it and read the simple text. "Mr.Sampson, this is Verena. If convenient, let's meet."


His brow arched in surprise. Verena, taking the initiative? That was a twvist he hadn't expected.


But the surprise didn't last long. A faint smile curved his lips. With long fingers, he typed a single word."Okay."







Their meeting was set at an upscale coffee shop in the heart of the city.


Inside, warm light spilled softly, mingling with the faint aroma of roasted coffee and refined dishes,wrapping the place in an inviting charm.


Verena sat by the window, her expression taut with seriousness.


Opposite her, a tall man lounged with practiced grace, legs crossed, his sharp gaze trained directly on her.


Luis' lips lifted into a faint, teasing smile. "Mrs.Bennett, after the incident at the hospital, I thought you'd want nothing more than to keep your distance.Who would've guessed you'd inyite me yourself?Truly, an unexpected pleasure."


With that, he adjusted his collar and dipped his head lightly. "I still owe you an apology for what happened that day."


Verena's brows knitted slightly. His polished manner struck her as nothing short of an act.


But she wasn't about to be charmed. Straightening,she spoke with cool firmness. "Mr. Sampson, you're no fool. You must know I didn't come here for apologies or pleasantries. Let's not dance around it.Tell me-what deal do you have with Simon?" Her eyes locked on his, sharp as a blade. "Did he promise you benefits, or is he holding something over you that forced you into recklessly opposing the Bennett family?"



Luis faltered for the briefest second. His smile lingered, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of unease.


He leaned back, folding his arms across his chest.


The truth was circling dangerously close.


Though his mind raced, outwardly he remained composed. "Are you investigating me?"


Her slender fingers drummed lightly against the table.





She tilted her chin, a faint laugh slipping out. "Isn't it only natural? To know both your own strength and your enemy's weakness-that is the surest way to win. Or tell me, Mr. Sampson, haven't you done the same while opposing my husband?"


Luis only shrugged, offering neither denial nor admission. Verena pressed on. "You're a businessman.Businessmen never strike without profit, nor do they stir trouble with the powerful without cause. You have no reason to pit yourself against my husband-unless someone asked you to."


She folded her arms, her gaze unwavering. "You met Simon almost immediately upon returning to Akoitha.Only after that did you move against us. That alone tells me Simon, not Isaac, is your true concern."


Luis' brow twitched as he lifted the coffee before him,taking a deliberate sip.


Inwardly, he sighed. She had piecedit all together with uncanny speed.


"Go on," he said quietly, lips curling faintly.


Verena tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her expression calm yet edged with steel.


"The first day you came to my hospital, you stirred up trouble, pretending to harass me. But the moment Simon showed up, your act vanished. A man like you has no shortage of female company. Clearly, your performance was nothing but a test of Simon's :reaction to me. Let me hazard a guess at your motives."


She leaned her temple against her fingertip, her tone measured. "First, Simon must hold something over you. Otherwise,with your influence, he couldn't dare corner you. Later, you had someone investigate him,discovered he was working at my hospital, and chose to exploit his Achilles' heel. That day, you saw Simon's concern for me-and so you ceased your antics and left. Surveillance showed he left soon after. 1 suspect the two of you struck some kind of deal then, didn't you?"


Her eyes shone clear and steady, pinning him in place.


Luis' expression shifted, surprise mingling with a grudging respect.


The woman before him-though outwardly uninvolved-saw through every layer of his plans.Remarkable. He had believed himself the one pulling strings,every move hidden. Yet she had unmasked the play with a single sweep of reason.


His so-called skirmishes with Isaac had been nothing but smoke. Simon was the true target, and Verena had unmasked it all.


Luis lowered his gaze, silently admiring her keen mind. Admiration, and something more, welled inside him.



Isaac, he thought, was fortunate indeed to have such a wife.


Looking back at her, his eyes glimmered with interest. "Impressive. Tell me-since you've unraveled so much, what's your purpose in calling this meeting? Surely not just to flaunt your wit?"


"Of course not." Her voice was cool, he lips set in a faint smile. "I want to know what kind of deal you struck with Simon, Mr. Sampson."


Luis' eyes sharpened, but Verena pressed on, her tone unwavering. "You're a clever man. You should weigh which partnership profits you more. If you tell me the truth of your arrangement with Simon,perhaps Isaac and I can work with you. Together, we can let Simon see precisely what he expects to see."


Her words struck Luis like ripples across still water.


He frowned slightly, an inner struggle flaring.


His sister was the one treasure he could never forsake. He would move heaven and earth to find her.



Yet Simon, that cunning wretch, kept her whereabouts locked tight.


Should he, then, consider cooperation with Isaac?


Luis' hand clenched around his cup, knuckles whitening with pressure.


One reckless move could doom his sister.


He felt ensnared in a vast, invisible net: the harder he fought, the tighter it bound him.


Simon was sly,Isaac formidable. But to remain passive before Simon was to walk into his trap. Perhaps it was better to seize the reins himself-and gamble.


Perhaps... perhaps cooperating with lsaac and Verena could be his way out.
###Chapter 253 How Is The Patient Inside
Luis steadied his thoughts, on the verge of agreeing to work with Verena.



Yet, before he could speak, he saw her lower her head without warning.


A flicker of doubt crossed his eyes as Verena's browS tightened and her hand instinctively pressed against her stomach.


The pain struck like a knife from within-sharp,relentless. Sweat sprang to her forehead in an instant, and her head spun as though weighed down by stone.


"Ah..." Verena gasped, a faint cry of agony escaping her lips. Her legs, suddenly drained of strength, gave way, and she slumped from the chair.


Though he had no clue what had befallen her, Luis acted without hesitation. He lunged forward,urgency burning through him, and caught Verena just before she struck the floor.



He shook her lightly, his voice trembling with alarm."Mrs. Bennett! What's happening?"


But her eyelids stayed shut. Her complexion had drained of all color, leaving her face ghostly pale, and she gave no answer.


Luis dared not delay another second. Gathering her in his arms, he rushed out the door.


Moments later, a black car tore through the streets,racing toward the nearest hospital.


At the hospital, Luis stood outside the emergency room, hands buried deep in his pockets, waiting as time stretched unbearably long.


After what felt like an eternity, the doctor finally appeared.


Luis stepped forward at once, his voice calm yet edged with strain. "Doctor, how is the patient inside?"


The doctor's brows drew tight, his eyes shadowed with reproach. After one glance at Luis, he said firmly, "Your wife is frail, but there's no need to panic.It's only low blood sugar. Still, as 'her husband, you've been careless. She's pregnant, and you should be taking far better care of her. If matters had turned grave, the consequences would have been severe.You must watch over her more closely in the days ahead."



The words stunned Luis. His composure faltered,and embarrassment flickered across his face. "You're mistaken. I'm not her husband."



The doctor blinked, momentarily caught off guard,and then cleared his throat and coughed to cover his slip. "Ah, I see... Forgive me for the misunderstanding."







Isaac arrived in haste the moment he received the hospital's call. Jacob wheeled him swiftly down the corridor, the chair's wheels scraping against the floor, their sound echoing through the hushed passage.


Sweat clung to Isaac's brow, whether from the rush or the dread gnawing at his chest.


Just then, voices drifted from the nurses' station-hushed, yet piercing as thunder to his ears.


"Did you hear? That young woman, Verena... she neglected her health, and she's lost the baby. Such a pity."


The words were soft, but to lsaac they detonated like a cruel thunderclap.


His heart stumbled in his chest, his breath caught and quickened.



He could no longer restrain himnself and cried out to Jacob,"Faster-push faster!"


Jacob gave a sharp nod and increased his pace.


At last, they reached the ward. The moment Isaac lifted his eyes, his gaze locked onto a figure he knew too well.


Luis?


He sat on a bench along the corridor, head bowed,features shadowed.


In an instant, Isaac's fury erupted, flaring hot as wildfire.



Luis Sampson!


It was him-without a doubt.



Anger surged so fiercely that Isaac's legs quivered of their own accord, straining as if they might rise in defiance of his weakness.



His fingers clawed at the wheelchair's armrests,knuckles blanching, veins standing out as though every ounce of strength had gathered there.


And then-his legs shifted, lifting ever so slightly, as if betraying their long helplessness.


Just as he was about to surge forward, the door  opened. Verena appeared.


Isaac froze, stunned. She stood there, one hand resting protectively over her stomach, a tender smnile softening her face. She looked perfectly well.


At that moment, relief struck him like a tide. It was as though he had been teetering on a cliff's edge, only to be pulled back at the final breath. The tension snapped from his body, leaving him to collapse heavily into the wheelchair once more.



"Verena..."


He whispered her name, his gaze shifting from rage to joy and finally to a deep, trembling relief-as if in the span of seconds, he had lived through death and returned to life.
###Chapter 254 Breaking The Deadlock





Verena had meant to exchange a few words with Luis. Yet the moment she stepped out of the hospital room, a faint murmur of Isaac's voice drifted to her ears.



At first, she thought it was a trick of her imagination.But when she turned her head, there he was in the flesh.



"Isaac, why are you here?" Her voice carried a trace of weakness, the kind that lingered after an IV.


Catching sight of her slightly pale face, Isaac felt his heart sink with fear. Concern gripped him so tightly it robbed him of words. At length, his voice emerged-rough, trembling. "The hospital called me as your emergency contact. When I rushed here, a nurse said a pregnant woman named Verena had miscarried. I thought it was you. My wNorld nearly collapsed. Thankfully..." His lashes quivered, his voice catching. "Thankfully, it wasn't you."


His hands clutched the wheelchair armrests as if they were his anchor, trying to mask his turmoil. But the redness in his eyes betrayed the tempest within.


He dared not even imagine what he would have done had the unfortunate pregnant woman been Verena.


For a heartbeat, Verena was stunned by the rawness of his tone. Looking closer, she saw the deep worry and strain etched in his reddened eyes.



She stepped forward, her own concern rising, and gently took his cold, sweat-dampened hand. In a soft voice, she reassured him, "I'm alright..The doctor said I only need to rest and take care of myself."


To steady him, Verena guided his hand to her abdomen.



Lowering her head, she let her gaze soften, tender eyes locking onto his. "The baby and I are both safe before you, aren't we? Isaac, you mustn't torment yourself with fear." Feeling the warmth beneath his palm, lsaac tightened his grip slightly on her abdomen. Slowly,the storm inside him began to ease.



He swallowed hard, words sticking in his throat.When he finally spoke, his voice was still hoarse with emotion. "Verena... I ask for nothing else. Your safety is all that matters."


With his free hand, he gently caressed her face,thumb tracing the delicate line of her cheek. His eyes brimmed with devotion.



Verena leaned into his touch, brushing her cheek against his palm. A soft smile curved her lips. "I understand. I'll take good care of myself. I won't let this happen again-nor let you worry so."



On the bench not far away, Luis sat quietly, observing the tender tableau.



His lips pressed into a thin line, an almost imperceptible flicker of discomfort at the open display of affection. After a pause, he cleared his throat, shattering the fragile hush, and walked toward Verena.


"Mrs. Bennett, about the collaboration you mentioned-I'll think it over and give you my answer tomorrow. Does that work?"



Verena nodded, her expression solemn. "This is something that deserves careful thought."


As she spoke, she remembered something, her eyes softening as she glanced at Luis. "And thank you for bringing me to the hospital."


Luis allowed himself a faint smile. "Merely doing what needed to be done."


With that, he cast a passing glance at Isaac, and then turned back to Verena. "I have business to attend to.I'll be taking my leave."


Without another word, he walked away, his figure shrinking down the corridor until it disappeared altogether.


Watching him go, lsaac's brows drew together,  confusion flickering in his eyes.


He turned back to Verena, his voice quiet. "Verena,what did he mean?"



Her lips pressed together as she weighed her words,and then she explained, "These past days, I've been thinking. Luis has no personal vendetta against you.It makes no sense for him to strike at you directly. A rational businessman never acts against his own interest-hurting you by sabotaging himself would be sheer folly."



She paused briefly, and then continued, "Which leaves only one explanation: he's being used by Simon. I suspect Simon holds something over him,forcing him into obedience. With that suspicion, I tested him today. From his reaction, it seemed he tacitly admitted as much. So I proposed a collaboration. If we join hands with him and deceive Simon, we can turn the tables and break this deadlock."



Isaac listened in silence, and then exhaled, as though a heavy burden had eased. He knew precisely what she intended.


He nodded lightly, pride flickering across his face as a smile tugged at his lips. "Verena, you never fail to astonish me."



Her answering smile shone like sunlight breaking through clouds.


From the corner of her eye, she noticed Jacob staring at lsaac, eyes wide as though beholding a miracle. His face was frozen in astonishment,mouth slightly agape.


Verena frowned in puzzlement, tilting her head."Jacob,what is it?"


It was as if he had been struck still. Only when Verena repeated herself did Jacob stir from his daze.


His body trembled faintly, and he raised a shaking hand,pointing directly at Isaac.


His voice quavered with disbelief and joy. "Mr.Bennett, you... you just stood up from the wheelchair." For an instant, Verena's mind went blank, stunned into stillness.



Then, like a spark catching fire, joy flared across her face, her smile widening as her eyes lit up. "Really?".


Jacob nodded fervently. "Yes! I saw it with my own eyes."


Isaac himself looked thunderstruck at the words.



His gaze dropped slowly to his legs-those lifeless limbs that had failed him for nearly a year.Astonishment and doubt warred in his eyes.


It was as though a man long trapped in darkness had suddenly glimpsed a shaft of light seeping through a crack in the stone, unsure if it was salvation or illusion.



Then memory struck: the moment he'd heard Verena might be in danger, his heart had nearly burst from its cage. Panic and worry had surged through him like a tidal wave.



And in that storm of emotion, he had wanted nothing more than to run to her-to shield her.


His body had responded on its own. He really had stood up.


It only lasted a fleeting moment, yet it filled him with courage,with the seed of hope.


Isaac's lips trembled as he lifted his gaze to Verena.Like a child seeking approval, his eyes glistened with longing. "Verena...I...I can stand ndw."
###Chapter 255 So Clingy





Isaac's voice came out rough, laced with a tremor he could not quite bury.


Hearing such good news, Verena too felt her heart overflow. Tears shimmered in her eyes as she bent low, her arms circling his neck, clihging to him as if afraid to let go.


With her cheek pressed to his shoulder, her voice quivered with the same unsteady warmth. "Isaac, I told you-what we've gone through will never be in vain."







Inside the car, lsaac pored over Verena's medical report as though missing a single line would be a sin too heavy to bear.


Verena gave a helpless little laugh. "It's fine.Everything checks out. You can breathe easy now. Since that's settled, I'll return to work."


At that, Isaac caught her hand firmly. "No. You're still not steady on your feet. You're not going to work today."


He immediately gave his order to Jacob. "Back to Seraphina Villas."


Jacob glanced over his shoulder, nodded, and replied with due respect, "Yes,Mr.Bennett."


Before Verena even gathered her wits, the car was already gliding toward Seraphina Villas.


She glanced down at their tightly entwined hands,and her lips lifted in a faint, tender curve.


She knew well-Isaac's worry was written all over his grip.


Truth be told, after the check-up, weariness was pressing down like a heavy cloak. So she didn't argue further,letting him lead her home without protest.

 
When the car came to a halt, Verena stepped out slowly, only to see Jacob helping Isaac down as well.


Startled, her eyes widened. "You rushed out of the office-don't you have pressing matters waiting?You're not going back?"


Indeed, a mountain of work awaited him. Yet beside Verena, all of it seemed pale and hollow. Isaac answered simply, his eyes brimming with devotion,"I'Il stay with you. Only then will I find peace."


Verena let out a soft laugh, half-teasing, "It's only been a few weeks-the baby hasn't even stirred yet.Isn't this too much fuss? Go handle your work. I only need a nap."



Isaac shook his head gently, his gaze warm. "Then..I'l stay until you fall asleep. Only after that will l leave."



His anxious insistence brought a radiant smnile to Verena's face. She stepped closer, erasing the distance until their breaths mingled in the narrow space between them. As she watched him tense, mischief flickered in her eyes. In a playful tone, she teased, "So clingy? What a pity! With a baby on the way, you can't do a thing..."


Her soft, lilting voice struck him straight to the core.Her eyes searched his face, clearly waiting for his reaction.



Sure enough, Isaac flushed crimson and ducked his head,utterly undone.



Watching him, Verena chuckled under her breath,clasped her hands behind her back, and strolled away.



When her footsteps faded, Isaac lifted his head slightly, said nothing, and quietly maneuvered his wheelchair to follow.



Back in the bedroom, Verena slipped into the bathroom. She splashed cold water onto her face,and then reached for her phone from the rack and dialed a number.



A moment later, the line connected. "Dr. Owen, hello. This is Verena."


Luther's deep voice sounded steady on the line."Mrs. Bennett, has there been a change in Mr.Bennett's condition?"
###Chapter 256 A New Lead





Verena replied, "That's it."


She then recounted to Luther everything that had unfolded.that day.


On the other end of the call, Luther adjusted his glasses,surprise and relief crossing his gaze.


He explained with gentle patience, "Congratulations,Mrs. Bennett. This is genuinely encouraging.After all,the human body bends easily to instinct, and when feelings run to the depths, their power is nothing short of astonishing. Think of it this way-when Mr.Bennett heard you had collapsed and believed you and the baby were in danger, his concern for you outweighed the shadow of his disability. At that decisive moment, the yearning to protect you took command-driving his body beyond limits he once thought carved in stone."


 
Luther paused, his voice taking on a note of expectation. "Mr. Bennett's feelings for you are nothing short of profound. This may well be the key to his full recovery."







Afternoon sunlight streamed gently through the sheer curtains, spilling across the bed like liquid gold.



Verena stirred awake, her thoughts slowly knitting themselves together. A glance around confirmed Isaac had already returned to the office.



The clock on the nightstand struck four.


She hadn't imagined she would sleep so long.


Just then, a gentle knock sounded. Rhonda entered,balancing a bowl of creamy mushroom soup.


"Mrs. Bennett, before leaving, Mr. Bennett asked me to make this for you. He said it's healthy, light, and especially good for you," Rhonda offered with a warm smile. Verena stilled for a moment, and then her lips softened into a smile.



Half-dreaming earlier, she had faintly felt Isaac's kisses graze her lips and forehead before he left.


Steadying herself, she thanked Rhonda and accepted the bowl with care.



She blew gently across the surface and took a bite.The savory flavor spread across her tongue; warmth unfurled in her stomach and quietly seeped into her chest.


Bite by bite, she ate until the bowl was empty.


Passing the empty bowl back, she watched as Rhonda silently accepted it and withdrew.



Verena rose, stretched, and walked toward the study.


Inside, soft lamplight spilled across the wooden desk.Her expression grew solemn as she sat dówn.


She moved the mouse, opened a browser, and typed swviftly. Her fingers flew across the keys. "Bennett Group Chairman and CEO car Accident Details."



At the time, every major media outlet had reported the Bennett family's accident. In theory, information should have been easy to find.



News articles, forum threads-everyone had once spoken of it.


Yet curiously, after the Bennett family's intervention,the timeline blurred. Photos from the crash site had vanished.



The truth had been buried deeper than expected.



Verena sifted through each report with care,unwilling to miss even a thread connected to Isaac's accident.



Minutes passed like sand through a glass, but nothing useful emerged.


She lifted her glass, sipped some water, and was about to rest when a nearly overlooked local report caught her attention. She clicked instantly. And there it was-a clear time and place.


Relief rushed through her veins. At last, something tangible.


But the hardest hurdle remained-finding surveillance footage.


Clearly, the Bennett family had pulled every string to hide it, determined to prevent the crash from feeding the tabloids.


Verena's brows drew together. She picked up her phone and dialed.



"Ivan, are you home right now?"


Ivan's voice came lightly. "Yeah, I'm home.What's up?"


She rubbed her temple. "I'm digging into something but I've hit a wall. I need your help. Hard to explain over the phone-I'll come over."


"Alright. I'll wait for you," Ivan agreed without hesitation.


Just as she ended the call, Rhonda's voice rose from downstairs. "Mr. Bennett, you're back."


Verena's movements stilled, emotions flashing in her eyes.


Isaac could not see the wreckage of that accident-not in his state.



Swiftly, she shut the computer and hurried back to the bedroom.



She exchanged her loungewear for a simple, neat outfit.



Stepping out of the closet, she saw lsaac entering the bedroom.


He sat in his wheelchair, his gaze sweeping over her attire. "Verena, are you heading out?"


She nodded. "Something urgent has come up. I may be back late."



Isaac's brows furrowed, worry flickering in his eyes. "It's already late. What's so urgent it can't wait until morning?"


Her lips pressed together. "It can't wait. I have to handle it now. Don't worry-I'll return soon."


Seeing her unwavering tone, Isaac said quietly, "Then I'll go with you."


Verena opened her mouth, but before words could form,his phone rang.



He glanced at the screen-Jacob.


Just as he moved to decline, Verena stopped him."Answer it. If Jacob's calling, it must be important."


Isaac hesitated. She leaned close, brushing a light kiss against his lips. With a teasing softness, she whispered, "Don't forget-you've got bodyguards trailing me. Nothing will happen. Trust me."


Reluctantly, Isaac nodded. "Fine. But be careful. Call me if anything comes up."


"I will," Verena promised. With that, she headed downstairs.


Once she was gone, Isaac answered Jacob's call."Speak."


"Mr. Bennett," Jacob reported, "there's been a new development."


Isaac had never believed Simon was merely who he appeared to be. From the moment he learned of Simon's connection to Luis, suspicion had taken root and never loosened its grip.


So he had kept the investigation alive.


"What is it?" Isaac's voice sank, steady yet sharp.


Jacob replied with respect, "The Simon working at your wife's hospitaI isn't the real one. The true Simon was devoted to charity. Raised in poverty in the rural backwater, he never forgot the children still left behind. He often sent them aid and support..."
###Chapter 257 She Went To See Him





"Once, the real Simon returned to the village where he'd grown up, intending to do a bit of charity work.Out of the blue, he fell ill and breathed his last in a shabby clinic."


Jacob paused before going on. "We traced every patient who passed through that clinic at that time and discovered one particularly suspicious man-Carl Aguilar. According to the doctor, Carl shared the same ward with Simon. They weren't strangers either; their roots tangled deep. They'd known each other since boyhood, even walked the same halls of elementary school."


On the other end, Jacob's fingers tapped swiftly."Mr. Bennett, I've compiled the full report, including Carl's background. Our people confirmed he. even turned up at Mrs. Bennett's hospital in Clokron. But the hospital's walls were sealed tight-confidentiality like an iron gate. We couldn't learn what he did inside. I've sent the file to your inbox. Please check it."


"Alright. Got it." Isaac ended the call, wheeled to his desk, and opened the newest email.


Scrolling down, several photos appeared, each one marked with the name Carl.


The moment his eyes landed on them, Isaac narrowed his gaze, body leaning forward as if distance itself could blur the truth.


In the image, Carl's long hair hung in filthy tangles, a nest beaten about by storm winds.


Dust clung to his bangs, hanging low, veiling most of his eyes.



Yet even through the cracks, a pair of vicious eyes gleamed like knives in the dark.


His face seemed to have crawled straight out of a gutter-skin hidden under layers of grime.


His lips were split and parched, like barren land fractured by drought.


To the eye, he looked ordinary, yet something about him unsettled like a shadow that refused to move.



Isaac frowned, confusion flickering like candlelight in his gaze.


That face...



Why did it strike him as familiar?


And along with the recognition came a sharp disgust that pierced without reason.







Meanwhile, Verena hurried to lvan's door, knocking hard,urgency written in her voice.


Ivan answered, surprise on his face. "That was quick..."


But before he could finish his words, Verena pulled him inside.



Ivan blinked, startled by her haste. "What's going on?"


Verena steadied herself, and then said, "Ivan, I tracked down the exact time and place of Isaac's crash, but every scrap of surveillance is gone. This is your battlefield. Help me recover it."


Halfway through a yawn, Ivan snapped awake, his eyes sharp. "You mean... you think the crash was no accident?"


Verena nodded solemnly. Ivan thumped his chest."Then leave it to me. I'll dig it out."


In the computer room, Ivan slid into his chair, the glow of the monitor throwing light over his angular features.



His fingers flew across the keyboard, streams of code spilling like rushing water down the screen.


Time slipped away-an hour vanished without a trace.





Verena sat nearby. When his hands finally slowed, his brows were drawn tight as knots. Softly,she asked, "How is it?"


Ivan exhaled heavily. "Harder than expected.Someone planted programs to wipe the footage clean. I've hit roadblocks. I'll need more time to crack through."



Verena quickly reassured him. "That's fine. Take the time you need."


Ivan suggested, "Why don't you head home? I'll call once it's done."



"At most, how long?" she pressed.



He straightened, pride ringing in his tone. "It's tough,sure. But who am l? Give me five or six hours, no more."



"Then I'll stay here," Verena replied firmly.


She couldn't leave. The thought that the footage might hold the truth about lsaac's crash had her blood running hot.


She needed answers. She needed the hand behind the curtain.



So she stayed.


Not wanting to weigh on Ivan, Verena rose."I'l wait on the side. Don't mind me."



She moved to the couch, phone in hand,though her thoughts were far away.


Every so often her eyes darted toward Ivan, nerves and anticipation twisting inside like tangled thread.


Ivan refocused, the clatter of keys echoing steadily through the quiet.


Time dripped by, drop after drop.


Sleep crept up on her. Her eyes closed, head tilting,and the phone slid from her loosened grip into the cushions.



At Seraphina Villas, lsaac sat at his desk. The paperwork was long finished, tossed aside like discarded notes.



His gaze lifted to the clock, and a frown cut across his face, unease gnawing at him.


So late...Why hadn't Verena returned?


He seized his phone and swiftly dialed the bodyguard assigned to Verena. "Where is she? Is she coming home?"


The guard outside lvan's place answered uneasily,"No, sir. Mrs. Bennett went inside with a young man wearing an ear stud. She hasn't come out...it's been over four hours."



Then he quickly added, "She called him lvan."


Ivan...


Isaac's grip tightened until his knuckles whitened.


His Adam's apple bobbed as his voice came out rough, like sandpaper dragged over stone. "Got it.Stay there. Protect her."


He hung up.


Lowering his gaze, his thick lashes cast faint shadows,veiling the storm of emotions swirling in his eyes.



Ivan.



She went to see him.



Isaac's chest clenched, every beat a thorn.


Bitterness spread, yet the memory of Verena's eyes came back to him-clear, steady, hiding nothing.


She had told him straight she had something to do,even allowed bodyguards to follow. No trace of deceit.



She had been nothing but honest. He ought to trust her.



But...



The knowledge that she'd been with her first love for hours still left jealousy gnawing at him.


He urged himself to trust Verena. Whatever she was doing, it must matter. Reason clawed at him,whispering sense. Yet emotion raged untamed-jealousy and unease flooding in like a tide that knew no shore.
###Chapter 258 | Want To Pick You Up
Isaac was afraid Verena and Ivan might mend the broken bridge between them, and even more afraid that in the end, he would lose her.


Two fears tugged at him from opposite ends, and with each heartbeat, the noose of panic drew tighter around his chest.



His phone trembled in his grip, Verena's number glowing like a lighthouse in the dark.


Time and again, his thumb hovered over the call button, yet every time it froze in midair.


At last, he chose to believe in her.


Verena would not deceive him. If she said it was something urgent, then surely it was.


All that remained for him was to wait-and wait patiently. But patience wore thin when the night grew long.


When the clock tolled two in the morning, Verena still had not returned.



Isaac rubbed his brow, resolve crumbling,and finally pressed call.


Meanwhile, Verena was curled on the couch, lost in slumber, when her phone shrilled through the silence, sharp and sudden.



She stirred, frowning, half-dreaming, and reached out blindly. Without glancing at the screen, she answered and said groggily, "Hello?"


Her voice-soft, husky with sleep-slid down the line and stopped Isaac cold.


His voice came low, searching. "Were you sleeping?"


The moment Verena realized it was lsaac, her lips curved into a drowsy smile. "Yeah, dozed off by accident."



The room was still, and Ivan had caught Isaac's voice through the receiver. His brow arched, and he turned toward Verena, muttering, "Maybe you should head back?"



Verena brushed it aside and asked instead, "Did you get it done?"


Ivan shook his head. He knew the urgency well, but some locks couldn't be broken in a short timne.


He had overestimated his own hands.



It was never going to be that simple.


On the other end, Isaac's breath faltered. A man's voice lingered near Verena.


They were together, in the same room.


Too close-close enough for lsaac to picture the narrow distance between them.



His grip on the phone tightened, knuckles bleaching white.



The calm mask he wore cracked, and beneath it bled panic, darkness, and jealousy. He swallowed hard, forcing his tone steady, though a tremor slipped through. "Verena, where are you? I'll come get you."


He needed to see her-only then could the gnawing unease find rest.



Verena glanced at the glowing clock on her phone-two a.m.



Had she really slept that long?



No wonder people said pregnant women were forever drowsy.


She didn't want Isaac coming out at such an hour."No need, go to bed. I'll come back on my own."


"Verena," Isaac cut her off, voice lower, firmer,carrying weight. "I want to pick you up."


She caught it-the strain beneath his words.


And she knew him too well.


So she yielded. "Alright. I'll send you the address." She hung up, typed the address, and then rose from the couch. "Ivan, it's late. Get some rest. I'll head back too. Thanks for tonight."


Her voice carried a thread of guilt-she had kept him up until the small hours.


Ivan stood, pretending offense. "Say that again, and I'll be angry."


He treated Verena like kin, and nothing irked him more than her distance.


His mock protest drew a laugh from her lips.


Ivan rubbed at his weary eyes. "Go on. I'll call the second I crack it."


She nodded and made her way to the door.


Ivan moved as though to walk her out, but she waved him off. "No need. Rest."


And with that, she opened the door and slipped into the night.
###Chapter 259 Let's Head Home Together
After leaving Ivan's place, Verena waited quietly at the corner.


Moments later, a polished black car eased its way in her direction.



The glow from the streetlights slid across its surface,casting a crisp, metallic shine over the sleek frame.Its refined shape hinted at quiet luxury, while the tinted glass shielded the interior from view, givingit an air of intrigue.



As soon as the car came to a stop, the driver got out with practiced ease. He walked straight to the rear passenger side and opened the door with careful precision.



Inside sat Isaac, who was in his wheelchair. With the driver's steady support, Isaac made his way out of the vehicle.



Beneath the soft glow of the streetlamp, Verena lifted her gaze to meet his. The wind caught her hair,sending a few wisps across her face, giving her an almost spellbinding grace.


The soft, yellow glow spilled through the street,casting everything in a hazy, welcoming warmth.


While en route, Isaac's mind had raced with worries about what he might find.


Yet, the second his gaze landed on Verena, his world seemed to quiet down. The pounding in his chest slowed, and the heavy thoughts that had followed him began to fade away.


He stopped for just a moment, and Verena rushed forward, wrapping her arms around him and burying her face in the curve of his neck.


Catching the moment, the driver quietly stepped away to give them privacy.


Isaac's embrace tightened, holding her as though he could never let go.


Still wanting more closeness, he leaned into her,taking in the familiar scent of her skin as if it could ease every trace of worry.


Noticing the tension he still carried, Verena gently rubbed his neck with her forehead and spoke softly,her voice light and comforting. "It's the small hours,yet you still came to pick me up? I feel so lucky.Thank you,sweetheart."



She reached up to give him a pair of delicate kisses on his cheek.



Isaac found it impossible to keep his guard up around her.His stern face relaxed into a gentle smile, though a faint crease lingered between his brows.



Locking eyes with Verena, his voice carried a firm edge. "It's already late. Whatever business you have can wait.What matters now is rest, especially with a child on the way. You're not in the best health, and just yesterday you swore you'd look after yourself.Yet here you are, running yourself ragged without  even planning to come home."



Worry and tenderness colored his voice, though a faint trace of jealousy lingered beneath it.


Verena had already picked up on it during their call earlier, even if he never voiced it directly.


She rubbed Isaac's back in a comforting rhythm and spoke with complete sincerity. "Isaac, I went to see Ivan because he's the best when it comes to technology. I needed his help with something complicated, and it was taking longer than I thought.While I waited, I dozed off on the sofa,and that's why I forgot to call you first. I'm sorry for putting you through that."


Her wordsrang true, just as they always did, and that honesty left Isaac unwilling to question Ivan's current place in her heart.


He felt some of his anxiety begin to melt away.


But he still lowered his voice to remind her. "Verena,you're my wife. Whenever you run into trouble, you  should come to me. I've got plenty of people on staff who can handle anything you need."


She hesitated for a second, sat up straighter, and met his eyes directly.



There were many problems she could have turned over to lsaac.


But for this one, her instincts told her lvan was the right person to trust.


She offered a gentle shake of her head. "I really appreciate it, love, but this time it isn't necessary.Everything will be taken care of soon."


He still seemed troubled, the crease between his brows refusing to leav/e,



Verena reached up and traced the lines away with her fingers, tilting her head with a reassuring smile."You don't need to worry, sweetheart. This was just a rare situation, and I swear I'll never come home this late again. I'll remember what you said and promise to look after myself.How does that sound?" Seeing her playful attempt to put him at ease, lsaac's spirits lifted.


At least he knew she was thinking of him.


He brought her hand to his lips for a gentle kiss."Alright, but only this once. The wind's picking up.Let's headhome together."


With a lighthearted grin, Verena let go of him and helped guide the wheelchair backtoward the car.
###Chapter 260 Have You Made Up Your Mind
Hours later, sunlight spilled gently across the room,filtering in through sheer curtains and casting everything in a soft, golden haze.


Verena remained fast asleep on the large bed.


Sitting close by, lsaac watched her with quiet warmth, his eyes lingering on every detail.


Her hair was a bit messy, spread across the pillow,and her lashes, long and curled, cast soft shadows on her cheeks. She breathed evenly, lips slightly parted, lost in a peaceful dream.


After a while, he leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.



Even half-asleep,Verena felt the brush of his lips and slowly blinked awake. Her voice was thick with sleep."What time is it?" Isaac checked the clock, answering in a low tone,"Just turned nine."


Still struggling to shake off the last bits of sleep,Verena rubbed her eyes, barely keeping them open.Noticing her drowsiness, Isaac brushed his fingers over her cheek and offered softly, "You got home in the wee hours. Why don't you rest a little longer?Take the day off if you need it."



But Verena shook her head, gathering her energy."really can't. There's work waiting for me at the hospital."



He knew how committed she was and could only sigh in resignation, a gentle smile curving his lips."Alright, just don't rush. Take your time getting ready.I'll let Rhonda know to prepare breakfast."


He turned his chair and rolled himself out of the room.



Just as Verena stretched and started to rise from bed, the phone on her nightstand rang sharply. She grabbed the phone, slid her finger across the screen, and lifted it to her ear, hner voice rough with sleep. "Hello? Who's calling?"


A deep male voice replied, "It's Luis. I've thought over everything we discussed yesterday. Let's meet up and talk things through."


She agreed without hesitation, "Just send me the place and I'll be there."


After exchanging a few more words, Verena hung up and headed to the bathroom to get ready.


Soon after, she joined Isaac downstairs for breakfast.


Once they finished eating, Isaac left for his company while Verena grabbed her bag and set out to meet Luis at their agreed spot.







Arriving early, Verena slipped into her seat at the restaurant. No sooner had she settled in than a waiter in crisp uniform approached, offering a polite bow and asking, "Ma'am, may I bring you something to drink?"



She returned his courtesy with a warm smile. "I'd love a glass of fresh orange juice."


With a quick nod of recognition, the waiter turned and made his way briskly to the service counter.


Moments later, he returned carrying a brilliant glass of juice, its color bright and inviting as he placed it in front of her.



Verena lifted the goblet and took a sip, savoring the sweet burst of citrus that danced across her tongue.



Close to twenty minutes passed before Luis stepped into the restaurant.



He immediately spotted Verena at their designated table, a flash of surprise and genuine pleasure lighting up his face as he made his way over.


As he slid into the chair across fromn her, Luis' eyes drifted to the half-finished orange juice in her hand before he checked his watch. "You know, Mrs. Bennett, there are still ten minutes before our meeting was supposed to start. I hurried over, thinking I'd arrive early, but you're already here.How am I supposed to impress you now?" he teased,a playful glint in his eye.


Setting her glass down, Verena offered a calm,steady smile. Her voice was all business. "This isn't a romantic outing, so you don't have to worry about formalities. Mr. Sampson, I'll be direct. Where do you stand on the partnership we talked about yesterday?Have you made up your mind?"


Her eyes met his without wavering, every bit of her posture radiating certainty and resolve.
###Chapter 261 Is It Somehow Shameful For A Man To Fall For A Woman
Luis eased back into his seat, his eyes fixed on Verena with a kind of silent admiration that needed no explanation.


There was something about the way she cut straight to the point. No games, no wasted time. That reminded him of himself and made him appreciate her even more.


A waiter approached, pausing beside their table with a respectful nod. "What would you like to drink,sir?"he asked.



Without missing a beat, Luis looked up and answered, "Americano. Thank you."


He turned his attention back to Verena, his gaze sharp and assessing.


"I spent some time thinking about what you  proposed yesterday, and I won't lie, it does have its appeal," remarked Luis, his brows drawing in ever so slightly. "Buut the truth is, Simon's holding the one thing he knows can hurt me. All I care about is making sure the person I'm trying to find stays safe.So, if you expect me to go along with you, tell me this. What exactly can you do to guarantee that person's safety?"


His fingers drummed a slow rhythm on the tabletop as he added, "And before you answer, just know Simon isn't the type to play by anyone else's rules.He acts on impulse and never considers the bigger picture."


Their conversation paused when the Americano arrived. After offering a quiet thank you, Luis picked up where he left off. "If Simon even suspects I'm not following his demands, he'll snap. He'd hurt the person I care about without hesitation. She means everything to me. Even the tiniest risk. isn't acceptable. If you really want me to help you, I need complete assurance that you can outmaneuver Simon.Otherwise, I can't take the chance." Luis' expression hardened as he thought about his sister, the person he cherished above all else. He couldn't allow even the smallest threat to touch her.



While Verena listened, her gaze drifted to the table.


That person meant everything to him...


That realization hit her hard, and she took a moment to gather her thoughts.



She met his eyes and replied, her voice steady and clear, "Mr. Sampson, since you're so observant, I'm sure you've already noticed Simon has feelings for me. The last time you stirred up trouble at my hospital, I could see you'd figured out how much influence I have over him. You can be sure I'm his weakness."



Luis listened and found himself caught off guard by her response.


He paused, and then let a small smile flicker across his face before shaking his head. "So you want to use yourself as leverage? That won't change  anything. I've already tried to threaten him with your safety. Simon isn't just unstable. If he thinks I'm winning, he'd rather take you down with him than let me get what I want. The man doesn't care about consequences, and he's already shown he'll hurt anyone close to you if it suits his purpose."



Verena met his gaze, calm and unflinching. "You're right about Simon. He doesn't think like everyone else. Typical strategies won't reach him. That's why I'm suggesting something different."


Luis looked puzzled, unsure of what she meant.Verena added, "He feels something for me, and that gives us the perfect opening. I don't need you to pressure him or throw around threats. All I have to do is offer a little kindness, just enough to cloud his judgment. While he's still trying to figure out what's happening,I'll already have what I came for."


Her words rang with assurance, each one steady and clear, as if she'd already mapped out every possible outcome.


Luis laced his fingers together, studying Verena with  newfound respect. He had to admit, she was as sharp as she was poised. Her ability to pinpoint the weakness in any situation was remarkable.


For a second, he found himself admiring her more than he'd expected.


Pulling himself back to the conversation, he asked,"So you're planning to use yourself as bait to distract Simon? That way, you keep the person I'm trying to protect out of harm's way, and then we team up to handle him. Is that your plan?"


Verena reached for her glass, took a slow sip, and set it back on the table. With a confident smile, she replied, "Team up to handle Simon? That's generous.You give him too much credit. The truth is, I can handle him on my own. The only reason I haven't acted is because I'm still waiting for concrete proof.I refuse to act on suspicions alone and risk hurting the wrong person. But once I'm certain he's behind all this, I won't even need your help to bring him down.Honestly, the reason I offered to work with you isn't because I need an ally against Simon. It's because | want to make sure you won't be helping him against Isaac or me. I'm only interested in removing the chance of trouble down the line."



Verena spoke her mind freely, her tone carrying both conviction and careful thought.


Luis had gone out of his way to set up this meeting,a clear sign he was open to joining forces.



Someone like him didn't waste precious time unless he saw real value in a partnership.



She understood his hesitation too.



Simon held the upper hand by threatening someone Luis cared about. Of course he would be careful.


Still, Verena's strategy covered every angle. She exposed Simon's soft spot and outlined a plan that gave Luis exactly what he needed to feel reassured about his loved one's safety.



That level of insight made cooperation much more likely. As her words hung in the air, Luis folded his arms and studied her with renewed interest, taking in the intelligence and cool self-assurance that radiated from her.



Verena came across as sharp, composed, and surprisingly cunning.



A rare woman indeed.



With a slight tilt of his head, Luis leaned in closer and flashed a teasing smile. "I have to admit, I like women like you. Once all this trouble is behind us, maybe you should consider leaving Isaac for someone who can match him in brains and ambition. What do you say?"



The sudden change in subject caught Verena off guard for a split second. She lifted an eyebrow,unbothered, and replied, "You're interested in me?"



Her eyes stayed distant and unreadable.


Luis let a faint smile play on his lips as he slowly stirred the coffee in his mug, the silver spoon  sending quiet ripples through the dark brew.


Lifting his gaze, he met Verena's eyes and asked with a teasing tone, "Oh? Am I not allowed to? Is it somehow shameful for a man to fall for a woman?"
###Chapter 262 It Was Her





Luis gently set down the small spoon and leaned back in his chair, his eyes still fastened on Verena,as though waiting for her response-or perhaps simply studying how she would take his words.


Verena caught the playful glint beneath his gaze. Her face remained composed, her heart unruffled, like still water untouched by wind.


Her lips parted slightly, her voice cool and firm."It's not shameful for a man to fall for a woman. But knowing well that I am already married, and still nursing such thoughts, still speaking such words-that, Mr. Sampson, is truly shameful."


Luis faltered for a heartbeat, and then offered a smile that neither agreed nor denied.



Returning to the matter at hand, Verena said evenly "Enough circling around. Let's get straight to the heart of it. Who is it you're trying to protect? Can you finally tell me now?"


Luis did not delay further. He reached for the document folder resting on the nearby chair, the one containing detailed information about his sister.


But at that moment, a server passed by their table with a tray holding a steaming cup of coffee.


Whether the floor betrayed him with its slick<surface or his own haste did, his foot slipped. He lost balance, the tray tipped, and the cup spilled.


The scalding liquid splashed directly toward Verena,a small portion striking her leg.


"Ah!" A sharp gasp escaped her lips, her brows knitting instantly as pain seared her skin.


The server blanched. He set down the tray in a flurry,bowing deeply, words tumbling out in panic. "I'm terribly sorry! I truly am! It was my carelessness.This order will be on the house-please forgive me!"


Verena's frown flickered, and then softened into calm. She waved lightly. "It's fine. Just be more careful next time."



The server, greatly relieved, hurried to clean the mess.



Luis quickly drew out a few napkins and handed them across the table. Verena lifted her gaze, saw his hand extended, and murmured, "Thank you." She accepted the napkins and lifted the hem of her dress slightly to blot the spill.


Her movements were swift, almost anxious, for the burn still stung her skin.


Luis leaned forward, intending to show concern,but his eyes caught upon her left leg.


That one glance struck him like lightning. His breath stilled; his pupils widened.



Just above her knee was a scar-shaped unmistakably like a butterfly.



The shape, the placement-it pierced him to the core. A single thought burst through him. Was she...his sister?



His heart raced. After only a second, his eyes hardened with certainty. He was almost sure-the woman before him was the sister he had sought for more than a decade.


That scar was no coincidence. He had caused it himself all those years ago. The memory was carved into his bones, impossible to forget,even in death.


Luis stared, breath growing ragged.


It was her. It was truly her.


In that instant, the puzzles of the past seemed to fall into place.



No wonder, from the very first meeting, he had felt a pull toward her-a bond unspoken, a comfort that made him want to linger at her side, to confide his heart without reason.



No wonder, even when he had agreed to help Simon against Isaac, he found himself recoiling at the thought of harming her once he knew she was Isaac's wife. His hands had resisted, his heart refusing to see her hurt.


It was because this woman-this source of strange,inexplicable emotions-was none other than his own sister, the one he had longed for since childhood.


His chest swelled with a storm: wild joy at what was found, bitter regret for nearly harming her. Hope and shame twisted together,leaving him adrift.


Then a thought froze him.


Wait!



What had he just said to her?



Luis snapped back. A wave of embarrassment crashed over him.


He had actually told her to leave her husband-to come to him. To her own brother! The thought was absurd,monstrous.


His stomach churned; he cursed himself silently.


The folder in his hand now burned like hot iron. Should he still hand it to her, or withdraw it?


His fingers clenched it so tightly the edges bent and creased.



Embarrassment and regret gnawed at him.


If Verena discovered that the man spouting such reckless words was her brother, how would she see him? Would she not shrink back in disgust?


When she was only a stranger, it mattered little if she mistook him for a man shameless enough to covet another's wife.



But now-now she was his sister.



Before he could even rebuild the bond fate had severed, he had already tainted it with folly.


Meanwhile,Verena remained unaware of the tempest on his face. She bowed her head, quietly tending to her dress, dabbing away the stain.


When she finished, she raised her hand, reaching for the folder he still held. But just as her fingers brushed close, Luis recoiled as though the file had scorched him.


Verena blinked, startled. Her puzzled gaze rose to him. "Mr. Sampson, what do you mean by this?"


Luis could not meet her eyes. His gaze darted everywhere else, his voice faltering. "I-I suddenly remembered something urgent. I must go."


Before she could reply, he rose abruptly and fled the restaurant.



His departing figure was steeped in panic, as though pursued by his own shadow.


Verena sat still, dazed by his hasty flight.


A moment ago, he had been perfectly calm.Why then did he leave as if chased by fire?



Her brow furrowed as she mulled over his inexplicable behavior, but no answer came.


Finally, she sighed. Some riddles could not be solved at once. She straightened her dress, made sure no obvious marks remained, and then left the restaurant and drove back toward the hospital.







At Bennett Group, Jacob held a folder in his hands as he reported to Isaac, "Mr. Bennett, the arrangements have been made."
###Chapter 263 A DNA Test





After Luis made his move by stealing lsaac's best people right under his nose, there was no chance Isaac would take that lying down.


He wasted no time. Within days, he'd managed to snatch a few of Luis' own top employees, striking back with precision and force.


Jacob's voice was steady as he delivered the news.Isaac didn't even look up from his paperwork."Understood. That'll be all, Jacob."


With a quiet nod, Jacob slipped from the room,leaving Isaac to his thoughts.


Across town, Luis' assistant delivered the latest development. Luis didn't look particularly shocked.He raised one brow and gave a half-smile, accepting the blow with a mix of resignation and amusement.


He mused silently that Isaac never did let anything go.


Still, since lsaac was now his brother-in-law, Luis decided not to escalate further.


As those thoughts circled his mind, a wave of regret washed over him.



He remembered the reckless things he'd said to Verena, and the mess he'd nearly created.


The memory made him rub at his temples,feeling the weight of it all.


How was he supposed to face her now? What could he say to her that would erase his mistakes?



The question gnawed at him, leaving him feeling helpless.


But beneath that worry, there was something else-a happiness he couldn't keep down.


After searching for his sister all these years, turning over every stone and refusing to give up, he had finally found her at last. The feeling was overwhelming, like surfacing for air after nearly drowning. Tears pricked at his eyes, and he couldn't stop himself from sharing this good news. Blinking the tears away, he turned to his assistant and said, "After all these years, Davin, I actually found her. I really did."


Davin Santos, who had been by Luis' side for years and earned the role of most trusted confidant, knew all about the long search for his sister.


For a second, Davin just stared, struggling to process what he was hearing.


Then his eyes went wide. "Wait, are you saying you actually found your sister,sir?"


Luis gave a solid nod, his gaze unwavering. "Yes.Verena. She's my sister."


Davin's brow furrowed. "You mean Verena-lsaac's wife?"



"That's the one," said Luis, and he launched into the whole story. He told Davin about the inexplicable connection he always felt around Verena and how the butterfly-shaped scar above her knee matched the memory he carried all these years.


"That scar is too distinct to forget," Luis insisted."There's no way I'd confuse her with anyone else.I know she's my sister."


Davin listened intently, weighing every word, but asked gently, "Are you really sure, sir? I know the scar matters, but after all this time, mistakes happen.You'd never forgive yourself if you were wrong."


Luis' face grew thoughtful as he shook his head."There's no doubt in my mind. I'm sure of it."


Davin, wanting to be careful, added, "This is important, sir. Maybe we should confirm it the scientific way. If you could get a strand of Verena's hair,we could do a DNA test-just to be certain."


The idea made sense to Luis.



He nodded, determination settling in his eyes. "Good thinking. I'll meet with her again tomorrow and figure out a way."







The following day, sunlight filtered through the hospital's windows, dappling the hallway with golden patches.


Because of her pregnancy, Verena had stepped back from operating and spent her days guiding the interns instead.



After wrapping up her session with the interns in the operating room, Verena felt fatiguesettling in her shoulders.



Right then, Julianna approached with an exasperated sigh. "Evelyn, that same man from last time showed up again. He's waiting in your office. I've tried everything to make him leave but he refuses."


It didn't take much for Verena to realize she meant Luis.



She offered Julianna a reassuring nod. "Thanks for letting me know. Go ahead and get back to your rounds. I'll take care of it."


Without wasting another moment, V/erena started down the hallway toward her office.


At the end of the corridor, Luis stood near her office door, hands tucked into his pockets, posture ramrod straight.


His head was slightly bowed, lost in thought, while sunlight traced a golden outline around his frame.


Verena closed the distance and said quietly, "Mr.Sampson."



Luis blinked, the sound of her voice bringing him back to the present.



Lifting his head, he met Verena's eyes, seeing her in a crisp white coat, and felt a swirl of emotions he could barely contain.



But his focus snapped back to the real reason for his visit. He needed to get a sample of her hair for the DNA test-confirmation at last. Quickly composing himself, he slipped his hands from his pockets, managing a warm, polite smile."Would you mind if we spoke somewhere more private? It's a little too public out here."


Conveniently, Verena had questions of her own and wanted to settle things from yesterday.


She agreed with a nod and guided him to a coffee shop just a short walk from the hospital.


Once they were settled in a secluded booth, Verena wasted no time. "You left abruptly yesterday without answering anything directly. Mr. Sampson, let's be honest. Who are you trying to protect? Are you going to work with us,or not?"



Luis' face changed the instant she mentioned yesterday.


Embarrassment and regret flashed across his features. He couldn't help but remember the rash things he'd blurted out and felt a wave of shame.For a second, he genuinely wished he could take the words back. He tried to speak, but the words stuck in his throat.He couldn't seem to figureout what to do with his hands, tapping the table one moment and rubbing his leg the next, obviously out of sorts.


Verena took in his discomfort, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. She arched an eyebrow and let a sly edge slip into her voice. "Mr. Sampson, you're making me wonder just how important this person really is to you. Are you here to play games again?Those tricks might get a reaction from some lovestruck girl, but I'm married, so I'm not impressed.Save your energy."



Her bluntness made Luis' cheeks burn. His embarrassment deepened until his face nearly glowed.



He managed to stammer, searching for an explanation, "That's not what I was trying to-"


Halfway through, he realized nothing he said would fix it.



He had been out of line, and there was no hiding from it.



In the end, he lowered his head, voice quiet. "I apologize for before. I was out of line. Please accept my apology."


Verena, still confused by his odd behavior the day before, felt even more at a loss after his sudden admission.


She opened her mouth to presshim for answers, but before she could, Luis spoke again. "Maybe we could add each other on the chat app?"


He offered this as if reaching out to a long-lost sibling, hoping to close the distance between them.


To Verena, though, it only felt like another attempt to insert himself into her life for reasons she couldn't quite trust.
###Chapter 264|Finally Found Her





Verena's brow furrowed in clear annoyance. A spark of impatience flickered in her eyes as she replied,"Absolutely not."



The blunt refusal hit Luis hard. He felt his confidence drain away, leaving him slumping in his chair. With a defeated sigh, he pressed a hand to his forehead,at a complete loss.



He couldn't help feeling disappointed.


Yesterday, he'd blurted out the wrong thing and left in a rush, and today he'd only made it worse by suddenly asking for her chat app number. He figured his reputation in Verena's mind was probably shot,but he promised himself he would find a way to make up for it later.


For now, he had to focus on getting that strand of her hair for the DNA test. After thinking it over, Luis finally settled on a plan.


He gave the spoon a calculated flick, sending it tumbling to the floor near Verena's feet.


With a touch of regret in his expression, he said,"Mrs. Bennett, would you mind picking that up for me?"



Verena barely hesitated, reaching down out of courtesy to retrieve the spoon.


While she bent over, Luis quietly reached out and snagged a few stray strands of hair from her shoulder, moving so quickly that she didn't notice a thing.


She straightened up and handed him the spoon,but before she could say anything, Luis shot to his feet."Sorry,Mrs.Bennett. Something just came up. I need to go."


Without waiting for a reply, he turned and left the restaurant in a hurry.

 
Verena sat there, the spoon still in her hand, watching Luis' retreating figure with a puzzled frown.His behavior left her feeling irritated and confused.


She couldn't make sense of his odd actions.







Outside, Luis clutched the tiny plastic bag holding Verena's hair as he hurried to his car and made straight for a hospital.


He reached the hospital in record time, heading straight for the lab where DNA tests were handled.Without wasting a minute, Luis handed the hair samples to the lab technician. "Please, I need this processed as fast as possible," he said, urgency sharpening his tone.


Normally, these results took days, but Luis wasn't just any person. He leaned on his connections,making sure the request jumped to the front of the line.



The staff recognized his name and status, and no one dared delay. They got to work right away, prepping the samples for immediate testing.


With nothing left to do, Luis paced the hallway, and then dropped onto a bench near the lab, his nerves stretched tight.


He kept glancing at the closed door, every second stretching longer than the last. His heart hammered in his chest, and his thoughts ran wild.


If the test said Verena wasn't his sister, what then?


Would everything he'd been searching for disappear in an instant?



But if she really was his long-lost sibling, how could he possibly make up for missing all those years?How could he face her now?



The waiting felt endless.


At last, the lab door swung open. Luis shot to his feet, unable to keep his anxiety from spilling out.


A doctor stepped out, test results in hand. Luis met him halfway, barely keeping his voice steady. "Do you


have the results?"


The doctor scanned the report, and then offered a small, reassuring smile. "Congratulations, Mr.Sampson.The results confirm the blood ties."


For a moment, Luis stood rooted in disbelief.


Tears stung his eyes as he whispered, "She's really my sister. After all this time, I finally found her."


Wiping his eyes, Luis hurried to his car,fumbled with his phone, and dialed a number, hands still trembling with emotion.
###Chapter 265 Don't Hurt My Daughter





Once the call went through, Luis spoke, his voice trembling ever so slightly. "Dad, I've found my sister."


At those words, his father, Joseph Sampson,staggered, almost swept off his feet by a wave of joy too heavy to bear.


Joseph's face, lined with years of sorrow, suddenly brimmed with tears of joy. His voice cracked under the weight of emotion as he pressed, "Luis, what did you just say? My daughter-has she truly been found? Is this real?"


Hearing his father's trembling excitement, Luis was torn by conflicting feelings.


He knew well the years of torment his parents had endured since his sister vanished-most of all his mother, whose grief had carved deep scars into her mind. Taking a breath, he steadied himself and answered with earnest conviction. "Dad, there's no mistake.I've just done the DNA test. The doctor confirmed it -there is clear blood relation. She is my sister."


The moment those words reached him, Joseph let out a cry he could not suppress.


His eyes turned to the living room, where a woman sat softly singing to a pillow. Shaken and unsteady,he stumbled toward her, carried along by overwhelming excitement.


He crouched before his wife, Marisa Sampson,carefully brushing a few stray strands of hair from her face, and with a hoarse, trembling voice whispered, "Stop singing, Marisa. Our daughter has been found."



The woman-her hair now streaked with gray, her expression weary and vacant-bore the unmistakable mark of illness.



Since their daughter's disappearance, her mind had unraveled. She clutched the pillow as though it were her lost child, insisting she was only singing her to sleep.


When Luis came of age, Joseph had stepped away from managing the family's affairs, entrusting everything to his son.


He himself remained at home, caring with his own hands for his broken-hearted wife.



But now, seeing no flicker of response in her eyes,only the same gentle humming as if nothing had been said, Joseph reached out slowly, attempting to take the pillow from her arms.



The moment his hand neared it, Marisa's nerves seemed to snap like a bowstring pulled too tight. She erupted with sudden fury.


Her once vacant gaze sharpened into cold fire,locking fiercely onto him.


Her face twisted in agitation, her forehead tightening into deep lines, her lips quivering as she screamed in a voice torn by hysteria, "Don't take my daughter way! Don't hurt my daughter!"


Her shrill cry shook the room to its very rafters,ringing painfully in Joseph's ears.


Her grip tightened on the pillow, veins rising on her arms.



Joseph froze, startled by the sudden storm. His hand fell back, and sorrow washed over his features,leaving him helpless.


Looking at the woman before him-her gray hair,her worn face-his voice caught in his throat. "Marisa,our daughter has truly returned. Luis has confirmed it with the doctor. She's come back to us."


And yet, as quickly as the tempest rose, it fell away.After her outburst, Marisa sank again into her fragile calm, as though the fury had been nothing more than smoke.



She resumed her gentle humming, cradling the pillow with tender devotion.


Beside her, Joseph said nothing more. Silent tears traced the furrows of his aged face.


Listening through the phone, Luis felt his chest tighten with sorrow.


He swallowed hard, forcing his voice into steadiness."Dad, don't worry. I'll see to it that my sister meets you both very soon."
###Chapter 266 You Can't Go After Simon Now
On the other end of the call, Joseph's voice sounded rough and exhausted, every syllable heavy with sorrow. "Luis, you can't imagine how hard this is.Seeing your mother like this breaks my heart..."


Luis stayed silent, listening to the pain in his father's words. He frowned, a sharp pang of guilt flickering across his face.



He knew the weight his father carried. Years of caring for his fragile wife, all while grieving the loss of their daughter, had left Joseph worn thin. The hardship was deeper than words could reach.


"Dad, I really do understand. You've done so much for all of us. Try not to worry. Things will change now.We found my sister. I believe Mom will start to get better, little by little," Luis replied, keeping his voice gentle, hoping his words would bring a sliver of hope. Joseph's breathing steadied, his tone softening "You're right, son. If your mother gets to see her daughter again, it might help her heal."


When Joseph finally sounded calmer, Luis ended the call.


A wave of relief washed over him. For the first time in days, his shoulders loosened, and he slumped back in his seat.



He pinched the bridge of his nose, massaging away the tension behind his eyes.


Once he'd caught his breath, Luis pulled himself together and reached for his phone again, this time dialing Verena.


At that moment, Verena was in the middle of briefing department heads when her phone buzzed, the urgent ringtone cutting through the meeting.


She glanced at the screen, her expression souring when she saw Luis' name.


Memories of his recent odd behavior made her


instantly irritated.


She hit decline without a second thought.


But the phone barely had a moment's rest before Luis tried again.


Seeing his name appear a second time only deepened her annoyance. She hung up once more.


Tucking her phone away, Verena chose to ignore it,throwing herself back into her work.


Still, Luis refused to give up. The phone rang again,the sound cutting sharply through the silent office.


Verena stared at the screen, feeling her irritation mount. After storming out on her, now he was blowing up her phone. She wondered what new scheme he might be pulling.


With a resigned sigh, she picked up, hoping to get it over with and return to work.



"Mr. Sampson, my schedule isn't exactly open. If there's something urgent, say it now," Verena said,  tone edged with impatience.


Luis hesitated, at first wanting to break the tension with a few polite words, hoping to ease her mood before raising the real reason for his call.


But Verena's brisk impatience made it clear she had no time for pleasantries. Not wanting to risk another hang-up, Luis went straight to the heart of the matter. "I'm calling to let you know l've decided to accept your proposal."


Verena was taken aback. "Come again?"


It wasn't that she hadn't caught his words. She was simply shocked by his sudden change, especially after all his earlier doubts and evasions.


Picking up on her disbelief, Luis continued, voice sincere, "I mean it. I won't help Simon against you anymore."


He could not contain the rush of relief in his tone."And do you know why? Because the person l've been looking for all these years-I finally found her." Verena felt a wave of disbelief. After years of chasing shadows, Luis had finally tracked down the one person Simon used to control him.


Everything changed in that instant.


Steadying himself, Luis spoke with a cold clarity."Simon isn't your problem anymore. I haven't even started settling my score with him. The man had the nerve to try and threaten me. He's' got no idea what that's going to cost him. I promise you, he'll wish he'd never crossed me."



Luis caught sight of his own reflection in the rearview mirror, his eyes as hard as stone. Every ounce of steel and ruthlessness he'd learned in the underworld flickered there, plain for anyone to see.


Verena listened to his voice through the phone,steady and merciless, and her brows drew together in unease.


People rarely doubted the reach of the Sampson Group's underground power. She had never witnessed it firsthand, but stories about Luis' harshness were enough to paint the picture.



Now that he had found the person he cherished most, Simon's threats meant nothing to him, and letting Simon walk away alive seemed unlikely.



He had a reputation for being ruthless, and once he set his sights on Simon, there was a good chance he would stop at nothing. He might even take Simon's life without a second thought.


As that realization hit her, Verena said, her voice leaving no room for argument, "You can't go after Simon now."



Luis was confused. "What do you mean?"


Her determination was clear as she answered, "I still haven't figured out the truth behind what happened to my family. If Simon really is the one l've been searching for, the one who hurt them, then it has to be me who faces him. That's not up for debate." She paused to gather her thoughts and then continued, "Mr. Sampson, since you've agreed to work with me, that means you owe me a certain level of respect. Once everything comes to light, I won't stand in the way if you want to take your revenge.But until then, don't interfere with mine. If you act too soon and go after Simon now, everything l've done will unravel. All the progress I've made, all the information I've dug up-it'll all disappear just like that."



Her defiance left Luis quiet, the weight of her words settling heavy over him.



Conflicted emotions twisted inside him.



He felt powerless.



All his efforts to find his sister had led to this moment, yet there was a wall between them.


Every time she spoke to him, it was as if they were nothing but strangers. The chill in her voice stung more than he cared to admit. He also felt a deep sense of gu't His reckless choices in the past had ruined whatever chance he had to mend things with his sister. Now, everything between them felt awkward and forced.


But then another thought settled in his mind.


Regardless of everything, she was still his sister.He would do right by her.
###Chapter 267 You're So Good To Me





After a long silence, Luis finally spoke, his voice softened to a tone as gentle as spring rain. "Since you've put it that way, what choice do I have? I can only agree with you."


He hoped that by showing this kind of yielding,his sister might at least feel the weight of his concern,even if it only took the edge off the coldair hanging between them.


Verena caught the deliberate softness at once, and her brows drew together. The more she listened, the stranger she found his behavior.


Recalling Luis' earlier outrageous remarks about pursuing her, a wave of irritation rose like a storm inside her.


She cut him off, her words sharp as a blade. "Mr.Sampson, please speak properly. Don't parade this false gentleness before a married woman; that trick is far too worn out."


Her tone carried an unmistakable disdain.



Luis froze, visibly startled, and then color rushed to his cheeks.



More than shame, it was awkwardness that burned through him.


Running a hand roughly through his hair, he scolded himself inwardly-why had he ever let such foolish words slip past his lips?


Still, his thoughts circled more around Simon's matter. Once it was settled, he would find the right time to confess the truth to Verena, hoping they could return to the simple bond of siblings.


Luis sighed, stumbling over his words. "You-you've misunderstood. I wasn't parading anything. I just...ah, never mind. I'll stop bothering you now."


As the words left his mouth, he felt the more he explained, the more guilty he sounded. Unsure how to go on, he hardened his heart, cut the call short, and spared himself further humiliation.


Verena stared at the ended call, her brows still tightly knitted. Luis' behavior struck her as more and more unusual.


She couldn't fathom why he so often hesitated,why he sometimes behaved as though he were flirting.



She truly had no idea what his intentions were.


As evening settled, the sky turned a brilliant orange-red, streaked with clouds that filtered the light like sheer veils, casting a gentle glow across the earth.


The stream of patients at the hospital thinned out,and before clocking out, Verena busied herself putting the medical records in order.


Just as she finished, her phone chimed with a crisp notification.



Setting aside the files, she picked up the phone and saw the familiar note-husband. A smile touched her lips as she opened the message. "Verena, I'm waiting for you downstairs at the hospital. Let's go home together."


Reading the brief words, Verena's delicate brows lifted slightly. She quickly typed back a simple "Okay."


Rising, she went to the changing room, slipped off her white coat, folded it with care, and placed it in the locker. Then she closed the door, picked up her small bag, and left the hospital.


Downstairs, Isaac's car waited quietly at the roadside, its body catching the fading glow of the setting sun.


The driver stepped forward, opening the door for her.Verena gave a polite thanks and got in.


As she settled, she noticed a U-shaped pillow placed on the seat.


She turned to Isaac, puzzled. "What's this?"


Isaac didn't answer right away. Instead, he leaned slightly, adjusting the pillow's position with his hand. "As the months advance, back pain is common for pregnant women. The doctor mentioned a pillow behind the back helps ease the strain. So, I prepared one for you."


Verena felt warmth bloom in hér chest, sweet and soft as honey on the tongue.


Leaning back against the pillow, she immediately felt her back relax.



She turned to lsaac, her eyes curving with a smile."Isaac, you're so good to me."


With that, she tilted toward him and pressed a gentle kiss on his cheek.



When they returned home, Rhonda had already set the table, each dish neatly arranged.


The moment the couple came in, she greeted them kindly, "Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, you're back. Dinner is ready-you may eat now."


Verena offered a faint smile and a nod. "Thank you,Rhonda." Leading Isaac to the sink, she washed her hands with him, and together they sat across from one another at the table.



Since the pregnancy, Verena's appetite had waned.Foods she once relished now made her stomach turn at the very thought.


Anything greasy or meaty became unbearable, their smell alone enough to drive her away.


Knowing this, Isaac had asked Rhonda to prepare meals that were light yet full of nourishment.


Rhonda took the instruction to heart, making sure every dish was both healthy and mild.


Though Verena's appetite was poor, she forced herself to finish half a bowl for the sake of her health.



One of the dishes tonight was noodles.


She managed a few bites, but soon her brow knitted and nausea surged. Her face turned pale as she retched painfully. The moment her stomach churned, Verena pushed back her chair with a scrape and hurried to the bathroom, hand over her mouth.


Isaac's heart twisted tight. Without a second thought,he followed her.


Inside, Verena gripped the sink, her body wracked by retching, the slender line of her neck flushed crimson.


Isaac's eyes were full of worry. "Verena, let's go to the hospital," he urged, his hand gently rubbing her back in comfort.


She rinsed her mouth with water, and then waved weakly, her hand pressed to her stomach. "I'm fine.Just a little discomfort. I'Il be better after some rest."


For the first time, Isaac felt helpless, a sense of defeat heavy on him.


His brows drew together as his gaze dropped to her slightly rounded belly. With a sigh, he murmured with a mix of reluctance and tenderness, "This little one really knows how to stir up trouble. I almost feel...less fond of it."


His voice was low and soft. Taking a tissue, he carefully wiped the water from her face, his touch delicate, as if she were the most fragile treasure in the world.


After that, dinner was forgotten.


Verena lay on the bed, though hot the least bit sleepy. Her eyes fixed blankly on the ceiling thoughts wandering endlessly.


After a while, she propped herself against the headboard, picked up a magazine from the bedside table, and flipped through it, trying to distract her restless mind.



Soon, the door opened gently from outside.
###Chapter 268 The Footage Was Recovered
Isaac steadied the delicate bowl in his hand, rolling his wheelchair closer to the bedside.


Verena caught sight of him and instinctively pursed her lips. Her voice carried both fatigue and resignation as she murmured, "Isaac, I'm really not in the mood to eat anything right now."


Isaac halted beside her, his smile warm yet coaxing."I understand. I only heated some soup to ease your stomach. It usually brings comfort when one feels unwell. If y/our appetite returns, you can tell me."


At those words, Verena blinked and allowed a faint smile to surface.



Isaac carefully scooped up a spoonful of steaming soup, cooling it with a soft breath before bringing it gently to her lips. "Just a taste-it's light, not heavy." She parted her lips, letting the warm broth slip past.It was like a quiet balm, soothing her throat and settling inside her.


Almost at once, a wave of warmth spread from her stomach, easing much of the torment of morning sickness.


Before long, the bowl was emptied. Isaac fed her the last sip, and then set the vessel quietly on the bedside table.


Turning back to her, his gaze grew solemn. "Verena,there's something I must tell you."


She lifted her eyes, noticed the gravity etched in his expression, and chose silence-waiting instead for his words.



Isaac paused, and then spoke with measured weight."From the moment I began to suspect Simon, I never once stopped digging. I launched investigation after investigation, sparing no effort. And at last, I learned the truth: the Simon before us is nothing but an imitation. The real Simon died long ago." As though reliving each step of the inquiry, Isaac furrowed his brow. "In that clinic where Simon died,we uncovered a suspicious man named Carl Aguilar-someone who had grown up in the same village as Simon. They even shared a ward for a while. NJot long after Simon's death, Carl vanished. The more l considered it, the more the pieces pointed to him. So I had Stevie examine every record from the cosmetic surgery hospitals in Clokron. That's where we struck gold."



His gaze locked on Verena's as he spoke slowly."Carl underwent surgery-an entire transformation,head to toe."


Hearing this, Verena's brows drew tight.


Though her heart already suspected the truth-that Simon was Carl-the cold evidence still pierced her with sorrow.


This was the very man she had once saved.


Hatred flickered in her eyes as she muttered, "So it really is Carl. Disguising himself as Simon...  approaching me on purpose..."


Isaac reached for her hand, his touch tender, yet his eyes probing. "Verena, do you remember him well?Our search showed he once received treatment at your hospital in Clokron, but the security around your patients' records were impenetrable. No matter how hard we tried, the trail ended there."


Verena gathered herself, giving 'a slight nod."I remember him, but only faintly. My impression of him was shallow."



She let out a small smile andadded, "At that time, we hired Ivan for security. He sealed the information tightly. He's the best at what he does, so it's no wonder you found nothing."


Isaac's eyes narrowed faintly, their brightness dimming.



Her mention of Ivan struck him like a hidden thorn.A pang of jealousy pricked at his heart, leaving a quiet sting. He pressed his lips together, and then murmured softly, "He has feelings for you."


His tone was gentle, yet it carried an undertone heavy as lead-like a feather that seemed light but bore hidden weight.


Verena failed to notice the subtle shift in him,assuming he referred to Carl.


Her eyes flashed with disdain, and her voice chilled."I guess as much. To be admired by someone like him is nothing short of an insult."


Images of Carl's vile deeds surged in her mind. Each memory of his cruelty toward those she loved made her sick with anger.


Isaac kept his silence, watching her carefully.From her words, he realized she spoke of Carl, not lvan.


A quiet sigh escaped him. Relief brushed his heart,yet the hidden bitterness lingered, pressed down like a secret burden.


"Oh, and Isaac," Verena said suddenly,tightening her hold on his hand. "There's something I need to tell you too."



He looked at her in mild surprise. Verena paused, and then continued, "Luis agreed to work with us. I also suspect Carl might be the one who killed my grandma. Once the truth is laid bare, I won't let him go unpunished."


And there was the matter of harming lsaac-Carl would pay for that as well.


Isaac lifted his hand, brushing her cheek with deep tenderness. His voice, low and unwavering, carried a vow. "Verena, no matter what comes, I'll face it with you. Anyone who has wounded you, anyone who's brought you sorrow-I'll see they answer for it."






Verena had asked Ivan to restore the surveillance of Isaac's car accident. Last time, he'd been too sure of himself and failed, leaving him stung with frustration.

 
Now, day and night blurred together as he sat rooted before the computer, unyielding as stone.


Inside the computer room, Ivan's eyes never strayed from the screen. His fingers hammered the keys,shutting out the world beyond.



Empty instant noodle cups rose in heaps, coffee mugs lay scattered, his hair was a mess, and his eyes bloodshot-but he pressed on without care.


Failure came again and again, yet he refused to surrender. After countless tries, success finally shone through.


As the recovered footage appeared, Ivan threw his hands skyward and shouted with triumph.


Rest and sleep were strangers to him in the past few days; he hadn't even spared a glance at whether day or night lay beyond the window.


Without delay, he seized his phone and dialed Verena's number.



At Seraphina Villas... Late-night silence cloaked the villa, the world hushed under the veil of sleep.


Moonlight, pale as silver, streamed through the gauzy curtains, scattering shifting patterns across the room.



Verena nestled quietly against lsaac's arm, their breaths soft, bodies closely entwined, both adrift in dreams.


But peace proved fragile. A faint vibration fromn the bedside table broke the stillness.



Disturbed, Verena stirred. Her lashes fluttered open as wakefulness crept back.


She reached out, groping for the vibrating phone, its glow harsh against the dark.


Her brows knitted slightly, but when she saw lvan's name flashing on the screen, the haze of sleep vanished in an instant.
###Chapter 269 Breakthrough





Ivan never called this late unless it was urgent. That meant something big had come up.


Verena's gaze flickered over to Isaac, who remained asleep on the bed beside her.


The harsh lines of his face seemed gentler in the moonlight, softened into something almost boyish and calm.



A small smile tugged at her lips as she eased herself away, moving with deliberate care so she wouldn't disturb him.



She slid her feet into her slippers and padded out onto the balcony, answering the call in a hushed tone. "Ivan? Any news?"


Her words floated quietly through the stillness.


Ivan's excitement was unmistakable as his voice crackled through the line. "Not news-breakthrough!I pulled up the missing surveillance video. You have to see this right now!"


Verena's drowsiness vanished. Her heart skipped,and her whole face lit up as she replied,"Seriously?That's incredible! I'm coming right over!"


She grabbed a coat from the closet, barely able to contain her anticipation.


All she could think about was getting to lvan's apartment as fast as she could and finally seeing the footage for herself.


Moments later, the soft click of the door echoed down the hallway as she slipped out, her voice fading behind her.


Back in the bedroom, Isaac's eyes snapped open-sharp and fully awake, despite his peaceful appearance just seconds before.


The moment Verena's phone buzzed, Isaac had woken up. He had stayed perfectly still, silently taking in every word she spoke as she answered the call.


The moment Verena said Ivan's name, lsaac felt a sting of jealousy, sharp and unexpected, as if someone had tugged on his heartstrings without warning.


He caught every word-news-clear proof that this was about the task Verena had handed off. Logic told him there was nothing to worry about, but emotion simmered beneath the surface, tightening his brow and dimming his gaze with a shadow of sadness.







Late night painted the city in darkness, muting the usual noise to a gentle hush.


With hardly any cars out, Verena pressed harder on the gas pedal, eyes locked on the empty stretch of road ahead.



She could barely contain her impatience. Every mile brought her closer to the truth-if she could see the footage tonight, maybe she could finally confirm her suspicions.


It took less than twenty minutes for her car to glide to a stop in front of Ivan's building.


She punched in the entry code Ivan had given her,pushed through the door, and found the computer room left slightly open.


Peeking inside, she spotted Ivan hunched over his desk, inhaling instant noodles with the kind of desperation only true exhaustion could bring. His hair stuck up at odd angles, making him look both comical and worn out.


Verena lingered in the doorway for a beat, half amused, half concerned. "Ivan, is this realy all you've eaten lately?" she asked, her tone gently scolding.


Ivan glanced up at the sound of her voice, offering a lopsided grin as he ran a hand through his messy hair. "What can I say? I get stuck on something, and I can't let go until I crack it. Guess we're alike in that way,Verena." There was a kind of stubborn pride in his tired eyes that made Verena smile, a mix of affection and worry bubbling up inside her.


He really was hopeless sometimes.


She stepped closer, tousling his hair in a gentle,sisterly gesture. "You've been pushing yourself too hard.When this is all over, dinner's on me. Whatever you want."


Ivan's whole face brightened at that, his reply quick and eager. "Don't forget you said that, Verena. I plan to eat my fill."


With that settled, the mood shifted as they turned to business.



"Did you already watch the footage?" Verena asked,her voice suddenly serious.


Ivan slurped up the last of his noodles,set the bowl aside without ceremony, and shook his head in answer.



He rolled his chair back to the computer, hands flying across the keys as he launched a flurry of code onto the screen.



Within moments, a new video file appeared.


He looked over at Verena, a glint of excitement in his eyes. "I haven't peeked yet. Figured I'd wait for you."


He wasted no time, dragging the mouse to the play button and clicking it.


Verena settled into the chair beside him, both of them leaning forward as the footage flickered to life.


She watched, absolutely transfixed, her attention locked onto every movement on the screen.


Ivan kept his voice low. "The whole video is about two minutes, starting a few seconds before the crash."



The video played out across a street alive with the ordinary rhythm of traffic. Cars rolled by, horns blared, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.


Then, out of nowhere, a massive truck lurched into view, veering wildly and smashing headlong into a sleek black Bentley traveling the opposite direction.


Inside that Bentley-Isaac and his father.


The collision erupted with a shattering boom, filling the screen with smoke and screeching chaos.


Verena's brow knitted as she watched the devastation unfold, a tight ache crawling up her throat. Still, she forced herself to stay sharp,determined to study every second.


She focused on the details, eyes darting across the screen, searching for any clue the footage might reveal.



As the recording drew to its final seconds, something in the corner caught Verena's attention. Her eyes went wide.


At the same moment, Ivan leaned in, his finger pointing at the monitor. "There-top right. Do you see that car coming up?"


Verena narrowed her gaze, spotting a shadowy black car drifting by. As it rolled past the wreck, the passenger window slid down partway.


She gripped the table so hard her knuckles turned white. "Pause it-zoom in here."



Ivan responded with a quick "Got it," and then paused the footage and zoomed in on the dark car lurking at the edge of the frame. Both of them leaned closer,tension thick in the air.


The screen filled with the image of a figure whose head and face were tightly swathed in gauze, only a pair of eyes visible through the layers.


At first, the figure's face was nothing more than a blur, almost impossible to make out. Yet those eyes immediately drew attention.



There was a cold, ferocious light in them-a spark that seemed to revel in the chaos erupting around the black Bentley. It was as if witnessing the crash brought the stranger a twisted sense of pleasure.


In the haze of smoke and ruin, those eyes burned like a spectral flame, a presence so haunting it seemed to seep straight from the darkness itself, making Verena's skin crawl.
###Chapter 270 Apology





Confusion flickered across Ivan's face. He absentmindedly rubbed his chin, lost in thought, his brows drawn tight as he tried to piece it all together.


After a beat, he spoke up, his voice hesitant and tinged with doubt. "This person's eyes... there's something familiar..."


He trailed off, searching his mind for the connection.


Next to him, Verena's mood changed in a heartbeat.


Her eyes flashed with sudden fury, and her words came out like a blade. "That's Carl."



There was no mistaking those eyes.


Staring at the shrouded figure on the screen,Verena's fists clenched so hard the veins stood out on her hands.


Before, she might have doubted herself-identifying someone from just a pair of eyes would have seemed impossible. But after seeing Carl at the Clokron hospital on surveillance footage, she could never forget that ice-cold, predatory stare burned into her memory.



Even though his face was hidden behind layers of gauze, just those eyes showing, Verena knew it was Carl. She would recognize that gaze anywhere, no matter the disguise, even if he was nothing more than a silhouette.



Ivan's expression grew tense, concern etched into every line of his face. "Should I keep looking into this,Verena?"



She shook her head, jaw tight, each word deliberate."There's no need to dig further. The man in that car is Carl. Isaac's crash-he's the one behind it."


Her shoulders slumped as she rose from her chair,face pale and distant.


A heaviness clouded her eyes as she looked  down,guilt and regret settling over her like a tidal wave, threatening to pull her under.


Verena's hands curled so tightly that her nails bit into her skin, leaving pale crescents along her palms,but she barely registered the pain.


A swirl of memories raced through her thoughts,haunted by a silent voice that wouldn't let her rest.


She tried not to put stock in destiny, but sometimes she wondered if the universe had singled her out for heartbreak.



She couldn't remember a time she felt truly cherished.


Childhood had been nothing but cold indifference-a father and mother whose love always belonged to someone else. That emptiness had left her hollow,unable to find warmth in her own home.


Her own sister treated her as arival, each scheme a fresh betrayal that cut deeper than the last.


Even her brother never reached out with kindnesS,keeping her at arm's length as if she were a stranger in her own family.


Only her grandmother had offered a flicker of comfort, the one person who ever made her feel safe.Yet even that comfort had been snatched away by tragedy-one she couldn't help but feel responsible for, the ache of loss still lodged deep inside.


Now, the guilt weighed heavier than ever. Isaac's father gone, Isaac himself losing his ability to walk-all of it seemed to trace back to her.


Every memory pressed down on her chest, making it nearly impossible to draw breath.


A relentless whisper in her mind insisted none of it would have happened if not for her.


Everyone's suffering, in the end, was her burden to bear.


Verena's eyes shone red, shadowed with grief and uncertainty.


She had no idea how she could ever look Isaac in the eye again, let alone find a way to carry the weight of her guilt.


"It's all because of me... I set everything in motion,"Verena whispered, her voice trembling as she finally forced the confession out, rough and raw.



Her words barely made a sound, thick with regret.


Ivan opened his mouth to respond, but suddenly,Verena swayed, overcome by a dizzy spell.Her knees buckled beneath her.


He caught her just in time, worry sharpening his features. "Verena, are you all right?"


She shook her head hard, trying to shake away the fog.


Forcing a brittle smile, she tried to play it off. "Really,I'm fine."



Ivan wasn't convinced. He knew too well her habit of taking on every burden herself, and he feared what it might do to her spirit. He let out a quiet sigh and stepped closer, voice gentle. "Verena, you can't shoulder all of this. None of this is your fault."


Ivan's comfort drew the ghost of a smile from her,but it was hollow, tinged with sorrow.


Lifting her head a little, Verena spoke in a cool,steady tone. "Ivan, can you send the video to my email? It's getting late. I should be heading home."


She sounded calm, but her composure was only a fragile mask over a storm of emotion.


Ivan, seeing her detachment, hesitated. "Let me at least drive you back," he suggested quickly, concern coloring every word.


Verena shook her head, waving off the offer. "No need, really. I drove myself here. But thank you,Ivan."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned and made her way toward the door.


Stepping out of the building, she pulled out her keys,ready to head home. As she lifted her gaze, a pair of headlights sliced through the night, washing over her in stark white.She covered her eyes on instinct, only to realize,once the glare faded, that lsaac's car sat quietly by the curb.



He was waiting outside, seated in his wheelchair,calm and unhurried beneath the streetlamp's soft glow.



A breeze played through his hair, tossing a few strands across his forehead, giving him an air of quiet, unintentional elegance.


His eyes found her in the darkness, their depths steady and unwavering.


When he saw her, Isaac offered a gentle, reassuring smile."Did you get what you needed?"


His voice was soft, gravelly, full of warmth and devotion.



Verena had meant to ask what he was doing there,but the words evaporated. The only thing she could do was cross the distance between them and fall into his arms, clutching him fiercely as if she might never let go.


Her tears came fast and heavy, spilling down her cheeks, soaking into lsaac's collar as she pressed her face against his neck.


Earlier, after Verena left the house, lsaac had quietly instructed the driver and Jacob to follow her. He waited outside lvan's building, his mind a whirlwind of emotion.



Isaac's thoughts were tangled, an uneasy ache settling in his chest as he watched Verena step out of Ivan's apartment building. He'd meant to gently ask,to uncover the truth behind her late-night visit.


But when her tears pressed hot against his neck, all his questions faded away. Worry eclipsed everything else.



He drew her closer, his large hand cupping the back of her head, fingers threading softly through her hair in a gesture of pure comfort. "Verena, talk to me-what happened?" he asked quietly.


She only clung tighter, sobs shaking her shoulders as she shook her head. "Please, don't ask," she managed to reply, her voice barely more than a gasp.


Her arms wrapped around his neck like she'd finally found somewhere safe to fall apart.


Seeing her so broken, Isaac leaned in, his lips close to her ear, voice gentle. "Okay. I won't press.Whenever you're ready, I'll listen."


His kindness only deepened the ache inside her.Ivan's advice replayed in her mind-she knew she wasn't meant to carry the world on her own shoulders.


Still, the sense of responsibility gnawed at her, sharp and stubborn, a weight that refused to let go.


Fresh tears spilled down her cheeks as she whispered, voice ragged with grief, "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry..." Isaac's chest tightened at the sound of her apology,the word slicing through him.



Sorry?


His brows drew together in concern, and his gaze drifted-almost involuntarily-toward Ivan's apartment, its windows glowing against the night. His throat felt tight, and for a moment, he forgot how to breathe.



Was she apologizing because of Ivan?



The idea left a bitter taste, a pang of jealousy he tried to swallow down.



For an instant, a shadow of loneliness flickered in his eyes as he looked at Verena, shaking and lost in his arms, unsure of how to help.


She wept for what seemed like forever, as if she could cry out every sorrow she'd ever carried.


Isaac stayed by her side, patient and gentle, his hand tracing soothing circles on her back. Maybe she was simply worn out-emotionally spent,sleep-deprived. Slowly, her sobs faded, her breathing evened out, and her eyelids fluttered shut as exhaustion pulled her under.


Once her breathing steadied and her tears faded into quiet, Isaac gazed down at Verena, still nestled in his arms. Moonlight caught on her lashes, where the last glimmers of tears clung, and her brow stayed faintly creased, even in sleep-uneasy, unsettled.


With a tenderness that seemed to steady his own heart, Isaac pressed a soft kiss to her forehead. Then he glanced over at Jacob and spoke quietly. "Jacob,can you take Verena's car back for her?"


Jacob gave a silent nod, took the keys, and headed off toward her car without another word.


With the driver's help, lsaac carried Verena to his own car, holding her close as though he could shield her from the world.
###Chapter 271 Kiss Me


Inside the car,Isaac pulled Verena a little closer, her slender form tucked securely against his chest.

He lowered his head to look at her as she slept, his eyes dark and unreadable, like still water concealing secrets beneath the surface.

Lately, she'd been meeting Ivan more frequently. Each time she mentioned Ivan-always with complete honesty-jealousy twisted inside him,sharp and relentless.

No matter how transparent she tried to be, it never fully soothed the knot in his chest.

Isaac couldn't help but imagine what they talked about in those quiet, private moments.

Did their conversations wander into old memories or drift toward plans yet to come?

Was there laughter tinged with nostalgia, or silence heavy with the weight of things unsaid?

Those questions circled endlessly, growing heavier each time they returned.

Isaac's imagination conjured scenes of Verena and Ivan together, and every image left a fresh ache, sharp as any wound.

His mind wandered to the delicate "I" inked on Verena's collarbone.

Did she think of Ivan when her fingers brushed over it? Did memories of their old love still tug at her heart,even now?

Isaac couldn't chase those thoughts any further. Even letting them get this far sent a cold, anxious tremor through him, a panic he struggled to hide.

Countless times, Isaac found himself on the verge of asking Verena what that tattoo meant to her, desperate to beg her to erase that singe,haunting letter.

Yet every time the words reached his lips, they caught in his throat, swallowed by fear and uncertainty. The truth was, he was scared.

Scared that the answer would be something he couldn't bear to hear.

But one thing never changed-Verena was his wife in the eyes of the law, the mother of his child.

No matter what ghosts from the past lingered, Isaac refused to let her slip away. He would hold her close,regardless of whether old feelings for lvan still lingered in her heart.

He would not share her-not with Ivan, not with anyone.

Isaac's gaze drifted to Ivan's apartment, eyes narrowing, a chill settling over his expression as if he could see through brick and glass to the man inside.

Ivan.

What right did he have to reappear, to meddle in their lives after all this time?

If Ivan tried to step between them, Isaac wouldn't hesitate to fight back. He'd protect his family, no matter the cost, even if it meant crossing lines he once swore he'd never approach.

By the time sunlight slipped through the curtains, Verena was stirring, eyelids heavy as she woke to find Isaac stretched out beside her. He absently twirled a lock of her hair between his fingers, his gaze intent and thoughtful, lost somewhere far away.

Guilt pinched at her chest the instant she saw him.

The night before lingered in a haze-she remembered coming home, collapsing into bed, and slippoing into uneasy dreams she couldn't recall but was sure had left her feeling unsettled.

Noticing she was awake, Isaac lowered his head, meeting her sleepy gaze. His voice was soft, edged with concern. "Want to stay in bed a little longer?"

She shook her head, mustering a gentle smile. "Good morning."

Isaac returned her greeting with a delicate kiss on her forehead.

It was a ritual she'd come to treasure, his way of anchoring her at the start of every day. She found herself smiling, ready to leave the warmth of the covers.

But before she could rise, his hand reached out, drawing her back with a firm but gentle hold.

Confused,Verena looked up at him, asking, "What is it?"

He traced the curve of her cheek with his fingers, searching her face as if he could read every unspoken thought hiding in her gaze.

For a moment, he caught his own reflection in her eyes-so clear, so close.

Still, a shadow passed through him, doubt flickering deep inside. Was he the only one that occupied her heart?

Isaac's gaze grew darker as the memory of the previous night pressed in on him, old fears and fresh uncertainty mingling behind his eyes.

Last nigt, Verena's tears had stained Isaac's shoulder.

But who had she been weeping for?

Isaac felt caught in a spiral, chasing questions when the answers sat heavy on his chest.
0
He curled his fingers into a fist beneath the sheets, an ache of dread tightening around his lungs until it hurt to draw breath.

After what felt like ages, he finally managed to speak, voice rough and unsteady."Verena,kiss me."

The words trembled between plea and demand, longing tangled with quiet desperation.

She didn't pick up on the edge beneath his request. With a faint arch of her brows, she let out a soft laugh.

She'd braced for a confrontation about last night. Instead, he only wanted a kiss.

Seeing the hope and worry mingling on his face, Verena leaned over, pressing a quick kiss to his lips before pulling back, ready to start her day.

She was caught off guard when Isaac's hand tightened around her wrist, drawing her back into his arms. His eyes fell, lashes heavy and shadowed, masking whatever storm brewed beneath. But the tension in his jaw and the press of his lips made his frustration clear.

"That wasn't enough. I want to feel it." His voice was husky,filling the stillness.

Verena hesitated, studying the intensity in Isaac's eyes, unsure what storm brewed behind his steady gaze.

Obliging him, she leaned in once more, pressing another soft kiss to his lips, careful and delicate-almost like sealing a promise.

But Isaac's eyes never left her mouth, darkening with frustration. "That's not enough," he said, his voice low and rough. "I want more."

His tone was deeper now, an edge of hunger threading through each word.

Verena felt a flicker of confusion at his insistence. Isaac could be passionate, but he'd never demanded a kiss with such raw need before.

Still, she let the thought go, giving in to the moment.

She moved closer, this time letting her lips linger and part against his, lightly tracing and sucking on his lower lip.	A

A faint trace of cherry blossom drifted between them-her signature scent, soft and distinct.

But Isaac only grew more restless.

His breath came heavier, and he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed. "You can bite," he whispered, voice drenched in longing.

The words startled her, making her freeze for a heartbeat, her eyes darting away in uncertainty,flustered by the unfamiliar boldness in his request.

Verena searched his eyes, certain he had to be teasing, but found nothing playful in his gaze.

A long pause hung between them. Then, with a mix of teasing and genuine wonder, she asked, "Isaac, since when were you into this sort of thing?" She didn't get a chance to hear his answer. Isaac caught her words on his mouth, kissing her hard, his hand threading through her hair and holding her close, his touch full of urgent longing.

Her protests melted away, lost against his lips.

His hunger for her was overwhelming, a force that left her breathless and shaken in his arms.
###Chapter 272 Meeting


Verena pressed her palms against Isaac's broad chest, intending to pause and catch her breath. Yet, the moment she tried to retreat, he leaned forward with eager persistence.

Startled, her brows knitted, and a faint hum slipped from her lips.

Isaac's gaze was unreadable; instead of giving her space, he closed in further, his grip fastening firmly around her waist, leaving her no path of escape.

His kisses fell gently, one after another, wrapping the room in an air of tenderness, almost paintingthe walls with quiet romance.

By the time they finally made their way downstairs for breakfast, the sun had already climbed high,its golden rays pouring through the vast windows and bathing the living room in warmth.

After the closeness of that morning, Isaac spoke nothing of the night before.

His expression and manner carried no difference, as though what had unfolded the previous night had been no more than a passing dream.

Verena, however, was leftunsettled. Last night, she had nearly fallen apart, her tears soaking into his clothes.

She knew Isaac well enough-he was not the kind of man to ignore her grief, nor one to wear indifference like armor.

Yet here he was, silent, not asking a single question, not even showing curiosity.

Why?

Her thoughts tangled, drifting back unwillingly to the night just gone.

She recalled vividly the sorrow in his eyes when he had spoken of his late father, the remorse etched into every word. For months, he had carried that torment, branding himself guilty for the accident that had stolen his father's life.

But now the tides were shifting.

If he ever learned that the root of that tragedy lay with her, how would he look at her then?

With bitter accusations? Or with a gulf of silence that no bridge could cross?

Verena dared not trace the thought further, yet shé knew some truths refused to stay buried.

She pressed her lips tight before finally breaking the silence.

Raising her gaze, she spoke softly. "Isaac, aren't you going to ask what happened yesterday? Don't you want to know why I said 'I'm sorry'?"

Her words dimmed his eyes instantly, like clouds snuffing out starlight.

He lowered his head, his shoulders sagging slightly.

in truth, he longed to know-curiosity gnawed at him-but fear was a crueler companion.

He dreaded the details, dreaded each word like a blade poised to carve into his heart.


He could not bear to learn why she had shed tears for another man.

So,he chose silence, hoping that time might erase what he could not confront.

At that moment, Rhonda emerged from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of soup.

Grasping it as though it were a rope thrown to a drowning man, Isaac quickly took the bowl.

Scooping up a spoonful, he gently blew on it, dispersing the steam, and said in a measured tone, "This is a new recipe Rhonda has been perfecting. It's good for you and the little one. Taste it and see if you like it."

His every movement was careful, almost reverent; his lowered lashes softened his whole demeanor.

Verena watched quietly as he lifted the spoon. to her lips. After a brief hesitation, she parted themn and accepted the soup. "How does it táste?" he asked in a low voice.

"Delicious." Verena nodded gently, forcing a faint smile.

Yet the words she truly wished to speak pressed hard against her tongue, restless, begging release.

But when she looked into his eyes--so gentle, so steady-her courage ebbed away like sand slipping through an hourglass.

With a sigh that she swallowed inwardly, she told herself now was not the time. Better to wait, to speak only when the dust of all this had settled.

Lowering her gaze, she tried to smother the storm within, not wanting him to see the turbulence beneath her calm surface.

Moments later, she lifted her head again and said slowly,"Isaac, you can stopinvestigating Simon's case.I already have the answers I need. I'll meet him later-just arrange for a few bodyguards to accompany me."

After a pause, she added, "Once everything is over, there are things I must tell you."

Isaac's grip on the spoon tightened abruptly at the last part of her words, his knuckles blanching with strain.

His heart sank like a stone tossed into deep water, a dark thought flickering across his mind.

Was she going to speak of her and Ivan?

What words would fall from her lips-a farewell, or something that would cut even deeper?

He looked up at her, the guilt in her eyes causing his heartto tighten.

That was what he feared most.

For guilt was another way of asking forgiveness, and he had already heard her apology last night.

Swallowing the heaviness in his chest, Isaac forced his voice steady, nodding as he said, "Alright. I'll have Jacob arrange bodyguards to go with you."

After breakfast, Isaac left for work. Verena,with the day free, changed out of her casual clothes upstairs and dialed Simon's number.

He picked up almost at once.

"Evelyn, is it really you?" His voice, warm and tinged with delight, carried surprise.

But for Verena, the respect she once felt for Simon had withered. Now, even the sound of his voice turned her stomach.

She bit her lip before replying, "It's me. Dr. Moss, do you have time? Let's meet-I have some questions for you."

Though she remained polite, her tone stirred something in Simon's chest, unsettling him.

His brows furrowed, jealousy and displeasure rising like a tide.

The last time she had asked him to meet, he thought she might harbor feelings for him-only to find the conversation circling back to Isaac, the man in the wheelchair.

Was it the same again?

Would Isaac's shadow always stretch between them?


The bitterness tightened his grip on the phone.

Before resentment could root deeper, Verena added calmly, "It's regarding some psychological matters."

At once, Simon's expression cleared, his gloom vanishing like mist under the sun. His eyes lit up, and joy he could not hide laced his voice.

"Alright. Send me the address. I'll be there right away."
###Chapter 273 What Does That Have To Do With You


In the heart of the bustling city, inside an elegant restaurant, Verena sat in a private dining room, her fingertips drumming softly against the polished table.

It wasn't long before Simon pushed the door open and stepped inside.

He wore a crisp white shirt beneath a tailored dark suit jacket, trousers pressed to perfection-every detail carefully chosen to present his best self.

The instant his gaze landed on Verena, a smile surfaced on his lips, and a faintgleam lit his eyes.

"Verena, have you been waiting long?" he asked warmly, sliding into the seat opposite her, leaning in as though to bridge the space between them.

The way he spoke her first name carried a weight of familiarity, tinged with a trace of desire, as though they were far closer than they truly were.

Verena's brow tightened ever so slightly at the address, a quiet ripple of distaste rising within her. Yet Simon appeared blind to his boldness, keeping his expression open and sincere, as though innocence itself clothed him.

Tilting his head, his voice low and persuasive, he added, "Since this isn't the hospital and we're past working hours, I thought it would be fine to call you by your real name, Verena, instead of Evelyn or Dr.Willis...right?"

Her lips curved faintly, though inwardly she scoffed at his carefully staged humility.

She gave a small nod and answered lightly, "Of course. No problem."

The moment her words landed, a spark of concealed delight flickered in Simon's eyes.

Inside, he congratulated himself. If patience was a ladder, he believed each careful step would carry him closer into Verena's guarded heart. Masking his satisfaction, Simon recalled their previous meeting, which had unfortunately turned toward Isaac.

Determined not to stumble on the same stone twice, he redirected the conversation.

He cleared his throat, tugged discreetly at his collar, and then asked with a polite smile, "Verena, I was wondering-was there a particular aspect of psychology you wished to talk about today?"

Verena lifted her chin slightly, her gaze steady as water yet sharp as glass. Her voice rang calm and deliberate. "To be honest, I'd already done a fair amount of research on you before we met today."

His modest mask slipped for a heartbeat-eyebrows arching, eyes widening-before disbelief gave way to visible delight.

In his mind, he convinced himself she was truly intrigued by him.

Catching the flash of delight on his face, Verena continued evenly, "From what I've learned, Dr. Moss, you once practiced at Clokron's most renowned psychological hospital, showing remarkable brilliance at a young age. A few years ago, the field of psychology faced daunting challenges. Several complex cases baffled even the most seasoned experts. They tried every traditional method, even the newest innovations,yet nothing worked. But with sharp insight, rare patience, and unmatched skill, you succeeded where others failed. Your efforts didn't just redeem your patients and their families-they opened new horizons for the entire field. That contribution alone deserves admiration. Beyond medicine, Dr. Moss, you're known for your generosity. Your name often appears on major donation lists, your charity work constant and sincere. Truly,you're a doctor worthy of respect."

Simon's eyes shimmered, every word feeding his vanity like a thirsty plant drinking in the rain.

A smug smile ghosted across his lips, so brief it almost went unnoticed.

Inside, he reveled in the fact that wearing Simon Moss's identity was like carrying a master key-it opened doors straight into Verena's esteem.

But quickly adjusting his expression, he straightened his tie with a gentleman's air and replied with measured grace, "These were merely my duties. I only did what I could. As for the charity work, that's the least I can offer. But you, Verena..." He smiled warmly. "You've cured countless difficult cases yourself. Every medical student looks up to you. Honestly, the reason I entered this field at all was largely because you inspired me-

Before he could finish, Verena's eyes snapped to his, cold and cutting.

That gaze, sharp as an eagle's, seemed to strip away his carefully constructed facade and pierce straight to the marrow.

Her voice, soft yet heavy with steel, cut him short. "But I was talking about Dr. Moss. What does that have to do with you?"

The words fell quiet as snowfall, yet struck like a hammer. Simon froze, his rehearsed speech crumbling to dust.

Her stare held him in place; his smile warped, and his heart clenched as if caught in a vice.

Still, he forced composure, his throat tight, his voice trembling beneath its casual mask. "But I am Simon Moss, Verena. I don't understand what you mean."

Verena did not answer at once. Her silence pressed in on him like a storm cloud, her gaze unyielding.

His hands curled into fists under the table, knuckles blanching as the pause stretched.

At last, she narrowed her eyes, each word edged in frost. "You don't know what I mean? A thief long enough begins to believe the stolen life is his own. Carl Aguilar, you killed Simon, didn't you?"

It wasn't a question but a verdict.

Simon's temple throbbed.

From her words, he realized the mask had slipped, the truth laid bare. She knew.

And if his secret was out, there was no sense in clinging to the charade.

Like a mask ripped from the stage, his tenderness vanished. In its place rose a twisted obsession,.dark and merciless.

His gaze locked on Verena-predatory, coiled, his eyes like a serpent fixing on its prey."SO111he drawled,his voice cold, "you've been investigating me all this time, Evelyn."

A hollow chuckle followed. "I still prefer Evelyn. That's what I called you the first time we met, remember?"
###Chapter 274 Time For You To Show Up


Verena remained silent, her gaze sharp and unyielding, like shards of ice piercing through Carl.

His mouth twitched, his lips curling into a smile that was both crooked and false.

The smile was not warmth-it was distortion incarnate, a flicker of madness masquerading as charm.

"Since you figured it out, it means I have a place in your life," he said. "Yes... I am Carl. I killed Simon Moss,but everything I did was to win you over."

Verena's brows drew together, a deep crease forming, heavy with disdain.

Her clear, unwavering eyes reflected pure disgust, as if she were staring at the embodiment of something vile.

Carl gripped the edge of the table, leaning in, his voice trembling with obsession and frustration. "Do you look at me with disgust now? Stop it! You must understand-no one has ever loved you as I do. Everything I've done... it's all for you."

Verena let out a cold, short snort, thick with scorn.

She fixed him.with a steady gaze, her words slow and deliberate. "Love? Stop insulting that word! What you catl love is selfishness. You killed my grandmother and orchestrated Isaac's car accident-all for you. Is that love? It's despicable!"

Her grandmother's death, Isaac's father's death, and Isaac's suffering-all traced back to the man before her.

Verena clenched her fists, her nails nearly cutting into her palms, her body trembling with restrained fury.

Carl's handsome features now twisted into something monstrous. His face, once familiar, was now a demon's mask, raw and terrifying.

His eyes bulged, bloodshot and feral behind his glasses, and he roared,"Of course! Isn't this love? I didn't want to hurt your grandmother, but if I didn't find a way to make you return home, you would have agreed to be with Isaac. I love you... how could I let that happen? How could he have the woman I can't?"

Rising to his full height, his expression nearly unrecognizable, he continued, "Evelyn, why? I met you at the same time as Isaac. Why him and not me? Because of his proud family? You look down on me, dismiss me,never even consider me. But I can reach that level too!"

He trembled, pointing at his elegant clothes, his mneticulously recreated appearance. "Look! I have Simon's life now. I surpass most people. I am no less than lsaac."

His voice carried manic intensity, echoing through the room's tense silence. "Whatever you desire, Evelyn, I will seize it. And if I cannot seize it... I will destroy the world to claim it."

His gaze never wavered from hers, a storm of obsession, madness, and bitter resentment.

Then, slowly, his eyes drifted downward-to her slightly swollen belly.

In that instant, his eyes froze, a flare of outrage igniting in his chest.

"I want nothing else," he said, veins throbbing on his forehead like restless snakes. "End his child. Do that,and we can bury the past. We'll find peace, a quiet life together, undisturbed."

He smiled, twisted and eager, lost in a dream only he could see.

Hearing Carl admit to his crimes, Verena's eyes widened in disbelief, pupils shrinking as molten rage rose inside her.

The murderous heat in her gaze could shred him to pieces.

Unable to contain herself, she stood abruptly, slamming her hands on the table with a resounding crash that sent glasses rattling.

"Lunatic! Pervert!" Her voice broke with fury,almost a hysterical shout.

"Carl... you ask why I chose Isaac? It's because he's not vile and disgusting like you. Being desired by you is the gravest insult I've endured. Had I known your true nature, I would have left you to rot in your ruin." She lowered her hands to rest on her belly, her voice gentler but firm. "This child... is the fruit of our love.Isaac and I will nurture them, give them all the love they deserve."

Her eyes rose again, cold and disdainful. "And you... you will always lurk in others' shadows, stealing names and faces like a rat in the dark, reeking of everything vile. You will never know true love, nor will you ever deserve it."

Carl stared,capturing the unmasked hatred in her gaze-a look like an icy blade sinking into his heart.

His maniacal eyes flared, refusing to accept reality.

He lunged at her, but two bodyguards intercepted him, restraining his struggling arms with iron grip.

"No! You can't do this! You can't hate me!" he shouted, voice ragged. "Everything I did... it was for you!"

"Everything you did?" Verena stepped forward, unshaken. "Everything you did only hurt the people I love.Carl,know this-I will repay the pain you caused a thousandfold."

"Ha ha ha..." He erupted into laughter, sharp, unhinged, and bone-chilling, his body shaking with madness.

"Evelyn... you cannot defeat me. I still have Luis. He obeys me. If you come for me, he will fight Isaac to the death. You know what Luis is capable of. Do you think Isaac will survive?"

Then, as if flipping a switch, his expression softened, his voice dripping with feigned sweetness."Darling...let me go. You and I are meant to be. No one else is worthy."

"Really?" Verena's tone was calm but cutting.′′Arnd how can you be so sure Luis will help you? If that's the case, I can call and check."

Shock crossed his face as Verena, unhesitating, pulled out her phone and dialed.. Sampson... please come in. It's time for you to show up."
###Chapter 275 Did I Say You Could Move


Verena's words struck Carl like a bolt of lightning, freezing him in place. The smug arrogance on his face hadn't yet faded when shock came crashing in like a tidal wave.

His eyes widened, pupils shrinking to pinpoints-dark whirlpools spinning with fear and disbelief.

Luis?

"What do you mean? What the hell are you saying?"

Carl's voice shattered into a sharp, quivering roar, raw with panic.

Why on earth would she be in touch with Luis?

Confusion clouded Carl's gaze-until a thought slammed into him, cold as ice, sinking his heart to the floor.

Could it be that Luis had already realized Verena was his sister?

Otherwise, Luis would never have turned against him.

Carl realized that if it were true-if Luis had seen through the ruse all along-then, knowing Luis, he was a dead man walking.

Panic tore at Carl from the inside, a feral beast he could not contain. His gaze fixed on Verena, desperate to read some answer in her expression.

Then his eyes darted to Verena's slightly rounded belly-and in that instant, his madness crystallized into ruthless resolve.

He couldn't lose here.

If he failed, he'd never have another chance at Verena.

He knew all too well the depth of Luis' ruthlessness. The thought sent a shiver down Carl's spine, yet the mania in his eyes only flared hotter, like twin flames devouring the night.

Possessed by a blind frenzy, he thrashed violently. The bodyguards clamped down, locking his arms tight.

But with sheer force and wild desperation, Carl jerked free.

In the same breath, he lunged like a predator, snatching the gleaming knife from the table.

With a crazed snarl, he charged at Verena.

The motion was fluid, lightning-quick.

Verena had scarcely a heartbeat to react before the blade swept toward her stomach.

At the final instant, the door burst open-Luis stormed in like a raging gale.

His eyes narrowed, fixing on Carl's motion. Without hesitation, he struck with a brutal kick.

His boot connected hard-the knife flew from Carl's grasp, clattering across the floor.

Before Carl could even register who it was, Luis slammed another savage kick square into his chest.

Agony exploded through Carl's body as he was hurled back, crashing to the floor several feet away.

He lay pale as chalk, blood spilling from his mouth, his body convulsing.

As Carl struggled to rise, he finally saw the attacker. Terror flared in his eyes, while pain tore through his chest,robbing him of breath.

Their eyes met briefly-Carl's mind whirled in chaos.

Luis being here was no accident. He and Verena had planned this.

And from that look, it was obvious Luis alreadyknew he'd been deceived.

Carl knew begging was futile; pleading with Luis was no different from bargaining with Death itself.
 
Cornered, his only choice was to fight and wager everything on survival. Clenching his teeth against the pain, Carl scrambled toward the fallen knife.

But Luis had no intention of giving him the chance.

In a blur, Luis stomped down hard on Carl's hand.

His boot crushed mercilessly, bones crunching under the weight with sickening clarity.

A scream tore from Carl's throat. It bounced off the walls, high-pitched and desperate, echoing like a warning bell.

Luis ground his boot further into Carl's hand, the pain shooting straight to the bone, twisting Carl's face into something unrecognizable.

Veins bulged across Carl's forehead, pounding so violently it seemed they might tear through his skin. His eyes reddened, his mouth stretched wide as one harrowing scream after another ripped free. He writhed on the floor, thrashing like a man condemned to hell itself.

Yet Luis' boot stayed firm, pressing as though to pulverize every bone in Carl's hand.

"What the hell did you think you were doing, huh?" Luis pressed harder, eyes narrowing, lips curling. "Did I say you could move?"

Carl howled, agony spilling from every fiber of him.

Luis radiated pure killing intent, a storm cloaked in human form.

Luis stared down at Carl, his eyes icy cold, stripped of all mercy.

Moments before, hearing Carl's deranged roar, Luis, who had reached the door, knew something was wrong.

The instant he pushed the door open, he saw Verena nearly gutted by the same monster who dared use her against him.

She was his blood, his treasure-the sister he had braved hell and returned to claim.

She was his untouchable boundary, and anyone who dared to cross it was already marked for death. Carl had crossedit.

If it weren't for his agreement with Verena, Luis would have ripped him apart and exacted payment in blood.

Luis struggled to leash the killing urge, restraining the need to end Carl instantly.

But rage churned in him, a volcano ready to erupt.

Slowly, Luis raised his boot. Carl gasped in fleeting relief, his hand bruised and useless, trembling as he struggled to rise.

Luis wasn't done.

Before Carl could rise halfway, Luis drove a vicious kick straight into his gut.

With a resounding thud, Carl was hurled back once more, crashing hard onto the floor.

Luis didn't stop-his eyes blazing as he delivered another brutal kick, as though intent on pulverizing Carl's insides.

Kick after kick crashed into him. Carl writhed, arms curled in a feeble shield, groans and desperate pleas slipping through clenched teeth.

Luis didn't hear a single word.
###Chapter 276 He'll Never Walk Again


Carl writhed on the floor, his throat releasing nothing but broken whimpers.

Verena watched the rise and fall of his chest grow weaker, his body trembling as though he might collapse into unconsciousness at any second.

Luis, however, showed no signs of restraint, his fury still pouring out in merciless blows. For a moment, she feared he would kill the man outright.

Her voice cut through the chaos. "Enough."

At once, Luis stilled, freezing mid-motion at her command.

He turned slowly, veins still bulging at his temple, the remnants of rage pulsing beneath his skin.

When his eyes met Verena's, the fire inside them dimmed, smothered beneath something heavier-guilt,sorrow, self-reproach.

His heart ached knowing that his little sister had come so closeto being hurt by that monster, and the blame rested squarely on his own shoulders for not keeping her safe.

A steady breath escaped him, an attempt to rein in the storm.

"Tell me what you want done," he said, his tone softened now. "Whatever you decide, it will be carried out."

Verena's gaze sharpened, her eyes like shards of ice locked on Carl's crumpled form. He looked less like a man and more like a stray animal beaten past recognition.

Her voice dropped into a chilling calm, each word sharpened with venom. "He murdered my grandmother.He destroyed a life that should have been spared. And he left lsaac in his current state. Death is too merciful. I want himto taste a pain worse than anything he's ever inflicted."

Her glare hardened, her jaw tight with fury. "Isaac's legs were hurt, leaving him in a chair. I want Carl to share the same fate." Her teeth clenched as she spat the words and then turned to the guards flanking the room. "Break his legs.Make sure he never walks again."

The bodyguards, trained to obey without hesitation, moved in like shadows, their faces expressionless as they closed around Carl.

For the briefest moment, hope had flickered in Carl's eyes. Verena had stopped Luis' cruelty-surely it meant she still cared, that she might spare him.

But the hope was short-lived. What he received was not mercy, but a sentence colder than death.

Before he could even drag himself out of the haze of pain, a ring of bodyguards closed in tight around him.

Their fists and boots rained down with merciless precision, each strike slamming into his legs with a sickening thud, like hammers breaking rotten timber.

Agony ripped through him, sharp and unrelenting, as though molten steel needles were being driven deep into his bones. The torment crashed over him in waves, leaving him teetering on the edge of unconsciousness.

His body convulsed on the floor, thrashing weakly in a hopeless attempt to crawl free, but there was no escape fromn the storm.

Amidst the chaos, his eyes sought Verena's.

Bloodshot and swollen, they glistened with raw pain, laced with confusion and disbelief.

Why?

Why would she do this to him?

Didn't she have even the slightest trace of affection for him?

Was there truly nothing left between them but venom and vengeance?

In his broken stare lingered a faint, desperate plea-some flicker of hope that she might relent, that she might show mercy at the last possible moment. But Verena's face remained an unyielding mask, her gaze sharp and frozen, unfouched by pity.

Beside her, Luis shifted slightly, his attention drawn not to Carl but to his sister. There was a flicker of astonishment in his eyes.

In his mind, Verena had always embodied the healer's vow, a doctor bound by instinct to preserve life, even the life of an enemy.

He had assumed she would falter, that hatred might shake her but never carry her far enough to deliver true punishment. His original plan had been simple-show restraint in front of her, and then dispose of Carl afterward, sparing her the cruelty.

Instead, Verena shattered every expectation.

Her decisiveness left no cracks for hesitation. She wielded her hatred with the precision of a scalpel,ruthless and absolute.

Even as Carl's gaze pleaded with her, searching for the woman he thought he knew, she remained still as stone.

A faint smile tugged at the corner of Luis' mouth, his eyes glinting with pride as he looked at Verena.

She truly was his sister, a daughter of the Sampson family.

At her command, the bodyguards pressed in with merciless force, their boots striking down without hesitation.

Carl crumpled to the floor, his body curling in on itself like a broken shell.

His jaw worked soundlessly as blood spilled from his lips in violent bursts, splattering across the floor until it pooled into a bright, spreading stain.

The sharp crimson against his ghastly pallor made the scene grotesque, almost surreal.

Sweat matted his hair, plastering it to his temples and cheeks, the strands streaked with streaks of scarlet.

The polished composure he carried into the room had disintegrated completely, leaving only a wreck of a His limbs sprawled uselessly across the floor, too drained to twitch, every breath scraping through his throat like knives carving at flesh.

Vision clouded under the weight of agony, the world around him dissolving into flickering shadows.

His mind slipped further and further away, his consciousness fraying as if it were tearing free of his body,drifting toward a dark void.

Then, out of the haze, memory dragged him backward.

Once, he hadn't been Simon at all-he had been Carl.

The ruins of Clokron rose up before him once more, streets torn apart and drowned in chaos.

Smoke choked the sky, thick and acrid, clawing at his lungs until every breath seared with fire.

He remembered lying face-down on the frozen ground, dust caking his mouth and nose, every gasp a losing battle.

Blood seeped from his wounds in a steady stream, the cold stealing warmth from his body faster than he could cling to life.

In those fading moments, Carl was certain death had come for him.
-
And then, through the haze, he saw it-a flash of white cutting through the ruin, a figure descending like an angel into the wreckage.

Through the haze of smoke and dust, Verena had appeared in a white coat, running toward him with fierce determination, her bangs whipping in the wind.

Even blurred by ash and ruin, her eyes had shone with raw concern.

Carl still remembered the wordsthat had cut through the chaos. "Give me your hand. I'll get you out."

Her palm had reached for him without hesitation, steady and sure. That moment had pulled him back from death's edge, tearing him out of the abyss that threatened to swallow him whole.

It had been the single most unforgettable instant of his lfe.

Now, as agony dragged him under once again, the memory twisted cruelly over the present.

Summoning the last shreds of his strength, Carl lifted his arm, every inch feeling like it weighed a thousand pounds, and from his shredded throat rasped a broken plea. "Evelyn... save me.."

The words were weak, pitiful, almost childlike.

Verena moved in his direction with measured steps.

The bodyguards instantly tightened their grip, forcing Carl down against the floor, unwilling to let him lash out.

His eyes locked on her figure, a flicker of hope igniting through the blood and haze.

The woman who had once pulled him back from hell would surely save him again.

But the hope shattered the moment she knelt before him. Her gaze was ice, her focus fixed not on his face A but on his legs. Slender fingers reached out, pressing firmly against his kneecap with clinical precision.

A white-hot bolt of pain shot through him, racing up his bones until it stole the air from his lungs.
-
His eyes flew wide, his teeth grinding together, terror bleeding through every line of his face.

He struggled instinctively, but the guards pinned him down with ease.

Expressionless, Verena shifted her weight, testing the joint beneath her hand as if she were diagnosing a patient.

Her verdict fell cold and final. "Good. He'll never walk again."

The words sank like shards of ice into Carl's chest, piercing through the last fragile thread of hope he clung to. He tilted his head back and released a long, broken cry that echoed with pain.
###Chapter 277 Help Me Rescue Someone


Carl turned his head, his gaze colliding with Verena's.

In that instant, he saw it-hatred so fierce it could freeze the marrow, eyes colder than the dead of winter,merciless and sharp as ice.

The reality cut deeper than any blade, yet he could not bring himself to accept it. Tears streamed from his bloodshot eyes, etching desperate tracks across cheeks already smeared with blood.

"Evelyn, you can't do this to me!" he cried out, his voice breaking, every word laced with sobs.

Verena regarded him quietly, her expression as firm and unyielding as stone. "Why can't l? Carl, from the moment you laid hands on those I love, you should have known this day would come."

Carl stiffened.His mind went blank. Only her words-chilling,final-echoed again and again in his ears.

It was then he understood: nothing could be undone; the road ahead was sealed.

Verena turned her eyes away, as though even another glance at him would stain her vision.

Rising to her feet, she shifted to Luis. Her voice was calm, crisp, cutting clear through the air."I'll hand every shred of evidence of Carl's murder of Simon Moss to the Clokron police. I know you hold some ties there,Mr.Sampson. I wonder if you'd do me a favor."

Luis' heart leapt at the chance to assist his sister.

Stepping forward, leaning closer, he asked softly, "What is it you need?"

Verena's words came slow, deliberate, each syllable heavy with intent. "Send a crippled man into the most chaotic,tangled prison in Clokron. That shouldn't be difficult for you, should it, Mr. Sampson?"

The phrase crippled man struck like a hammer, emphasizing Carl's pitiful state.

The Sampson family's reach was wide overseas, its influence like a kingdom abroad. For Luis, her request was no mountain at all.

A faint smile tugged at his lips. "Not a problem. Just a matter of words."

Verena inclined her head in gratitude. "Good. Then I thank you in advance."

Her gaze slid once more to the broken figure on the floor. With lips pressed tight, her voice calm,she added, "My debts are settled. Mr. Sampson, I'll leave the rest in your hands."

With that,she turned and left, her bodyguards following at her heels.

The moment she disappeared, Luis' eyes sharpened. At the wave of his hand, the men stationed outside poured in.

More than a dozen hulking figures lined up before him, silent, awaiting orders.

Luis' tone was low, but carried the weight of thunder. "Until I say stop, no one stops."

"Yes, sir!" came the unified reply, and the men surged toward Carl cowering in the corner.

He tried to crawl back, but his legs were dead weights, refusing to move.

Blows fell on him like a mefciless storm. Instinct drove his arms to shield his head and chest, but such defense was no more than paper before the flood.

Luis, untouched by the violence, slipped a cigar from his pocket, fitting it with grace between his lips. The lighter sparked, its flame dancing briefly against his stern features.

He inhaled, and then exhaled, thick smoke spiraling into ghostly rings.

Through them, he stared coldly at the figure writhing on the floor, as though the scene were a play staged for someone else's amusement.

Were it not for his sister's insistence that Carl be handed to the Clokron police, Luis would have silenced him the moment she stepped away.

With a final drag, he crushed the glowing cigar into the ashtray, sparks fading to nothing. Lifting his head, his narrowed eyes glinted with frost. "Stop."

The word cracked like a whip. Instantly, the beating ceased.

Carl lay gasping, clutching his chest, coughing so violently it seemed his very organs might burst forth.Blood spilled past his lips, a gruesome tide.

Luis read his condition at a glance-the earlier storm of fists had likely shattered him inside.

Carl's face was a grotesque mask, bruised and swollen, mottled with colors of pain.

The golden-rimmed glasses, once his badge of pride, were now broken shards embedded in his cheek,streaks of blood flowing down.

Hands in his pockets, Luis walked toward him, every step measured, cold.

The disguise stripped away, Carl lay exposed,pitiful, wretched.

His bloodied hand trembled as he reached out, clutching at Luis' flawless suit pants like a drowning man grasping driftwood.

"Spare me... spare me..." he whispered hoarsely.
A
Luis' brows knitted, disgust flickering in his eyes. Without hesitation, he kicked the hand away.

Like a kite with a snapped string, Carl's arm flung aside, his body slamming into the cabinet behind him,wringing a tortured groan from his throat.

Luis' voice cut down like steel. "The fact that you're still breathing is the greatest mercy."

He bent slightly, pressing the tip of hisshoe onto Carl's shattered leg bone, leaning down slowly,deliberately, each ounce of pressure a fresh torment.

Carl's features twisted in agony, veins swelling, sweat pouring like rain as his scream split the air.

Luis was unmoved, deaf to the sound, his eyes as merciless as winter night.

"Do not worry. I'll protect the one you love because.." He leaned closer, his voice deep, chilling. "She is my Verena stepped from the restaurant, a shadow of weariness veiling her face.

Carl's ###Chapter was closed.

But Isaac?

Should she reveal the truth about the car accident now?

Her thoughts were tangled, her mind blank.

She exhaled softly, seeking calm amidst the storm inside.

Just then, her phone rang.

She frowned,pulled it out-lvan.

Sliding to answer, she didn't even manage a greeting before his frantic voice rushed through the line, quick as gunfire. "Verena, come with me to Crilizult. Help me rescue someone, please! Only you can save her."

His tone carried both urgency and despair, trembling even through the speaker.

Verena's heart tightened; Ivan's panic was plain.

For someone as fearless as Ivan to lose composure, the person in danger must hold immense weight in his heart.

Without a beat of hesitation, Verena steadied her voice."Ivan, calm yourself. I'll go with you to Crilizult-right now."
###Chapter 278 Ivan Again


Hanging up,Verena quickened her steps toward the car waiting by the curb.

Just as her fingers brushed the handle, a bodyguard's arm shot out like a barrier, halting her path.

She turned sharply, brows knitting, eyes flashing with bewilderment."What's the matter?"

The guard looked troubled, bowing his head as if carrying a burden. "Ma'am, Mr. Bennett instructed me not to let you go off alone. It's for your safety."

Verena's frown deepened, her tone cutting through the air.,"This is urgent. I'm going to save someone.Don't stand in the way-I'll explain to lsaac myself."

Her voice was steady, a command wrapped in steel.

The guard pressed his lips together, caught in a tug-of-war within. He knew well how lsaac regarded her-like the rarest treasure locked away from harm.

And now, with her pregnancy, both Verena and the unborn child were the very axis of Isaac's world.

He dared not push too far. If she was upset and something happened, Isaac would punish him without a second thought.

His gaze flickered between Verena's face and her rounded belly. With a helpless sigh, he yielded.

Slowly, he lowered his arm, pulled open the door, and bowed slightly. "Please,take care."

Verena offered a soft word of thanks before sliding into the seat.

The guard shut the door, eyes tracking the car until it melted into the main road. Only then did he finally look away.

With a heavy sigh, he pulled out his phone and dialed.

The call connected, Isaac's deep voice cutting across the line. "Is it settled?" The guard knew Isaac meant Carl.

Straightening,he answered with careful respect. "It's handled. Mrs. Bennett said she'll pass the evidence to the Clokron police. For now, Carl is in Luis' custody."

"Okay," Isaac said curtly, mind drifting to Verena's pregnancy and how severely morning sickness had been wearing her down.

"Did she go home to rest?" he asked.

The guard hesitated, and then spoke carefully. "After leaving the restaurant, Mrs. Bennett received a call from someone named Ivan. She's leaving with him for Crilizult. I tried to stop her, but she insisted. Icouldn't hold her back."

Isaac tightened his grip on his pen.

The paper tore under his hand, a jagged gash slicing it open.

His grip tightened even more, knuckles whitening. His expression clouded over, dark as a storm brewing on the horizon.

Ivan.

Again!

How many times had this cycle repeated?

One call-and Verena vanished.

What a cruelly simple trick.

Grinding his teeth, Isaac forced the words through clenched jaws. "Did she say why?"

The guard replied at once, "She said it was to save someone."

Isaac's brow furrowed, a vein throbbing at his temple. He bit the words out, low and harsh. "I know."

And with that, he ended the call in gloom. Leaning back hard in the leather chair, he tipped his head against it, throat taut as his breath dragged rough and uneven.

His gaze locked on the ceiling, eyes dark with frustration, chest heaving with restless weight.

Strangled by it, he clawed at his tie, tugging until the knot gave way.

Once neat and precise, it now sagged uselessly against his shirt. With a sharp pull, he tore it free and flung it aside.

But the suffocating heaviness only thickened.

His eyes darkened further, like thunderclouds about to burst. After a few harsh breaths, he snatched his phone,calling Jacob.

The moment Jacob answered, Isaac's voice cut like a blade. "Cancel the meeting. Book me the next flight to Crilizult."

He didn't wait for acknowledgment, just hung up, spun his wheelchair, and drove it toward the door.

At Shoildon Airport, Verena met Ivan without trouble.

He clutched the tickets tightly, urgency written in every move as he pulled her toward the gate.

While they scanned their passes, Verena asked, "Ivan, what's going on? Why the rush?"

Ivan's face was stricken, eyes rimmed red, voice trembling. "It's Luciana. She was in a car crash. Head injury. The doctors in Crilizult said they can't operate."

Verena knew Luciana Murray was the woman Ivan cared for, though they had never crossed paths.

At those words, Verena's chest tightened. The head-most delicate, most unforgiving of places.

The situation was graver than she had imagined.

Yet she steadied herself, voice calm and anchoring. "Don't panic. The flight to Crilizult is only ninety minutes. We'll make it in time. Don't let fear defeat you before we even arrive." Ivan nodded stifly, though worry clung to him like a shadow.

Tickets checked, they boarded swiftly.

Less than two hours later, the plane touched down in Crilizult Airport.

Verena and Ivan hurried straight to the hospital.

A nurse rushed forward, guiding them down a long corridor, into an elevator, and finally into an office.

Inside, several doctors sat around a table, brows furrowed, the air heavy wit debate.

As Verena entered, one older doctor-Huxley Gordon-froze in astonishment. So this was the famed Evelyn?Young, striking, and far from the picture he had painted inhis mind.

His gaze lingered, edged with awe.

Verena extended her hand politely. "Hello, I'm Evelyn. Or you may call me Verena."

Huxley quickly rose, grasping her hand with both of his, relief and respect lighting his face. "Evelyn, what an honor. I've heard of your brilliance for years. To finally meet you-so young, yet already so accomplished-it inspires nothing but admiration."

A "Thank you," Verena replied with a faint smile, bowing her head modestly.

But her expression sharpened, voice brisk and urgent. "A life is hanging by a thread. Tell me the patient's exact condition so I can prepare for surgery at once."

Huxley nodded rapidly."Yes, of course."

The corridor lights blazed white as Verena strode toward the OR. Calm yet swift, her steps carried the quiet authority of someone who had walked into storms before.

Time was slipping fast, but her presence radiated strength-steel wrapped in serenity.
###Chapter 279 Seeing Verena So Near Another Man


A nurse, swift and efficient, handed over a sterile gown.

Verena accepted it with practiced calm.

She lowered her head, slid her arms smoothly through the sleeves, and then straightened the collar and hem with precise movements.

The process was seamless-without a pause, as natural as breathing.

Yet, even as her hands moved, her ears stayed sharp, catching every word as Huxley outlined the case.

"The patient was in a car crash--limbs bear only scrapes, nothing grave. The real wound lies in the head.Glass shattered, shards pierced the skull-several large pieces are lodged inside. It's a hard case," Huxley said gravely.

Verena's brows drew together, questions spilling like a quickened stream. "Where exactly are the shards?How deep? Any sign of intracranial bleeding? And the patient's level of consciousness?"
A
Adjusting his glasses, Huxley admired her sharpness and repied without delay, "The fragments sit in the right hemisphere. Depth runs about an inch. There's minor intracranial bleeding, but no major hematoma yet. The patient's in a coma but reacts to pain stimuli. Vitals hold, though not steady-blood pressure and heart rate fluctuate."

Stopping before the OR doors, Verena lifted her head, her gaze firm. With a calm, steady voice, she nodded,saying,"Alright. I have a clear enough picture."

Ivan followed behind, hollow-eyed, like a man carrying the weight of the world, from office to operating room.

His steps faltered; his gaze was vacant, each movement dragging as though chained.

In his mind, two images clashed: the girl's dimpled smile, and the imagined wreck that had torn it away.His chest tightened as though an invisible fist had clenched around his heart, stealíng his breath.

Verena was about to enter, but catching Ivan's state, she turned back to his shattered figure.

Her tone softened, steady as a hand on troubled waters. "Don't worry. I'H do everything I can."

Ivan moistened his pale, cracked lips, nodding stiffly, a puppet barely held by strings.

Then his gaze lifted-eyes swimming with helplessness and desperate plea. His voice rasped. "I trust you.You have to save her."

The sight struck at Verena's chest.

But doctors know better than to hand out absolute verdicts. False hope is poison, despair a double-edged blade, and promises unkept cut deepest of all.

So she sighed gently, her gaze earnest. "Ivan, I'll give it everything I have. But medicine is riddled with uncertainty-things may turn at any moment. I can't give you an absolute promise. Yet as long as there's a thread of hope, I won't let go. You, too, must brace yourself-for whatever comes."

Ivan's lips trembled. Words clung to his throat, but only a broken whimper slipped free.

His hands dangled weakly, fingers twitching in spasms.

At length, he nodded slowly, as though surrendering the last of his strength.

Once carefree, now crushed to fragments-his ruin made Verena's heart clench. Yet as a doctor, precision was her creed; every word had to bear its weight.

She pressed her lips, said no more, slipped on her mask, and pushed through the OR doors. The doors sealed shut, the red "In Surgery" light glowing above.

Ivan stood frozen, staring, as though his soul had been left on the other side.

Then his knees gave way, sliding down the wall.

Crouched low, his hands covered his face, muffled sobs leaking through trembling fingers. His shoulders heaved, soft cries echoing faintly through the empty corridor.

Passing nurses and waiting families cast pitying glances, but lvan saw none of them. He was drowned in grief, his tears slipping through his hands and darkening the floor.

Inside, cold light washed the OR.

Verena took up the scalpel with precision, incising the scalp, the nurses quick at her side.

Her every move was steady, caIculated, sparing blood and sparing trauma.

When the shards came into sight, lodged deep in fragile brain tissue, sweat gathered on her brow-but her gaze did not falter.

She clamped each fragment with forceps, easing it out bit by bit.

Time itself seemed suspended-only the beeping machines and her measured breath filled the room.

At last, after long and grueling labor, every shard was removed.

Pressing her dry lips, she moved forward-suturing, stopping blood, repairing what damage she could.

When the final stitch was tied, she exhaled deeply, one hand bracing her aching waist as she stepped back

One of the nurses, catching sight of her belly, rushed close. "Are you alright?"

Verena nodded slightly. "I'mn fine. I'll leave the follow-up to you."

With that,she walked out.

Outside, the "In Surgery" light dimmed, and Ivan's heart lurched again.

His gaze was fixed on the doors. The instant Verena appeared, he sprang forward.

He stood before her-eyes red, lips trembling.

He tried to speak, but his throat locked, words piling like stones behind silence.

Seeing him, Verena patted his shoulder lightly. "It's okay-she's out of immediate danger. But waking will depend on her willpower."

At those words, Ivan's taut nerves unraveled. His whole frame buckled, strength deserting him in an instant.

Verena caught him quickly.

Just then, Isaac arrived in haste.

His hands froze on the wheels, his eyes locking onto the two pressed close.

His gaze flickered-worry, doubt, and beneath it all, jealousy's bitter fire, seeing Verena so near another man.
###Chapter 280 Could He Have Been Mistaken From The Start


"Verena." Isaac's voice carried a trace of unease as it cut through the corridor.

At the sound, Verena instinctively pulled her hands away from Ivan and turned, surprise flashing in her eyes when she saw Isaac sitting in his wheelchair not far off.

The moment she stepped back, a gulf opened between her and Ivan.

Ivan remained in place, his eyes swollen and red, grief clouding his expression.

Isaac's eyes settled on Ivan at last, and the sight of his tear-stained face and shaking sobs made him stop in his tracks.

His eyes then shifted back to Verena. She stood in her white coat at the OR doors, her shoulders heavy with exhaustion, looking as if she had just walked out of a long operation.

In that instant, Isaac's jealousy crumbled, replaced by guilt.

It became painfully clear, Verena had been telling the truth. She had been saving a life, not betraying him as his doubts had suggested.

Verena blinked herself out of her daze, the corners of her lips lifting slightly as she hurried over to him.

"Isaac, why are you here?" she asked, still surprised.

His eyes flickered between her and Ivan before softening. "The guard mentioned you rushed to Crilizult.You're pregnant, and I was worried something might happen, so l came."

"I'm alright," Verena said quietly, her brows drawing together. "Ivan's friend was in a car accident. It was urgent. I just came as fast as I could, and I didn't have time to call. I'm sorry for worrying you."

Ivan's friend?

Isaac cast a look at the operating room. "Is the surgery finished?" Verena gave a small nod."Yes."

"And the condition now?" he pressed.

"The operation went smoothly, but..."

Ivan darted forward before she could finish, gripping her arm with desperation in his eyes. "Verena, if the operation worked, that means she's going to be alright, doesn't it? She'll open her eyes again, won't she?"

His voice broke apart between sobs, the words spilling out in a rush. "You've saved countless people before.Have you ever seen someone like her? Has anyone stayed unconscious even when the surgery went well?"

Ivan's composure was unraveling, his grief spilling over until he seemed completely unmoored.

Verena wrenched herself free and seized Ivan by the shoulders, her grip firm. Her voice rose as her eyes locked on his. "Ivan, look at me. Breathe. Think carefully, have I ever once failed you? Even once?"

His lips parted, but no words came out. He only shook his head.

In his eyes, Verena had always stood like a miracle worker.

She never let him down, not with her steady hands, her fierce determination, or the quiet kindness she always carried.	A

She carried herself with such certainty that it felt like nothing in the world could stand in her way.

Once his trembling eased, Verena pressed on. "Luciana's situation is serious, but far from hopeless. The operation went well. Her chances of waking up are strong. But the injury is delicate, so even if she regains consciousness, complications may remain. With careful rehab and the right therapies, I can guide her step by step toward recovery. For now, the most important thing is that she wakes up. You told me she's always been cheerful, full of fight. That spirit will help her through this. I believe she'll come back. But you..."

Her eyes swept over his reddened gaze, taking in the fatigue etched into his features. "You can't keep burning yourself out. If you collapse, you'll be no help to her. Take a break. I'll make sure you're the first to know when there's news."

The steadiness in her eyes poured into him, like an anchor for his shaken soul. Ivan inhaled deeply, drawing strength from her words, his breathing evening out.

Straightening his back, he managed a frail smile. "Don't worry about me. You're the one who should go rest now. You've been running nonstop for my sake. You barely got off the plane before rushing into surgery.And with the baby coming, you need rest more than anyone."

The words had barely left him when a chill crawled up his spine.

Turning his head, he found Isaac's eyes fixed on him, stern and unreadable.

Ivan stiffened, and then quickly dipped his head in greeting. "Hi, Isaac, maybe you should take your wife to a hotel to rest."

The unexpected remark made Isaac's brows rise slightly in surprise.

Ivan's words-"youur wife"-caught Isaac off guard, shaking the certainty he had clung to for so long.

For an instant, his thoughts wavered.

That small tattoo etched on Verena's collarbone-the single letter l-had always filled him with suspicion,making him believe it was tied to lvan.
A
Yet now, it seemed that the connection never existed.

Could he have been mistaken from the start?
-
He knew men well enough. If a man still harbored feelings for his ex, he would never speak to her husband in a way that openly affirmed their bond.

Isaac quickly buried the turmoil in his chest, giving only a faint nod in return.

Verena, still pale from the strain of surgery and pregnancy, felt exhaustion weighing heavily on her.

Without a word, she let Isaac guide her to a nearby hotel.

The presidential suite exuded grandeur. Soft light spilled from a glittering chandelier, washing over the carved furniture with a warm glow. The thick carpet muffled every step, plush beneath her feet like walking on clouds.

As soon as she crossed the threshold, the rich scent of freshly prepared food greeted her.
###Chapter 281 Ivan Wasn't Verena's First Love


Verena glanced over and saw the dining table already laid out, dishes steaming and fragrant, the aromas alone promising how mouthwatering they must taste.

The sight caught her off guard, and sheturned to Isaac in surprise.

At that moment, Isaac lifted his gaze. Warmth flickered in his eyes as he spoke softly. "I figured you hadn't eaten much since you left this morning, so I had everything prepared ahead of time."

A gentle heat rose within Verena's chest, melting away her earlier exhaustion.

Her lips curved into a smile, her eyes sparkling as she said, "Come, join me for the meal."

They soon sat facing each other at the table.

With practiced ease, Isaac's long fingers portioned the cod. Without lifting his eyes, he asked calmly,"IVan seemed quite on edge earlier. The one in the operating room must be someone very close to him, isn't that right?" Verena accepted the piece of tender fish he served her, nodding slowly as she ate. "Luciana and Ivan have been childhood companions, tied together since they were small. Ivan has always carried feelings for her,but with Luciana's family now so well-off, he feels unworthy. That's why, all these years, he never dared to tell her how he feels."

Her sigh slipped out, tinged with pity at the tangled fate of the two.

She failed to notice the way Isaac's skilled hands froze ever so slightly at her words.

Hearing her explanation, his doubts dissolved completely.

So it wasn't what he had imagined after all.

The girl Ivan loved was someone else-meaning Ivan was not Verena's first love. A new question stirred within Isaac: if not Ivan, then who occupied the hidden corner of Verena's heart?

His thoughts drifted, though he kept them buried.

In the blink of an eye, Isaac returned to his usual composure. His hands moved again to cut the fish, his face carrying the same gentle smile as though that flicker of unease had never been there.

The following morning, Verena was still deep in sleep when the sharp ring of the phone pierced the quiet,waking her abruptly.

It was the hospital. The moment she answered, Huxley's urgent voice rang out. "Evelyn, the patient has regained consciousness."

At once, sleep vanished from her eyes. She rose quickly. "Alright, I understand. I'll be there immediately."

Dressing in haste, she rushed to the hospital.

The corridors reeked faintly of disinfectant as she strode briskly into Luciana's room.

Ivan sat at the bedside, his gaze never leaving Luciana as he murmured softly to her.

The instant he saw Verena, he jumped to his feet, a smile breaking across his tired face. "Verena!" he called. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, bruised with fatigue, proof that sleep had abandoned him through the night.

Yet now that Luciana had woken, the heaviness on his heart seemed lifted, and he looked more spirited than before.

Relief washed through Verena as she teased lightly, "The patient needs peace and quiet. If you keep shouting,I'll throw you out."

Ivan instantly mimed zipping his lips shut.

Luciana, lying in bed, was amused. Verena moved closer, her voice gentle. "How are you feeling?".

Luciana's face was delicate and small, but her eyes-bright and lively like two clear jewels-were impossible to miss. Though her head was wrapped in bandages, her natural charm shone undiminished.

She smiled faintly,gratitude gleaming in her eyes. "I'm alright. Thank you."

Verena gave a small nod, and then began a meticulous examination, her hands steady, her movements practiced and light.

One by one, test results arrived.

She reviewed them all with care, and only when everything confirmed Luciana's safety did she let out a long,quiet breath, relief spreading into a smile.

Ivan too felt a crushing weight lift from his chest.

Turning serious, Verena explained the follow-up care to the other doctors, her tone firm, reminding them every detail required utmost attention.

When all was arranged, she turned to Ivan. "I'll leave her in their capable hands for now. Look after her well,and reach out if anything comes up. For the time being, Isaac and I must return to Shoildon."

Ivan nodded quickly, his eyes brimming with gratitude. His voice, hoarse from sleepless nights and brimming emotion, carried a rough edge. "Verena, thank you... If you hadn't rushed here without hesitation and performed surgery on Luciana, I don't dare imagine the outcome."

His head lowered slightly, as if embarrassed by the sheer weight of his thanks. His fingers fiddled with his shirt hem like a child caught between guilt and gratitude. "I truly owe you more than words can say. As I promised before-just give the word, and I'll do anything for you."

Verena's smile softened. Seeing his earnestness, she teased gently, "That's quite the oath. You're making me feel a little burdened."

She stepped closer, giving his shoulder a light pat. "No need for grand vows. Let's settle the debt with the meal I promised you earlier."

Ivan instantly grasped what she meant-she wanted to ease his sense of obligation and not trap him under the weight of a favor. That realization warmed his heart. Quietly, he swore he would protect this woman always, a bond even deeper than family.

Soon after, the plane gathered speed on the runway, lifting smoothly into the skies. Inside the cabin, calm and comfort wrapped around the passengers.

Verena and Isaac sat side by side, the window framing a boundless sea of clouds, sunlight gilding them in molten gold.

Turning to him, Verena finally shared, "The issue with Simon is settled. I didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday. The information you got is correct. His true name is Carl Aguilar. I saved him back in Clokron nothing more than a gesture of compassion, trying to pull him back from death's edge."

Her brow knitted, anger flashing across her face. "But I never imagined he would twist those feelings into obsession-so warped he would murder my grandmother, aIl just to claim me for himself."
###Chapter 282 What Did He Want Now


Verena's words sparked a flicker of surprise across Isaac's face, disbelief flooding his eyes.

He couldn't wrap his mind around how someone would hurt the family of the person they claimed to love deeply.

To him, such actions were a walking contradiction.

Turning toward Verena, Isaac searched her gaze, confusion written in his eyes. "If Carl truly loved you, why kill Shawna, your closest family? Shawna couIdn't have stood in his way. Even if there were obstacles,surely he didn't need to go to such extremes."

Meeting his eyes, Verena felt a pang of guilt ripple through her.

If he knew it hadn't been just about her grandmother...

She bit her lower lip, self-reproach flickering in her eyes, and her voice turned husky as she began slowly,"At that time, everything happened in a rush. I saved him and another man at the same moment. To me, Carl was just another patient-lheld no special feelings for him. But with the other man, things changed.Spending time together, we grew close. Admiration turned into affection, and affection blossomed into love.Between us, aside from speaking the words outright, we shared all that lovebirds could."
-
Verena paused, drawing in a shaky breath before she pressed on. "Carl must have noticed the bond between me and that man. When he discovered the man had planned a grand, public profession of love,he realized our union was only a matter of time. In panic, he lost all reason and used Shawna's death to make me leave Clokron. During my absence, that man's company faced a serious crisis that forced him back to Akoitha. Carl seized the chance, weaving his schemes in secret to bring him down, and he caused him..."

Before her words could finish, the plane jolted, tires screeching against the runway before settling into a steady halt.

The courage Verena had summoned to reveal the truth drained like sand through open fingers. Her reddened eyes blinked, and she whispered softly,"Let's go home."

Isaac stayed seated, silent, still trapped within her painful story. It was as though invisible hands were squeezing his heart until it hurt.

Conflicting emotions clouded his face, brows drawn tight, his eyes swirling with unrest.

On one side, he felt relieved that Verena had finally laid bare her past without concealment. It spoke volumes of the trust she placed in him.

On the other, a sharp bitterness gnawed at him.

So the man she once loved had been torn away by Carl's treachery.

Their love hadn't ended through quarrel or coldness, but by death-a curtain call that left no encore.

No wonder Verena could never erase that man from her heart.

Isaac's chest tightened; his eyes grew moist.

Though he felt her love for him now, he couldn't shake the memory of what she had told Miranda on the morning after their wedding, about how she could never forget her first love. That declaration lingered like a wound that refused to closea

Indeed, how could he ever measure up to the ghost of the one she lost?

Coupled with guilt, her heart would always keep a corner reserved for that man.

Isaac sighed silently.

He knew he ought to be generous, not shackled by jealousy or bitterness.

After all, no one was truly to blame.

When love is cut short at its height, it brands itself upon memory forever.

No wonder Verena carried it with her still.

Outside the airport, the crowd bustled in a noisy tide. By the roadside, a black car gleamed faintly under the sun.

Jacob stepped forward, opening the door for them. After they settled inside, he closed it gently and moved to the passenger seat.

The driver pressed the accelerator, and the car slid smoothly onto the road.

Perhaps it was the weight of recounting the past on the plane, or perhaps exhaustion from the past few days finally caught up, but Verena's eyelids grew heavy. Her body leaned unconsciously against Isaac.

"Are you tired?" Isaac shifted slightly, cradling her closer with an arm around her shoulders.

She nodded,resting her head on his chest. "Yeah, a little."

The car grew hushed. Just as she drifted toward sleep, Isaac's hand gently stroked the back of her head,his fingers weaving through her hair in a tender rhythm.

Yet her words still echoed in his mind.

Leaning close to her ear, he murmured, "Verena, let bygones rest. Don't shoulder blame that was never yours. It was Carl who destroyed the man you once loved-not you. You were a victim too. Don't carry his sin as your burden."

His voice, deep and resonant, filled the car like a steady tide. Verena opened her eyes, gazing up at him,realizing he had misunderstood.

Her lips parted, and then closed again. She hesitated, her thoughts tangled.

How desperately she wanted to tell him-the man she loved had always been him, from beginning to end.

But Carl's shadow loomed, heavy as a mountain, for his schemes had cost lsaac his father's life-all because of her.

She knew Isaac's heart: though paralyzed, he might not resent her.

Yet his father had been his most revered figure.

Even if he said he bore no grudge, could he truly strip his soul of bitterness? Verena sighed inwardly, weighed down by helplessness and frustration.

She told herself she would wait a little longer.

She needed time-time to summon the courage to face lsaac and find a way to speak the truth.

Back at Seraphina Villas, Verena headed straight to the hospital after a bit of rest, while lsaac returned to the company to handle affairs.

As she entered the hospital, before reaching her office, Julianna hurried toward her, a troubled look on her face. "Evelyn, while you were away, Mr. Sampson came looking for you several times."

Verena's brows furrowed slightly.

Luis?

What did he want now?

She opened her lips to reply, but before a sound emerged, a young nurse rushed over, flustered. "Evelyn,Mr. Sampson is waiting for you at the nurses' station... He's making it difficult for us to work." ###Chapter 283 I'm Your Brother


After listening to the young nurse's complaint, Verena felt frustration rise within her likea tide she could not hold back.

She knew Luis was not the kind of man one could simply brush aside, so she gave a small nod. "I understand. Please ask him to wait a moment. I'll put on my white coat first."

With that, she turned and slipped into the changing room.

Moments later, Verena emerged, neatly dressed in her white coat, and made her way to the nurses' station to face Luis.

There he stood, calm as a seasoned actor on his own stage. With hands buried in his pockets and his body leaning lazily against the counter, he carried himself as though the entire station belonged to him.

His high nose and tightly pressed lips, drawn slightly downward at the corners, gave off a brooding presence-like winter shadows stretching across the floor.

0
The nurses instinctively kept their distance, treating him as one would a storm cloud-best avoided.

As Verena neared, her gaze lingered on the figure who seemed carved out of authority itself. She spoke softly."Mr. Sampson."

At her voice, Luis-who only a heartbeat earlier had stood in studied nonchalance-snapped upright as though a schoolboy unexpectedly called on in class. He tugged his hands free from his pockets and faced her directly.

For a brief moment, his stern features softened, betraying a flicker of unease, as if he were eager to show his best side before her eyes.

Yet the years spent in the underworld had left him with a gravity not so easily shaken, giving him an odd mix of contradiction-both intimidating and faintly endearing. Verena, however, wasted no thought on his changing expression. She asked directly, "Mr. Sampson, what brings you here? This is a hospital, and your constant visits are hardly appropriate."

Her eyes remained clear as spring water, though their chill revealed a certain distance.

The words, cool as frost, made Luis curl his fingers unconsciously. A sting of sorrow pricked him-his sister's heart was still closed to him.

He knew such bonds could not be mended overnight; time alone could test his patience.

He pressed hislips into a thin line, bitterness flickering across his face.

Yet soon he inhaled deeply, as though summoning courage from the very air, and his posture straightened,his expression solemn.

"Mrs. Bennett," he began, voice low and hoarse, carrying a weight of sincerity. "I know my past actions bewildered you-and at times, even offended you."

He lowered his head, as if bowing beneath the burden of his own shame. "So here and now, I offer you my heartfelt apology for the rudeness and presumption I once showed."

With deliberate care, he leaned forward and bent in a deep bow.

Every movement was unhurried,solemn-etched with genuine intent.

The moment froze; nurses and patients passing by cast curious glances, but Luis seemed blind to their eyes.

Verena's own eyes flickered-confusion stirring within them. His sudden apology struck her as both unexpected and puzzling.

Her lips parted, ready to speak, but before she could utter a word, Luis pressed on. "But today, I came for more than apologies. I have something crucial to tell you. Will you grant me a little of your time?"

Her expression remained composed, her tone clipped. "Go ahead."

Luis glanced around at the crowded corridors. "A hospital is too noisy for such words. Perhaps we could find a quieter place to talk?"

Verena's eyes swept the busy corridors-doctors and nurses in motion, families brimming with anxiety.Indeed,hardly the ground for a private talk.

But memory reminded her: he had used this very excuse before, only to leave her with silence and confusion. Wariness flickered in her gaze.

Not wanting to have a lengthy conversation with him in some restaurant like before, she said, "Follow me."

She turned on her heel and walked toward the far end of the corridor.

Luis, catching her intent, gestured to his assistant.

A folder was swiftly handed over, which Luis clutched before hurrying after her.

Verena led him into the hospital's rehabilitation garden, where meandering streams, shaded trees, and clusters of flowers formed a refuge apart from the world's clamor.

They strolled along winding paths until they reached an artificial lake. Beneath the glassy surface,fish darted in sudden flashes of silver.

Benches dotted the lakesidey and Verena chose one, seating herself with calm composure.

Looking up at him, she said evenly, "Mr. Sampson, it's quiet enough here. Please, get to the point."

Luis gave a small nod and, after a moment's hesitation, lowered himself onto the bench, careful to keep a respectful distance.

"The truth is..." He began slowly, his hands restless on his thighs, his eyes flickering toward her now and then.

Verena sat poised, hands folded on her lap, her calm gaze fixed on the lake as though she had all the time in the world.

Luis' words faltered, his Adam's apple rising and falling.

Within the folder lay the DNA results-evidence binding him and Verena together. Just one sentence could unveil the truth.

But the memory of his inappropriate words to her in the past twisted inside him, leaving him entangled in hesitation.

What would she do when she finally learned their true bond? And how would she think of him?

His brows drew tight, his eyes clouded with struggle.

One hand clutched the folder as though it were a lifeline, while the other rubbed his thigh in restless motion.

Verena's patience, though steady, was not endless. Seeing his hesitation, she assumed he was once again tricking her.

Her frown deepened; her voice sharpened with impatience as she rose to her feet. "Mr. Sampson, our cooperation already ended. If you have nothing to say, I'll take my leave. And another thing..." She paused,turning coldly toward him. "We are strangers. I hope you'll keep your distance. I have a family of my own,and my husband would never welcome this."

Her words cut clear as glass. She turned as though to leave.

A stab of pain pierced Luis' chest. Before thought could steady him, instinct seized his body. He stepped forward and caught her arm.

"Verena-I'm your brother." His voice rang with urgency, trembling as it broke through the air.

Verena froze, her face suddenly a canvas of shock and disbelief, her mind caught between denial and confusion.
 ###Chapter 284 She Wasn't Alone


Verena's eyes widened, her gaze locked on Luis, caught between disbelief and a shock too heavy to process.

For several long seconds, her throat felt closed, her voice refusing to come. At last, the words scraped out,raw and unsteady. "What are you saying?"

To her, Luis must have gone out of his mind to say something like that.

His hands trembled as he snatched the folder from the bench, yanking it open with frantic urgency.Papers slid and rustled between his shaking fingers as he thrust them toward her.

"I know it sounds impossible," he rasped, his voice hoarse and unsteady. "But it's the truth. You and I share the same blood-you're my sister."

His words tumbled out in a rush, fueled by desperation. "You were taken from Starshell Women's and Children's Hospital before you were even a month old. Mom never recovered from losing you. She broke down-her mind, her spirit. She hasn't been herself since. Dad's health collapsed too, but he forces himself ④to care for her. Everything fell apart after you were gone."

The red in his eyes deepened until tears clung to his lashes, threatening to spill.

Verena's brows knitted hard, her face darkened with suspicion, her mind rejecting the words as if they were part of some absurd, twisted play.

Seeing her doubt, Luis dug frantically through the pile, pulling out a single sheet as though it were his last lifeline. His hands shook as he pushed it toward her. "If you can't take my word for it, then read this. The DNA results don't lie."

Almost without realizing, her fingers closed around the paper.

Her gaze fell to the report, scanning down until it hit the line that mattered. Her eyes shot wide,pupils shrinking, her body jolting as if the ground had cracked beneath her feet. For a moment, her mind rang with nothing but silence, a hollow echo of disbelief. Then, slowly, she shook her head, her hair falling around her face as though she could shake the truth away.

Her voice was a whisper, broken and unwilling. "No... this isn't real. It can't be."

All her life she had carried one certainty-that she was Laura's daughter.

Laura might be mean now, greedy with money, and hopelessly biased, but Verena had always believed she would never cross into anything unlawful or immoral.

Her lips pressed into a firm line as she locked eyes with Luis. "I don't want to believe you. But since you're so adamant,I'll confirm it myself."

Before he could react, her hand shot out like lightning, grabbing a fistful of his hair and ripping hard.

The desperate urgency in her movements left no room for hesitation. Luis winced sharply, pain burning across his scalp.

A hiss escaped him as his eyes squeezed shut, one hand flying up to shield his head.

By the time he looked again, Verena was already moving, her stride purposeful, the strands of hair clenched tightly in her hand as she stormed toward the hospital building.

Luis gritted his teeth against thesting and quickly hurried after her.

Inside the testing laboratory, machines whirred steadily, and medical staff moved with quiet efficiency from station to station.

Verena burst through the door, her gaze scanning the room with fierce determination until it landed on a familiar figure.

"Andrew," she called out, her voice clipped and urgent.

The young doctor turned at the sound, brows lifting in surprise before he set aside his work and came forward.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Andrew Turner asked, confusion flickering in his eyes. Without wasting a second, Verena shoved the strands of hair into Andrew's hands.

One belonged to her, the other torn from Luis, both with roots still intact.

Her voice came low and steady, weighted with urgency. "Andrew, I need a kinship test. Run it immediately.This is critical."

Andrew's eyes flicked to the samples in his palm, and then lifted to her face, startled by the gravity carved into her features. At last, his gaze slid past her to the man standing in silence just behind.

Though questions burned on his tongue, Andrew wisely kept them to himself.

Pulling his gaze away, he gave a firm nod. "I'll handle it right away. You'll have the results as soon as they're ready."

Without another word, he disappeared into the testing room.

An hour later, the door swung open, and Andrew stepped out, a report clutched tightly in his hand.

He crossed the room quickly, holding the papers out. "Evelyn, the results are in."

Verena accepted the report and scanned its contents until her gaze locked onto one line-"Blood Relation Exists". Her heart kicked into a faster rhythm, and she stood rooted to the spot, unable to move.

"This... this can't be real," she murmured, the disbelief trembling in her voice.

Mémories clashed violently in her head. She had grown up in a poor household-Alec and Laura scraping by,just ordinary people fighting to survive before they made a fortune in the big city.

The Sampson family, though, was another world entirely. Old blood. Money. Power entangled with shadows of the underworld.

Two families standing on opposite ends of society-how could there be any link between them?

Beside her, Luis' face broke into unrestrained joy, his voice carrying triumph. "Now you see? I wasn't lying.We're siblings, Verena."

But she stood silent, her expression distant, her thoughts spiraling inward. At last, her voice came low and uncertain. "When did you find out? Is that why you've been treating me so differently-because you knew?"

Luis' eyes dropped for a moment, though his answer came steady."1only learned the truth not long ago.I waited for the right time to tell you."

Verena gave a slight nod, her gaze lowering to the floor.

So she wasn't Alec and Laura's daughter after all. Did they know? Had they raised her all these years in ignorance-or with the weight of a secret they never shared?

The shock left her hollow, but slowly, piece by piece, her composure began to stitch itself back together.Reason returned, fighting through the storm.

Verena lifted her gaze to Luis, her eyes clear yet clouded with a storm of conflicting emotions.

"I never imagined your words would turn out to be true." Her tone carried a calm steadiness, but beneath it trembled the ripple of unease. "This revelation... it's overwhelming. I can't accept this bond as easily as you want me to."

She drew in a breath, choosing her next words with care. "Before anything else, I need to speak to Alec and Laura Willis. For all these yeårs, they've been the only parents l've ever known."

Even now, their favoritism toward Kaia and Luka still stung like barbs buried deep beneath her skin.

Every slight, every moment she was overlooked, had planted seeds of bitterness that grew unchecked,forming a wall she could never climb.

Yet this truth shifted everything. If Alec and Laura were never her blood, then perhaps their coldness had an explanation.

The thought eased the weight on her chest, as if the resentment that had clung to her for so long had finally dissolved into air.

Her lips curved faintly, a fragile smile breaking through. "Thank you for telling me. Without you, I might have lived my whole life in ignorance." Watching her soften, Luis' chest loosened with relief, though sorrow flickered in his eyes.

He waved his hands quickly, words tumbling out. "Don't thank me, Verena. You don't need to be formal with me-we're family. You're my sister. All I want is for you not to push me away."

Verena studied him quietly, taking in the anxious energy in his eyes, the way his mouth rushed to explain,desperate for her acceptance.

And in that moment, she felt the sincerity of his concern, his yearning to claim her as kin.

Warmth bloomed inside her, unfamiliar but comforting.

For so long she had believed Shawna was the only one who truly loved her.

But now, standing before her, her brother shattered that belief. She wasn't alone.

Just as Alec and Laura had cherished Kaia, she too had a family waiting to treasure her, to hold her close, to guard her heart.
###Chapter 285 Am I Not Welcome Here


Verena lowered her head, her fingers interlacing unconsciously as though trying to anchor the storm within.Her eyes drifted aimlessly, as if searching for clarity among the jumble of emotions.

"This came like a bolt from the blue, without a whisper of warning, leaving me utterly unprepared." After pausing to collect herself, she added slowwly, "Even I struggle to put my feelings into words. Shock,uncertainty, and confusion... all tangled together, leaving me at a complete loss."

When she finally lifted her gaze toward Luis, determination flickered beneath the sincerity in her eyes."I know you want me to slip seamlessly into this family, but | can't. For years, I've lived in another world, with my own rhythm, my own ties. To suddenly turn my back on all of that, to embrace a brand-new family,I need time-plenty of time-to find my footing."

She drew a breath and pressed on. "Mr. Sampson, I hope you'll understand and grant me the space to process this, to redefine what our bond truly means."

Luis stood rooted, his hands hanging loosely at his sides, the confident pride that once defined him now reduced to a shadow, tinged®with defeat.

Memories crowded his mind-moments with Verena that now stung like reproaches. He had chastised himself countless times.

When they first met, he had left nothing but a poor impression, even uttering careless remarks that now echoed like ghosts.

He had only himself to blame if she found it hard to accept him-or even this newfound kinship-because of the stains he had left.

His gaze fell, and a heavy sigh escaped his lips.

After a moment, he lifted his head again, guilt flickering in his eyes as he met hers. "I understand, Verena. Of course, I do. Everything happened so quickly you barely had time to catch your breath. It's only natural. Don't worry-I won't force your hand. I'll give you time, as much as you need, until your heart allows you to accept me and this family in your own way."

"Thank you." Verena glanced at her watch and added, "Mr. Sampson, I have matters to attend to, so I won't see you out."

Without another word, she turned and left.


...

In her office, Verena sat quietly, her eyes clouded with mixed emotions.

She unfastened her buttons, slipped off her white coat, folded it neatly, and placed it in the wardrobe.Without hesitation, she walked to the rack, pulled down her outer coat, and zipped it up in one smooth motion.

Just then, Julianna returned from her rounds. Spotting Verena ready to leave, she asked in surprise,"Evelyn, are you heading out?"

Verena turned with measured calm. "Yes, I have some things to handle. I'll leave everything here in your care for now."


After a pause, she added, "If anything urgent arises at the hospital, call me immediately. I'll return as soon as possible."

She picked up her phone and bag, and then walked briskly toward the door.

A short while later, a silver-gray car rolled out of the hospital's underground parking lot and merged onto the main road.

Outside Wilis Villa, sunlight spilled across the lush green lawn.

Several middle-aged maids in uniform crouched by the flowerbeds, trimming the blossoms with meticulous care.

A younger maid nearby swept fallen leaves and dust with practiced strokes. The sudden roar of an engine broke the calm.

The younger maid froze mid-sweep, glancing toward the sound. A silver-gray car was drawing near.

It slowed, finally stopping neatly in the open space before the villa

The door opened, and Verena stepped out.

She wore a plain white long-sleeved top, loose casual trousers, and a finely knit black cardigan-simple yet elegant.

Her face was bare of makeup, radiant in its natural glow, her skin touched with a soft flush, and her eyes bright with quiet depth.

Recognition dawned at once on the maid's face. Lighting up, she hurried forward, bowing slightly with eager words. "Mrs. Bennett, welcome back."

The commotion drew the others, who quickly followed, their flattering tones ringing sharply against the memory of their past indifference.

Verena's expression remained calm, her eyes unreadable, as she walked straight to the villa's entrance.

She knew all too well-their sudden warmth was born not of respect but of convenience. Her brilliant showing at the hospital opening, her rising reputation as a famous doctor, and her marriage to lsaac had transformed their scorn into obsequious praise.

The ugly duckling they had once dismissed had become a swan they now scrambled to revere.

Naturally, their stance shifted with the wind.

Kylee,catching sight of Verena, dropped her shears and hurried into the villa, eager to announce her arrival to Alec and Laura.

Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, bathing the Willis living room in a golden glow.

Alec, in a dark gray suit, sat by a luxurious coffee table, his hands deftly working with a set of fine coffee utensils. Across the room, Laura lounged beside a pile of colorful scarves.

Dressed in luxurious silk loungewear, she draped a sapphire scarf over her shoulders, turning this way and that before the mirror, murmuring about which shade best suited her elegance.

Since the Willis family stopped causing trouble for Verena, she had kept her distance-neither lending support nor showing hostility-perhaps as a token of respect for the late Shawna. Their life had finally returned to its usual peaceful rhythm.

"Mr. and Mrs. Willis, Verena has arrived!" Kylee burst into the living room, panting but smiling broadly.

The words struck like thunder. Alec's hand shook, and the porcelain coffee cup slipped, shattering with a sharp crack. Dark liquid splashed his trousers, yet he didn't so much as flinch.

His eyes widened, his face torn between disbelief and joy.

Laura, too, froze mid-motion, the scarf still in her grasp, her smile caught halfway.

Three seconds passed. Then, as if a curtain had lifted, their expressions bloomed with delight. In unison,they exclaimed, "What did you say? Verena is here?"

Before Kylee could answer, a clear, composed voice drifted from the doorway:"Why? Am I not welcome here?"A

Alec and Laura turned at once, stunned, their eyes locking on the figure at the entrance.
###Chapter 286 Was | Really Born Your Daughter


The moment Verena stepped into view, Alec's and Laura's expressions shifted in an instant. Both looked genuinely startled, their faces glowing with excitement.

Alec shot upright so quickly that the bottle of coffee beans toppled onto the table and tumbled to the floor,but he made no move to clean up the mess. His hands fumbled across his jacket, and he straightened his shirt in an anxious rush.

Ignoring the shattered coffee cup at his feet, he strode straight for the doorway. He grinned and called out,"Verena, you're finally back. Of course you're welcome here! It's about time you came home."

Inside, his thoughts twisted in every direction. The memories of what happened during her hospital's opening ceremony still left him uneasy.

He couldn't forget how furious he'd felt after Verena's outburst, thinking she had gone too far and dragged his reputation through the mud in front of everyone.

Yet even as anger bubbled up, a thread of worry ran alongside it. Verena's position in the world had changed overnight.

With her new title as Isaac's wife, everyone suddenly looked at the Willis family differently. The stories about her healing skills had drawn the city's most powerful families to their door, each one hoping for an introduction.

None of that would have happened without Verena.

Alec understood this better than anyone. As long as Verena stood with them, the Willis family's future in high society was safe.

Seeing her here now, Alec's first instinct was to believe she finally realized where she belonged. He imagined she had set aside her resentment and chosen to make peace for the family's sake.

No matter what happened, Verena was still his daughter. Who else would know her as well as he did? At the thought, a smug smile crept across his face.

With Verena ready to bury the hatchet, it would be foolish to bring up old arguments or show any resentment.

That thought made his smile grow even wider.

Across the room, Laura flung hér scarf onto the sofa and hurried over, a bright smile lighting up her features as she exclaimed, "Verena, what do you mean? Of course we want you here! This will always be your home.Your father and I couldn't be happier to see you back."

Behind Laura's warm greeting, her mind was racing. She had never felt close to this daughter who grew up so far from home.

But those old feelings didn't matter now. Laura knew full well that Verena was their family's lucky charm,and it would be foolish to riskupsetting her.

Now that Verena had come back on her own, Laura saw a golden chance to finally repair the distance between them.

Laura could not risk being anything but sweet to Verena. If she angered her now, all the comforts and privilege she had gotten used to might vanish in a heartbeat.

Both Alec and Laura wore wide, practiced smiles, their eyes shining with a show of warmth and devotion that bordered on theatrical.

Beside them, Kylee watched carefully, eager to leave a good impression. She bent at the waist, her smile extra bright, and said, "Mrs. Bennett, it's such a relief to see you back. Your parents haven't stopped hoping you'd return."

Her words dripped with flattery, each one sounding more forced than the last.

Verena's gaze swept past Alec and Laura, her expression cool and unreadable, as if she was simply observing two people she barely knew.

With a faint smirk that never touched her eyes, she replied,11|sthat really what you believe?" born your daughter?"That hint of sarcasm landed, and Alec's smile faltered before he could catch himself.

He recovered quickly and responded, "Come on, Verena. Of course we mean it!"

He tried to keep things light, almost teasing.

Laura jumped in right after him, her hand starting to reach for Verena's but stopping halfway, uncertainty flickering across her face. "That's right, sweetheart. You're our daughter. Who else do you think we'd be missing if not you?"

Her tone rang out loud and sharp, her smile stretched a little too tight.

Verena cut her off with a question of her own. "Your daughter, you say? Are you so sure about that?"

Her eyes held steady on Alec and Laura, as if she was searching for answers only they could give.

Confusion swept over both of them as they traded glances, each trying to figure out where Verena was going with this.

Alec was the first to gather himself, drawing a shaky breath, irritation flashing across his face.

He fell back on his usual authority, hoping to put an end to Verena's odd questions. "Verena, what's gotten into you? Why would you say something so ridiculous? Your mother gave birth to you. There's no doubt you're our daughter."

Even as he spoke, Alec's instincts, sharpened by years in business, told him something deeper was at play from the moment Verena opened her mouth.

Something unsettled twisted inside Alec, as if he could sense a storm brewing just out of sight.

Nothing about Laura's confusion felt reassuring. She eyed Verena warily, trying to guess the motive. "Has someone been whispering in your ear? Is that it?"

Stone-faced, Verena faced them without blinking. Her voice cut through the room, cold and unyielding "Stop worrying about what people might have said. I just need you to answer me. Was I really  The sound of her question hung in the air,sharp and heavy, rattling both Alec and Laura. Anxiety crept into their faces as they struggled to grasp what Verena truly meant.

A sudden rush of fear shot through Laura, her mind flooded with the blaring warning that something was terribly wrong.

Thoughts chased each other around her mind, each one darker than the last. What if Verena had only returned to cut ties forever?

Losing Verena would mean losing everything-the prestige, the attention, the doors that her presence opened. Laura could not stand the idea of watching all her comforts slip away.

No way. Laura vowed that she would do whatever it took to keep that from happening.

With barely a pause, Laura nodded frantically."Of course, Verena. I carried you for nine long months. Don't ever doubt that."

Trying to seem gentle, she closed the gap between them, eyes shining with a tenderness that felt anything but real.

Her hand reached out, aiming for Verena's arm, but Verena shifted away before she could make contact.

Left hanging, Laura's hand wavered in the empty space. She started to pull back, but Verena's fingers shot out and wrapped tightlyaround her wrist.

The grip wasn't forceful, but eerily cold, and the chill seemed to burrow under Laura's skin, making her flinch.

Alec's frown deepened as he watched, voice turning stern. "Verena, what are you trying to do?"

Verena didn't flinch. She stared straight at Alec, her gaze unwavering and sharp, completely shut offfrom any trace of family warmth.

"If you're so convinced, then let's put it to the test. I want answers-and science doesn't lie." Her declaration echoed through the room, calm and unshakeable.
###Chapter 287 No Biological Relationship


Verena led Alec and Laura straight to her hospital.

Once the DNA samples were collected, the hallway turned into a place of restless waiting.

Without saying a word, Verena took a seat on a bench, her eyes never leaving the closed door ahead.

Alec and Laura lingered nearby, their faces a mix of nerves and mounting confusion.

Laura lowered her voice, unable to hide her worry. "Alec, do you have any idea what she's really after?"

Irritation flashed in Alec's eyes as he snapped back, "You think I can read her mind? Your guess is as good as mine."

A nurse eventually returned with an envelope in hand. Verena accepted it with a cool nod, barely glancing at the nurse before unfolding the paper. The words"no biological relationship" stared up at her. Her face showed nothing. She had expected as much.

This was not the first time she had faced the truth.

Alec reached for the report so quickly it almost tore in his hands. His eyes scanned the page until they landed on the words"no biological relationship",and in that instant, his entire body locked up.He stood motionless, staring in stunned disbelief, unable to look away.

"This isn't possible..." said Alec, his voice trembling as he shook his head. "There has to be some kind of error!"

Laura stood rooted beside him, her eyes wide, face pinched in shock and confusion.

Confusion carved sharp lines across Laura's face. Her eyebrows knitted together as she struggled to make sense of what she was seeing.

Turning toward Verena, she couldn't hold back anymore. "Verena, I gave birth to you. For nine months, I felt every heartbeat.How can you not be my daughter?" Verena showed no sign of emotion. She watched the meltdown before her with chilly indifference.

A flicker of amusement crossed her lips as she took in the sight of Alec and Laura teetering on the edge,both their worlds crumbling in front of her.

Cold and direct, Verena didn't botherhiding her contempt. "How long are you planning to keep this charade going?"

Her words cut sharper than glass, and her stare left no doubt about how little respect she had left for either of them.

Alec's face flushed crimson, fury overtaking confusion.

"What's gotten into you, Verena?" His voice thundered down the corridor, drawing stares from people nearby.

Embarrassed by the attention, he leaned closer, dropping his voice. "First you drag us to this hospital,now you're tossing out accusations. What are you after, exactly?"

Every glance at Verena fueled his anger; he was certain she was stirring up trouble just to spite him.

Verena faced him, the chill in her posture radiating from the quiet tension in her narrow shoulders.

Disgust twisted in her gut.

She'd clung to the hope that Alec and Laura might finally tell the truth themselves. Clearly, that hope had been wasted.

Without a word, Verena unzipped her handbag and pulled out a crisp, folded sheet of paper.

Every movement was deliberate as she walked over and held the document out to Alec.

"Read it for yourself. There's no hiding from the truth now." Her tone was measured, every syllable steady and clear.

Alec's hands shook as he unfolded the report, his eyes racing across the lines until the answer became painfully obvious. There it was in black and white-Verena and Luis were biologically related. Luis Sampson, whose name alone was enough to send ripples of fear through the city's elite.

The revrelation was impossible to deny. Verena wasn't their daughter. She was a Sampson by birth.

Alec's legs suddenly gave out, and he nearly dropped to the floor as the truth hit him like a physical blow.

Laura's eyes stayed glued to Alec, picking up on the tremor in his limbs before he even faltered. She lunged forward, wrapping an arm around him to keep him upright.

Curiosity and dread tangled inside her. What could have possibly rattled Alec this much?

After making sure he wouldn't collapse, Laura edged closer, snatching a peek at the report in his hands.

Her whole body stiffened. Every ounce of color drained from her face as she read the words that shattered everything she thought she knew.

She and Alec stared at the test results, both so shaken that neither could speak.

The silence dragged on until Verena finally broke it, her voice sharp and cutting. "You've seen it for yourselves,haven't you? I belong to the Sampson family. Luis Sampson is my brother. You have never been my family-not by blood."

The look she gave Alec and Laura was nothing short of ice-cold. Any wish for reconciliation had burned away, leaving only years of betrayal and anger in its place.

"So tell me-how did you pull me away from the Sampson family all those years ago?" Verena's tone dripped with accusation, her anger barely contained.

"You'd be wise to come clean now. Because if you don't, neither the Bennett family nor the Sampson family will ever let this go."

Laura reeled, her mind spinning with shock and resentment.

She never dreamed she could raise a child only to discover she belonged to someone else all along.

Laura's thoughts spun into chaos. Could it be true that she had spent all these years raising someone else's child? The longer she dwelled on it, the heavier her chest felt, as though a stone had settled there and refused to move. Bitterness clawed at her, feeding a growing unwillingness to accept the truth.

But when she looked up and met Verena's unyielding stare, a chill crept through her. Fear replaced every ounce of defiance.

Both the Sampson and Bennett families carried power she dared not provoke. If Verena truly believed she'd been stolen, the fallout would be catastrophic.

Driven by desperation, Laura rushed forward, words tumbling from her lips. "Verena, I swear I don't know what this is about. You're the daughter I gave birth to! If you doubt me, then check the records. It was Plentlight Hospital, the year you were born. I never took anyone else's child-I swear it!"

Alec, meanwhile, was drowning in his own storm of emotions. Frustration pounded in his chest until it hurt to breathe.

Rage burned across his face, his chest tightening with a mix of regret and unwillingness that left him restless.

The thought gnawed at him-how could the girl he had raised all these years turn out to belong to someone else?

All those sacrifices, all that time-was it nothing but a wasted effort?

Memories of how cold and dismissive he had been toward Verena struck himn like a blade, a pang of panic carving deep into his heart.

The reality of the Sampson family's power pressed on him next. They weren't just influential-they were untouchable.

Had things not fallen apart between them and Verena, there might have been chances to build even stronger ties through her.

For the first time, Alec admitted to himself that they had backed themselves into a corner.

If he could turn back time, he would have handled Verena very differently. A heavy sigh escaped him. The test results left no room for denial, yet he clung to the stubborn thought that she was still his daughter.

In his eyes, Verena was remarkable. Her beauty, her talent, her strength, all of it set her apart.

Whether he said it aloud or not, Alec had always counted on her to be the pillar that carried the Willis family into the future.
###Chapter 288 May I See Her


Now, everything Alec had held as truth crumbled before him.

The revelation that Verena did not truly belong to the Willis family was like watching his cherished dreams torn apart piece by piece.

How could he possibly swallow such a bitter pill?

He forced down the storm within, fists tightening as though he could cage his frustration.

When he opened his mouth, he tried to wear a mask of calm affection. "Verena, if we had known from the beginning that you weren't our own flesh and blood, do you think your mother and I would have worked ourselves to the bone to raise you?"

He paused, took a step closer, and gently laid his hand on her shoulder. "Remember this-no matter what the world says, you will always be my child, my dear daughter."

But in truth, Alec's heart balked at letting go. To lose Verena meant more than losing a daughter-it meant watching wealth and status alip through his fingers like sand.

Verena lifted her gaze to meet his. Her eyes, steady yet piercing, seemed to strip away every layer of disguise.

His words of tenderness drifted past her ears like a passing wind that stirred nothing.

After Kaia's birth, she had tasted neglect, indifference, and favoritism sharp as vinegar.

The love she once received from the Willis couple was scarce in her memory, and trust had become a fragile, guarded thing.

Still, she noticed the tremors in Laura's and Alec's eyes-the shock, the panic, the frantic struggle to prove their innocence. It rang too raw to be a play.

From what she knew of them, she began to form her verdict: the Willis couple were likely in the dark, as bewildered as she was.

There could be only one answer-she had been switched before Laura ever laid eyes on her own baby.

Drawing a steady breath,Verena stepped back.

Alec's hand slid helplessly from her shoulder.

His heart plummeted when Verena raised her chin and said coolly, "You had better be telling the truth, or this matter won't rest here."

Without another glance, she turned and walked away, her steps resolute.

Back in her office, Verena's brows knitted as she pulled out her phone and dialed Luis.

The moment the line clicked open, she wasted no words. "I just did a DNA test with Alec and Laura. The results confirmed it-I'm not their biological child. But I don't think they were the ones who took me."

Luis had expected her to run the test, knowing her cautious nature-she trusted no truth unless her own eyes had seen it.

Yet her final words puzzled him. "How can you be so sure?"he asked.

Verena stood by the tall window, her gaze stretching far into the distance. Her voice was calm, her reasoning sharp."Let me explain. First, before Kaia was born, Alec and Laura adored me as if I were a pearl in their palm. They gave me everything, and their care was sincere. If they were the ones who stole me, they would have lived in constant fear of exposure. How could they have loved me with such abandon? It was only after Kaia's arrival that their affection shifted, leaving me overlooked and overshadowed."

She paused briefly, and then continued, "Second, when I was born, Alec and Laura had nothing. Their world was leagues apart from the Sampson family. They had no access to such lofty circles, let alone the means to plot stealing a child. At that time, they were too busy scraping a living to scheme about crimes. Third, they lacked the courage. Alec may be sharp in business, but at his core he is cautious. To risk a crime that defies both law and conscience-he would never dare. And Laura, always following in his shadow, has no mind of her own. How could such people summon the audacity to steal a child? No, I believe they were oblivious." Luis fell into silence, mulling over her words. Then he drawled slowly, "Your reasoning holds water... but if so,what really unfolded back then? Who, then, is the hand behind this?"

Verena's grip tightened on the phone. Determination flashed in her eyes. "I don't know yet. But I will uncover the truth. Whoever did this-I won't let them walk away unpunished."

On the other end, Luis nodded, his voice quiet but steady."Very well, Verena. We're family. I'll help you investigate."

Just then, a breeze slipped through the window, stirring strands of her hair.

The words "we're family" filled her with a bittersweet ache-half warmth,half sorrow.

Her thoughts wandered to what he had once told her: her biological mother had fallen into madness after losing her child.

Hesitation tugged at her, yet she could not resist asking, "What... what kind of person is she?"

Even as the words left her lips, she knew how vague they were. She hadn't named anyone, yet she was certain Luis would understand.

There was a brief pause, and then a smile colored his tone. "Mom is gentle and graceful, a fine cook, a dancer who moves like flowing water, a singer with a voice like birdsong. In short, she is gifted in many ways.You resemble her closely. When you see her, you'll recognize her at once."

Verena listened in silence, a vision of the mother she never knew forming in her mind-cooking by the stove,twirlingacross a stage, or singing softly with a voice that could heal.

Her eyes grew moist.

A pang of guilt struck her heart-for not being there, for letting her mother suffer the torment of loss alone.

"May I see her?" Her voice was barely above a whisper. "Just from afar."

She wasn't ready to step into this newfound family, unprepared for bonds that had arrived without warning.

Sensing her fragile yearning, Luis answered at once, "Of course. Mom and Dad are already in Shoildon. Tomorrow at 10:30 in the morning, Dad will take Mom for a check-up at the hospital. I'll call you then."
###Chapter 289 Will You Come Somewhere With Me Tomorrow


Darkness stretched across the neighborhood, and the silence was broken only by the faint, uneven chorus of crickets. Silver light spilled from the moon, sketching out the outlines of Verena and Isaac's home at Seraphina Villas, giving the house a ghostly glow.

At the bedroom window, Verena stood with her arms folded, her slim figure etched sharply against the pale shimmer of the night.

Her eyes lingered on the cypress tree swaying gently in the yard, though her mind was somewhere far beyond what she saw.

Isaac rolled out of the bathroom with a towel in hand, running it lazily over his damp hair after finishing his nightly routine.

He noticed Verena immediately. She looked lost by the window, her delicate frame swallowed by the quiet glow.

"Verena, it's late. Why don't we head to bed?" he asked, his tone light and coaxing.
A
But she gave no sign of hearing him. Her stare stayed fixed on the night outside, as though she had slipped into another world entirely.

A faint crease formed on Isaac's brow, unease creeping into his chest.

He wheeled closer, raised his voice a little, and called out again, "Verena, come on, it's time to sleep."

Still, she didn't move. The stillness in her body made his heart tighten.

Resignation flickered in his eyes before he reached for her hand. His palm closed around her cold fingers,pressing warmth into them.

"Verena," he said again, this time lower, steadier.

The heat of his palm against her cool skin snapped Verena out of her daze. She slowly turned to him, her eyes clouded with uncertainty as she asked, "Why are you looking at me like that?"

Isaac met her gaze with a quiet calm."All through dinner, you looked miles away. I called your name a few times just now, but you didn't hear me. Tell me, what's going on?"

His words were soft, yet his hand clasped hers a little tighter, as though he feared she might slip away again.

Her mouth opened, and the hesitation in her expression gave her away. After a pause, she whispered,"Isaac, will you come somewhere with me tomorrow?"

Her voice carried the weight of unspoken feelings-nervousness, hope, and a trace of fear she couldn't hide.

A storm of emotions churned inside Verena at the thought of finally meeting the woman tied to her by blood.

She had grown up in a house where she always felt like an outsider, carrying the weight of silent slights and a loneliness that never lifted.

Now that the truth of her birth had come to light, the chance to see her real mother stirred both hope and dread within her.

The idea of standing face-to-face with a stranger who was, at the same time, her own flesh and blood filled her with unease.

She dreaded the possibility of finding a woman broken down by time and the sorrow of years spent apart.

Even more terrifying was the thought of not knowing what to say, how to bridge the gap of years that had already slipped away.

In this moment, one thing was certain-she needed Isaac with her.

For a long time, he had been her anchor, the one person she could lean on without fear of being pushed aside.

When Isaac caught the redness in her eyes and the turmoil that clouded her expression, his chest tightened.He didn't press her for answers. Instead, he wrapped her gently in his arms and whispered, "I'll go with you. Whatever happens, you're not facing it alone."

The next morning, the shrif ring of the phone broke the quiet. Verena lifted the device, and Luis' voice came through. "Verena, everything's ready. You can come now."

"We'll be thee soon," she said, her voice steady though her heart was racing.

She hung up, drew in a deep breath, and turned to Isaac. "It's time. Let's go."

Isaac answered with a firm nod. Together they left the house, slid into the waiting car, and set off toward the hospital.

During the ride, Verena stared out the backseat window, the blur of passing scenery doing nothing to calm her.

Her palms grew damp as she clenched her fists, her mind replaying the imagined moment over and over-the first mneeting with the mother she had never known.

Isaac noticed the stiffness in her shoulders and brushed his hand over hers, a quiet attempt to ease her nerves.

Moments later, the car slowed to a stop in front of the hospital entrance.

Verena stepped out first, tilting her head upward to find Luis already waiting in front of the main hospital building.

He stood straight and alert, his eyes fixed on the entrance until they caught sight of her. The moment he recognized her, he walked quickly in their direction.

"You're here, Verena," Luis said. His gaze flickered briefly toward Isaac before settling back on her."Try not to overthink it. When you go in, stay with her for as long as you can."

Isaac joined them, surprised to find Luis waiting for them, and his eyes narrowed ever so slightly at the way Luis spoke.

He spoke with the ease of someone who knew her well. When had Verena gotten that familiar with Luis? Still, Isaac's sharp instincts told him there was nothing romantic in their exchange-just the easy recognition of two people bound by circumstance.

Choosing not to interfere, he kept beside Verena in silence.

Verena tilted her head toward Luis, her voice calm but firm. "Let's go in."

Luis gave a short hum of ackhowledgment before guiding them into the hospital.

At the far end of the corridor, they stopped in front of a door marked for VIP patients. Luis lifted a hand and said quietly, "This is the one."

Verena's chest tightened, her breath catching as the weight of the moment bore down on her. Forcing herself to draw in a steady breath, she edged closer to the door.

Through the small glass panel, she looked inside, her body going rigid as though her feet had rooted to the floor.

Inside, a woman sat on the edge of the bed, middle-aged and fragile, clutching a pillow as though it were her lifeline.

Her lips moved in a soft lullaby, broken now and then as she whispered, "Sleep well, my sweet girl. Such a good child..."

Nearly all her hair had turned silver, streaked with just a few strands of black. Deep lines carved her face,the years etched into every crease.

Even so, Verena could still see the trace of elegance that had once defined her,the beauty that lingered beneath time's cruel hand.

What struck Verena most were the woman's eyes and brows-so much like her own it was as though they had been stamped from the same mold.

Beside her, a weary-looking man sat peeling an apple with deliberate care.

His shoulders slumped under the weight of years, his face lined and tired, and in his features Verena saw where Luis had gotten his resemblance. Verena had toId herself she would face this moment with composure, but the instant her gaze fell on the pair, her vision blurred and her eyes filled.

Her hand flew to her mouth, desperate to hold back the sob that threatened to break free.

Luis had warned her their mother's mind was no longer sound, yet nothing had prepared her for this sight.

Even lost in confusion, her mother had been waiting for her, still calling out to a daughter she had not seen for over two decades.

The pain etched across Verena's face was enough to make Isaac's chest ache.

He reached for her hand, his voice low. "Verena... who are those people inside?"

Through a shaky breath, she answered, "They're my real parents."

Isaac froze, his eyes widening as though he hadn't heard her correctly.

Her real parents?

The words tumbled around in his mind, leaving only disbelief behind.

Catching the bewilderment in his expression, Verena steadied herself and added, "A DNA test proved it.Alec and Laura aren't my biological parents. Those two are. And Luis...he's my brother."

The revelation hit Isaac like a blow, astonishment breaking through his usual calm.

Luis finally stepped forwvard and interjected, "There's a lot to untangle, and it's not something we can explain in a few sentences. But what matters is the truth, and we just discovered it ourselves. All we want now is for our mother to recover, so maybe this family might be whole again."
###Chapter 290 I've Come Back


Verena nodded, her gaze shifting back to her mother in the hospital room, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

"I'd like to see Mom alone," she whispered.

Luis parted his lips, unable to restrain his question."Don't you want to see Dad? He's been restless with worry,longing for this day."

Verena froze for a moment before answering,"1want to check on Mom first. So many years have passed,and she's ended up like this.I..."

Her words trailed off, swallowed by the tide of emotions crashing inside her.

All she wished for now was to sit quietly with her mother-trying to piece together her pain, to understand her silence, and perhaps share even a fragment of the burden she had borne for years.

She clung to the fragile hope that perhaps even a spark of memory might flicker awake in her mother's mind.	0

Luis' gaze softened, carrying both joy and sorrow. "Dad's heart has been hanging by a thread all these years. The moment I confirmed I had found you, I told him at once. You should have seen him-his joy was beyond words, his voice trembling with disbelief. Without hesitation, he arranged for Mom to be brought here, praying that when you came, our family might finally be made whole again."

Luis paused, sympathy clouding his face, before adding, "Since losing you, Dad has not been the man he once was. He has grown thinner, older; his health has withered. Yet for the sake of us, and to care for Mom,he bore it all-gritting his teeth, swallowing his grief, and forcing himself to endure."

Listening to those words, Verena felt a lump rise in her throat, bitterness stinging her chest like swallowed glass.

She blinked furiously to hold back tears, and then looked at Luis with a voice hoarse from restraint. "Give me a little tme with Mom first. I... I'm lost right now. I don't know how to face Dad."

Luis studied her troubled expression, his heart filled with compassion.

Respecting her will, he did not press further. He nodded gently. "Alright. I'll bring Dad out. You go in first. Mr.Ben-

His voice faltered, his eyes sliding briefly to Isaac. At the last moment, he changed his tone. "Isaac and I will wait outside. If you need anything, just call."

Isaac, who had been silent all this time, listened with quiet astonishment at Verena's hidden past.

When Luis addressed him by name instead of "Mr. Bennett," Isaac froze for a heartbeat, surprise and a faint embarrassment flickering in his eyes.

He had not expected Luis to accept him so quickly as family.

But soon, his lips curved gently. He tightened his hold on Verena's hand and spoke in a voice both steady and tender. "Go on."

The warmth of his hand coursed into her, lending her strength she did not realize she needed.Lowering her gaze, Verena gave a small, resolute nod.

Luis entered the room and quietly called their father out.

But Verena's mind was fixed solely on her mother; she hardly noticed Luis and Joseph leaving the room.

When the door opened, she walked past Joseph without slowing, not sparing him even a glance.

At that moment, a slight breeze seemed to pass between them, and Joseph's body stiffened as though struck by it.

Without hesitation, Verena slipped inside. The door closed softly behind her, sealing her in the stillness of the room.

Joseph remained rooted to the spot, staring at the space where she had vanished, his face blank with shock. For a long time, he stood there in a daze, unable to regain his composure. At last, his voice returned to him, tremnbling, uncertain. "Is she... really your sistèr?" he asked Luis, doubt and hope battling in his eyes.

Luis' heart ached, yet he answered firmly, his head dipping in conviction, "Yes, Dad. She is your daughter-my sister. It is absolutely true. The DNA tests confirm it without a shadow of doubt. And look at her-her features, her expressións-she is the very image of Mom."

Joseph's eyes immediately reddened.

The daughter they had prayed for through long and weary years...had finally come home.

Luis, noticing his father's trembling sorrow, quickly offered comfort. "Dad, don't be afraid. Verena has grown strong, even when we weren't there to guide her. She worked harder than most, built herself into an excellent doctor-respected in her profession and admired by many. She has weathered hardship with calm and grace, no matter the storms she faced. Her brilliance, her composure-it all reminds me of Mom."

As he spoke, Luis pulled out his phone, his voice softening further. "Look. These are her records, and some videos I've collected. I wanted you to seethem with your own eyes."

With trembling hands, Joseph received the phone, his palms rough with age and years of toil. His fingers quivered as though he feared he might drop it.

He squinted, carefully taking in the words and images on the screen.

As he read about Verena's achievements, his lipstrembled faintly, his composure crumbling.

Suddenly, like a dam breaking under pressure, the emotions he had held back for years burst forth. Tears spilled freely,coursing down his cheeks.

He reached out with his other hand, brushing the screen gently, as though by doing so he could touch his daughter's face. His voice broke into a whisper, filled with both pride and regret."Our little girl... She really is our little girl. Just like her mother-so gifted,so lovable."

Every word carried the weight of pride tempered with the bitterness of lost years, yet also the soaring joy of finally having her back. Luis, moved by the sight, could hardly contain his own tears.

He placed a hand on Joseph's shoulder, steadying him. "Dad, she's here now. We have time-time we thought we'd lost. Don't drown yourself in sorrow. Let's hold on to the blessing of her return."

Joseph tried to wipe his tears with unsteady hands, but the more he wiped, the more they fell.

He nodded vigorously, his voice thick with emotion. "Yes... yes. It's such a relief to have her back. I am so grateful, so glad..."

As Joseph was swept up in joy and tears, the atmosphere inside the hospital room held a fragile tension.

Verena lingered by the door for a long while, pinching her wrist to steady herself before finally moving forward with quiet steps.

The room was steeped in quiet. Marisa sat facing the window, her thin arms wrapped tightly around the pillow as if it were her anchor in a storm.

She hummed a faint tune, broken with occasional mutters that slipped into the air like scattered fragments of a forgotten dream.

Verena's heart pounded faster with every step she took. Her palms were damp, her breath unsteady.

When she reached the bedside, she looked at her mother's hair, almost entirely silver now, and her shoulders so frail they seemed as though a strong breeze could scatter them. Verena's nose tingled, her chest constricted with emotion.

Drawing a long, trembling breath, Verena whispered, "Mom..."

But Marisa gave no sign of hearing. Her gaze was vacant, her mind adrift far away, as she clung desperately to the pillow in her arms.

The sight struck Verena's heart like a blade.

She bit her lower lip, and then slowly sank to her knees. After a hesitant pause, she reached out and gently took her mother's dry, fragile hand in her own. "Mom, it's me, Verena. I've come back." Her words were tender, trembling with hope, as she clutched her mother's hand tightly, willing warmth and recognition to pass through her touch.
###Chapter 291 Are You My Daughter
 Though Verena reached out with all her heart,Marisa remained oblivious, treating her presence as though it were thin air.



Her eyes were vacant, fixed on the pillow clutched in her arms. She murmured again and again, "My little darling,sleep now."



Her voice carried the haze of confusion, yet wrapped in a warmth so deep that the pillow seemed like her pearl of great price-her whole world pressed to her chest.



When Verena heard her mother use a name that only the dearest family had ever spoken, it felt as though an invisible hand seized her heart, stealing the air from her lungs.



She caressed Marisa's time-worn cheek,her own voice breaking even as she tried to keep it tender."Mom, it's me. I'm right here. Look at me."



But Marisa wandered deeper in her muddled realm,deaf to Verena's plea, her lips moving with the same broken refrain. She tightened her hold on the pillow, instinctive,desperate, as though someone might rob her of her child.



Verena's gaze fell on that pillow, and guilt pierced her like a thorn. Had she never been taken away years ago,perhaps her mother would never have fallen to this state.



The thought alone brought tears to her eyes.


Lowering her head, she drew in a deep breath,summoning the courage to reach carefully for the pillow.



Her hand moved with the patience of one handling glass. As she slowly drew the pillow away, her eyes never left Marisa's. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. "Mom, this isn't your baby. I'm here-I'm your daughter."



Before she even began to pull it free,dread gnawed at her-would Marisa clutch it back with all her strength?



She feared her mother's grief might only deepen.


Yet, to her astonishment, Marisa did not resist.


Her vacant eyes shifted from the pillow to Verena's face. Slowly, faint light kindled there. Marisa stared, dazed, before whispering in a hoarse tone, "Are you my daughter?"



Verena had not expected such swift belief. She seized Marisa's hand with all her strength, her voicethick with tears. "Mom, it's me. I'm your daughter. I've come back-and I'll never leave you again."


Hearing this, Marisa's anxiety broke loose.Summoning a strength born of longing, she pulled Verena into an embrace so fierce it nearly crushed the breath from her.



Verena did not resist. Though suffocated,she only tightened her own hold in return.


Marisa buried her face in her daughter's shoulder,trembling,sobbing low.



Amidst her tears came anguished words, heavy with guilt. "I'm sorry... I'm sorry... It's all my fault. I failed to protect you."


She repeated the lament like a prisoner caught in a cycle with no escape.


Each word was a hammer upon Verena's heart,leaving it bruised and aching. Tears broke loose as she cried with her.



She stroked her mother's back, comforting her gently  through sobs. "Mom, it isn't your fault. Don't carry that burden. I'm here now-and nothing will part us again."



Under her comfort, Marisa's sobs began to fade, her body still quivering but slowly loosening.


Yet, as if some hidden switch had been touched,another thought seized her. Her brow furrowed,and she gestured wildly, muttering, "The gifts...I've saved so many special gifts, all for your birthdays. I'll show you."



Her voice brimmed with urgency. Breaking from Verena's arms, she staggered toward the cabinet in the corner, still murmuring, "The gifts... the gifts..."


With trembling hands, Marisa rummaged, scattering items without care, driven only by the search for the treasures she had prepared for her daughter.



But no matter how she searched, nothing appeared.


Confusion clouded her face, and desperation surged in her eyes.


Her knees gave way, and she collapsed with a cry like that of a lost child. "What do I do? The gifts are gone -I can't find them. What do I do? They were for my daughter..."



Verena rushed to her side, her arms reaching out to  steady her.


But Marisa thrashed, hands flailing, despair twisting her face.



She rose again, trying to continue the hopeless search.



Verena caught her hands firmly, drawing her back into an embrace, her voice both urgent and soothing."Mom, don't worry. I've already received the gifts.Truly,I have."


Those words rooted Marisa in place. She froze,looking at Verena with trembling doubt. "You...you received them?"



Verena brushed away her mother's tears with her thumb, her gaze brimming with tenderness.


Leaning close, she nodded softly, eyes steady."Yes,I've received them-and I treasure them dearly."


Her sincerity washed over Marisa,calming her storm.


Verena had once believed that blood ties alone could not bridge the gulf of years.


Yet in this moment, she felt how deeply her parents had always held her in their hearts.



The distance she feared had melted away. Marisa's sobs grew faint,though a few hiccupped cries lingered in the silence.


The long storm left her utterly drained, her eyes swollen,her face dazed with weariness.


Verena tended to her gently, as though afraid a careless touch might cause pain.



She eased her mother back onto the bed. Marisa clutched her daughter's hand with desperate strength,as if letting go would mean losing her again.


Verena did not resist. She let her mother hold on with all her might.



Sitting at her side, she smoothed the strands of hair from Marisa's face, speaking softly. "Rest now. It's all behind us. Everything is alright."


Guided by that tender voice, Marisa's breath slowed,her grip weakened, and sleep drew her under at last.


When Verena left the room, her own heart was steadier, as though a burden had finally been lifted.
###Chapter 292 My Husband


When Verena lifted her gaze, she caught sight of Joseph standing a short distance away, his eyes red and swollen.



Her lips parted slightly as she whispered,almost like a prayer, "Dad."



Joseph froze, as if struck by lightning, before joy broke through his surprise. A rare light filled his eyes,leaving him flustered and at a loss.



But quickly, his face bloomed into a smile-half wonder,half delight-as he answered with eagerness,"Yes,my dear."



Facing her father's tear-streaked eyes, Verena felt her heart twist painfully, and for a moment, tears threatened to rise again.


She was never one to wear her emotions openly for all to see.


She pressed her lips together, lowered her head, and gathered herself.


A heartbeat later, she lifted her eyes once more,glancing at Luis before resting her gaze on Joseph. "Dad, Luis... all these years, I've made you live with worry and longing. From today onward, I will no longer be the cause of your sleepless nights."



Joseph and Luis leaned forward to speak, but Verena continued firmly, "I carefully studied Mom's condition in the ward just now. Judging from her symptoms, and with the medical knowledge l've acquired, I may attempt a treatment."



Joseph stiffened at her words. Luis, quicker to recover,was the first to break the silence.



His face lit with astonishment and hope as he blurted out, "Verena,do you mean you can treat Mom? Is that true?"



Verena's lips curved in a small, composed smile.Meeting their astonished gazes, she said calmly, "Luis,I believe you've looked into my background thoroughly.I cannot promise a miracle, but I hold at least fifty percent confidence.And now that I am here,the chance of healing her troubled spirit grows even stronger."


At that, Joseph looked upon Verena with eyes full of recognition and pride.



It seemed his daughter had grown into someone far greater than he had expected.



Unable to restrain himself, Joseph's face softened into  a smile of deep satisfaction.



"Wonderful! This is wonderful!" His voice trembled with excitement he could not contain.



Turning sharply to Luis, he ordered, "Luis, gather your mother's medical records from the past year and hand them over to Verena."



Luis gave a quick nod, already drawing out his phone as his fingers flew across the screen."Alright,I'll send them right away."



Since Verena stepped out of the ward, Isaac had remained at her side, quiet as a shadow.



Though he said nothing, Verena felt the silent shield of his presence. He was giving her the space to face her family,yet protecting her all the same.


Warmth surged through her chest, and a tender smile tugged at her lips.



She reached for his hand.


Startled, Isaac turned to her, and then quickly clasped her hand tightly, his eyes softening.



Her smile deepened as she faced Joseph and spoke with steady resolve. "Dad, allow me to introduce him.This is Isaac Bennett-my husband." The title struck Isaac like a sudden thunderclap.


His heart skipped, and then pounded so wildly it was as though it echoed in his chest.


Almost instinctively, he straightened his posture, his gaze lowering briefly to his legs. For once, the calm and composed mask he usually wvore gave way to a rare trace of nervousness.



He could not help but wonder whether Verena's father might harbor prejudice against him, or question his strength and ability to stand by her side.



Joseph, despite the years weighing on him, carried himself with elegance and grace. His eyes, though softened by age, were still sharp, expressive, and full of insight.



In truth, he had already sensed the truth before Verena even mentioned Isaac. After all, when two souls are bound in love, their eyes betray the secret long before words do.



Joseph's gaze lingered on Isaac, narrowing slightly as he took in the young man. Even the faint wrinkles at the corners of his eyes seemed to deepen intoa smile of satisfaction.



Isaac, tall and striking in a dark suit, looked every inch the man of stature. Even seated in a wheelchair, he carried a quiet authority that demanded respect, radiating maturity and steadiness with every restrained movement.


Isaac was, without question, worthy of the title given to him-the remarkable young CEO of Bennett Group,who had forged extraordinary success in so short a span of years.



Joseph let his eyes remain on Isaac a moment longer,studying him carefully. Then, after scrutiny,his gaze softened into approval.


He raised a hand and laid it gently on Isaac's shoulder -a gesture heavy with both trust and acceptance."Isaac, I can see in you the mark ofresponsibility.Verena has endured so much in these years, and as her parents, we feel a deep guilt for failing to shield her from life's storms."



Joseph's voice grew husky with affection as he continued, "But now, she has returned to us, and she brings you by her side. That tells me this is her choice,and it is also destiny's arrangement."


He paused, fixing his gaze on Isaac, his eyes sharp. "I hope you can give her enough love and respect, and stand as her pillar when she falters. Do not let her carry burdens alone."



He added, with a quiet edge of warning, "The  Sampson family will never permit our precious daughter to suffer even the smallest grievance."



Receiving Joseph's heartfelt words, Isaac nodded firmly. "I take your words to heart. I will treat Verena with unwavering love and care, cherish her every day,and never give you reason to doubt me."


At that moment, Luis returned, his phone in hand,walking quickly toward Verena. "Verena, I've already sent all the medical records to your email. If there's anything missing,just let me know anytime."



Verena nodded in acknowledgment before turning back to Joseph. "Dad, I'd like to return to my hospital as soon as possible to study Mom's condition carefully.I also plan to consult with some doctors who have treated similar cases, hoping to create a plan most suited to her recovery."



Her hands rested gently on Isaac's wheelchair handles as she added, "Isaac and I will take our leave now.Please,you and Luis must care for yourselves as well.We'll stay in touch."


They had already exchanged contact details earlier.


Though Joseph's heart resisted letting her go,he knew her purpose and felt both gratitude and worry.



He nodded, saying, "Good girl. Go now, and take care.
If anything arises, reach out at once." The driver delivered lsaac to his company, while Verena arranged for her own meeting with Luther,providing the address along the way.



When she stepped into the café, she saw Luther already seated,waiting patiently.



She hurried toward him, bowing slightly in apology."I'm so sorry. The traffic held me back. I hope you weren't waiting long."


At her words, Luther looked up, his face brightening into a smile.



He rose at once, pulling out a chair with courtesy,his voice gentle. "No problem. I also just arrived."


As they both sat down, the café was filled with the soothing strains of gentle music.



Verena leaned forward slightly, her tone carrying both urgency and care as she began the conversation. "Dr.Owen,how is my husband's condition now?"



She had been consumed by one unexpected matter after another in recent days,leaving her little chance to properly learn about Isaac's latest state of mental health.
###Chapter 293 The Key To Your Mother's Stability
Luther looked genuinely puzzled at Verena's question.
"Didn't Mr. Bennett ever mention that to you?"



Verena's brows drew together."Mention what?"



He set down his coffee cup, clasped his hands on the table, and fixed her with a steady gaze."So you really don't know. I've been giving Mr. Bennett therapy sessions every week."



He stroked his beard, satisfaction flickering across his face, before adding, "Here's the good news-he can stand on his own now."



Verena's lashes quivered, as though the ground had shifted beneath her feet. Could Isaac truly stand?


She looked at Luther in disbelief, lips parting, yet no sound found its way out.



Patiently, Luther continued, "It only happens in moments of crisis-and always when it's about you.The time is fleeting, but it's still a breakthrough. It means he's no longer chaining himself to guilt over his father's death, refusing to move. And more than that, it proves just how deeply you matter to him." Luther leaned forward, his voice earnest. "If you can,create moments where he has no choice but to rise -even to run toward you. Counseling has softened the weight of his guilt. Because now,he has someone he longs to protect. That someone is you. Give him those chances, and step by step, he'll only grow stronger."



Shock and joy mingled in Verena's eyes like light meeting shadow. "Thank you. I'll take your advice to heart-for his recovery."



She unlocked her phone, slid it across the table, and said, "By the way, Dr. Owen, since you're the expert,I need your opinion on something."



Her brows pinched as she explained, "These are my mother's medical records. After I was taken from her as a child, she lost her grip on reality. From what I can see,it all stems from emotional trauma. Should we begin with therapy, or treat the physical symptoms caused by her state first?"



Luther picked up the phone and pored over the records carefully.



His face grew solemn, his blue eyes sharpening with focus.



Verena sat in silence, her fingers tracing idle patterns on the tablecloth.At last, Luther looked up.



He tapped the table lightly, as though gathering his thoughts into order.


Then he spoke, calm yet firm, "Mrs. Bennett, from both this file and what you've told me, the key to your mother's stability lies with you."


He paused, noting the flicker of confusion in Verena's eyes. "Think about it-family ties wield enormous power. For your mother, you alone can reach into the depths of her memories and emotions. I can guide her as a psychologist. But in this matter, my role will never outweigh yours."
###Chapter 294 From A Man
Still looking a little bewildered, Verena asked with earnest sincerity, "Dr. Owen, I remain unsure. Could you tell me plainly what I should do?"


Luther offered a gentle smile and answered with patience, "Mrs. Bennett, my advice is to tend both body and spirit at the same time. Right now, the key issue isn't to restore every memory at once, but rather to lift your mother's mood first."



As he spoke, his hands moved to emphasize his words."The physical concerns cannot be set aside, of course.But if emotional distress is soothed, then recovery will be half the battle won."



He paused, reflecting a moment, and then met Verena's gaze. "You should try to create more chances for her to interact with you, her daughter.From her records and from what you've just said,there's something vital. Your mother remembers you only as a small baby. That is not a curse but a window of opportunity.You may relive those early years with her,almost as though walking the same road once more."



Hope flickered in Verena's eyes. "So, you mean letting her get to know me gradually, little by little?" Exactly. You have the right idea." Luther's smile deepened with appreciation. "Begin with the simple threads of daily life. Play lighthearted games-puzzles,perhaps, or a board game. Walk with her in the park and talk along the way. And, as you share these moments, weave stories of your own journey-of school days, of youth, of college, and the present. As she pictures her daughter growing step by step,her heart will find ease,and her healing will be swifter."


Listening closely, Verena rose to her feet and offered a small bow, her voice full of gratitude. "Thank you,Dr. Owen. I'll try it. I'll do my utmost to help my mother."



Luther stood as well, extending his hand with a smile."I believe you can. And should you face any obstacle or need support, do not hesitate to reach me."



Verena clasped his hand, her lips curved in a smile steeped in thankfulness.


After parting ways with Luther, she stepped out of the café and walked to the car waiting by the roadside.


The driver opened the door, and she slipped into the back seat.



The engine started with a low roar, and soon the car was gliding down the street. Her gaze wandered to the window. The scenery slipped by like a slideshow, swift and fleeting.


Crowds hurried, cars streamed endlessly, yet she felt no urge to admire the city's pulse.



Her eyes remained fixed in the distance, quiet and faraway.



Two burdens pressed heavily against her heart.


One bore the name of Isaac, the other,her mother.


Both needed her.



Unconsciously,her hand came to rest on her abdomen.



Feeling the swelling curve beneath her palm, she lowered her head, a tender smile gracing her lips.



But the smile faltered soon after, stiffening as the reality weighed down.



Isaac's recovery, her mother's condition, and the child she carried-all demanded the best of her.


That mixture of joy and pressure tugged her heart in two directions at once.



Drawing a deep breath, Verena straightened her back.Resolve rekindled in her eyes, a flame refusing to die out. At least, she told herself, Isaac's matter already had a path forward.



Night descended upon Seraphina Villas.


The moon was veiled behind drifting clouds, stars scattered like faint pinpricks of silver.



In the study, Isaac sat at the broad mahogany desk,his posture upright, mind buried in work.


His brows were faintly drawn, his face stern in its silence. Under the lamplight, his lashes traced a soft shadow across his cheeks.



The door creaked open just a little.



"Still busy?" A voice, gentle and melodious, slipped into the room.



Isaac's hands stilled. He lifted his eyes toward the sound.



There,Verena stood.



Since her pregnancy, she had favored loose gowns that flowed with ease.



Now she wore a creamy-white silk nightgown,its hem brushing her knees, her rounded belly softly outlined,her legs smooth and graceful beneath.



Though her face bore no cosmetics, her skin shone with a natural glow, and a few loose strands framed her bun, lending her an effortless charm.



Isaac's sternness dissolved at once, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "Just a little longer. Are you sleepy?I could watch you fall asleep and then come back to finish."


As he spoke, he guided his wheelchair closer to her.


Verena's lips curved in a gentle smile. She shook her head and walked inside. "Not yet. I saw how hard you were working and thought I might sit with you, keep you company, and ease your mind."


Moving behind him, she placed her hands on his shoulders and began kneading with practiced care,her touch firm yet tender.


Little by little, the tension left Isaac's body.Weariness faded from his eyes.


He tilted his head slightly, teasing, "I had no idea you were so skilled at this, darling. Where did you learn it?"


A playful smile appeared at Verena's lips.



She leaned forward, strands of hair tumbling down,brushing his cheek with a feather's touch. Drawing closer, she let her warm breath skim his ear as she whispered, mischievous and mysterious, "From a man."



Isaac froze, the smile on his face stiffening. A flicker of unease darkened his eyes.



His brows knitted, and he started to turn, but her hands pressed lightly on his shoulders, holding him still.



"Which man?" His voice carried urgency, though he tried to mask it with calm.



His tension amused Verena, endearing in its way.



She straightened and gave his shoulders a playful squeeze. "My grandma often had backaches,so lonce learned a few tricks from a massage therapist. He was a seasoned master. Why? Are you jealous?"



Isaac let out a slow breath as the truth settled.He realized he had been toyed with. Feigning annoyance,he chided, "You do enjoy making sport of me."


Verena laughed softly, patting his shoulder,her voice light and coaxing. "Well, I only wanted to lift your spirits since you've been working so hard."



Isaac shook his head, half resigned, half indulgent, yet the smile lingering on his lips betrayed his affection.


###Chapter 295 Answer Me One Question
"By the way." Verena tilted her head, a gentle smile resting on her lips as she softly remarked, "Rhonda warmed some milk. I already had a glass, and it was quite good. Let me bring you one."



Isaac was never fond of such drinks. He lightly caught her hand, stopping her. "Thank you, but I'll pass."


Yet Verena acted as if his words had drifted past her ears.


She slipped her hand free and turned, stepping out of the study.



Watching her vanish at the doorway, Isaac shook his head.Still, a faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes glowing with affection.



Luther's words lingered in Verena's mind.



She knew Isaac cared deeply for her, and to help him heal,she needed to create moments that stirred his instincts without his noticing.



Soon she returned, the milk warm, steam curling upward as she walked back toward the study. At the doorway, she let out a sudden exclamation."Oh no!"



Her tone rang with carefully measured alarm-enough to carry clearly into the study, but not so sharp as to sound false.



Inside, Isaac sat typing, immersed in documents.


The moment Verena's startled cry reached him,he snapped his head up.


Before reason could intervene, instinct spoke louder.



His palms pressed down on the wheelchair's arms,and long-weakened legs sprang into motion with surprising force.


Like a tightly wound spring let loose, he rose from the chair.



But though he had stood before, his legs, long strangers to weight,failed him at once.



After only a few faltering steps, his knees buckled, and he crashed forward heavily.


The dull thud echoed coldly through the silent room.


Gritting against panic, Isaac raised his head, eyes wide with helplessness as he cried out, "Verena! What's wrong?" Fear laced his voice, each word trembling.



But no reply came, and his heart gave a violent shudder.



He clenched his jaw, struggling against the floor with his arms,desperate to rise.


His legs, however,felt like stone.


Anxious and consumed only by Verena's safety, he cast aside all thought of his own state.


"Verena, answer me! Are you hurt?" His brows knitted tightly as he shouted again, "Rhonda! Rhonda!"


At the doorway, Verena had been listening to every sound,her heart hammering with both eagerness and dread.



The moment she heard the crash, her chest clenched,all pretense forgotten, her only prayer that Isaac remained unharmed.



She rushed inside without a second thought.


There he was-lying awkwardly on the floor, his usual composure gone, clothes disordered, beads of sweat on his brow.



"Isaac!" Verena gasped, darting forward to his side,reaching down to lift him. Her arms wrapped firmly around his, pouring every ounce of strength into guiding him to the sofa.



But before she could straighten, Isaac suddenly clutched her arms with unexpected force, making her freeze.



His eyes searched her up and down, frantic. "Verena,are you hurt? Show me the wound!"



The sight of his near-desperate worry struck Verena with both warmth and guilt.



She laid her hand gently over his, steadying him.



Then her other hand moved softly to her rounded belly, caressing it as a calm smile spread across her lips. "Isaac, I'm fine. Don't be so tense. The baby just kicked suddenly, and I was startled. I'm sorry to worry you."



His eyes dropped at once to her belly,surprise flashing before the storm in his gaze began to ease.



He exhaled unevenly, still frowning but with a gentler tone. "So it was only the baby? No pain, no other discomfort?"



Saying so,he too reached out, placing his palm over hers. Verena nodded, her smile softening further."Nothing more. The baby's strong now-maybe just eager to greet you."



At that, Isaac's taut nerves finally began to loosen.



He let out a long breath, drew Verena into his arms,and rested his chin upon her shoulder.


For a moment he was silent; then, hoarsely, he confessed, "It tears at me-not being able to reach you the moment you're in distress."


His embrace tightened, as though he feared she might slip away.



Verena leaned into him, sadness wwashing over her at his words.



She circled her arms around him,patting his back with a gentleness one might offer a wounded child.



"Isaac, hush now. You've done more than enough.You stood for me, didn't you? That shows your legs are waking again-all because you care. How could I possibly blame you?"


Still, Isaac bowed his head, his voice muffled against her shoulder. "But I failed to reach you in time."


Verena lifted his face, guiding his eyes to hers. "That's enough of this discouraging talk." Her brows drew in mock sternness, though her tone held comfort."Answer me one question, will you?"


Her clear eyes held him as she leaned closer.


Isaac, caught off guard, forgot his sorrow for a heartbeat.


His gaze rose to hers, still shadowed but softened."What is it?" he asked gently, his voice raw yet touched by her nearness.


Verena's lips curved in playful mischief. She blinked,drawing out her words. "First tell me-are you wvilling to answer?"



Her fingertips brushed his cheek, warm and delicate.


Seeing her teasing spirit, Isaac felt the weight on his chest lift, little by little.


With a faint, resigned smile, he answered, "I'm willing.If it's you asking, I'll always be willing."


As he spoke, his hands covered hers on his cheeks,soaking in her warmth. His eyes brimmed with quiet devotion.



Verena's smile deepened at his reply, her heart glowing all the brighter.
###Chapter 296 | Want To Be Closer To You
Seeing the lingering sadness in Isaac's eyes, Verena recalled Luther's counsel: create more chances for Isaac to rise and even run to her. And whenever despair crept in from his inability to walk, she needed to steer him away from self-reproach,to pull him from that pit before it swallowed himn whole.



With that thought, Verena slid lightly onto his lap,leaning close until the tip of her nose brushed his.



Isaac's body stiffened in surprise at the sudden intimacy.



A flicker of astonishment crossed his eyes, soon giving way to an emotion stirred only by Verena's nearness.



She leaned in, the space between them dwindling to almost nothing.



So close now, their hearts seemed to echo each other -racing,stumbling,and then finding the same rhythm.



Tilting her chin, she drew nearer to his ear, her breath feather-light against him, teasing as a whisper of wind.With a voice soft enough to melt into the air, she murmured,"I want to know... how do you feel here?" Even as she spoke, her hand slipped beneath the fabric of his shirt.



Isaac's gaze deepened, intensity pooling in those eyes fixed on her.



His breathing grew uneven, as though words lodged in his throat,refusing to surface.


The hand on her waist instinctively gripped tighter, as if to anchor this luminous figure and forbid any distance from returning.


He parted his lips, but speech faltered; finally, in a husky rasp, he managed, "Verena, you... what are you ..."



The question trembled, but it was laced less with doubt than with the enchantment she had awakened.



Verena's lips curved with quiet triumph.Her head tilted,her eyes gleaming with playful affection as she whispered again at his ear, "Lost for words?"


Isaac's lips quivered, his breath broken and heavy.



His voice, rough yet charged with desire barely reined in, tumbled out, "Verena, you... you're going to make me..."



He wanted to say she was going to make him lose  every shred of control, but before he could finish, she lowered her head.



A burst of light seemed to explode in Isaac's mind, like fireworks scattering across a midnight sky. Every thought collapsed into chaos, and the world narrowed until there was nothing left but Verena's face,dangerously close and irresistibly vivid.


Almost without thought, his arm coiled tightly around her slender waist.


The other hand rose urgently yet tenderly to cradle her head,drawing her in until no gap remained.



Only in such closeness did it feel as though they could become whole.



Yet,the tide of control began to shift.



Verena, swept in the same current, looped her arm around his neck.



Her other hand stirred lightly-then came a crisp sound in the stillness of the study. His belt was unbuckled. The sudden note jolted Isaac, a spark of electricity that cut through the haze, dragging his reason back from the brink.



His breath tore out in gasps, his chest heaving,sweat gathering along his brow.With trembling restraint, he caught her hand mid-motion. "Verena, no..."



Her lips drew back from his, her gaze steady on him.



"Isaac, I want to be closer to you.Is that so wrong?"



Her eyes shimmered like dew, and his heart lurched at the sight.


Any other day, he would never have denied her.


But this was different.


Grinding his teeth, resignation etched across his features, he sighed and lowered his gaze to her swelling belly. His voice, hoarse and torn, said only,"The baby..."



Verena froze for a breath, but the sparkle in her eyes did not fade-it brightened, mischievous and resolute.



Leaning in once more, she cupped his face between her palms.



Her smile carried both pride and teasing warmth."Don't forget,I'm a doctor."


Heat surged through lsaac's chest, threatening to burst out in flames.



He trusted her judgment-she knew the boundaries  better than anyone.



But even knowing that, he could not trust himself.

###Chapter 297 Two Possible Results
Isaac's brows drew together in a deep frown as he held back his desire, and Verena found the sight both tender and pitiful, like laughter caught in the middle of sympathy.


Leaning closer, she gently pressed her forehead against his.


Their foreheads touched lightly, sharing a fleeting yet intimate moment. In a whisper soft as the rustle of leaves, she said, "Alright, I'll stop teasing you. We have a whole lifetime ahead of us."




···



The following day, at Evelyn Model Hospital..


Verena's pregnancy was advancing, making her every step heavier and more cumbersome.



Her once brisk and graceful pace had slowed, and her workload at the hospital had to be cut down considerably.



That morning, Verena stepped into the operating room. This time, she wasn't the surgeon holding the scalpel.Instead, she sat nearby, guiding the resident trainees through the procedure.



The operating room glowed under the bright lights.Instruments gave off steady, rhythmic sounds, filling the air with a solemn tension.



The trainees were fully absorbed, carrying out their duties with painstaking care.


Clad in a crisp white coat, her figure marked by the gentle swell of pregnancy, Verena sat upright in a specially designed chair, her gaze unwavering as she followed every move at the operating table.



One trainee held a scalpe,his hands trembling,sweat beading on his forehead-a clear picture of nerves stretched taut.



His eyes darted back and forth between the incision and Verena.



Sensing his anxiety, Verena leaned forward slightly,her voice calm and reassuring. "Don't worry. Keep your hand steady, just follow the steps we went over."



She pointed to a key area, directing his attention to the crucial point of the procedure.



Beside him, another trainee was suturing, his movements clumsy, the tension of each stitch wavering and uneven.



Verena's brows knitted slightly. "When suturing,keep the pressure even, and make sure the stitches are spaced consistently. That ensures better healing afterward."



As she spoke, she lifted a pair of tweezers and demonstrated, her motions smooth as flowing water -drawing admiring looks from the surrounding trainees.



Under her careful guidance, the young doctors gained confidence, and the surgery moved forward in steady order.



When the operation ended, midday break finally arrived.



Verena stretched her back, rose slowly, and stepped out of the operating room.



At that very moment, Julianna, having just finished her rounds, caught sight of her.


She hurried over, her smile bright and warm. "Evelyn,care to join me for lunch?"



Turning toward the familiar voice, Verena smiled gently and declined with courtesy. "Thank you,but l already have plans. Perhaps another time?" Julianna's face showed a flicker of disappointment,her lips pursed before she nodded. "Alright then. I'll see you later."



Once Julianna walked away, Verena slipped into a quiet corner of the hallway, took out her phone, and dialed Luis' number.


When he answered, she asked softly, "Luis, do you have time now?"



Luis' voice, touched with a smile, came through the line. "I was just about to ask if you'd join me for lunch,and then your call came. Are you still at the hospital?I'll drive over."



In the past, it was Isaac who waited for her.


Now, with Luis, there was a warmth of kinship,a different kind of anticipation that steadied her heart.


It felt like comfort arriving by two different paths.



Isaac's devotion was born of love; Luis' presence was the embrace of family.


Her smile deepened as she answered, "Alright.I'll wait for you at the hospital entrance."



She descended by elevator and waited on the steps outside. Before long, a black Cayenne rolled into view.



She recognized it instantly, her lips curving into an unbidden smile.



The car eased to a stop before her, the window lowered, revealing Luis' steady, mature face. "Have you been waiting long, Verena?" he asked.


She shook her head with a soft smile. "No,I just came out."



Even before she finished, Luis was already out of the car, opening the door for her.


She murmured her thanks and slid inside.


The car pulled awvay from the hospital.


Since she had work in the afternoon, Verena suggested they go to a nearby restaurant known for its authentic dishes-saving both time and effort.


Soon,the Cayenne stopped at the restaurant entrance.


The facade was refined, the sign prominent. A doorman quickly stepped forward, opening the car door in welcome.



Inside, the décor was tasteful, the lighting soft,wrapping the space in a pleasant and homely warmth. Verena, familiar with the place, chose a seat by the window, where the sunlight streamed in-perfect for a quiet meal and a private talk.


Luis slid the menu toward her with a smile. "Order whatever you like. Think of it as a reward from your elder brother for all your hard work as the great doctor."



With a laugh, Verena accepted the menu, took her time, and made the selections.


After placing the order, as they waited for the dishes,she leaned slightly forward, elbow resting on the table,fingers tapping lightly. "Luis, there's something I need to discuss with you."


His eyes, deep and perceptive, flickered with understanding, a composed smile playing at hislips.


Leaning back, shoulders straight, he radiated the calm assurance of a seasoned man.



He shook his head gently, his voice confident yet teasing. "I also have something to tell you. But l suspect we're thinking of the same thing."



Verena tilted her head, smiling at the unspoken bond between them.



She took a sip of water to ease her throat, and then  set the glass down, her expression sharpening into seriousness. "Since it's clear now that Alec and Laura never knew I wasn't their biological daughter, then I must have been secretly swapped at birth. At that time, Alec and Laura had little to their name,so there was no reason to target them. That means the real target must have been the Sampson family."



Her brows furrowed as she thought aloud, her fingers tapping a steady rhythm on the table.


"I believe someone sought an opening to approach the Sampsons and then exchanged me with the Willis baby. The aim was to strike the Sampson family hard.I see two possible results: one, after the Sampsons were shaken, their business would falter, projects slipping into rival hands, bringing enormous profit to others. Two, it might simply have been vengeance-a cruel desire to sow pain and chaos within the family."


Lifting her gaze, she met Luis' eyes, her expression intent. "Luis, do the Sampsons have any rivals of note?Or in the business world, are there competitors so ruthless that they would stop at nothing to bring the family down?"
###Chapter 298 Press Conference
Verena's sudden questions threw Luis off balance.



He raised a hand and rubbed at his brow with his thumb, a flicker of unease settling over his face as his brows drew together.


Long before this meeting, he had suspected that Verena's disappearance hadn't been an accident at all.More likely, it was a carefully planned scheme by someone with a darker agenda.


But suspicion was all it had ever been. He hadn't dug deeply enough to uncover the truth.



Only after Verena laid her questions out plainly did Luis begin to grasp just how tangled things really were,leaving him uneasy and at a loss for words.



Leading the country's underground forces had earned him more than his share of enemies through the years.



Just within their hometown, Ochrerayd, countless people bore grudges against him and the Sampson name.



As he mulled it over, the idea of a targeted plot


Air India Flights Resume seemed far more likely.



A sharp breath slipped from him as the realization sank in. He shot Verena a quick glance, quietly gauging her reaction.



If she learned just how many enemies their family had accumulated,would she begin to resent them?



The thought made his head pound.


He massaged his temples, sifting through the endless list of factions that had crossed the Sampson family over the years.



But the further he dug through his memories, the wider the circle grew, and the harder it became to pinpoint who might be responsible.


Clearing his throat, Luis finally answered, "Verena,you've put me in a difficult position. You know the Sampson family's influence in the underworld.We've naturally made plenty of enemies. If we're talking about people who hate us, there are too many to count."



He gave a weary shake of his head, a strained smile tugging at his lips.


From that, Verena caught on.


Her eyes narrowed, and her fists tightened against the  table. Her voice came out cold and sharp. "No matter who it is, I won't let the one who destroyed our family escape. If someone despises the Sampson family that much, then now that I've resurfaced, they won't be able to resist making a move."



She drew in a steady breath before speaking again."Luis, announce that I've returned to the Sampson family. Host a party. We'll appear together, and you'll introduce me to everyone in Ochrerayd. Let the news spread everywhere. I don't believe the person hiding in the shadows will sit quietly once they hear it. When they make their move, we'll finally have a trail to follow."



Luis' face grew grim as her plan sank in. "That would put you right back in danger. I can't allow it."


He caught himself, realizing his tone was too sharp,and spoke more gently. "Verena, this is reckless. I understand your determination to uncover the truth and avenge the family, but what if they act out of desperation and target you again? Our parents and I could never bear to see you hurt once more. Even the smallest risk is too much."



Her brother's worry filled Verena with warmth, butit didn't shake her resolve.



She laid her hand lightly over his, her voice calm yet unwavering. "Luis, waiting around only gives them the  upper hand. Right now, we know nothing about our enemy, and neither do they about our intentions. If we stay passive, how will we ever unmask the one responsible? I refuse to let them keep roaming free,endangering our family."



She paused, and then leaned in, her eyes locking onto his with a faint, steady smile. "Tell me, Luis,don't you trust your own ability to protect me? I do. If we prepare carefully, I believe you'll keep me safe."


Luis' brows knitted tighter as her words cut through him,his heart pulled in two directions.


How could he ever doubt his ability to protect his sister?



Her plan was dangerous, and Luis knew it.


Even the smallest risk to Verena's safety was something he could never take lightly.



But the determination in her eyes made it impossible to voice his rejection outright.


Uneasy, he dragged both hands down his face, trying to steady his thoughts.


When he finally spoke, his voice was lowbut firm."Verena, it isn't a matter of confidence. Aside from Mom,you are the most important woman in my life.This situation is unpredictable. We have no idea what
 moves they'll make. If anything went wrong, I would regret it for the rest of my days. Please, hear me out.Let's consider other ways to flush them out while keeping you safe."



His hesitation unsettled Verena, though her resolve did not waver.



She knew deep down that her plan was the only path forward.



"Luis, I know you're worried. I won't pretend I'm fearless, but whoever took me back then clearly knew our family inside and out. NNow that I've already reunited with you and our parents, they likely already know. Waiting quietly will only give them more opportunities. Finding out who they are is worth the risk to me. We can surround me with guards and prepare for every possibility. And remember,you're not the only one protecting me. Isaac won't allow harm to come my way either. Trust me, Luis. Nothing will happen. Please agree."


For a long while, he said nothing.


At last, Luis' gaze deepened, and he gave a reluctant nod. "Fine. I'll agree. But you must swear to follow my lead. Every precaution I set in place, you obey. If something feels wrong, don't act brave; get behind me immediately. Do you understand?" Verena's lips curved into a small smile, and she nodded."I understand."







In Ochrerayd, the press conference hall gleamed under the light of a massive crystal chandelier, its brilliance spilling across every corner of the room.



A red carpet unfurled from the entrance all the way to the stage, lined with fresh, colorful blooms that released a faint, sweet fragrance into the air.


Uniformed security guards maintained strict order,pacing the perimeter with sharp eyes to ensure nothing disrupted the event.



Every touch revealed just how much effort the Sampson family had invested in this occasion.



Journalists from leading outlets had poured in from all directions, buzzing with anticipation.


Even before the press conference, clusters of reporters were already locked in spirited conversation.



One veteran from a major newspaper adjusted his glasses, his brow furrowed. "This press conference from the Sampson family is baffling. Not a single detail leaked beforehand. All they said was that an announcement would be made. I've covered stories  for years, but I've never seen secrecy handled this tightly."



A young woman known for her celebrity scoops tested her microphone and chimed in, "I know, right?I've been digging through all my contacts these past few days, and not a shred of useful information came out."



Another reporter specializing in entertainment news added quickly, "Same here! Normally, when powerful families make a move, some rumor always escapes.But this time, the Sampsons have sealed everything shut. Not a word."


A business reporter folded his arms, thinking aloud."The Sampsons are known for playing it safe. If they've gone all out with a press conference like this,it's got to be tied to something big. Maybe they're about to unveil a major partnership?"



Almost immediately, Stan Juarez,a local reporter from Ochrerayd, cut in, "I don't buy it. If it were about business, they'd have leaked teasers to build hype and stir up market confidence. This feels more like a private matter within the family."


The back-and-forth only heightened the energy,curiosity mounting with every exchange.



Before long, a staff member stepped on stage to announce that the conference was about to begin.



The chatter died down instantly. Reporters readied their equipment, eyes trained on the platform, waiting for the revelation.
###Chapter 299 It Shall Also Be Hers
Luis stepped onto the stage with measured confidence,the echo of his leather shoes striking the polished floor like a drumbeat, pulling every gaze toward him.


He wore a sharply tailored dark suit; his straight posture and commanding presence spoke louder than words.



Reaching the front of the stage, Luis halted, scanning the sea of faces before him.



His calm, deep eyes carried an innate sternness and quiet authority, and like a sudden hush before a storm,the restless murmur of the crowd stilled.



Clearing his throat, he spoke into the microphone,his magnetic voice resonating. "I believe many of you are wondering why the Sampson family has recently poured such energy and excitement into this press conference."



Here, he paused for a breath, and for a fleeting second,warmth glimmered in his eyes.



The reporters fixed their eyes on him, not daring to blink. Pens hovered in midair, recorders ready, every  ear sharpened not to miss a single word.



Noticing their rapt attention, Luis' smile brightened."Since you are so curious, I won't keep you dangling on the hook any longer."



His voice rose unconsciously as he declared with deliberate clarity, "Ladies and gentlemen,today I am honored to announce joyous news. The family member we lost for more than twenty years-my younger sister-has at last been found."


His words rang through the hall, clear as a bell.


Just moments earlier, whispers and speculation had filled the room; now silence struck like lightning,leaving the audience stunned.



Then, like a dam bursting, exclamations and hurried discussions rushed forth, mingled with the flashing storm of cameras eager to capture history in the making.



One reporter gasped, "Is this real? I've followed the Sampson family for years and heard of the missing daughter. After years of silence, I feared the worst,and yet now..."



Another sighed, "Over twenty years...how many such spans does one get in a lifetime? The Sampson family has endured like a tree rooted against storms. Many would have abandoned the search, but they never  wavered. It shows how deeply they cherish this daughter."


Someone, more skeptical, chimed in, "Look at the grandeur of this announcement-it proves how highly they treasure her. They never stopped searching,and now that she's back, they unveil it n this grand fashion.But let's not forget: I hear the Sampson family is preparing major moves in pharmaceuticals. Could this be nothing more than a prelude? Businessmen often dress profit in the robes of affection."



Around them, reporters nodded in agreement with this suspicion.



"This isn't merely about family love; the currents run deeper."



"Indeed. Sampson Group has kept Ochrerayd's business world steady, yet beyond its borders, the waters are anything but calm. Rivals lie in wait,ready for a slip."



"As an old and powerful family in Ochrerayd, they've long held the crown. With the daughter's return,new alliances could form, perhapsheralding the rise of an even greater force alongside them."



The discussion swelled like a tide, the press conference turning into a cauldron of opinions.



Luis, unshaken, lifted his hand slightly. The gesture,calm yet commanding, was enough to draw silence once again.



The reporters quieted, curiosity burning hotter than ever,their earlier fervor now redirected to the man on stage.



When the hush was complete, Luis spoke again. "For over twenty years, our search never ceased. Now that my sister is safely back, this blessing is beyond measure for the Sampson family."



The spotlight carved out his profile,highlighting his resolve as he lifted his chin. His eyes, sharp as a blade,cut through the glare and met the cameras head-on.


With the whole room watching,he continued slowly,"To make amends for the years she lost, to let her truly feel the warmth of home,I solemnly declare that I will entrust many ofour core sectors to her-so she may guide Sampson Group's future at my side."


A ripple of shock swept across the hall, setting cameras ablaze and reporters clamoring with questions.


"Mr. Sampson, which sectors specifically?"


All eyes locked onto him; the answer was a prize no one wanted to miss.


 
Luis replied without hurry, "Our initial plan is to entrust  the sectors of emerging technology and premium real estate to my sister. With her wisdom and ability, I believe she will expand them and carry forward the Sampson legacy."



"Then what effect will your sister's return have on the family's future direction?"



For years,the world outside had known little about the family's lost daughter.


Her sudden reappearance and immediate role in such vital enterprises introduced countless unknowns.


As the question hung in the air, the venue fell silent,breath held as though the room itself waited for his response.



Luis' gaze softened with determination and affection.



He looked briefly into the camera, and then turned to the reporter.



"As for the future," he said, his voice low but unwavering, "all I can say is this: as long as she desires it, and as long as it is mine, it shall also be hers."



The promise, spoken with iron firmness, carried weight far beyond sentiment. The reporters exchanged meaningful glances. Their pens scratched swiftly, knowing they had caught a statement that could reshape Ochrerayd's business map. For it was not merely a brother's love; it hinted at sweeping changes that the Sampson daughter's return might set in motion.



Luis steadied the air once more and addressed them."I know many questions remain in your minds.Curiosity is only natural; after all, twenty years can change a person in countless ways."



At this, a faint smile touched his lips, and his tone grew resolute. "To answer your questions, and to formally welcome my sister back into the family, the Sampson family will hold a grand party in ten days' time. She will personally attend and meet you all. Whether media,business partners, or leaders of every circle-l sincerely invite you to come and witness this moment of rare significance together."



The moment his words fell, applause thundered through the hall, rising in waves like a tide that refused to ebb.
###Chapter 300 Stand Up And Come To Me

The reporters moved quickly, adjusting their lenses with precision, ensuring not a single important frame slipped past them.



The relentless click of shutters filled the room,sharp and rhythmic, like the pounding of drums. None of them dared miss a shot that might explode into headlines.



Every frame they captured streamed instantly across the internet, reaching countless viewers in real time.


Meanwhile, far across the city, in a shadowed villa,a middle-aged man reclined lazily in an antique chair.


The unsteady glow of the dim light threw strange,shifting shadows over his face.



On the polished table before him sat a porcelain cup,steam curling upward in delicate threads.



The mist softened his features, but nothing could disguise the sinister glint in his eyes.


He raised the cup, blew lightly across the rim, and took a slow sip. As the taste spread over his tongue, his lips curved into a knowing smile.



The announcement from Luis echoed through the television, catching him off guard for only a moment.



Then,a cruel sneer twisted across his mouth.



"So they've brought her back? Perfect..."


The words rolled from him in a low murmur, dark and cold,like a whisper from the abyss.


"One move with that girl was enough to cripple Joseph and Marisa before. This time, Luis, it's your turn."His gaze fixed on Luis' image on the screen, teeth grinding as he hissed. "Enjoy the happiness while it lasts... Soon, you'll bleed for it."



At Seraphina Villas in Shoildon, Verena and Isaac sat together on the sofa, the glow of the television washing over their faces as the press conference played on.



When the broadcast neared its close, Verena shifted her gaze toward the man at her side.



Isaac sat upright, his expression stern, the weight of his thoughts plain to see.



Sensing her eyes, he turned his head, meeting her  steady look.



Their gazes held.



Verena finally spoke, biting her lip before saying,"Isaac, my brother and I talked it over. We've decided to arrange a party ten days from now. WVill you come with me to Ochrerayd?"


Her hand slipped into his, her eyes steady with determination. "This party isn't just about announcing my return. The real purpose is to lure out the one who took me all those years ago."


Isaac's brows drew together, a sharp seriousness flickering in his eyes. His voice carried the weight of concern. "Verena, this plan is dangerous. Anyone capable of taking you from the Sampson family in secret is not someone ordinary..."


Before he could finish, Verena pressed her fingers gently against his lips, cutting him off. "I understand the risks. But everything will be prepared. He won't get the chance to harm me. Besides, with you by my side,how could I possibly be hurt?"


When their eyes met, lsaac caught the raw,unwavering trust shining in her clear gaze.


Somehow,that quiet trust eased the weight of worry pressing on his heart.He tightened his grip around her slender hand, his tone resolute. "You're right. I'll stay by your side. No matter what, I won't let anything happen to you. If it comes to it, I'd give everything for you."



A wave of emotion washed over Verena, but a sudden thought pulled her back.


Her brows drew together, a distant look settling in as though her mind had wandered elsewhere.


A quiet spark lit up her eyes, and she turned her head toward Isaac. Her tone softened with a teasing edge."I don't want you throwing yourself into danger. The thought of you getting hurt scares me. But... would you promise me one thing?"


Her voice softened into persuasion, sweet enough to melt the weight in his chest.



Isaac's gaze softened, his deep eyes catching her smile. "Tell me," he said warmly.


With a bright smile, Verena leaned closer, and then rose from the sofa and stepped back a few paces.


"Stand up and come to me," she said. The request froze lsaac in place, a flicker of panic flashing across his face. His eyes dropped instinctively to his legs, his lips pressing into a thin line.



Drawing in a deep breath,he tried to steady the storm of emotions inside him.



At last, his voice came out strained, carrying both helplessness and bitterness."I... can't."



Verena's gaze softened, her tone gentle yet firm."Isaac, I've seen the footage in the study. You've stood before, more than once. I know you can do it.Just try with me now. You can."



Isaac's brows knitted tightly as he pressed his palms hard against his knees, his head bowing low. His fringe slipped forward, shadowing his eyes so no one could read what lay behind them.


The truth was, those rare moments he had risen in the study hadn't been conscious choices. They were born out of instinct, his fear for Verena driving him to act when logic and limitation should have stopped him.



Now, asked to stand on his own, his will faltered.



It wasn't the fear of failing that chained him to the seat-it was the thought of seeing the disappointment in Verena's eyes. Watching his hesitation, Verena felt her chest tighten.  Resigned, she tried coaxing him with a gentler touch.


Her tone turned playful. "Isaac, please, jst try.I know you can."



At her words, his head lifted slowly, eyes clouded with conflict.



Before he could speak, Verena crooked her finger in a teasing gesture, her voice lilting with sweet mischief."Come on, walk over here to me."



Still,his body betrayed him.


Without saying a word, he stared at her, his jaw clenched and fingers tightening around his knees before he even noticed.



He stayed right where he was, making no move to rise from his seat.



Verena narrowed her eyes in mock anger,stamping her foot and planting her hands on her hips. "Isaac,I mean it. If you won't listen to me, I might really stop paying attention to you."


She chose her words with sharp edges, hoping the sting would push Isaac to find his strength.



The moment he heard her words, a flicker of unease rushed through Isaac. His head snapped up, panic flooding his eyes as he rushed out the words. "Verena, please, don't be upset.I didn't mean it. I swear I didn't."


Yet even as the words rushed out, his body stayed rooted to the sofa,unmoving.



Verena could see that this path would lead nowhere.



Her eyes flicked with a sudden idea. She placed a gentle hand on her rounded belly, letting her features crease as if in pain. Her voice came out weak and strained."Oh,sweetheart... with the baby, I can't stay standing much longer. My legs already ache so badly.If you don't come help me, I really don't think I can hold on."



She swayed lightly as she spoke, her act so believable it tugged at the heart as if it were true.
###Chapter 301 The Party



Upon hearing those words,Isaac's heart tightened with worry.


Afraid that Verena might stumble and hurt herself,he clenched his teeth, his hand gripping the sofa's armrest as though anchoring himself. Veins stood out on his forehead as he forced his weary body to respond.Summoning every ounce of strength left in him,he tried to rise.


At last, after a grueling struggle, his legs quivered but managed to lift him upright.


Yet, the moment he tried to take a step toward Verena,his body betrayed him. His legs felt like dead weight, each movement agonizing, his frame swaying like a reed in the wind.



Verena rushed forward, catching his arm before he collapsed.



When his balance steadied, she gently let go.



Lifting her gaze to him, her eyes brimmed with joy."You're standing now, aren't you? Isaac,you really can do it." Only then did Isaac look down, as though waking from a dream, to see his legs planted firmly on the floor-supporting him without crutch or aid.


This time, it was under his own willpower that he truly stood.



A spark of triumph lit his eyes.



"Verena,I stood up!"



His eyes grew moist. He opened his mouth, but emotion rose like a knot in his throat, silencing him.



After a pause, he managed to choke out the words."I ...I really stood up..."


His voice carried disbelief, yet it trembled with an irrepressible joy.


Verena's heart swelled with mixed feelings. She almost wanted to weep. Reaching up,she wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, her smile tender."Yes, Isaac, you did it. I knew you could. If you keep trying,you'll walk freely again,just like before."



Isaac nodded with fierce determination, his arms wrapping around her.



He buried his head against her shoulder, his voice hushed and uneven. "Verena, thank you... thank you for giving me the courage."



-



Ten days slipped by in the blink of an eye, and the Sampson family party arrived as promised.



The party unfolded within a stately mansion in Ochrerayd. Paths of polished bluestone led the way,flanked by white walls etched with intricate patterns -each detail bearing the mark of fine craftsmanship.



At the garden's heart lay a petite pond,clear as glass,its surface shimmering under the touch of the setting sun.


Following the corridor to its far end opened into the party's main hall.


The contrast struck at once. Where the exterior exuded rustic calm, the interior dazzled with grandeur.


Tables draped in luxurious cloths stood in precise order, each adorned with gleaming dinnerware and bright blossoms.



Candles flickered, their flames mingling with the brilliance of crystal chandeliers above, bathing the hall in a glow that was both warm and regal.


The parking lot of the mansion teemed with commotion. Vehicles lined up in neat succession, headlights glinting like jewels in the twilight.


Each polished car seemed to declare the prestige of its passenger.


One after another, distinguished guests stepped out.Titans of business adjusted their suits, their conversations hushed but brimming with speculation.



Politicians, faces practiced into perfect smiles,walked with poise toward the entrance.



The crowd also included men from the city's undercurrents.



Their presence brought an unusual vibe, slightly out of sync with the surroundings.


Their sharp gazes and hardened faces betrayed lives carved by survival, yet tonight even they set aside arrogance, carrying themselves with uncharacteristic restraint before the Sampson family.



Adding to the atmosphere were journalists from every corner of the media, their cameras and microphones at the ready to capture history in the making.



A long crimson carpet unfurled from the garden to the hall, flanked by servers who stood like sentinels,their polite smiles rehearsed to perfection. At the entrance to the main hall, Verena and Luis stood ready to greet the guests.



The occasion demanded dignity, and Verena chose a designer dress. Its pristine fabric gleamed faintly,embroidered with delicate patterns. The cut was elegant yet considerate, allowing space for the child she carried.



When she moved, the sleeves swayed lightly, like petals stirred by a gentle breeze.


Her makeup was simple but refined. Her long hair was coiled neatly and secured with a hairpin.



The grace of her slender neck and poised bearing gave her an aura both serene and noble.



Beside her stood Luis, tall and steadfast.



His tailored black suit bespoke craftsmanship of the highest tier. A crisp white shirt and dark-patterned tie completed the look,exuding quiet dignity.


His hair was neatly combed, his eyes clear and sharp.



Together,they presented a striking contrast-softness and steel side by side-drawing admiration from all who passed. Many whispered their praise of their presence and natural poise. Luis, ever mindful, introduced guests to Verena while discreetly sharing with her the intricacies of Ochrerayd's social currents. Each introduction was a thread,weaving her into the fabric of her new life.



Just then, a middle-aged man in a navy suit and gold -rimmed glasses approached.



Seeing Luis, he quickened his step, extending his hand warmly. "Mr. Sampson, it's been too long. I heard your sister has been found-what wonderful news! After hardship always comes blessing. Your family is destined to rise higher than ever."



He gave a slight bow, humility laced into his tone.


Luis' lips curved faintly as he returned the handshake.His words were steady,carrying the composure of one accustomed to command. "Thank you for your kind words."



Turning with quiet pride, Luis gestured toward Verena."Mr. Dury, allow me to introduce my younger sister,Verena."



His voice softened with warmth as he continued,"Verena, this is Henrik Dury of the Dury Group. In Ochrerayd's high-tech sector, his company holds weight,andtheirproductshaveearnednotableacclaim."



Leaning closer, Luis whispered to her, "Their influence  doesn't rival the largest groups, but their strength in research and development makes them invaluable.One day, when we step into this field, Henrik will be an important ally."


Understanding, Verena smiled graciously. She bowed slightly. "Mr. Dury, I've heard much about you. It's an honor to meet you today."


Henrik's gaze lingered a moment, admiration flickering in his eyes. Something about her seemed familiar,though the memory eluded him.


With practiced courtesy, he replied, "Ms. Sampson,you're too generous. Your return has already added new color to Ochrerayd. I look forward to future collaborations with you and Mr. Sampson."


With that, an attendant guided Henrik into the hall,leaving the air warm with anticipation for what was yet to unfold.
###Chapter 302 Owes Him More Than We Could Eve...
"I hope I'm not too late for the celebration, Luis. Still a spot for me at the table?"



The party was about to begin when a deep, friendly voice echoed from the entrance,commanding the attention of everyone in the hall.


Verena glanced up and spotted a distinguished man stepping inside. He carried himself with a warmth that immediately put people at ease, his genial smile inviting rather than imposing.



Though time had etched gentle lines across his brow and his frame had softened, there was nothing weary in his manner. His presence was approachable, even reassuring.



A dark gray suit jacket,expertly tailored, draped over his shoulders with effortless elegance. A silk tie in midnight blue brought a quiet dignity to his appearance.



At the sight of Sherwood Kirk, Luis moved to greet him,posture straight and respectful. "Mr. Kirk, don't be modest. This evening wouldn't be complete without you." Sherwood chuckled, his laughter booming as he clapped Luis on the shoulder in a familiar, almost fatherly gesture. "Always so earnest, Luis. I was only teasing. Got held up getting back, but I made sure to come straight here."



Then his eyes softened with concern. "It's been ages since I saw your father.How are your parents these days? At our age,health is everything."


Luis dipped his head in gratitude. "Thank you for asking. They're both improving,thankfully.And you-you're always so busy. Be sure to take care of yourself,too."



Verena watched the middle-aged man with quiet interest,her thoughts swirling beneath a calm exterior.


Most of the evening's guests had filed in with the same measured politeness-each stopping to offer Luis a greeting that was all surface and formality.


But the moment Mr. Kirk arrived, the atmosphere shifted.



Luis stepped forward personally to welcome him,his tone carrying genuine respect.


Mr. Kirk greeted Luis with a tone that belonged to family, not formality-there was warmth in his voice,like an old friend slipping back into a cherished routine.Instead of the usual polite distance, Mr. Kirk genuinely inquired about her parents, his concern warm and unforced.



Their conversation felt nothing like small talk. It was rich with the ease and depth of people reuniting after too long apart.


It was clear to Verena that Mr. Kirk and her parents were bound by years of shared stories.


Casting a fond look at his waistline, Sherwood gave his belly a playful pat and let out a good-natured laugh. "I swear, two months in the countryside and all I've got to show for it is a bigger belly!"



Luis drew a breath to tease him, but a melodic,teasing voice beat him to it. "You're the only one surprised,Dad!"



Verena turned in time to see a young woman approaching, her pink off-the-shoulder dress fluttering as she walked, heels tapping out a gentle rhythm on the floor.



There was wisdom behind her youthful features-a quiet poise that softened her glow.



Molly Kirk, Sherwood's daughter, came to a stop beside them and fixed her father with a mock-scowl."I leave for one minute and you've already ditched me? That's just cruel!"



Turning her full attention to Luis, Molly let the rest of the world fade into the background. "You have no idea how amazing the desserts are in Starshell these days. Every time I visit, I can't help but sample everything. Honestly, I think I've gained a few pounds just from all the taste-testing."


With a teasing glimmer, she pressed a finger to her cheek, as if to prove her point.


Luis remained unflappable, his expression cool and composed,returning only the faintest of polite smiles.


Molly,undeterred,leaned in with renewed brightness."Actually, I stumbled on a little dessertplace tucked away in Starshell-absolutely heavenly. I should take you there next time. You'd love it."



Her eyes danced as she gently reached for his arm,every move overflowing with clear affection and intent.



Sherwood could only laugh, shaking his head. "You were gone so long, I just figured I'd catch up with Luis while I waited."



He glanced from his daughter to Luis, a thoughtful flicker in his eyes,but said nothing more.


Luis subtly shifted, putting a careful distance between  them.His tone stayed measured and formal. "Miss Kirk,that's kind of you, but I've been buried in work. You should enjoy those treats yourself-I wouldn't want to slow you down."



Molly's smile faltered for a split second, the bright confidence dimming just before she gathered herself,swallowing her disappointment behind another graceful smile.



Luis gave no sign he'd noticed Molly's disappointment.With quiet composure, he shifted beside Verena,his hand gently guiding her forward.


"Mr. Kirk,allow me to introduce my sister, Verena," he said,his voice carrying pride and a hint of relief. "She's endured more than most,but at last, she's home again."



He turned to Verena, offering a warm smile. "Verena,this is Sherwood Kirk-one of our father's oldest friends."



His voice lowered as he continued, "While you were gone,everything changed. Home never felt the same.Mom was broken by grief. Dad wore himself out searching for you, looking after her, and never truly recovered."



Luis' eyes softened with emotion as he glanced back at Sherwood. "During those years, when it felt like everything was falling apart, Mr. Kirk stood by us.He  taught me the ropes, helped me weather the business storms, and reminded me how to keep the family from crumbling. Without his support, I honestly don't know where we'd be. Our family owes him more than we could ever repay."

###Chapter 303 Marriage Alliance
At those heartfelt words, Verena turned toward Sherwood and bent slightly in gratitude. "Mr. Kirk,thank you. Luis and I will never forget how much kindness you've 'shown us."



Before she could lower herself fully, Sherwood moved quickly and lifted her back up with gentle hands.


Affection softened his expression, and his gaze lingered on her as though he were looking at a daughter long lost. HHis whole demeanor radiated pride and care.



He pressed her hand reassuringly and spoke with warmth. "There's no need for thanks, my dear. We're bound like family, and family should always help each other.What truly matters is that you've come back safe and sound."



Shifting his attention to Luis, his eyes grew serious."Luis,your sister has returned, and it falls on you to look after her well. She has likely gone through many hardships while she was away, and now that she is home at last, she ought to have some peace. If there comes a time when you face trouble or find yourself  needing assistance, do not hesitate to speak up. I will gladly lend you my help."



Luis gave a firm nod. "I understand. Thank you for your concern. I'll protect Verena and won't allow anyone to hurt her again."



A proud smile spread across Sherwood's face as he patted Luis on the shoulder. "That's exactly what I hoped to hear. You've always been dependable. I trust you'll do right by your sister. She's grown into such a graceful and inteligent young woman. Our two families should meet more often. It's always better to have lively company around."



From theside, Molly quietly observed the exchange.She noticed how deeply Luis treasured his sister.Though a flicker of emotion stirred in her chest, she kept it hidden behind composure.



Instead,she stepped forward with a radiant smile and slipped her hand into Verena's with ease. "Yes, Verena,you're truly delightful. I felt an instant connection the moment I saw you. Let's spend time together from now on. I've been wanting a good companion, and I think I've found one in you."



Verena, uncomfortable with too much warmth from someone she barely knew, kept her tone gracious."Thank you, Miss Kirk. I'll be sure to ask you for tips on where to go in Ochrerayd." Molly gave a playful wave of her hand, her smile wide."Don't call me Miss Kirk. That sounds stiff. Just say Molly.We're practically friends now."


A small, composed smile curved Verena's lips as she carefully eased her hand free, though she gave a polite nod in return.



Molly,brimming.with energy, clearly wasn't ready to let the moment end and leaned in as if eager to keep the exchange going.



Luis cut in smoothly, his timing precise. "Mr. Kirk, the wind is stronger out here. It's warmer inside. Please go ahead and rest in the hall."


He shifted slightly to the side, motioning toward the entrance of the main hall.


Sherwood's eyes flicked toward Verena, lingering briefly on the faint curve of her belly before he answered warmly, "You're right, Luis. Molly and I will go in first."



With an easy smile, he led the way toward the main hall.


Though Molly seemed reluctant to pull back, she didn't challenge her father's lead.


 
Instead,she flashed Verena another bright smile. "I'll  go in first then. We can pick up where we left off inside."



Without waiting for a reply, she trailed after Sherwood into the hall.



Verena's gaze lingered on Molly's graceful figure for a moment, curiosity stirring before she turned back to Luis.



After a short pause, she asked quietly,"Luis...you and Molly, is there something between you?"


A faint crease formed on Luis' brow as he lowered his voice. "Sherwood has entertained the idea of tying our families closer through marriage. With our history and business ties, the elders think it would make sense."


His words slowed, edged with resolve. "But I've never felt anything for her in that way."



Verena nodded in quiet understanding. "Love can't be manufactured. You should follow your heart, not obligations."


Luis gave a weary shake of his head. "Still, Sherwood has always treated me with generosity. That makes it hard. Whenever he drops hints, I usually steer the conversation elsewhere, just to	avoid	an uncomfortable scene."



Verena gave Luis' shoulder a firm but gentle pat. "Luis, don't let it weigh too heavily on you. Sherwood has always shown you kindness, and I believe he's a reasonable man. When you find the right moment,speak honestly with him. Marriage isn't something to rush-it deserves patience and thought."



Luis inclined his head, ready to answer, but his words stalled when his eyes caught a figure drawing near.



Isaac moved forward in his wheelchair, a white shawl draped carelessly over his arm, his composure calm as always.



Trailing a few steps behind him was a striking young woman.



A flowing gown of deep blue clung to her form,cinching at the waist before cascading into a skirt that swayed with each graceful step,like petals stirred by a soft breeze.



Her heels struck the floor in a delicate rhythm, each click ringing clear in the air.


Noticing Luis' focus shift, Verena instinctively followed his line of sight.



Her lips curved with recognition as Isaac came closer.



Her gaze drifted past him, landing on the woman at his back. A spark of surprise lit her eyes before it melted into joy.



"Miranda?" She moved forward quickly,her voice warm."What brings you here?"



Miranda's eyes flicked briefly to Luis before settling on Verena. Her smile carried both charm and ease. "I'm attending on behalf of my company."



Playfully pretending to be offended, Miranda tapped Verena's arm. "If I hadn't seen Isaac at the gates,I'd never have discovered your true origins. How could you keep something like this from me? Aren't we supposed to be best friends?"


Verena's expression softened with guilt. "I wasn't trying to hide it. Everything happened so suddenly,and I've barely had time to breathe, let alone explain."



As their voices mingled, Isaac wheeled closer,slipping the shawl over Verena's shoulders in quiet care.
###Chapter 304 Does A One-night Stand Count As...



Verena bent slightly as lsaac put the shawl on her shoulders. She pulled it tighter as if to ward off the chill riding on the night wind.


Miranda watched with a playful smile tugging at her lips. "Oh, come now. I was only jesting.I wasn't truly upset. It's just astonishing-who would have guessed you're the Sampson family's daughter? That's quite the twist of fate, like turning a page and finding a different story written there."



Verena glanced toward the silent Luis before replying,"Ah,yes,Miranda.Let me introduce you properly. This is my elder brother, Luis Sampson."


Turning to Luis, she added warmly, "Luis, this is Miranda Brown-the CEO of AuroraNexus in Clokron,and my dear friend since college. She's stood by me through thick and thin."



Miranda lifted her eyes to Luis, a playful arch in her gaze, and extended her hand. "Mr. Sampson, it has been a long while."



Her tone carried a hidden undercurrent, as though some unspoken tale lingered between her words. Luis met her eyes, and for a fleeting moment,emotions stirred like ripples across still water. Then,as quickly as they came,they vanished;leaving only calm.



His voice was steady as he clasped her hand politely."Miss Brown, your achievements are commendable.Managing AuroraNexus with such success is no small feat. And thank you for watching over my sister all these years."


Miranda's smile deepened, her tone light. "Mr.Sampson, you're too generous with your praise. I've always considered Verena as family, so it's only natural I care for her. But if you truly wish to thank me,perhaps you could treat me to a meal sometime?"


Just before she released his hand, her fingertip brushed lightly against his palm-subtle as a feather,yet carrying an unmistakable hint of flirtation.


Luis' frame stiffened almost imperceptibly. His brows lifted in brief surprise, and then his composure returned like a mask slipped back into place.He smiled, steering the moment elsewhere. "The party will be starting soon. Verena, why don't you take your friend inside?"



Verena caught the faint tension between them.Though curiosity tugged at her, she chose to let  it rest for now. She simply nodded and smiled at Miranda. "It's too breezy here at the door. Let's head in."


Inside the hall, Miranda accepted a glass of red wine from Verena, though her eyes still lingered on the entrance, savoring the earlier exchange. "I truly didn't expect him to be your brother."


Following her friend's gaze, Verena noticed Luis speaking with Isaac at the doorway.


She turned back to Miranda, frowning slightly."Miranda, what exactly is going on between you and my brother? From the moment you two met,something felt... unusual. Do you know each other well?"



"Know each other well?" Miranda mused, and then leaned close to Verena's ear with a mischievous smile."Tell me-does a one-night stand count as familiar?"


Verena froze in shock, demanding,"When? What on earth happened between you two?"



Miranda straightened, shrugging with feigned nonchalance. "It's a long tale. Years ago, I was drunk and crossed paths with him. Sparks flew,we're both adults-what followed was inevitable."



Verena struggled to reconcile the image of her composed brother with the phrase "one-night stand."  Glancing at Luis in the distance, she shook her head."Miranda, this... this is absurd. My brother has always been the picture of restraint. How could he possibly -"



Miranda's lips curved into a sly smile, her eyes glinting with meaning. "You're mistaken. His calm is only a mask. In private, he's a very different man."


She swirled the wine in her glass, her gaze slipping through the rim as though peering into memory, her eyes darting toward Luis again and again, lost briefly in recollection.


Verena, hesitant, asked, "So... are you actually interested in him?"



Miranda's smile widened into playful boldness. "I'm interested in his looks. And, to be frank, his performance and his appearance left me quite satisfied."



She delivered those words with deliberate ambiguity,her eyes glimmering with mischief, as if enjoying Verena's discomfort.


Verena found herself speechless, caught off guard by her friend's candor.



After a pause, she sipped her juice and asked, "So...are you hooked on himn?" Miranda tilted her chin thoughtfully, a dreamy half-smile on her lips. "Hooked on? Hard to say. But the aftereffects? Oh, they linger."



Seeing her friend's frivolous air, Verena sighed."Miranda, could you be serious for once? You leave me at a loss for words."



Still grinning, Miranda nudged her shoulder playfully."Luck is on my side now. He's your brother, after all.With this connection, how could I not succeed?Verena,why not lend me a hand?"



Pressed by Miranda's persistence, Verena finally relented. "Alright,alright. I'll bring him over. After that,it's up to you."



Miranda's eyes sparkled with triumph as she patted her chest in assurance. "Rest easy. Everything is under control."



Verena sighed softly, scanning the hall for Luis.



By now, the guests had filled the room, the party humming with lively chatter.



Luis stood not far away, conversing with several business magnates.



His tall stature and dignified bearing made him stand out like a lighthouse amid the crowd. Spotting him, Verena wove her way over.


After waiting for her moment, she, gently tapped his arm and whispered, "Luis, may I speak with you for a moment? There's something I need to say."



Luis turned, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.



He excused himself politely, saying, "Gentlemen,if you'll allow me,I must attend to my sister."


He and Verena stepped into a quieter corner."Verena,what is it? Has something happened?"



She bit her lip, hesitating, and then decided to stick to Miranda's plan. "Luis, Miranda... she wvants to speak with you."


His expression stilled for a beat. As though sensing the weight of someone's gaze,he lifted his eyes.


There sat Miranda, chin resting on one hand, her wine glass raised in salute, her smile radiant.


Luis looked away, his face smooth and unreadable."Miss Brown? And what matter does she wish to discuss?"



Verena cleared her throat, stumbling slightly. "She mentioned... she mentioned a possible business collaboration she'd like to explore with you." A spark of skepticism flitted through Luis' eyes,making Verena uneasy under his gaze.


Just when she thought he might see through her,Luis shifted his eyes aside and gave a small nod. "If it concerns business, I'll listen."


Verena exhaled quietly in relief, pointing toward Miranda. "She's waiting over there. Go on, Luis.I won't intrude on your conversation."
###Chapter 305 Are You Trying To Play Matchmaker
The party venue shimmered beneath dazzling lights,alive with a chorus of laughter and chatter.



Luis strode toward Miranda with easy confidence,hands tucked in his pockets, carrying himself with the calm of a man who owned the moment.



Verena's gaze followed him, noting the glint of playful defiance in his manner as he exchanged a few words-likely probing Miranda about her intentions.



Miranda did not answer at once; instead, she studied him with a smile that was subtle yet layered with meaning.



Luis knitted his brows faintly, and Miranda leaned in,whispering something against his ear-a gesture both intimate and enigmatic.


Surprise flickered across Luis' features; his deep-set eyes locked on hers.


For an instant, it felt as though time itself had drawn to a halt.



Luis' expression hardened with indifference, while Miranda's lips arched in a smile of assured triumph.


Just as Verena braced for him to turn away, Luis startled her by moving first, striding toward the back garden.



Miranda cast Verena a glance,lifted her brow in silent victory, and followed after him with practiced grace.



Though Molly had slipped into the party venue earlier,her eyes clung to Luis as if drawn by invisible threads.



When Miranda appeared and traded glances with him,Molly-who had long nursed hidden feelings-felt her heart twist tight.


Her instincts pricked like thorns, sensing something unusual in the air.


Then she noticed Verena chatting cordially with Miranda, even taking pains to draw Luis closer to Miranda.


A sense of threat, sharp and unfamiliar, gripped Molly's chest.


Watching the two leave together, she smothered her rising jealousy with a sip of wine and approached Verena, a smile carefully stitched onto her face.



"Verenna, I saw a striking lady with you earlier. Is she a friend of yours?" Molly asked, tone light as if nothing  weighed on her.



Verena had little fondness for Molly's brand of familiarity,yet courtesy-and gratitude for Sherwood's kindness-kept her lips curved faintly as she answered,"Yes. She's my best friend."



Molly wet her lips with another sip,jealousy flashing in her eyes though her voice remained curious. "Well,she certainly seems distinguished. And it looks like she knows Luis too. Hlave they met before?"



Verena's brows creased,irritation simmering at Molly's persistence.


After a brief pause, she replied evenly, "They've crossed paths at some evens, but I don't know the details."



A sly smile crept to Molly's mouth as she pressed further. "Verena,you're truly helpful-setting them up like that. Are you trying to play matchmaker?"


At that, Verena's gaze sharpened.


She nearly admitted as much, yet concern for Miranda's reputation silenced her. Meeting Molly's eyes squarely, she said with calm conviction, "Miss Kirk,you're overthinking. It's nothing more than ordinary interaction between friends."



Molly sneered inwardly, though her outward smile shone as bright as ever. "Perhaps you're right. I might be imagining things. Luis is extraordinary, after all,and such men draw admirers like moths to a flame."



She paused, feigning nonchalance before adding,"Besides, Luis and I grew up together, and our families have always spoken of a union. I'm not saying it's improper to play matchmaker; I just worry that you've been away so long you may miss the undercurrents-and unknowingly fall into another's schemes,disrupting relationships."



Her words carried barbed hostility aimed squarely at Miranda.



Verena,keen to the venom hidden in honeyed tones,remained unmoved.



Her eyes locked on Molly's, sharp as an eagle's. "Is that so? Yet my brother has said clearly he has no intention of marrying you. I assume he's told you as much himself. If you're neither engaged nor in a courtship,how couldldisruptbondsthatneverexisted?"


For a heartbeat, Molly's face faltered, but she quickly masked it. "So, Verena, do you truly believe your friend would suit Luis?"



A dull ache throbbed at Verena's temples; she longed to change the subject.



Just then, her eyes caught lsaac in his wheelchair  nearby,waiting patiently.


Warmth flooded her chest, and with a faint shrug,she told Molly, "Who can ever predict the heart's course?Forgive me, I must attend to something else."


Without waiting for reply, she made her way toward Isaac.



Molly watched her retreat, dissatisfaction flickering in her eyes.


"Ungrateful. Insensible," she muttered,slamming her glass onto a tray, spilling droplets of wine.


Verena was right: Luis had told Molly plainly in private that he regarded her only as a younger sister, never as a bride.


But what of it?



Such a matter could not be decided by the Sampson siblings alone.



Lowering her gaze,Molly thought of her father-how he had lent the Sampson family tireless support in business, how he had guided Luis patiently during the family's darkest days after their daughter went missing.



Without her father's hand, the Sampsons would hardly stand as tall as they did now. With such loyalty repaid, what right did the Sampsons have to deny a marriage alliance?



In Molly's mind, her union with Luis was not a question of if but when.



The more she thought about it, the more certain she became of her place, and her jealousy toward Verena's friend waned.


Meanwhile, Verena reached Isaac, took his hand,and teased lightly, "Forgive me. I've been so busy l've neglected you."



Isaac shook his head, his calloused fingertips brushing her palm. "That was Sherwood's daughter, wasn't it?What did she want with you?"


Verena frowned,recalling Molly's words, annoyance weighing on her.


With a sigh, she admitted, "It was about my brother.She said her family and my family had long arranged a union, and warned me not to set Miranda up with Luis,lest I ruin their plans."



Isaac's brows drew together, his eyes narrowing with a trace of scorn. "How presumptuous. If Luis has no will for it, no power on earth can force him."
###Chapter 306 Be With Me One More Time
As the party drew near, most of the guests had already gathered within the brightly lit hall.


By contrast, the back garden lay in quiet repose, like a hidden sanctuary set apart from the noise.


Only now and then did a passerby wander along the winding stone paths.



The sun had long dipped beyond the horizon, and the last traces of daylight slowly surrendered to dusk.


When night finally fell, the moon began its slow unveiling,scattering mottled light through the swaying branches.



Luis walked in front,tall and composed, his figure etched sharply in the moonlight. His shadow stretched long upon the ground, as though blending into the fabric of the night.


Behind him, Miranda followed with measured steps,her high heels clicking softly against the stone path,the crisp sound distinct in the hush of the evening.


 
For a time, neither spoke. The night breeze teased Miranda's hair as she kept her eyes on Luis' broad back,her expression at ease, giving no sign that she would be the first to break the silence.



Though he walked ahead, Luis seemed to sense her gaze.



Every so often, he cast a glance over his shoulder,his eyes brushing past her elegant silhouette before he lowered his lashes, his profile set in stern coldness beneath the moon's glow.



After a silence that felt without measure, Luis finally lifted his wrist to check the time.



Three minutes had slipped by.



He looked back again. The woman behind him still strolled at leisure, unhurried and unbothered, making no move to speak.



Luis stopped at last, turned, and fixed his gaze upon her.


"Miss Brown," he said, his voice breaking the standstill -low yet ringing clear. "My sister told me you wished to speak with me about a business matter. Since neither of us has time for idle talk, say what you mean plainly." Miranda lifted her eyes to his, her expression unreadable. His gaze was dark and fathomless, reminding her of still waters, cold and detached.


Her lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "Mr.Sampson,you sound impatient. But business is only a veil."



Luis' brows knitted slightly, though her words did not catch him entirely off guard.



His face remained calm, the corners of his lips curving with the slightest hint of irony. "Is that so? Then what's your real intention, Miss Brown?"


She stepped closer, narrowing the distance between them.



Her eyes gleamed as she tilted her head, one brow lifting. "It's been years since we last met, Mr. Sampson.Can't we catch up? Or have you conveniently forgotten that night?"



Her slender fingers brushed across his chest, the gesture deliberately playful.


Luis neither flinched nor drew back. His gaze lowered to hers. "Miss Brown, that night was nothing more than mutual consent,no strings attached.I had thought you weren't one to linger on what's past."  her breath sweet as spring blossoms. "And yet, Mr.Sampson,can a man truly erase such a night of fire? I,for one, cannot forget your fervent kisses, and that-"


Luis cut across her words, his brows taut. "If tonight is nothing but a rehearsal of old tales, then I fear you will leave disappointed."


Though his tone was steady, a fleeting shadow stirred in his eyes.



Miranda pretended not to hear, tracing idle circles across his chest with her fingertip, her voice playful."Tell me, aren't you the least bit curious if I thought of you these years?"


Drawing a measured breath, Luis caught her wrist,stilling her hand. "Miss Brown, we're both adults. That night was indulgence, nothing more. No force, no promises-and it should bear no weight on the present."



Miranda slipped free from his grasp, placing her hands behind her back as she strolled lazily around him,her eyes boldly sweeping over his figure.



"Why do you have to be so serious? I never said I wished to cling. We both enjoyed ourselves. I simply admired your... performance, Mr. Sampson. No need to look at me as if I were a storm cloud."



Luis' eyes followed her, a dry scoff escaping. "Miss  Brown, turning the bedroom into a stage for talk is quite the novelty. If that's all, then I'll take my leave."


He made to step away, but Miranda blocked his path,her head tilted, her eyes alight with teasing. "Mr.Sampson, why so eager to run? Afraid a passerby might overhear-or is it your own heart that falters?"



His Adam's apple shifted, his lips twitching as though words pressed tó escape.



Miranda suddenly caught something, her interest piqued.



She lifted a hand, tracing beneath his eye with her fingertip, her voice soft as silk. "I recall that night being rather reckless. I didn't expect I'd leave a small scar here."



Just below his left eye, a faint mark lay hidden like an ornament-subtle,yet lending a roguish edge to his otherwise composed face.



Miranda's tone carried both jest and memory, her words a riddle of intent. "Let me think... I'd had a drink or two, and the air was heated. Was it my nail that scratched you, or was your strength to blame, and I simply lost myself?"



Her fingers lingered at the scar, gently stroking as though retracing old heat. Bathed in the blurred glow of moonlight, she leaned closer, their bodies nearly touching.



Her warm breath fanned his neck, and Luis stiffened,his gaze wavering.



He stepped back sharply, turning aside to evade her touch. "Miss Brown,watch your behavior."



But she, unfazed, only smiled with sultry delght.Twining his necktie around her finger,she whispered,"Why keep such distance, Mr. Sampson? We were once close enough to breathe the same air. Tonight,we're merely reminiscing. Loosen up."



Luis stood rooted, his eyes dark and unreadable."If you insist on dragging that night back into the light,Miss Brown, then we are finished talking."


Her lips tilted in sly amusement, her gaze brazenly sweeping him. "Very well. If you dislike reminiscing,then grant me one request."



Luis' brow creased, knowing instinctively her words carried noinnocence,yet he waited in silence.



She tilted her head, eyes half-lidded, lips forming each word slowly, deliberately. "Be with me one more time."



For a moment, Luis froze. The muscle beneath his  scar twitched.


Then his brows drew tight, and he hissed a single word."Absurd!"



He turned on his heel, his stride swift, as though fleeing a shadow that chased him. Within moments,his tall figure melted into the depths of the night.


Miranda folded her arms, watching him vanish,a smile of hidden meaning tugging at her lips.


He had seemed... unsettled.



And as for her-she was still intoxicated by the memory of his body.



She tilted her head to the moonlit sky, lost in silent thought.


Their story, she felt, was far from its final chapter.
###Chapter 307 Achievements



In the main hall, though the party had yet to officially commence,the hall already thrummed with a low hum of conversation and the gentle shuffle of footsteps,like waves lapping at a quiet shore.


Verena, weary from the twin companions of pregnancy-fatigue and hunger-rested comfortably on a sofa in the lounge.



At her side sat Isaac, holding a bowl of freshly prepared cereal he had just ordered from the kitchen.



Clad in a perfectly tailored black suit that accentuated his tall, graceful frame, he carried himself with quiet dignity; the silvertie clip at his collar caught the light with a discreet gleam.



With steady hands, Isaac lifted a spoonful of cereal,blew on it gently, and offered it to Verena, his eyes filled with tenderness. "Here, try this. The temperature should be just right."



Verena's lips curved into a soft, sweet smile as she opened her mouth obediently, tasting the food. "Hmm,it tastes wonderful," she murmured.



His gaze lingered on her, deep and steady, as if a tranquil lake had mirrored his thoughts.



He raised another spoonful to her lips. "If you like it,have some more. It'll give you the strength you'll need for your speech later."



Verena nodded lightly, savoring each bite with deliberate calm.



After swallowing, she looked up, her smile radiant."Don't worry, love. The baby hasn't made any fuss today. I'm feeling just fine."


Hearing this, Isaac's lips curved in quiet relief. He unfolded a paper napkin and carefully dabbed the corner of her mouth. "That's good.Seems our little one already knows how to care for their mother. Still,you were on your feet quite a while greeting the guests. Once we're home tonight, I'll massage your feet."



Verena responded with another warm smile, her eyes glistening with contentment.



The return of the Sampson family's daughter had already stirred quiet waves of attention. Since Verena's entrance, many eyes had discreetly followed her.



Now, seeing this tender exchange, the onlookers ' curiosity deepened, their glances growing more frequent. Not far away, a young woman in a sleek black gown whispered to her companion, envy lacing her tone,"Who would have thought the Sampson family's daughter would marry such a remarkable man? Even though he's disabled, he's striking,broad-shouldered,and-above all-devoted. Look how he gazes at her;it's as though they've stepped out of a romance film."



Her companion followed her gaze, catching Isaac's affectionate eyes fixed on Verena, as though the entire world had shrunk to just the two of them.



The companion nodded thoughtfully. "Indeed. Yet somehow,I feel I've seen her husband somewhere before."



She frowned, lost in thought.



Meanwhile, across the room, a woman adorned with a glittering diamond necklace widened her eyes,her voice rising in astonishment. "Isn't that Isaac Bennett,the heir of Shoildon's most powerful family?"


Her words rang clear, drawing countless heads in their direction.



At her side, a bearded middle-aged man let out a teasing chuckle. "You've only just realized? Isaac Bennett usually keeps a low profile, but tonight he steps into the light-just to accompany his wife.Seems the rumors about him being a 'devoted  husband' hold water after all."



No sooner had he spoken than a ripple of exclamations swept through the hall, and discussions erupted.



"So he's the young CEO of Bennett Group, the one who carved his name in the business world at such a young age-even that terrible car accident never dimmed his brilliance."



A middle-aged gentleman in a sharp suit shook his head slowly, admiration shining in his eyes.


"I never imagined the Sampson family's long-lost daughter would be his wife."



"True," a short-haired woman chimed in. "Word has it that under his leadership, Bennett Group leapt into overseas markets within mere years, expanding its influence far and wide. It's no stretch to call him a rising star."



Just then, an elderly man leaning on a cane, his hair silvered by time, spoke in a measured drawl."The achievements of this couple leave us all in their shadow."



His words drew every gaze toward him.



Dressed in a finely cut suit with ornate buttons glinting at his collar, he radiated authority and quiet respect. He was Emiliano Ramsey, a towering figure in the Ochrerayd business circle.



A young man in a gray suit could not resist asking, "Mr.Ramsey,what makes you say that?"



Emiliano's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Take Isaac, for example. He was not yet twenty when he stormed into the business world, daring to confront seasoned giants. Back then, the financial arena was turbulent; established powers closed ranks to choke out fresh blood. Yet Isaac did not shrink back-like a calf unafraid of the tiger, he leapt straight in. Through bold and innovative moves, he carved out Bennett Group's place in finance and triggered reforms that reshaped the industryitself. Legend after legend was born of his defiance. Tell me,how many can match that courage and wisdom?"



A murmur of agreement swept through the crowd.



Emiliano paused, his eyes sweeping the guests with meaning, before adding, "And Verena-she is no ornament clinging to her husband's success. Perhaps you haven't recognized her yet. She is Evelyn Rowe,the internationally renowned medical expert."



At those words, silence blanketed the hall, broken only by startled gasps.



All eyes turned toward Verena,filled with disbelief. "I knew she looked familiar, but I couldn't place her.So she really is Evelyn!"



A young woman clapped her hand over her mouth in astonishment. "Heavens! I've heard of Evelyn's genius -curing impossible illnesses, developing anti-cancer drugs. Who could imagine she's the Sampson family's lost daughter?"



A man in gold-rimmed glasses adjusted them, his tone brimming with respect. "Indeed. At last year's International Medical Forum,Evelyn presented her groundbreaking work on precision medicine-causing a global sensation, giving hope to countless patients.To think this legendary figure now stands before us."



Among the guests, a female doctor trembled wvith excitement, her voice unsteady. "She's been my idol for years. I've studied her papers over and over,learning so much. What an honor to see her in person tonight!"


All the while, Sherwood had been quietly observing.


But when Emiliano unveiled Verena's identity as Evelyn,he faltered.



The crystal wine glass in his hand froze mid-air; the red liquid rippled gently, betraying the shock etched across his face.
###Chapter 308 Watch This Space
Sherwood's gaze, almost against his will, drifted toward Verena seated in the lounge.



Never in his wildest dreams had he thought she was Evelyn.



His eyelid twitched, betraying the storm beneath the calm surface, and a glimmer of shock mingled with fleeting excitement flashed across his eyes.



Five minutes before the party officially began, Luis stepped back into the main hall.


Verena had just finished her cereal when she caught sight of him from the corner of her eye.


She rose gracefully and called out, "Luis, you're back."


Without slowing his pace, Luis cast her a quick sidelong glance and gave a slight nod. His words came briskly. "The party is about to begin. We should get prepared."



With that, he strode past her.



Verena inclined her head, and then turned to lsaac and said, "I'll go with Luis now."



She followed after her brother.



As she moved, a faint, elusive fragrance slipped into her nose.



She inhaled lightly, and her pupils tightened with sudden recognition.



It was Miranda's perfume.


Despite Miranda's fiery temper, she always favored a fragrance that sang a different tune: elegant,subdued,a delicate blend of jasmine and woody notes echoing timeless grace.



Verena knew Miranda's quirks well; the woman never used more than a drop.



Unless Luis and Miranda had been in close quarters,the scent would never linger on him.



A ripple of curiosity stirred in Verena's heart.



Her brother and Miranda...



What had just passed between them?



Knowing Miranda's bold spirit, Verena wondered if she had taken the first daring step toward Luis.


Her thoughts were cut short by the deep, resonant voice of the emcee, rolling across the hall."Distinguished guests, welcome to the Sampson family's party celebrating the return of their beloved daughter. Please, join me in welcoming Mr. Luis Sampson and his sister to the stage..."



Luis turned at once,extending his hand toward Verena.She gathered her thoughts, placed her hand upon his arm,and together they advanced.


All eyes followed them-gazes heavy with admiration,curiosity, and judgment.


Verena lifted her chin slightly, straightened her back,and let a gentle smile play on her lips. Confidence wrapped around her like a cloak.



In the back rows, cameras clicked relentlessly. The instant Verena and Luis stepped into the spotlight, the room lit up with flashes.



The front row was dominated by business giants,sharp suits framing faces of gravity and calculation.


Luis strode to the center of thestage,posture firm as a pillar.


He adjusted the microphone, calm-faced, his stern brows softened with a touch of humility. Then, his deep,magnetic voice carried through the hall. "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for honoring us with your presence.I am Luis Sampson,CEO of Sampson Group. Because of my parents' poor health, they could not be here today and asked me to host this event on their behalf."



The hall quieted instantly, the audience hanging on his words.



Luis paused, and then turned slightly toward Verena.



His eyes softened, filled with the tenderness of an elder brother reunited with his sister.


Verena met his gaze with a smile of her own.


Facing forward once more, Luis' voice rose as he declared, "As many of you already know, this young lady, Verena, is the daughter of our Sampson family -lost to us for more than twenty years. Her safe return brings us boundless joy, and tonight we proudly introduce her to you all."


Applause thundered through the hall.


Guests whispered among themselves,	some astonished to learn that she was Evelyn.



When Luis gestured to the microphone, Verena stepped forward, her smile poised, her nod courteous.


Under the spotlight, her face shone with quiet refinement, features sculpted with clarity, her eyes luminous. She parted her lips and spoke, her calm, steady tone ringing through the hall. "Ladies and gentlemen, I am Verena. Please don't call me Miss Sampson; I'm accustomed to my name as it is. Call me Verena."


She paused, her posture straight, her presence collected. Her voice carried like a bell as she continued, "It is a privilege to stand here. Returning to the Sampson family marks a new beginning for me.From this day forward, I will join hands with my family in building its future. So I say to you all-watch this space."



Her gaze locked on the cameras, narrowing slightly,sharp as an eagle's strike, as though she could pierce the cold lens and face the unseen figure behind it.


In her mind, images rose in painful succession-her father's weary figure, her mother's shattered mind,her brother forced to carry the family's burdens, her own years of mistreatment under the Willis couple,and above all, the shadowy culprit who had taken her years ago and wrecked her family. That unseen hand had toppled their joy overnight and dragged them into ruin step by step. A frost gathered in Verena's eyes.



She vowed silently-never again would they escape justice. Her final words, meant for the camera, were more than a promise; they were a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the hidden foe.



Applause rippled again, followed by murmurs spreading through the hall.


"Such a young woman, yet so composed," a middle-aged man marveled. "To speak with such ambition before a sea of elites-her future shines bright."



"Humph!" an older man scoffed, his tone sharp with disdain. "A girl so green imagines business is child's play? The marketplace is a battlefield; words alone won't win the war."



The person beside him gave a small nod, tacitly agreeing.


Opinions diverged: some expectant, some doubtful,others indifferent.



Meanwhile,Sherwood sat quietly amid the throng,his eyes fastened on Verena.


When he heard her say,"watch this space", his gaze narrowed, and a faint smile touched his lips.



As the voices in the hall swelled, Luis lifted his wrist with leisurely grace. The movement seemed casual, yet it bore the unspoken weight of command.



At once, the room hushed.


Sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Luis cleared his throat and spoke again, his voice carrying authority."Though I mentioned this at the press conference,allow me to declare it formally here before the media and our esteemed guests. Alongside our new tech ventures and premium real estate developments, I wvill entrust	the	Sampson	Group's	Benedict Pharmaceuticals entirely to my sister's leadership."
###Chapter 309 How Could She Be Incompetent
The moment the announcement was made, the hall froze as though time itself had stumbled. Shock rippled through the crowd,leaving everyone silent and wide-eyed,unable to digest what they had just heard.



The air grew heavy, disbelief written across every face,as if trust had suddenly become too costly to afford.


Molly, just stepping out of the restroom, caught Luis 'voice as his words fell like a hammer.



Her stride faltered, feet rooted to the floor.She lifted her gaze toward the stage, her expression clouded with incredulity.



What?



Luis was placing the reins of Benedict Pharmaceuticals into Verena's hands?



Her eyes clung to Verena, blazing with a mix of shock and bitterness.



Molly had poured years of sweat into managing Benedict Pharmaceuticals, brick by brick, like building a fortress in stormy weather. And now, Verena appeared out of nowhere, only to have the whole fortress delivered to her.



And Molly herself?



Was she expected to bow before Verena, as though the years of her labor were mere shadows?


The thought gnawed at her, feeding a deep well of resentment.



She knew well that Benedict Pharmaceuticals was the Sampson family's property, but without her father's devotion, it would have been a withered tree long ago.



Could Verena even fathom the labyrinth of management? A pharmaceutical company was no corner store.



How could a young woman, freshly acknowledged by the Sampson family and untested in business, hope to steer such a mighty ship?



Dissatisfaction, envy, and anger twisted together in Molly's chest.



She glared from below the stage, teeth clenched tight, and then stalked toward the guest seating area.


After a moment, faint gasps fractured the silence,and the audience slowly regained its voice. Soon the hall stirred like waves in a restless sea.



"Can Verena truly manage such a company right after joining the Sampson family?" someone muttered,brows furrowed with doubt.



"Indeed! Benedict Pharmaceuticals is the lifeblood of Sampson Group. Though young, its future is bright,"an elegantly dressed woman agreed,her tone sharp with skepticism. "To entrust it so hastily to a novice -what on earth is Luis thinking?"



A bespectacled man stroked his chin,eyes narrowed in thought. "There must be a hidden reason. Surely,he doesn't genuinely believe she's capable... does he?"


"How could she be incompetent?" A firm voice cut through the murmur like a bell ringing clear.


Heads turned toward a stout middle-aged man who had just spoken. "Have you forgotten who Verena truly is? She is Evelyn, famed for her unmatched medical skill."



He paused, sweeping the crowd with a knowing smile."When it comes to medicine, or leading a pharmaceutical venture, who among you holds more weight than she? And beyond that, remember her husband. Isaac commands Shoildon's business world with an iron grip. His judgment could outwit a hundred men." The man's lips curled, as though mocking the narrowness of the crowd."With these two truths alone,how could you still call her unfit?"



His words struck like sparks, stirring commotion anew.


Someone nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, there's an old saying in business: 'Ochrerayd's Sampson, Shoildon's Bennett.' Both families stand as pillars. Under Isaac's lead, the Bennett family has flourished,his foresight razor-sharp."



A middle-aged woman added, "If the Bennett family has embraced Verena, it must be for more than her skill in healing."


Another guest sighed, "Perhaps Luis' choice to entrust her with Benedict Pharmaceuticals is a masterstroke."



Hearing the growing chatter, Molly froze mid-motion,her wine glass suspended just shy of her lips.



"What?" The word escaped her, loud and raw, carrying her astonishment tothe room.



She scanned the hall, heart thudding.


Her eyes landed on lsaac, seated quietly in his wheelchair.



His gaze never wavered from the stage, fixed solely  on Verena, as if the rest of the world had ceased to matter.



Even strangers could read the tenderness etched in his expression.



Molly's mind buzzed. Her breath caught as she looked back at Verena.



Never had she imagined that Verena's husband was none other than Isaac Bennett-the formidable leader of Bennett Group, the man whispered about in boardrooms as both savior and storm.



She had never seen his methods firsthand, yet his reputation alone was legend.


And legends, she knew, were not to be tested.



Drawing in a long breath, Molly fought to steady her thoughts, her resentment bending under the weight of reason.


Antagonism,she realized,would be foolish.



Better an ally than an enemy.



Her gaze drifted again to Isaac.



The guests, now enlightened to lsaac's identity,approached him with eager smiles, each angling for favor. But Isaac remained cool, nodding politely at best, his eyes unfailingly returning to Verena.



Molly saw it clearly-his devotion,his fierce protection.



And she knew, should she openly cross Verena, the price would be more than her position. With Isaac's fiercely protective heart and his reputation for ruthless precision, Molly might find herself unable to plant even a single firm step in the business world, no matter how strong her father's backing.


If that were all, it would be a small mercy.Worse still -her very life might hang in the balance.


Realizing this bitter truth, Molly forced a smile that tasted of defeat.



She lifted her wine glass slowly, taking a measured sip to mask her unease, while her mind whirled,calculating the best way to weave a bridge toward Verena instead of burning one.



On stage, Verena and Luis stood side by side,bringing their closing words to a graceful end. Verena inclined her head, her gratitude flowing toward the assembled guests.



Luis,steady and composed,lifted his hand in a guiding gesture, escorting Verena as they descended the steps together. The audience's eyes trailed after them, whispers rising and falling like the rustle of leaves in a restless breeze.



As Verena stepped off the stage, she caught sight of Isaac steering his wheelchair toward her.


In his broad hand, he carried a glass of water, his long fingers finely cut, glimmering faintly beneath the lights.



He stopped before her, tilting his head in quiet affection, and extended the glass. His voice,low and steady, reached her gently. "Here.Have some water."



Verena's smile deepened,lighting her face like dawn."Thank you,honey."


She accepted the glass with both hands, feeling its warmth seep into her palms, anchoring her.


Lowering her gaze,she sipped lightly, the water easing the dryness in her throat.


Luis, watching the exchange, let his eyes rest on Isaac and arched a brow ever so slightly.


In that small gesture, it was clear he had seen enough -his brother-in-law was not only capable, but devoted to Verena with genuine care.
###Chapter 310 Would You Be Willing To Treat My Illness
 As Sherwood watched Verena step down from the stage,his eyes lit up with delight. Straightening his suit,he wore a gentle, welcoming smile and hurried forward.



Luis caught sight of him and offered a polite greeting."Mr.Kirk."



Sherwood gave a light nod in return, though his gaze remained fixed on Verena.



The past year, he had been convalescing in his hometown,far removed from the noise of the outside world. News had scarcely reached him.



Thus, he never imagined that Verena was none other than Evelyn-the miracle healer spoken of with awe.


Approaching Verena, his expression held the warmth of an elder admiring the younger generation,his face glowing with approval. "I heard your speech on stage,Verena. For someone so young, you carry such resolve. You've truly brought honor to the Sampson family-an eye-opener indeed."


He then turned to Luis with a smile. "Luis, your sister is  remarkable. She shines in medicine, and with her talent, she will also carve her place in business soon.For her,the sky is the limit."



To seal his praise, Sherwood raised a thumbs-up,admiration shining through with a touch of imperceptible flattery.


Luis gave a faint nod, quietly agreeing.


His eyes softened as they rested on Verena, carying both affection and care.



"Indeed,Verena is outstanding," Luis said. "But she has endured more than her share of hardship. Now that she is finally home, all I wish for is her peace. Nothing else matters."



Verena caught the concern in his gaze, and warmth surged in her heart.


She gently pressed his arm, wordlessly assuring him that she was fine, and that he didn't need to worry.



Turning back to Sherwood, however, she felt an unease. His gaze seemed to hold more than the kindly affection of an elder.



Something else flickered beneath, though she could not name it.



Pushing the thought aside, Verena managed a modest  smile, her manner poised between courtesy and restraint. "You are too generous. I haven't even touched the world of business yet-that's for the future. Medicine, though, has always been my calling and my strongest ground."


At this, Sherwood leaned in slightly,his tone earnest."Verena, I must speak plainly."


He let out a weary breath, his features etched with fatigue. "I've been back in my hometown for over a year because I was diagnosed with cancer."


Luis' brows drew together at the revelation. Until now,he had only known Sherwood was unwell, not that it was cancer.



Sherwood pressed on, his sigh heavy. "It's a reversible form, but extremely difficult. I have sought out famed doctors to no avail. Only Evelyn-the miracle healer -could save me."



He glanced at Verena, lowering his gaze briefly before continuing, "For a year, I pulled every string I could,searching high and low for Evelyn, but without success."



Then his eyes lifted again, bright with sudden hope."Only today have I discovered that you are the very Evelyn I sought."



Placing a hand on her shoulder, he spoke with quiet  urgency. "Verena, would you be willing to treat my illness?"



Though his demeanor still struck her as slightly odd,the compassion of a healer outweighed her unease.


Besides, Luis had told her more than once that,during her years of absence, Sherwood had extended great help to the Sampson family, carrying them through difficult storms.



That kindness was not something she could forget.



After a brief pause of reflection, Verena smiled warmly and gave a solemn nod. "Mr. Kirk,healing the sick is my duty. Once you return home, send me your medical records. I'll study them carefully and devise a treatment plan that suits you best."



At her words,relief washed over Sherwood.He gently patted her shoulder, gratitude written all over his face.


"Thank you, Verena," he said earnestly. "You're nothing less than my lifesaver."



His gaze then shifted to Isaac, wo until now had kept silent.



As the CEO of Bennett Group, Isaac's influence in Shoildon's business circles was formidable. To have him as an ally was no small advantage. Yet the Kirk family, too, carried weight. Sherwood knew he had to tread carefully-showing neither servility nor arrogance-while seizing the chance to strengthen ties.



With practiced poise, he smiled warmly. "Mr. Bennett,it is an honor to finally meet you. I've long admired your accomplishments in business. Even an old man like me cannot help but be impressed."


His eyes narrowed slightly, brimming with approval."Truly, the younger generation outshines the older."



He then patted Isaac's shoulder with deliberate ease,striking a tone of dignity mixed with cordiality.



Isaac, though never one to chase unnecessary bonds,recognized the goodwill Sherwood had shown to the Sampson family, and the fact that Verena was part of it.



For that reason alone, he returned the courtesy with a polite smile. "Mr. Kirk, thank you for the kind words.You're close to Verena's family. Please, just call me Isaac."



His voice carried neither warmth nor distance-measured, respectful, yet keeping a boundary clear.



But Sherwood, sharp as ever, had already noticed how often Isaac mentioned Verena. From that alone, he  discerned where Isaac's heart lay.



To win Isaac over, going through Verena was the best way. At the thought, his smile broádened as his gaze softened upon her. "Verena, it is a joy to see you safely returned, and with such a devoted husband.Iam truly glad for you."



He paused, his tone tinged with apology. "I've been away for treatment so long that I've neglected to visit your parents."



As he spoke, his expression shifted, struck by a sudden thought. His eyes flicked between Luis and Verena.


Brightening with enthusiasm, he proposed, "Why don't we take this chance, now that both families are here,to share a lively meal together?"



Luis considered briefly before nodding. "You are right.It has been far too long since our home felt this lively.My parents will be overjoyed."


And so, the plan for a family dinner was set.



As the party drew to a close and the guests began to drift away, three SUVs soon pulled up outside.



Their headlights cut through the night as they departed together, bound for Sampson Villa.
###Chapter 311 Returning Home
At Sampson Villa, after receiving the news, Joseph and Marisa stood waiting at the villa entrance, their eagerness written across their faces.



Joseph,ever thoughtful, supported his wife's arm,his eyes shifting between the gate and her pale features,gently adjusting her coat now and then to shield her from the evening chill.


Marisa's gaze never left the entrance. Her expression,worn thin by years of illness, seemed a little vacant,yet her eyes sparkled with a fierce light-an odd marriage of surprise and longing.



Her fingers tightened together as she murmured over and over, "My little girl... I'm waiting for my little girl to come home..."



About five minutes later, three cars appeared in the distance, their headlights glimmering as they rolled steadily toward the gate.


The vehicles halted in unison, and one after anoter,the passengers stepped out.



Luis was the first to emerge from the lead car, calling  out a greeting to his parents.



Joseph returned his son's gesture with a small nod of acknowledgment.


From the middle car, Verena and Isaac came into view.


The moment Marisa spotted her daughter, her whole face lit up with a smile that seemed to peel away years of sorrow. She slipped from Joseph's hold,her steps shaky but determined, and cried out,"Sweetheart! My darling daughter is home!"


Her joy was unguarded, almost childlike in its purity.



Isaac offered Joseph a polite nod and said warmly,"Good evening,Joseph."



Joseph's smile carried both welcome and relief. "Here you came,lsaac."



With that brief exchange, his eyes were drawn back to his wife and daughter.



The sight before him stirred a storm of emotions-joy interwoven with pain.



He knew too well that through the years of Verena's absence,countless nights had found Marisa clutching the pillow their daughter once used, grieving silently despite her fragile state of mind. And Joseph himself had spent many hours imagining the face of the grown woman their child would become,hoping against hope that she might one day return to their door.



They had waited for this reunion for more than two decades, holding their breath against disappointment.


And now,the long-desired moment had finally arrived.



The thought brought tears stinging to Joseph's eyes.


As Marisa rushed forward, Verena quickly embraced her. Feeling the cold in her mother's arms, Verena's heart throbbed with ache. "Dad, Mom,it's so windy and chilly. Why are you both standing at the gate?"



Joseph brushed away the tears at the corners of his eyes,his look torn between resignation and affection.



With a sigh, he explained softly, "The moment I told your mother you were coming, she couldn't keep still.She refused to wait inside-she had to be at the gate to welcome you herself."


Hearing that, Marisa gripped Verena's hand tightly,her words stubborn and tender all at once. "Sweetheart,I missed you. I missed you so much..."


Verena knew her mother's mind had unraveled after her disappearance. For years, Marisa had been ground down by the double burden of illness and longing, enduring a torment no one else could measure.



With a gentle touch, Verena tucked a few windblown strands behind her mother's ear. "Mom, I'm here now.I will never leave you again."


Her tone was soft, her gesture even softer.


But Marisa, caught between hope and disbelief, tilted her head and searched Verena's face with wary eyes.


Watching his wife's reaction, Joseph's heart clenched with sorrow and resignation.


Through all the years, Marisa's condition had wavered,but her yearning never weakened-it had only grown roots, deeper and deeper.


Luis stepped closer, resting a comforting hand on his mother's shoulder. "Mom, isn't my sister right here?From now on, we'll see her often."


At last, Marisa's doubts eased, and she nodded slowly.


Sensing the heaviness lingering in the air, Luis lifted his hand, motioning toward Sherwood and Molly, who had stood quietly at the side.


"Dad, Mom," Luis said a little louder, "Mr. Kirk has come especially to see you."


Marisa barely reacted, still clutching Verena's hand as if it were her lifeline, her gaze drifting inward to a world of her own.



Joseph,however,turned from Verena to Sherwood,his expression breaking into one of gratitude and delight. He strode forward quickly.


"Oh, Sherwood, how wonderful to see you again!"Joseph clasped his old friend's hand firmly, his eyes brimming with emotion.



Sherwood's smile was warm. "With everyone gathered for such a joyful day, I couldn't bear to stay away."


At his side, Molly offered a courteous greeting. "Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Sampson."


Her voice rang clear, a touch of shyness beneath its melody.


"Good evening, Molly." Joseph beamed, nodding repeatedly in heartfelt approval.


Then, glancing at Sherwood, he remarked with fondness,"Sherwood,your daughter grows lovelier by the day."



Molly blushed and lowered her head, whispering,"Thank you,Mr.Sampson."Sherwood chuckled gently and patted her shoulder."She's just a little shy. Spending more time with Luis and Verena will do her good."


Then, with a wave of admiration, he continued,"Tonight at the party, both Luis and Verena shone brightly. But Verena especially-her eloquence was striking. In front of so many people, she showed not the slightest fear. Her grasp of business theory was sharp and clear, and she handled the media with effortless poise. Even a man like me,who has seen a fair share of the world, could not help but admire her."



Joseph's chest swelled with pride at Sherwood's praise,his smile widening with satisfaction.



Turning to Verena, his eyes shone with paternal affection. "I always knew my daughter would not disappoint."



Though Marisa didn't fully understand the details,the joy on everyone's faces was enough for her. She broke into a wide smile and murmured again and again,"My daughter is incredible. My daughter is incredible ...”



Verena's features softened into a gentle smile at her mother's words. She inclined her head politely toward Sherwood. "Thank you for your kind words, Mr.Kirk."


She glanced around at the group, her hair swaying  lightly in the breeze, and added with concern,"The wind is biting. Let's head inside."


With that, she wrapped her arm around Marisa, guiding her carefully toward the house.



Luis stepped aside quickly to usher Sherwood in."Please come in,Mr.Kirk."


Sherwood,smiling,walked with Joseph into the house,followed by Isaac, Luis, and Molly.
###Chapter 312 Suspicion



Molly slowed her steps, quietly letting herself drift to the back of the group.


Her eyes clung to Verena up ahead, who was tenderly held between Joseph and Marisa, as though their arms formed a fortress around her. Marisa clutched Verena as if afraid she might vanish like smoke in the wind.



Molly recalled Marisa's affectionate gaze at the entrance earlier, and a storm of mixed feelings stirred within her chest.



The Sampson family had searched for Verena for more than twenty years, and Molly already knew they treasured their daughter beyond measure.


Yet,seeing it with her own eyes, she realized their devotion to Verena ran even deeper than she had ever imagined.



In silence, Molly reflected: Verena's standing in the Sampson family was immovable, as solid as a mountain.



Therefore, if she truly wished to win Luis' heart,she must avoid crossing Verena at all costs. pon hearing the news of the group's visit, Joseph ad quickly instructed the servants to prepare a velcoming dinner.



At the dining table, the dishes were laid out with meticulous care, fragrant steam curling into the air.



Joseph gazed at Verena with tenderness overflowing,his voice gentle as he said, "Verena, try this grilled fish.It's a specialty from your mother's hometown, made with a secret recipe. She personally asked the chef to prepare it."



Marisa,sitting close by, instantly placed a portion on Verena's plate, murmuring, "Sweetheart, taste it.Careful now,it's still hot."



Her eyes never strayed from Verena, brimming with attachment and reliance, as though every breath revolved around her.



Verena looked at the golden, finely shaped fish on her plate, its aroma teasing her senses.



Isaac quietly removed the bones for her, and Verena dipped the tender meat into the sweet-and-sour sauce before bringing it to her lips.



The flavor melted on her tongue-balanced, rich, and gentle-yet her eyes glistened red with tears. Parental love,absent for so long, now lay before her like a jewel finally unearthed.



Since Kaia's birth when Verena was seven, she had only watched from the shadows as Alec and Laura poured affection onto Kaia and Luka.


She had seen Alec prepare gifts with careful thought for Kaia's birthdays, his gaze overflowing with indulgence.



She had seen Laura spend sleepless nights by Luka's bedside when illness struck.



And Verena-she had been nothing more than a bystander.


No matter the envy or longing swelling within her,she had always buried it deep, never daring to let it show.


But tonight, for the first time, she felt how fierce and boundless a parent's love could truly be.


It wrapped around her, filling her heart with both sweetness and ache, a paradox of joy and sorrow mingled together. Overcome, tears welled and blurred her sight.



"Verena, why are you crying?" Joseph's voice carried anxious concern, while Marisa quickly clasped her daughter's hand. Verena brushed her tears away, forcing a fragile smile,er voice thick. "Dad, Mom, I'm fine. The fish is just so delicious... I've never tasted anything as divine as this."


Isaac pulled out a tissue, gently dabbing at her tears,his palm resting softly on her back to steady her.


Hearing her words, Joseph and Marisa finally breathed easier.


Joseph spoke warmly. "Good girl, if you like the fish,eat as much as you wish."



Verena managed a small smile, nodding.


Joseph's gaze shifted to Isaac, who had silently cared for Verena all evening. His appreciation for the young man grew like a flame fanned by the wind.


With a smile, he said, "Isaac, I wonder if these dishes suit your taste. If you have any preferences,let me know. I'll make sure the chef prepares something special for you next time."


Isaac set down his utensils at once, straightening his posture. With a modest bow and a respectful smile,he replied sincerely, "That's most thoughtful of you,Joseph. Tonight's meal has been a true delight, thanks to you and Marisa."



His eyes shone with genuine respect as he looked at Joseph.



From her seat,Verena's heart swelled with warmth.



She slipped her hand over Isaac's, smiling as she told her father, "Dad, Isaac isn't particular. Don't worry.We both love everything you and Mom prepared."



Marisa nodded eagerly, her face glowing with kindness."As long as you enjoy it, I'm content."


With a smile, Luis said to Marisa, "Mom,you must eat more as well. Tonight should be a true celebration-joyful and hearty-with Verena home again."


Seated quietly, Sherwood observed the harmony at the table. A faint smile played on his lips, though for an instant his kindly eyes revealed a sharp,calculating gleam.



It was gone in a heartbeat, replaced by warmth. He lifted his wine glass, rising with a voice full ofemotion."Joseph, Marisa, nothing brings me more joy than seeing your family whole again. All these years you searched high and low, spreading notices, asking anyone who might know. I've witnessed the toll it took-the effort, the cost-and my heart ached for you.But God has shown mercy, and the trial has finally ended."



His tone softened, and then brightened with a smile.
"Family reunion outweighs all else. And to know Verena has married Mr. Bennett, such a fine man-handsome,capable, and talented-truly, the two of them are a match made in heaven. It is the happiest of endings, and I rejoice with you."


Joseph's eyes brimmed with emotion at Sherwood's heartfelt words. He raised his glass in haste."Sherwood, for your support all these years, I thank you. Let's drink to this!"



"Joseph, we've walked side by side for many years,"Sherwood replied with feeling. "I've watched your devotion to your family, and now your dream fulfilled -I couldn't be happier."



Turning to Marisa before Joseph could answer, he added, "Marisa, from this day on, enjoy the blessings before you. With children so devoted, your days will only grow more joyous."



Then, he lifted his glass high. "This toast is for you both! May the Sampson family's future shine ever brighter, and may our friendship endure for generations."


At those words, Verena, Isaac, Luis, and Molly also raised their glasses.


Sherwood tilted back his head, downing his wine in one smooth motion, swift and assured.



As the glass lowered, his expression shifted ever so slightly, a glint flashing in his eyes-fleeting,subtle,and gone before anyone noticed.



Only Isaac, seated directly opposité him, happened to catch that instant.


As he set down his glass, his gaze lifted almost by chance, and in that instant he caught Sherwood's fleeting expression.



Though his heart tightened with suspicion, Isaac remained calm, his face betraying nothing.
###Chapter 313 I've Already Discovered A Treatment
Once dinner drew to an end, the Sampson family and their guests drifted into the living room, easing into the sofas as the atmosphere shifted to casual conversation.



Joseph angled himself slightly toward Sherwood,who sat across from himn. "Sherwood, you've been recuperating in the countryside this past year. How are you holding up now?"


Sherwood answered with his familiar, unhurried smile,dismissing the concern with a light wave. "I'm managing well enough, Joseph. There's no need for worry. But you and Marisa... the toll of searching for Verena shows on you both. You must remember to care for yourselves, too."



A weary sigh escaped Joseph's lips, and he seemed ready to reply when a servant appeared, balancing several small parcels of medicine in her hands.


Seated nearby, Verena slipped a section of orange to Marisa before turning to her father. "Dad, I've prepared some herbal treatments for you."


She reached for the medicine packages the maid
 anded her as she remarked, "These herbs were hosen to match the condition you're dealing with ght now, and they should help bring your body back nto balance. I'll walk the servants through the nstructions more thoroughly later. Dad, you have to remember to take them on schedule. If you stick with it, your health will slowly begin to turn around."



Joseph's gaze lingered on the medicine, and then rose to Verena's face. His eyes glistened, betraying the emotions he struggled to hold back.



His hand closed over hers, trembling slightly. "Verena...after all the years I failed to protect you, after all the ways I fell short, you still think of me. I don't deserve this kindness."



Sherwood's smile deepened as he nodded approvingly."Such devotion is rare. Joseph, you're blessed to have a daughter with a heart as thoughtful as hers."


Molly leaned forward with a bright smile. "Yes, Verena really is remarkable. So caring, so attentive."


Verena returned the praise with a modest smile and a gentle nod. Before she could reply, Luis spoke up, his eyes steady on her. "Verena, have you studied Mom's medical records I sent you? Has there been any progress?"



Joseph's expression tightened, his eyes fixed on Verena with equal parts worry and hope.



Verena's brows drew together, her lips parting as if to respond, but Sherwood cut in with á tone that masked itself as concern. "Luis, you need to be patient.Your mother's condition didn't come about in a day, so it's only natural that the cure won't appear right away either. Even so, Verena is a doctor, and there's no doubt about her skill or training."



Turning to Joseph, he added reassuringly,"Have faith in her, Joseph. In time, she will find the way to heal Marisa."



Though disappointment flickered across Joseph's face,he forced himself to nod. He knew his anxiety made him restless.



Verena inclined her head slightly in acknowledgment before responding, "Mr. Kirk is right. My mother's condition won't be resolved overnight, and pushing for quick results will only make things harder. But..."Her pause carried weight, her lips curving faintly as confidence lit her gaze. "I've already discovered a treatment."



Her words snapped the attention of the room onto her.



Joseph's dim eyes came alive in an instant, trembling hands reaching forward as if to clutch the hope she  offered. "Verena... you mean it? You've really found a cure?"



Luis' face broke into unguarded joy, pride and relief mingling in his features.



Across the table, Molly froze with a cherry between her fingers, her surprise plain. Doubt lingered in her thoughts-wasn'tMarisa'scondition declaredhopeless?Could Verena trúly have such ability?



Meanwhile, Isaac quietly tended to Verena's hands,dabbing them clean with a damp towel after she peeled the fruit.



His lashes cast shadows over his eyes,which remained lowered,calm and composed.



He didn't need to be astonished; to him, Verena's brilliance had never been in question.



In Isaac's eyes, Verena had always been extraordinary,so her confidence came as no surprise.



Across from her, Sherwood's composure faltered.His fingers, resting idly on the arm of the sofa, clenched hard enough to pale at the knuckles.


For a brief instant, his face betrayed him,panic and disbelief flashing through his gaze like a bolt of lightning. Every renowned physician who had once treated Marisa had declared her illness too difficult, too stubborn to heal.



Even with Verena's reputation, he had assumed she would struggle for years before making progress.


Yet she had outstripped every expectation,proving herself far beyond what he had imagined.



A moment later, Sherwood masked the lapse, forcing out a hearty laugh that rang through the room."Remarkable! Verena truly lives up to her title as a miracle healer. To discover a solution so swiftly is nothing short of incredible. Joseph,you can finally breathe easy."



Isaac's lashes lowered as he shifted his gaze, the smallest flicker of cold insight passing throughhis eyes.



Joseph, on the other hand, nearly leapt from his seat with joy. "Verena, when can you begin treating your mother?"



Verena drew herself up, her expression steady,her tone unwavering. "We can start right now."



For a second, Joseph was stunned. Then his entire face lit up, his head nodding over and over."Wonderful! Begin immediately. If it means her  recovery, we won't waste a second."



At once, the others stepped back, creating a quiet circle of space for her.


From the bundle on the table, Verena retrieved another set of herbs she had prepared in advance.



She struck the flame to the herbs, the soft smoke spiraling upward as the faint, earthy scent spread through the room.


She approached Marisa, her voice soft as she said,"Mom, don't be nervous. This will ease your body and bring comfort."



Confusion lingered in Marisa's eyes as she watched,uncertain of the process. But her trust in her daughter kept her still, obediently yielding.


With calm precision, Verena located the exact acupoint. Her hand steady, she hovered the glowing herbs above the crown of Marisa's head.



A gentle heat seeped into Marisa's body, softening the rigid tension etched across her face.


Shifting with care, Verena guided the herbs toward a different acupoint, one meant to calm the spirit and steady the mind.



Her concentration never wavered, gauging the exact  distance of the glowing tip from her mother's skin,making certain the warmth soothed without ever burning.



"Mom,if it feels too hot or uncomfortable, let me know," Verena said softly. Marisa gave a faint nod,her eyes hazy,almost dreamlike.



The room had fallen into a hushed stillness, broken only by the faint crackle of the smoldering herbs.


Every gaze lingered on the pair at the center.


Joseph and Luis stayed focused on Verena and Marisa,their gazes steady as quiet prayers filled their thoughts. They wished with everything in them that the treatment would make a real difference and that Marisa's strength would return before long.


Molly, at first intrigued by the ritual, soon grew restless as the minutes stretched on.



Her attention strayed, settling on Luis, and once there,it refused to move.



Admiration softened her eyes, a quiet affection spilling into her stare.



Luis, however, noticed nothing. His focus was entirely on his mother, his brows tight with worry, his posture firm and protective. The more Molly watched him, the deeper her feelings burrowed,a private longing stirring-one that dreamed of becoming his wife someday.



At the far edge of the group, Isaac sat angled back,his fingers pressed lightly against his lips as though deep in thought.



From beneath lowered lashes, his eyes flickered toward Verena, though his true attention lingered on Sherwood.



Sherwood,who stood apart, had lost his warm smile.His narrowed gaze betrayed a storm of emotions, as though he were barely containing something dark and unsettled within.
###Chapter 314 | Need Your Kiss

After finishing the treatment session, Verena carefully carried out a series of examinations on Marisa.



When the checkup ended, a wave of relief washed over Verena, and a gentle smile appeared.



She walked over to Joseph and whispered,"Dad,with me back to Mom's side, I can see faint signs of improvement. Right after the therapy, her mood steadied, and her once-erratic pulse has begun to find its rhythm again. That's a good omen-the treatment is working."



Joseph, caught between surprise and joy, nodded slowly. "That's wonderful. To see your mother regaining strength-it's a blessing. Verena, treating her illness must weigh heavily on you."



Verena clasped his hand and answered warmly, "Dad,please don't say that. It's my duty, and more than that -it's what I want to do."



Sherwood, wearing a smile that looked both gratified and admiring, stepped forward. "Verena's skills are truly remarkable. Such swift progress! Joseph, with her tending to Marisa, I daresay recovery won't be farff."



et, behind his words, a fleeting shadow stirred in his yes-a shadow unnoticed by Joseph and Luis, who vere both too absorbed in relief to catch it.



Just then, Verena's phone rang. Glancing at the screen,she was surprised to see Miranda's name.



She hesitated briefly, and then looked toward Joseph."Dad, it's a call from a friend. I should take this."


Joseph smiled warmly. "Go on, Verena. A call from a friend is not something one should ignore."



With a nod, she stepped out to the open-air balcony.



The night breeze drifted past, playful as a child,brushing her hair aside.



She swiped the screen and greeted softly, "Hello,Miranda,what's the matter?"



On the other end, Miranda's slightly husky voice asked,"Verena, is Luis with you? If he is, could you pass the phone to him?"


Verena's brow arched with amusement. A mischievous smile tugged at her lips. "Miranda, don't tell me you've gone and fallen head over heels for him?"



The moonlight toyed with her expression, lending her a playful glow. Resting against the railing,she let s punquiet chuckle.


teils lence fell before Miranda replied with mock oyance, "Oh, stop teasing! Just hand him the )enine, or I'll truly be cross with you."

Joseph and Sherwood were chatting idly on the other 。couch; Luis and Isaac were locked in a chess match,their words mingling with strategy; while Molly,phone b in hand, seemed distracted-her eyes kept straying toward Luis,betraying her pretense.



Stepping forward,Verena gently tapped Luis' shoulder,offering him the phone with a smile. "Luis, Miranda wants a word with you."


At once, Molly's feigned calmness shattered-her gaze lifted sharply, her heartbeat quickening as if drums were playing in her chest. She watched Luis  th anxious intensity, hungry for every flicker of his action.

Aolly's eyes followed his retreating figure, her heart tangle of emotions she could neither name nor (117tangle.


ijLuis stood outside, one hand tucked casually in his npocket as the night air brushed his brow.


Hn a level tone, he spoke into the phone. "Miss Brown,what can I do for you?"


Miranda's playful voice drifted through. "Can't I call you without a reason?"


Luis' lips curved faintly. "Usually, people call for a reason."



He thought she would continue bantering,but her voice shifted, carrying a note of gravity laced with frustration. "Luis, I'm sick."



His eyes narrowed; he was ready to respond, but she interrupted with languid mischief. "It's lovesickness-andI need your kiss."


Her words were drawn-out, drenched with teasing triumph.


For an instant, Luis' composure cracked. His gaze lifted toward the endless dark ský, brows arched in surprise.



"You're drunk," he said-not as a question, but asa fact.



Her voice-so·like that fateful night-made it impossible for him to forget.


A soft, tipsy laugh slipped through the receiver."Yes,I'm drunk. But no one came to fetch me. What am I supposed to do,Luis?"



The playful grievance in her voice, tinged with warmth,carried across the line like an ember refusing to die.



Luis' gaze sharpened, his lips pressed into a thin line."Are you still at the party venue?" he asked, already pulling his phone from his pocket, his fingers sliding to his contacts.



"Are you coming to get me?" she murmured,intoxication seeping through her tone.



Then, after a pause, she giggled suddenly. "I'm teasing.The driver's already brought me to the hotel."



Luis froze, his hand lingering mid-air above the screen. Once again, she had toyed with him.



He pocketed his phone with a quiet sigh, eyes narrowing. "Miss Brown, your gift for mischief only sharpens with time."



Her reply was slurred, yet sincere in its resignation."It's the only way that works on you."



A little distance away, Verena leaned against the far railing. The dim moonlight traced Luis' profile,his face unreadable-yet, for the briefest heartbeat, she thought she saw the corner of his lips lift.


It vanished as quickly as it appeared.


Still, Verena was certain she hadn't imagined it.


The thought drew a smile from her as well.


"Verena," a voice called.



She turned. Molly was approaching.



Verena's smile lingered. "Miss Kirk, what brings you here?"



Brushing a stray lock of hair from her face, Molly answered softly, "I noticed you standing alone.I thought I'd join you. The night is beautiful, isn't it?"


She stopped beside Verena, both of them gazing  skyward.


Verena nodded politely. "Yes. The moon is lovely tonight."


A hush fell. Then Molly, unable to keep her thoughts caged, lowered her head and confessed, "Verena,there's something I must apologize for."


Her voice trembled with guilt as she stood, shoulders squared but spirit burdened.



Verena raised her brow, curiosity sparking, and regarded her with quiet interest.
###Chapter 315 What Exactly Did Sherwood Do For Yo...
Molly chewed on her lower lip, her fingers nervously twisting togethner as she spoke. "Look, I shouldn't have said what I did at the party. It wasn't fair. The truth is,I care about Luis, probably more than I should.When I saw you playing matchmaker, I got jealous and said things I didn't mean. I admit it. I really do like him. But I'd never try to force him into anything. I just keep hoping he'll feel the same way about me one day. I've known Luis my whole life,Verena. I know what he wants, and it's definitely not your friend. You might not see it, but he's only going along with your plan because you're his sister. Luis never does anything he truly doesn't want to do. Maybe my feelings don't matter to you, but you should at least think about his.Your friend's gorgeous, sure, but she's not his type."



Verena, with her years of experience, saw straight through Molly's reasoning.


Every word seemed wrapped in concern for Luis, but the real motive was painfully clear.


Just as Molly had insisted, Luis never did anything he didn't want to do. If he truly disliked Miranda, nothing and no one could push him into spending time with  her, not even his own sister. No matter how much Verena tried to nudge them together,Luis would have found a way out.



Verena's lips curved into a knowing smile as she met Molly's gaze. "Miss Kirk, I can see how much you care about him. But let's be honest, if Luis isn't interested,no amount of matchmaking would matter."


She straightened, confidence radiating from her. "But have you noticed? He's still on the balcony, talking to Miranda right now. I didn't force him into that. All I did was pass on a message for them. The rest was his choice."



Molly traced Verena's line of sight until her eyes landed on the far edge of the balcony.


Luis stood faintly outlined in the night, phone in hand as he listened closely to the voice on the other end.



A twist of jealousy pinched at her heart.



"But..."



Molly spoke with a trace of reluctance in her voice,but no words of protest came to her.



She'd convinced herself that Luis was only being polite for Verena's sake. Now, watching him there,she wasn't so sure. ena's words gave Molly pause, and for a moment,found herself reluctantly nodding. Maybe there s some truth in what Verena said, even if it stung.



ticing Molly's crestfallen look, Verena's tone ftened, though she remained firm. "Miss Kirk, the eart never bends to anyone's will. Sometimes,the est thing we can do is let go."


.cross the room, Sherwood rose from his seat and lasped Joseph's hand in farewell.


Joseph answered with warmth in his tone, and once their short exchange ended, Sherwood turned his eyes toward Molly and Verena, who stood a little distance away.


bHe lifted his voice slightly and called out, "Molly, the hour's getting late. Let's make our way back."


Molly hesitated, biting her lip before straightening her shoulders. "Alright. I'll be right there."


She made her way back inside the living room,her steps heavy with resignation.



Meanwhile, Luis finished his call and drifted over to Verena, passing her phone back with a smooth,easy motion.



Verena accepted the phone, feeling the lingering q varmth of the device.



jhe tried to catch a hint of what he'd discussed with Miranda,searching his eyes for clués.



But Luis simply smiled, the same mysterious glint in his eyes as always, refusing to reveal a thing.


9After Sherwood and Molly left, the evening wound down.


Marisa, true to habit, slipped away to her room early,fighting back yawns.


Luis offered a quick goodnight before heading off for a much-needed shower.


Joseph guided Verena and Isaac upstairs, his voice warm and kind. "Verena, Isaac, this room is all set for you. You've both gone above and beyond today. Get some rest."



Verena offered a grateful smile as she guided Isaac's wheelchair to the door. "Thank you, Dad. You should rest, too. It's been a long day for all of us."


Isaac gave Joseph a courteous nod and said,"Thank you,Joseph. Have a good night."



Joseph returned their goodnights with a wave and slipped quietly down the hall.Verena pushed the wooden door inward, and a wave of soft warmth welcomed her in.



Muted cream tones stretched across the room like a quiet whisper, broken only by the presence of a few graceful landscape paintings that added just enough charm without shouting for attention.



At the center stood a wide, inviting bed,its pale yellow cover stitched with faint, intricate patterns that caught the light like threads of sunlight.


Low lamps flanked each side of the bed, their gentle glow spilling over the room like honey, wrapping everything in a hush of comfort.


A tall wardrobe along the wall brought the faint scent of cedar to the air.



Nearby, a writing desk sat beneath a window,moonlight falling across a vase of lilies. Their fragrance drifted through the room, delicate and soothing.



A cushioned sofa occupied the corner by the glass,perfectly positioned for quiet reading or gazing at the garden below.



On a dainty table rested porcelain coffee cups and several slim volumes of poetry,their covers well-worn and loved. spacious walk-in closet stood open in one corner,is shelves and racks neatly organized.


Compared to her old room at the Willis Villa, this place felt twice as large and infinitely warmer.Every detail spoke of care, chosen for her, not out of habit,but out oflove.



Verena lingered in the doorway, eyes bright with emotion as gratitude washed over her.



Isaac noticed her silence, and then wrapped her hand in his.



His touch was steady and warm. "You have more than just me now, Verena. From this day on, you belong to two families, both ready to welcome you home."



She met his gaze, tears shimmering but refusing to fall. For the first time, she truly felt the weight of being loved from all sides.



She had parents who cherished her, a brother who never failed to make her smile, and a husband whose patience never wore thin.



Verena drew in a steadying breath and smiled through the last of her tears. "I think I'll go run a bath. It's been a long day."



Before she could turn away, Isaac gently caught her  wrist. "Hold on," he said, eyes suddenly intent."There's something I've been wanting to ask you."



Surprised by the shift in his tone, she turned back,tilting her head as if to say, Go on.



He looked at her, sincerity written all over his face."Tell me, what exactly did Sherwood do for your family? Everyone in your family seems to owe him,but I never heard the full story."



The question caught Verena off guard. She hadn't imagined Isaac would bring that up so suddenly.


She hesitated, and then answered softly, "After l vanished, my father could barely keep himself together, let alone run the company. Luis, still so young, was forced into the chaos. People in the company refused to take him seriously, and things unraveled quickly. It was Sherwood who stepped up.He took Luis under his wing,showed him how to lead,and handled every storm that hit the business."


Verena's voice turned gentle. "With Sherwood's support and his standing in the industry, he brought calm to the turmoil and made sure Sampson Group survived. Dad never forgot what Sherwood did for us,and neither has any Sampson family member. Our family owes him a debt we'll always remember."
###Chapter 316 Let's Shower Together
"Is this really a big favor?" Isaac's voice was low, his question as soft as a ripple breaking still water.


Verena, puzzled, sank into the single-seater sofa across from him, her eyes resting on his face. "Isaac,what do you mean by that?"



For a while, Isaac said nothing. His long fingers tapped lightly against the armrest of his wheelchair, as though he were weighing every word on a scale.


At last, he raised his head, his eyes locking with hers,his expression solemn. "Verena, doesn't it strike you as too coincidental? After you vanished, your father was heartbroken,Sampson Group fell into chaos, and Sherwood arrived at the perfect moment to steady the ship."



Verena blinked, taken aback, her confusion deepening."Isaac, are you suggesting... Sherwood has ulterior motives? But he did help the Sampson family through those stormy times, and over the years, he's never made unreasonable demands."



"Verena, think again," Isaac pressed,cutting straight to the heart of the matter. "Sherwood, as the CEO of  Kirk Group, has no business entanglements with Sampson Group. He holds no authority inside Sampson Group-no shares, no position. How could Luis, sharp as he was, not notice? Back then, though inexperienced, he was still the rightful heir of Sampson Group. Even if others grumbled, they only whispered behind closed doors; none could topple him.He might have been young, but he wasn't a fool.With patience, bearing those rumors, his talent and vision would soon have carried him to the success he enjoys now."



Isaac's voice grew sharper, his gaze unwavering. "And yet Sherwood, an outsider, was able to silence dissent the moment he stepped in. Doesn't that tell you something?"


Verena faltered, unable to find words under lsaac's relentless reasoning.



Calmly, he continued, "First, the discontent toward Luis was likely stirred by Sherwood-that's why he could smother it so easily. Second, it shows he must have bought off many high-ranking members,using the excuse of helping Luis learn the ropes to plant himself firmly inside Sampson Group."


A sardonic smile touched Isaac's lips. "Look now-his daughter may hold only a manager's title in Benedict Pharmaceuticals, but in truth, the company is almost within their grasp. From what I know, Luis has even  entrusted several key posts to the Kirks, all in the name of gratitude."



His words were precise, each one cutting deeper,sending a chill down Verena's spine as she absorbed the frightening possibilities.


She was a healer celebrated around the world, her hands steady enough to pull lives back from the brink.But the battlefield of business, with its hidden daggers and unseen snares, was foreign ground.


When it came to unraveling webs of power and deceit,she could not match Isaac's clarity.



Her brows knitted. "So, the Kirk family's influence in Sampson Group runs far deeper than it seems on the surface..."



Then,as though struck by a memory,Verena hesitated,her eyes clouded with doubt. "But according to Luis,Sherwood has been friends with my parents for many years. How could he act like this? Could decades of friendship really be nothing but smoke and mirrors?"


Isaac sighed softly, his expression turning complex."Verena, such suspicions are not baseless. In the world of business, it's often said-there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. Sherwood, after years in this arena, knows this better than anyone. No bond, no matter how cherished, can withstand the trial of profit.  To tell you the truth, when you were treating your mother tonight, I caught a glimpse in Sherwood's eyes -it was not the gaze of a man truly hoping for her recovery. Luis, bound by gratitude, may choose to look away, but you don't carry those same ties. That's why you must watch the Kirks with clear eyes, always mindful of the motives behind their every move."



He paused, and then reached for her hand, his broad,warm palm enclosing hers.



Looking into her clear eyes, his own gaze softened though his tone remained steady. "I don't meddle in Sampson family matters; my position doesn't allow it.And I'd never want you to think my feelings for you are chained to family interests. But if you ever stumble upon something that confuses you,something you're unsure about, come to me. I'll do all I can to help you untangle it."



Warmth bloomed in Verena's heart, and she nodded gently. "Isaac, I understand your care and your warnings. I will stay vigilant, and I won't let them harm my family."



Isaac drew her into his arms, his chin restinglightly on her hair, his voice low and magnetic.


"We are one, Verena. Your burdens are mine;your family is mine to guard." Breathing deeply against his chest, she felt his warmth,his strong heartbeat steady beneath her ear.


She tightened her embrace, wrapping her arms around his broad back, nodding softly.



Isaac's palm patted her back with tender rhythm,soothing her like a lullaby.


Nestled in his arms, Verena allowed her eyes to close,basking in the shelter of his warmth.


The room grew still, filled only with the cadence of their breathing.



The soft glow of the lamps painted their silhouettes together. Verena's figure, almost swallowed in Isaac's embrace, made his form appear all the more tender,as though light and shadow conspired to reveal his gentler side.



His features-handsome and sharp by nature-now softened,his high nose and faintly curved lips carrying a quiet smile, his dark eyes unfathomable pools.


Time slipped by unnoticed until Verena stirred, her eyes fluttering open in a haze of drowsiness.


She let out a small yawn and rose,her voice hushed."I'm a little tired. I should take a shower." As she moved to leave his embrace, Isaac's hand caught her wrist.



She turned back, brows arching in surprise.


He tilted his head, meeting her gaze.


In that instant, the air thickened, charged with something unspoken.


Her eyes, bright as spring water, blinked curiously,lashes trembling like butterfly wings.


The lamplight cast a glow across her face, deepening her loveliness.



Isaac's throat tightened; he pressed his lips together,a faint blush touching the tips of his ears.


br
His voice dropped lower than usual, laced with awkwardness. "I need a shower too."


Verena froze for a moment, searching his face.


6His gaze wavered, veiled with unspoken desire.


"Understanding dawned, and the corners of her lips 'curved in amusement.


A playful gleam flashed in her eyes. She tilted her 2head and teased lightly,"What, afraidI'll use up all the hot water?"  Isaac cleared his throat, turning his flushed face aside."That's not what I meant."



At times like these, he was still as endearingly awkward as ever.



Verena's soft laugh slipped out,tinged with cunning mischief.



She leaned closer, her arms braced on the wheelchair's armrests, encircling him completely.


Her unique scent surrounded him, making his heart stumble in its rhythm.



Startled, his tense hands gripped the wheelchair's edges tighter.


His throat bobbed, parched, as though fire licked within.





Then her voice came, warm and teasing,brushing his ear like a breeze. "All right then... let's showNer together."



Her words struck him like lightning, scattering images through his mind in an instant.



His breath quickened, the flush burning from his cheeks down to his neck.
###Chapter 317 Stop At Nothing
A black car crept along the quiet street, headlights carving pale lines through the night.


In the shadowed back seat, Sherwood sat quietly, his face half-hidden in darkness but his eyes glinting with a keen,watchful sharpness.


He folded his hands together, resting them on his knees, and angled his body toward Molly.


"Talk to me, Molly," he said, his tone low and gentle but edged with worry. "Do you honestly believe you and Luis have a future together?"



Sherwood had been around long enough to see clearly that Luis felt nothing romantic toward Molly.Still,out of consideration for her feelings and a few practical motives of his own, he made a point of arranging chances for them to spend time together whenever they visited the Sampson family.


Even tonight, while sharing forced pleasantries with Joseph,he kept catching glimpses of Molly and Luis,searching for some spark between them.



It was never there, but he couldn't let himself stare

 too long, not in front of everyone, and so he could only guess at what was really going on.


Lost in thought of Verena's earlier words, Molly barely registered the question until his words finally cut through her daze. She turned to look at him, her eyes dull and defeated, the shine in them dimmed like a night sky washed out by heavy clouds.



After a long, aching pause, she shook her head and answered quietly, "Dad, Luis just doesn't feel that way about me. Should I really keep chasing after something that isn't there?"



The moment he heard those words, a chill settled in Sherwood's gaze, his eyes narrowing just enough to reveal the edge behind them.



He rubbed his thumb over a hardened patch of skin-a scar from years spent wrestling with ruthless business rivals.



"It's time to face reality, Molly." His words came out steady, but there was a hard edge to them. "You and Luis aren't equals when it comes to business. The only reason Kirk Group is where it is now is because we managed to tie ourselves to the Sampson family."



He let out a heavy breath,voice rough with exhaustion."You're all I've got. Just one daughter. You're still so young,with your whole life ahead,but I'm not going to be around forever."



A soft sadness overtook his eyes. "I've fought for every inch of ground in the business world and seen more betrayals than I care to remember. It's not a kind place."



He lifted his hand as if to brush her cheek, but halfway there,hesitated-then let his hand fall, both palms clasping tightly on his knees again.


"I don't want you to carry the same burdens I once did,nor do I want you to stand alone when the storms of business come crashing down. What I want is for you to live with ease, to succeed without breaking yourself in the process, to stand tall above others with a steady foundation beneath you. Luis has both the strength and the pedigree to give you that kind of life.He can shield you, guide you, and his talent speaks for itself."



His voice hardened, his stare unwavering."That is why he is the only man I will ever accept as my son-in-law."



A shadow crossed his expression as his brows knitted together. "If you marry him, I'll never need to take measures I'd rather avoid."



Molly sat silently, her chest tight with emotion.



Every word reminded her of how deeply her father had planned for her future. From the very beginning,he had placed her happiness above all else.



Her mother's death after childbirth had left him with nothing but grief and a fragile infant to raise.



Back in those tough years, it was Sherwood who had taken on everything to raise her by himself.


She knew all too well the weight he'd carried and the countless things he had given up to make sure she had a chance at a better life.



As his reputation grew and the Sampson family ties pushed him upward, countless people had tried to push women into his life. He turned them all away. His devotion never wavered.


The thought of it warmed her heart, filling her with quiet joy.


Yet the final note in his words unsettled her, like a dark cloud drifting into a clear sky.



Lifting her eyes to him, she whispered, uncertainty coloring her voice, "Dad... what exactly are you planning?"



Sherwood leaned back against the leather seat, his gaze cutting straight into hers. "Molly, you need to remember: two tigers can't rule the same mountain.Business doesn't stop being ruthless just because you decide to play fair. If Luis doesn't become your husband and gives his name to another woman,then the Kirk family will always be forced to kneel beneath the Sampson family. Their roots run deep, and their influence stretches across the entire city."


His fingers drummed lightly against the armrest, his words deliberate and edged with reluctance. "If Luis throws his lot in with another family, their reach will expand beyond measure. Without that bond, we'll be left trailing behind, shut out of opportunities and stripped of the projects that keep us strong."



Molly worried her lip between her teeth, uncertainty flickering in her eyes.



For years, she had watched her father claw his way through the brutal storms of business, raising their family higher with every victory.



But she never truly grasped why they always had to fight for dominance, why being on top mattered so much. Her gaze lingered on him, clouded with confusion, and she finally parted her lips to voice the question that had been pressing in her chest.



But before she could, Sherwood's expression softened,his eyes filled with warmth as he added,"Molly,I know how much you care for Luis."



His hand rose to ruffle her hair gently, his voice a promise. "Don't worry. I'll stop at nothing to make sure you get what you want."


Before Molly could answer, he turned away, staring out into the blur of passing streetlights.


In the blink of an eye, the warmth in his smile disappeared, carried off like it had never been there at all. Under the glow of the streetlights,a chill settled in his gaze, sharp and unblinking. A faint crease formed between his brows, and deep lines slowly etched their way across his forehead.



The memory of dinner brought a curl to his lips, a smile that barely surfaced before hardening into something cold.



Verena might seem aloof, but beneath her polished surface she was simple, transparent even-someone easy to read.



Isaac, however, was another matter entirely. He had sat in silence most of the evening, calm and inscrutable, revealing nothing. That silence was the most dangerous part.


Men who thrived in Shoildon's ruthless world of wealth and power didn't rise on luck alone-they carried both cunning and skill sharpened over years. The realization darkened Sherwood's gaze, his eyes hardening with a chill that cut deeper than before.He warned himself to tread carefully, to watch every step when it came to lsaac.



A different thought stirred, and his fingers began a slow, deliberate rhythm against his knee.



Isaac was far more cunning than Verena, yet that didn't give him the luxury of brushing her aside.


For now, Verena remained useful, and Sherwood had no intention of discarding her just yet.
###Chapter 318 Why Was He Here
The following morning,at the Sampson Villa...


The bathroom glowed softly, the light spreading a warm,gentle haze.



At the sink, Isaac carefully squeezed toothpaste onto Verena's brush before tending to his own. Both were preparing to brush their teeth.


Beside him, Verena was in front of the mirror, casually fixing her hair.


When her eyes drifted upward, they landed on her own neck.



There, several hickeys stood vividly against her delicate skin-like scarlet stamps of last night's passion, impossible to ignore.



As though drawn by some silent thread, her gaze met Isaac's in the mirror.


Verena shot him a playful glare.



Isaac immediately set down his toothbrush, his voice laced with apology yet softened by affection. "Sorry,  I lost control last night."



His voice, low and magnetic, carried a subtle current that lingered in Verena's ears.


She smiled, leaned close, and brushed a gentle kiss against the corner of his lips. "Alright, you're forgiven."


After completing their morning routine, Verena reached for concealer and carefully covered the hickeys on her neck.


Downstairs, Joseph and Marisa were seated on the sofa,while Luis lingered on the balcony, speaking on the phone.


When Verena and Isaac came down, Joseph immediately instructed a servant to bring out breakfast.



The family gathered around the table. They ate together, though Luis finished quickly and left for the company.



Under Joseph's and Marisa's watchful eyes, Verena managed a glass of milk and a sandwich.



Realizing she couldn't eat more, they held back from pressing her further.



Once breakfast ended, she and lsaac lingered for a while,chatting with her parents before preparing to  leave.



Marisa, however, looked reluctant. She clung to Verena's hand, urging her again and again not to go.


Verena patiently comforted her, promising she would visit again in just a few days. At last, Marisa relented.



The moment they stepped outside, Verena's phone rang.



The caller was Sherwood.


She answered and greeted politely, "Hello, Mr. Kirk."



From the other end came a gentle male voice."Verena, I hope I'm not intruding?"


Though he couldn't see her, Verena pressed her lips together and kept a polite smile.



"Of course not, Mr.Kirk."



"Good," Sherwood said. He continued after a pause,as if weighing his words, "Verena, I once told you about my health troubles. This illness cannot be put off any longer. I wanted to ask for your help, but l worried I might consume too much of your time.Would now be convenient?"



At those words, Isaac's eyes narrowed, a flicker of sternness darkening his gaze. 
Despite her wariness,Verena remembered her promise.



Besides, she wasn't certain if their suspicions were correct.



So she answered firmly, "Mr. Kirk, don't worry. I'll do everything I can to help you recover. Send me the address-I'll come right away."



Once the call ended, Isaac spoke without hesitation,his tone firm as stone. "I'll go with you."


His eyes left no room for refusal.


But Verena smiled gently and shook her head. Her voice softened."No need.You have matters to handle -go on and take care of them."



Seeing his hesitation, she reassured him. "Don't worry.Even if he harbors schemes, he won't dare act openly.I'm going there at his request to treat him. He wouldn't be so reckless."



Isaac frowned, his concern still etched deeply. "Are you certain you don't want me along? Sherwood is cunning.I worry for you."



Verena leaned down, brushed a kiss across his cheek,and looked steadily into his eyes. "I'll be fine. Don't you trust my ability? Besides, Luis is still here. Once l finish, I'll update you at once, alright?" Isaac sighed in resignation, tapping her nose lightly with a fingertip. "Be very careful. The moment anything feels wrong, call me. I'll be there in a heartbeat."



Verena nodded. "Alright, don't worry."


So they parted-lsaac back to Shoildon, Verena into the car bound for the Kirk family residence.


Half an hour later, her car eased onto the road leading to the Kirk family villa.



Just then, a black veicle approached head-on.


As they passed each other, Verena,idly watching the scenery outside, caught sight of a middle-aged man seated in the back.


He wore a gray suit and square-framed glasses, their lenses glinting faintly in the sunlight, adding a touch of mystery.



A brown birthmark marked his right cheek, prominent and unmistakable.



Verena's eyes narrowed slightly. The face tugged at her memory.



A wave of familiarity washed over her, and she frowned,searching her mind. Then, in a sudden flash, she recalled-she had seen him at last night's party.



Wasn't he a senior executive from Sampson Group?



Her eyes sharpened at once,puzzlement stirring within her.



This road led straight to the Kirk family villa. Why was he here?



As her car neared the villa gates, she forced herself to set aside the thought for now.



The car stopped at the entrance. Sherwood greeted her warmly, his face spread in welcoming smiles.



"Verena,you came so quickly."



She returned his warmth with composure, smiling gently. "Mr. Kirk, since you're unwell, I wouldn't dare delay."



With that, she followed him into the living room.


"Isaac didn't come with you?" Sherwood asked casually.



Verena remained poised. Her lips curved slightly as she shook her head. "He returned to Shoildon for business." "I see." He nodded.



In the living room, he gestured for her to sit,and then personally poured her a cup of coffee, his manner all attentiveness.



"Try this, Verena. I prepared it especially for you," he said, offering the cup.


She accepted politely, thanked him, took a light sip,and then placed it down again, cutting straight to the matter."Mr. Kirk, let's talk about your health."


At once, Sherwood nodded. "Very well. Please follow me to the private medical facility in the back garden."


Wealth often brought its own form of caution-many powerful families built clinics within their homes.


Sherwood's, however, was not only complete but luxurious, with advanced equipment and shelves stocked with medicine, a testament to how much he prized his health.



Verena began by reviewing his past medical records before conducting a thorough examination herself.



After careful confirmation, her conclusion was clear -he had liver cancer, already in the intermediate to late s  The liver, that silent organ, often gave no early warning. By the time liver cancer was discovered,many patients were already beyond the first stage.


At that point, the best chance for surgery was gone.



In such cases, operations could seldom remove the tumor completely. And even when surgery succeeded,the risk of recurrence and metastasis loomed large.
###Chapter 319 Caution



Years spent immersed in pharmacology had given Verena a foundation most doctors could only envy.Experience with rare and difficult cases, along with her unconventional methods, offered a glimmer of hope even when situations looked grim.


Sherwood studied Verena,searching her calm face for any hint of certainty. His voice trembled as he spoke."Verena, do you really think there's a chance for me to get better?"



She chose her words carefully, keeping her confidence guarded. "Liver cancer isn't easy to fight,Mr. Kirk, but there are ways to manage it. I'll do everything I can for you."


Relief flashed across Sherwood's features. "Just hearing that from you helps me breathe a little easier.Thank you,Verena."



She nodded. "We'll start with traditional treatment to help your energy flow and ease your discomfort. The needles might sting a bit, but try to stay relaxed."


She opened her kit, revealing rows of shining silver needles, each one meticulously arranged and ready. Though he tried to seem fearless, Sherwood couldn't stop staring at the needles, swallowing hard. "I'm ready. Go ahead.I trust you."



His tone was steady, but his hands twisted the hem of his shirt, betraying a deep-rooted anxiety.


Trust, after all, was never something he handed out freely.



Verena wiped each needle with care, her tone soothing. "There's nothing to worry about. If you focus on a pleasant memory, the treatment will be over before you know it."



Her hands moved with swift precision, finding each acupuncture point with confidence. The needles glided into place, her expertise on full display.



Verena recalled Isaac's warning from the night before about Sherwood's suspicious intentions, and a sharp glint of caution flickered in her eyes.



On the outside, she looked calm and steady, but underneath, she carried a quiet edge of caution-she didn't try to do her best for now.



This session was just the beginning, a way to gauge his condition, nothing more. A single round of acupuncture would only smooth the surface; the real problem ran deeper. Verena wasn't naive enough to save someone who posed a threat to her family.



She maintained a careful mask: all professionalism and poise, her real thoughts hidden.



Once the final needle was removed, she cleaned her tools and returned them to their case with quiet efficiency.



"That's it for now, Mr. Kirk. Try to get plenty of rest,and if you notice anything out of the ordinary,let me know right away," said Verena, her voice gentle but firm.



Sherwood pushed himself upright with slow movements, gave a brief stretch, and a faint expression of relief settled across his face.



"I'm already feeling the difference,Verena. Thank you."His face softened into a smile as he made a gesture of hospitality. "It's nearly lunchtime. Would youstay and join me? Let me show my appreciation."



A polite smile flickered across Verena's face as she shook her head."That's very generous of you, Mr. Kirk,but I have a few pressing matters I can't put off.Maybe next time, after your next round of treatment."



Her words were gentle, yet there was no mistaking her resolve. Sherwood caught the unspoken finality and didn't push any further.


"Alright then. If you ever run into trouble, business or otherwise, my door's always open to you, Verena," he said,following her to the entryway.


He watched as she walked away, his initial warmth dimming as her figure slipped out of sight.



Outside,the sun beat down relentlessly. Raising a hand to shield her eyes, Verena hurried toward the waiting car by the curb.



The driver wasted no time opening the door, and she slid into the cool interior, grateful for the reprieve.


The car pulled away from the Kirk family villa and onto the main road.



Returning to her home in Shoildon, Verena dropped onto the living room sofa, sinking into the cushions.



Thoughts tumbled through her mind: Isaac's warning from the night before, and the man she'd seen outside Sherwood's villa, both lingering at the edge of her memory.



Digging for the truth would take more than speculation.She needed real answers.
 Determined, Verena grabbed her phone and dialed Luis.



He picked up on the first ring, his voice calm as ever."Hey, Verena. What's going on?"


She wasted no time with pleasantries. "Luis, I need you to pull the profiles for every executive and shareholder at. Sampson Group. I want their backgrounds, recent movements, and who they've been meeting with. Don't leave anything out."



Luis immediately picked up on the urgency in her tone."Is something wrong? Did you run into trouble?"



Verena's gaze drifted to the garden outside, her brow furrowing. After a brief pause, she replied, "I'm not sure yet. Send me what you find first, and we'll talk once I've gone over the details."



Luis understood that Verena never acted without careful thought, and he was certain she would not press him with such urgent demands unless there was a solid reason behind them.



He chose not to press her with more questions and instead spoke firmly. "Alright, I'll take care of it right now. As soon as everything is ready, I'll send the materials to you."



With the call finished, Verena made her way upstairs and booted up her laptop.



A short while later, a notification chimed. Luis had already delivered the files.



Without hesitation, she clicked open the documents,ready to dig into whatever secrets they held.


Information and images filled the screen, each file unraveling the inner workings of the Sampson Group's leadership.



Verena's eyes moved swiftly, absorbing every name,background, and photograph with laser focus.


Roughly thirty minutes passed before something unusual made her pause mid-scroll.


A certain image jumped out at her, halting her hand in place.



There,frozen on the screen, was a man with a brown birthmark on his right cheek and heavy square glasses perched on his nose.



Recognition hit like a punch; she'd seen this man earlier, crossing paths with him on the road leading to Sherwood's villa.



A sharp breath escaped her as she leaned closer,reading the caption beneath the photo. The name read Howe Adams, a major power broker at Sampson Group, holding a sizable share and clearly pulling more strings than most.



The realization left her stunned, mind racing with questions. Her fingers drummed an anxious beat on the desktop.



Why would someone like Howe be anywhere near Sherwood's home?



What kind of arrangement could be brewing between them?



There was no way this was a chance encounter.Something bigger had to be unfolding beneath the surface.



Maybe Howe was just one of the cogs in a much larger scheme.


Determined to get answers, Verena picked up her phone and dialed her trusted detective.



On the third ring, a voice came through. "Verena, how can I help you?"



Verena wasted no time. "I need a full report on who's been snapping up Sampson Group's loose shares.I want names, transaction dates, and even where the deals went down. Don't leave anything out. This takes priority. Send me what you find as soon as possible."
###Chapter 320 The Hidden Connection
The detective didn't disappoint-three days later,Verena found a new email in her inbox.



She settled at her desk and clicked open the file. A spreadsheet sprang to life on her screen, brimming with names and numbers.



It was a complete rundown of every individual who'd snapped up Sampson Group shares in recent months.



Verena's eyes scanned each entry, her pen darting across a legal pad as she mapped out connections,drawing circles and arrows with practiced care.



As Verena sifted through the data, she watched a maze of hidden relationships start to take shape on her screen.



It became clear that the people buying up shares weren't acting alone-each was part of a web, bound by family, old alliances, or business dealings that stretched back for years.



What once looked like random names scattered across a spreadsheet slowly revealed a tight network,threads overlapping in every direction. This roster of shareholders was more than a list-it was a trapdoor map, giving the illusion of chaos while masking intricate connections beneath the surface.


Verena clicked from profile to profile, tracing every link and cross-referencing every name.


In the end, all the scattered pieces began to draw together. Despite the illusion of randomness, every path, no matter how convoluted, circled back to a single figure.



That person was-Howe.



No matter how tangled or circuitous the trail,every connection circled back to him.



Whether it was close family, distant acquaintances,or business partners from the past, all roads inevitably pointed straight to Howe.



It felt as though Howe was the mastermind, pulling every string in this elaborate game.



However...



Verena leaned back in her chair, brow creased as she replayed the memory of spotting Howe near the intersection by Sherwood's house.



Sherwood wasn't just any bystander-he was a  seasoned player in the business world, his influence within Sampson Group still lingering thanks to favors and deals from years past.



Howe,with his szable stake and sway in the company,had no good reason to be anywhere near Sherwood's home.



Given Sherwood's long-standing ties to the Sampson family, any meeting between the two should have been strictly off-limits.



There was no way this was just a coincidence.


Verena lowered her gaze, and then looked up again,eyes flashing with a razor-sharp gleam.


Every instinct screamed at her-Howe was hiding something bigger, someone even more cunning operating from the shadowNS.


And whatever that secret was, Sherwood was in the thick of it too.



Verena folded her arms and sank back in her chair,thoughts churning beneath a mask of composure.



The silence in her study was broken only by the slow,steady tick of the wall clock, each sound amplifying the tension building inside her.



Her eyes grew somber as one clue after another  tangled together in her mind.



The more she considered the hidden connection between Howe and Sherwood-and the web of investors wrapped around Sampson Group-the more a prickling sense of unease swept over her.


At last, she let out a weary breath and reached for her phone, scrolling until Luis' name appeared on the screen.


For a moment, Verena hovered over Luis' number, and then set her phone aside.



This was not the sort of puzzle to untangle through a phone call.


Some conversations demanded eye contact and privacy.





She pressed her fingers to her temples, trying to soothe the headache that came with all these new questions.



Clearly, she would have to carve out time for a proper discussion with Luis, face-to-face.







A few days later, Verena left the hospital early in the morning and slid into the back seat of her car, giving the driver a single, clear order. "Take me to the  airport. I need to catch a flight to Ochrerayd."


The driver gave a nod and pulled away from the curb,weaving through city traffic until the airport came into view.



Before long, they eased to a stop at the bustling terminal.


A few hours and a smooth flight later, Verena found herself greeted by a Sampson family chauffeur,ready and waiting to drive her to the Sampson Group building.



When the car rolled to a halt at the foot of Sampson Group's skyscraper, Verena stepped out and tilted her head back, taking in the sheer scale of the building.Sunlight bounced off the glass exterior, each ray a silent testament to decades of ambition and achievement.



A flush of pride warmed her chest, quickly shadowed by a whisper of unease.



She brushed away the worry, squared her shoulders,and strode toward the entrance.



Inside, the marble floors shone so brightly they caught her reflection at every step.



The lobby stretched wide and bright, sunlight pouring in through tall windows as employees hurried across  polished floors, the space alive with the energy of a thriving business.



Verena strode straight to the reception counter and offered a polite greeting. "Good morning. I'm here to see Luis Sampson."



As soon as her voice echoed through the lobby, two young women at the front desk glanced up without thinking. Their gazes collided with Verena's, and for a heartbeat,the world seemed to stand still.



Standing before them, Verena wore a sleek silk dress that effortlessly complemented her pregnant form,highlighting a figure that spoke of self-care and discipline.



Her gentle features and luminous complexion showed no sign of tiredness. Pregnancy had not left its mark on her face, and it was obvious she'd taken meticulous care of herself.


Admiration flickered in the eyes of the receptionists.It was rare to witness someone who could radiate such elegance and poise while expecting.


They shared a silent look.


Verena's identity had been made public by Luis, and her impressive reputation in the medical world made it easy for them to put a name to the face. After a moment, their professionalism kicked in.Warm smiles bloomed, and one of them said, "You must be Mr. Sampson's sister. He's working upstairs right now Let me show you the way."


Without missing a beat, she hurried around the desk and led Verena to the elevators, casting respectful and curious glances over her shoulder to make sure Verena stayed close.



When the elevator finally arrived with a soft chime,they rode to the top floor.



As the doors slid open, the receptionist prepared to step out first, ready to guide Verena further.


But Verena smiled kindly and spoke in a gentle tone."Thank you, but I can find my way from here."


The receptionist paused for a moment, and then nodded, still smiling as she gestured to the left. "Of course. Mr. Sampson's office is the first door down that hall."



Verena offered a quiet nod of appreciation and moved down the left corridor without another word.



With each step, anticipation built until she reached a closed office door. Lifting her hand, she rapped her knuckles gently against the wood, waiting. When no answer came, curiosity urged her to try the handle. As she pushed the door open, Verena found herself rooted to the spot.



Surprise swept across her face, her calm composure giving way to disbelief.


Inside, Miranda lounged sideways in Luis' lap, the two pressed together so closely that the air in the room seemed to crackle.



Miranda's head lowered, her teeth playfully tugging at the crisp fabric of Luis' shirt. The collar was askew,and a few buttons had been undone, exposing the defined lines of his chest.



Luis wore his suit jacket open, his tie loose and forgotten.



Overwhelmed by Miranda's playful taunting,he tilted his head away. His neck strained, Adam's apple moving as he swallowed, and a flash of embarrassment replaced his usual confidence.



The pair looked like models caught in a magazine shoot-so much so that Verena felt heat creeping up her cheeks.



Struggling to hide her amusement, she cleared her throat and grinned. "Well, don't let me stop you. Go right ahead."Without lingering, she spun on her heel and quietly pulled the door shut.
###Chapter 321 You've Lost



When Verena shut the door, silence instantly swallowed the office whole.



Miranda was the first to gather herself,her expression serene, the same mischievous smile still dancing on her lips.



Her slender fingers skimmed along the edge of Luis 'open collar as she leaned closer, her warm breath whispering against his ear. "Well, it looks like Verena just caught sight of something she never should have."



Luis' gaze sharpened at once, the haze in his eyes clearing. Though his voice carried a hoarse undertone,he kept his tone even. "Miss Brown, this is an office.Conduct yourself properly."



Yet Miranda seemed bent on ignoring that line.Instead of moving away, she nestled closer into his arms, her arms sliding around his neck. Triumph curved her mouth. "With your shirt already halfway undone, isn't it a little late for reminders, Mr. Sampson?"



She arched her brows in playful challenge, her eyes glinting with mischief.



Luis' lips formed a faint, unreadable smile, his dark gaze steady on her. "You were the one who wagered that if I kissed you willingly within fifteen minutes, I'd accept your earlier proposal. Time's up, Miss Brown.You've lost."



Unruffled, Miranda tilted her chin toward the wall clock, her red lips bending upward. "Isn't there still a minute left?"



A faint crease formed on Luis' forehead, confusion flickering in his eyes.


As he considered what ploy she might try next, a firm hand suddenly gripped the back of his neck and tugged him close.



His body stiffened, an instinctive urge to resist flashing through him, but before he could act, Miranda's breath was already mingling with his.


The distance between them vanished, their quickened breaths colliding in the charged space.


Luis' lashes quivered, his lips parting to speak-but Miranda silenced him with a kiss.


For an instant, his mind went blank, thought and reason frozen.



Then, like floodgates breaking, memories long buried surged back, drowning him in recollections of that reckless,fevered night.Everything replayed in his mind as vividly as if a reel of film were spinning before him.


Dazed only for a heartbeat, his gaze soon darkened,depth and danger interwoven.



He swallowed hard, one hand cupping the back of her head,his fingers weaving into her hair.


From that moment, control was an illusion.


The once-quiet air of the office seemed to flare into flame.



Documents slid from the desk, strewn across the floor like leaves in the wind.



The world outside ceased to matter.


Luis' tie pooled at his feet,several buttons gone from his shirt.



Miranda's hair tumbled loosely down, strands clinging to her flushed cheeks, enhancing her allure.







Meanwhile, Verena waited neither too close nor too far from the office, perched on a high stool with the city spread out below. Her eyes looked vacant, her thoughts adrift.
For the fifth time, she glanced at her watch-just as the office door clicked open.



Turning,she spotted Miranda approaching.



Miranda's hair was slightly tousled, her once-polished outfit a little undone, though her lips curved into a smile that betrayed her satisfaction-like a cat fresh from mischief.



Verena's lips tugged into a knowing smile as her gaze swept Miranda up and down.


After a moment, she reached out and brushed at Miranda's cheek, her tone playful. "You've got a touch of lipstick smudged there."



Crossing her arms, she tilted her head, her eyes dancing. "So, Miss Brown, care to explain what's going on between you and my brother?"


Miranda showed no hint of shame. Instead,she looped an arm casually around Verena's neck, her grin lighthearted. "Darling, shouldn't you be warning me not to meddle with him unless I mean it?"



Verena laughed softly, shaking her head. "We're all grown-ups. He knows whether you mean it or not.Why should I step in?"



Admiration flickered in Miranda's eyes. She arched a brow. "As perceptive as ever. No wonder I like you so much."



She released Verena, smoothed her hair, and waved a careless farewell. "Well, I've got errands to run. See you,darling."


Her heels tapped a steady rhythm as she left.


Verena watched her slip into an elevator,shaking her head with an amused smile.


The office, in contrast, bore the look of a storm's passing.


Papers once stacked neatly were scattered across the floor,bent and jumbled.


Luis' chair sat at an awkward angle, its cushion askew.


A delicate crystal ornament had toppled, shattered into fragments that gleamed shaply in the light.


Nearby, a coffee cup lay overturned, its dark stain spreading across the desk and dripping down in crooked trails.



Luis stood before the desk, hands braced on his hips.The creases in his collar betrayed the disarray.


His hair, usually groomed to precision, now fell in untamed strands over his forehead, lending him an air  of roguish abandon.



Blood tinged his eyes, his chest rising unevenly.



The office brimmed with warmth and static, as if the air itself pulsed.



He tilted his head back, eyes closed, drawing in a deep breath.



The floral trace of Miranda's perfume lingered,mingling with the woody note of his cologne-a dangerous mix pulling him back toward their heated encounter.



His brow twitched, as though the scent itself was a provocation.


He pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to steady himself.



When he opened his eyes again, confusion and yearning flickered in their depths.


Pulling himself together, he reached for the intercom,his voice rougher than usual. "Send someone to clean up my office."


He hung up and strode toward the shower in the rest area.
###Chapter 322 She's His Achilles' Heel
Luis opened the office door, clad in a crisp new suit.


His collar was buttoned to the top, the tie falling in perfect order across his chest.He carried himself with the poise of a man firmly in control, his expression clean of even the faintest hint of impropriety.



His back was straight, his stride measured, as he moved toward Verena.



Verena stood there, her eyes fixed on him.



Luis met her gaze, his face unreadable. The calm steadiness in his eyes was the same as ever-detached,almost indifferent.



That cool composure unsettled Verena, making her wonder if the compromising scene she had witnessed earlier had been nothing more than a trick of her imagination.



His voice came low, even, without a crack in its surface. "Verena, what's the matter?"


 
As she looked up, a faint scent of fresh shower gel lingered in the air. Her lips parted to speak, but at that moment Luis 'assistant hurried over from the far side.



Leaning close, the assistant whispered, "Mr.Sampson,the meeting begins in three minutes."



Luis gave the slightest nod before turning back to her."Go on-say what you wanted to say."



Verena shook her head softly. "Go handle your meeting. I've got work too. We can talk later-it isn't urgent."



For a fleeting second, apology flickered in Luis' eyes.He offered her a quiet, "Sorry," and then walked off with his assistant toward the conference room.



Verena didn't see it, but as soon as he turned,unease and resignation shadowed his gaze.



..·


That very day, Verena flew back to Shoildon.



The following evening, she recounted to Isaac what she had seen between Luis and Miranda.



"You should have seen it. Had I not been there, I'd never believe Luis could lose control like that,"Verena said as she placed the needles into Isaac.



Isaac lifted his eyes slightly, curiosity flickering there. "Truly? I never thought Luis had that in him."


To the world, Luis had always worn a mask of arrogance and icy composure, an untouchable hauteur that set him apart.


It seemed as though nothing on earth could rattle him.


So the idea of such a man stumbling over a woman bordered on the unthinkable.



"Exactly," Verena replied, a trace of mischief brightening her eyes. "He's always held everyone at arm's length. And yet, along comes Miranda."


She let out a gentle sigh. "From the way he behaves around her, he never stood a chance. She's his Achilles' heel."



"And then?" Isaac asked evenly. He cared little for Luis ' affairs, yet he found more amusement in the sparkle of Verena's storytelling.



Verena shrugged,carefully removing the needles one by one. "Then he carried on as though nothing had happened,walking straight into his meeting.If not for the fresh clothes and that lingering scent of shower gel, I might have doubted my own eyes."


Isaac pictured it, a quiet laugh slipping from his lips. When she finished, she said, "Don't move yet. Take a  moment to rest."



Once he had, Verena took his arms firmly and helped him rise.



With her steady support, Isaac drew in a deep breath and eased his legs toward the floor.


The instant his feet touched down, his brow furrowed.A sharp soreness surged through his muscles,making his movements falter.


Sensing his struggle, Verena instinctively tightened her hold, murmuring gently, "Don't worry, I've got you."



Isaac clenched his jaw, forcing his body to obey. He lifted one foot. The movement was shaky, stiff-but not as rigid as before.
###Chapter 323 Shouldn't You Be More Concerned With... 
As time went by, under Verena's patient guidance,Isaac slowly learned to catch the rhythm of walking.



She supported him with steady arms,softly counting,"One,two,one,two..."



Matching her cadence, Isaac adjusted his steps.


Bit by bit, his movements grew steadier. They still carried a tremor, but no longer the helpless wobble of the beginning.



Step after step-each as heavy as climbing a mountain,each demanding most of Verena's strength to keep him upright-yet at least he was finally able to summon his own willpower and press forward.


Watching him push against his limits, Verena couldn't hold back her praise. "I knew you'd manage. Look how far you've come."


With her support, Isaac had already covered a surprising distance.



Lowering his gaze, he noticed the strain in her slender arms, veins rising faintly against her skin, and beads of  sweat glistening on her smooth forehead.



A pang of heartache stirred within him. He gently clasped her delicate arm, his breath uneven, and said,"That's enough for today. Let's take a break."


Verena nodded with a smile. "Alright, let's rest for a while. You must be exhausted."



She guided him carefully to the sofa.



Once seated,she poured him a glass of water,passing it to him with quiet insistence. "Here, drik.You need to replenish your strength."


She took a sip from her own glass, and then said warmly, "Isaac, at the pace you're recovering,your legs will heal completely. Walking as you once did is only a matter of time."


Setting down her glass, she turned slightly,unable to hide her joy. "Just think-in such a short while, you've already managed to walk with your own strength.The speed of your progress is remarkable. If we keep to this rhythm, together with the healing methods we're using, it won't be long before you can walk, even run,freely again."


Walk...run...


Words he once shunned, words he dared not hope for. But now...



Isaac lifted his eyes, filled with longing, and gazed at Verena.



Her eyes glimmered with a soft radiance, her smile so tender that he wished to shield it for life.



That gaze of hers struck the most fragile corner of his heart, as if it carried a spell only she could weave.


Love surged through him. He quickly set his glass aside.



In the next breath, he wrapped his strong arms around her waist, drawing her close as though he were cradling the most precious treasure on earth.



He lowered his head, pressing his cheek gently against her rounded belly, feeling the warmth and faint pulse of life.



In that embrace, words became unnecessary.



Closing his eyes, lsaac let the quiet warmth soak through him.


This-this was the home he had longed for.


With her by his side, with their love's creation within her,the shadow of pain and despair dissolved like mist at sunrise. Drawing in a deep breath of her familiar scent, he whispered, "Verena, thank you... for all of this."


Her heart swelled at the sight of him. Love filled her gaze.



She combed her fingers through his hair,bent low,and murmured near his ear, "Isaac, from here on, things will only get better for us."



Isaac smiled faintly, nuzzling against her waist in quiet reply.



Just then, a thought crossed Verena's mind.



Her lips curved into a playful smile, her voice carrying a note of gossip. "I can't help wondering what will become of Luis and Miranda. Do you think they'll last?"



The words stirred a spark of jealousy in Isaac.



He had been resting contentedly against her belly, but now he lifted his head, feigning a pout as he leaned so close their faces nearly touched.


Half-playful, half-complaining, he said, "Instead of worrying about Luis' tangled romance, shouldn't you be more concerned with our love story?"



His gaze fell on her lips, holding her there.



Verena caught the glimmer of desire rising in his eyes His playful and jealous demeanor reminded her of the times they spent together in Clokron.



Thinking of this, she smiled tenderly and leaned in to kiss him...




...


As for Sherwood, Venera knew action could not be delayed.



That evening, she instructed her assistant to book the earliest flight to Ochrerayd for the following morning.



When dawn had yet to break and the city lay in slumber, she left with her portable laptop in hand.


At the airport, she moved through check-in and security with quiet determination.


The plane took off, piercing the clouds, and a few hours later descended smoothly onto Ochrerayd's runway.



While waiting earlier, she had already contacted the Sampson family driver.


So the moment she stepped out of the terminal, she spotted the familiar black vehicle waiting at its designated spot.



The driver, neatly uniformed, had clearly been there  for some time.



To her surprise, one of Luis' assistants was also present.


Upon seeing her, the driver quickly stepped forward,respectfully opening the rear door.



Verena nodded in acknowledgment and slipped gracefully into the car.


The door closed with a soft click, and the car eased onto the main road.



Seated in the back, Verena furrowed her brow slightly,turning over in her mind the matters she would soon discuss with Luis.



Her fingers tapped lightly on the window frame before she asked the assistant, "Patrick,is Luis busy right now?"



She asked because she didn't wish to stumble into another awkward scene-charming though it might have seemed the first time, she had no desire to witnessit again.



The car rolled to a gentle halt at a red light.


Patrick Hayes, sitting in the passenger seat,turned to reply with calm courtesy."When Mr.Sampson learned of your visit and the importance of your discussion,he moved his morning meetings to the afternoon. He  should be in the office now,awaiting you."


Verena gave a small nod.


Seeing no further questions, Patrick turned back,sitting upright.


The light turned green, and the car resumed its smooth pace.



Half an hour later, they pulled into Sampson Group's exclusive underground lot.



The driver quickly stepped out to open her door with respect.



Verena alighted, straightening her attire.



Patrick led her through the first-floor lobby and into the private elevator.


With a soft "ding," the elevator doors opened.



He stepped aside, motioning for her to go ahead.



The carpeted hallway carried her to the door of Luis 'office.



Patrick knocked lightly. At the call of "Come in," he opened the door and smiled, gesturing for her to enter. Verena stepped inside. Luis, standing by the window,  turned as she entered. "Verena, you're here. You caught such an early flight-you must be tired. Come,sit and rest a while."
 ###Chapter 324 A Carefully Laid Trap

Verena gave a small nod before walking over to settle on a sofa.



Patrick moved swiftly, placing two cups of coffee neatly on the table.



Luis broke the silence, his tone calm yet firm. "You can go ahead and take care of your work."



Patrick inclined his head in acknowledgment, and then slipped out, gently pulling the door shut behind him.


When the room grew quiet, Luis crossed over as well and lowered himself onto the sofa opposite Verena.



Leaning forward, elbows braced on his knees and fingers interlocked, he asked steadily, "Verena, has something happened?"


He knew her nature well. Verena was not the type to stir the waters without cause; when she acted,it meant the stakes were high.



Her lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes carrying the weight of hesitation as she studied him. Sherwood, to her, was little more than a stranger without any bond of affection. Yet to Luis, Sherwood stood as a venerable elder who the Sampson family owed a debt of gratitude to.



Years of trust had cemented Luis' regard for him. For Verena to cast suspicion on Sherwood now was like tossing a stone into still water-it would be difficult for Luis to accept.



But the matter at hand touched upon the safety of the entire Sampson Group, and Luis could not be left in the dark.



Taking in a steady breath, Verena looked at him with solemn resolve. "Luis, what I'm about to say may overturn your view of Sherwood completely.You must be ready."
 Confusion flickered in Luis' eyes.


Verena paused, and then pressed on. "I've been digging into many things lately and discovered that Sherwood's gestures may hide deeper motives. Luis,have you ever considered that his generosity toward us might be nothing more than a carefully laid trap?That everything was meant to serve some hidden agenda?"



Luis lifted the cup of coffee,but her words froze him in place.
The porcelain halted midway, his eyes sharpening as the calm surface gave way to keen vigilance.



His brows knitted together.



Placing the cup back down, he studied Verena closely,realizing there was no jest in her tone.


He held his silence for a long beat.


Finally, he spoke, his voice tinged with unease."Verena,could this be a misunderstanding?"



A pause, and then he continued, "Sherwood has done so much for our family. If what you say were true, then when you vanished and Sampson Group teetered on the edge of ruin, why would he step forward to help me rebuild?"



By now, Verena was over six months into her pregnancy. The discomfort of sitting too long pressed on her, and she shifted, preparing to stand.


Luis rose to steady her, but she waved him off,pushing herself up. With one hand on her lower back,the other resting protectively on her rounded belly,she started pacing slowly.



"Of course he would step forward. Because the storm then was not truly fatal. It was a setback, not the end of the road. The real problem was that our father, consumed by grief, had no will to run the company.That opened the door for chaos. But think carefully,Luis."



She halted suddenly, turning to meet his eyes head-on. "If Sampson Group had truly been pushed to the brink, even in despair, Dad would have clenched his teeth and shouldered the responsibility for the sake of the family's legacy."



Verena resumed pacing, her tone deliberate and measured. "If I were Sherwood, I too would have intervened before a fatal collapse. By doing so, l'd gain gratitude, secure trust, and position myself to rightfully insert influence into the company. Step by step,I could then consume it."



Her lips curved into a cold, ironic smile. "And what's more-by helping in crisis, he avoids suspicion. No one questions a hand that rescues. He must have calculated that you, Luis, are a man who never forgets a grudge and always repays kindness. That's why he's managed to extend his reach into every corner of Sampson Group without resistance."



Luis listened, his expression darkening like clouds before rain.



Yet years of walking both the straight road and shadowed alleys had taught him caution; he quickly reined in his emotions. Drawing a long breath, he steadied his tone. "Verena,do you have evidence for this?"



As though anticipating the question, Verena remained composed. She returned to his side, reaching for the laptop she had brought.


With practiced motion, she powered it on, sliding in a USB drive loaded with information.



The screen glowed, casting a cold light across their faces,making the moment all the more grave.



"These," she explained, pointing at the complex charts and figures, "are the connections I've uncovered regarding the investors who purchased Sampson Group's shares."



Her voice was even, precise. "Luis, you've been rooted in Ochrerayd for years, with deep ties and broad resources. If you dig into this further, it will be far easier for you than it was for me, and your findings will cut deeper."



She straightened slightly, meeting his gaze with unshaken sincerity. "If you doubt me, then investigate yourself. I'm not showing you this to force belief, but to let you see who holds those shares and how their ties weave together."



Luis' lips pressed into a thin, firm line as his eyes scanned the tangled web displayed on the screen, a chill  settling in his gaze. Noticing it, Verena frowned faintly, worry flickering across her features. "Though we lack ironclad proof of Sherwood's malice, caution is still the wiser course.The Sampson business empire is large and prosperous -such trees always draw the wind. We must keep our guard up."


Luis let out a soft sigh.


He looked at her with gentle warmth, his tone colored by brotherly affection. "Verena, it isn't that I doubt you. You've always had a clear head, and I respect that.But Sherwood has stood beside our family for so long-it's difficult to imagine he could be what you suggest."


A pause, and then he conceded, "Still, you're right.The human heart is a riddle, and in business,vigilance is worth more than trust. Rest assured, I'll take this matter into my own hands and not let it drift away.From this moment on, I will keep a sharper eye on Sherwood."
###Chapter 325 Waiting For You At The Hotel
Verena nodded in agreement. "That's for the best."


Watching her, Luis felt a tug of sorrow in his chest.


He was proud of her sharp intelligence, yet his pride was shadowed by regret that she had to shoulder such tangled affairs at so young an age.


Luis reached out, gently ruffling Verena's hair. His voice was deep, carrying warmth like an anchor in stormy seas. "I brought you back home to be the jewel of this family-carefree, radiant, and smiling each day. Not burdened with these thorny matters."



As he spoke, his gaze drifted unconsciously to Verena's rounded bely. Tenderness welled up in his eyes, soft as dawn. "Especially now, when you're carrying life within you,you mustn't wear yourself thin.Trust me-let me carry the weight of these troubles."



Verena understood his concern, but her spirit rebelled against passivity.



"Luis, I'm not one who lives by leaning on others."Her tone grew firm. "This is our home. How could I turn a blind eye to the family's matters?" Luis felt a tide of both pride and appreciation rising for her.



He nodded slowly. "You're right."


Then, with a playful glimmer, he tapped her nose."You're too clever for your own good. In such little time, you've peeled back layers of the company's secrets and sensed the cracks beneath the surface.Even I can't help but admire you."



Verena shook her head, a gentle smile curving her lips."Luis, this time you're giving me too much credit."



She tilted her head slightly, the smile brightening her features. "You know my roots lie in medicine. It was Isaac who noticed something amiss with Sherwood and warned me. I merely followed the thread and,after no small effort, uncovered what you see."



Seeing the shadow cross Luis' face, Verena quickly added, "But don't worry. Though Isaac knows, he won't cross into Sampson Group's affairs. And of course,I'll keep my own boundaries clear."


Luis chuckled softly and patted her shoulder. "I don't doubt that. Isaac is a man of pride and standing-he wouldn't meddle where he doesn't belong.Besides-"His lips curled teasingly as he continued, "Anyone can see he's utterly smitten with you." Then,as though catching a darker thought, Luis' eyes narrowed,his voice sharpening. "But don't mistake me for a fool to be played with. If Isaac ever dared to betray you or tried to prey upon the Sampson family business, I would not stand idly by."


Noticing the shift in topic, Luis steered the conversation back, his gaze softening. "Anyway,Verena,let those things rest."



He placed a careful hand on her belly, his touch light with reverence. "What matters most now is that you care for yourself and the little life growing inside you.I'm already waiting for the day I can hold my nephew or niece."



As their conversation flowed,her phone on the table lit up with a new message.



Verena picked it up and let out a quiet laugh.


It was from Miranda. "Sweetheart, help me send Luis a message. Tell him I'm waiting at Serenity Hotel."


Verena cast a sidelong glance at Luis, who was engrossed in his work, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.



She lowered her eyes and typed swiftly. "Why ddon't you message him yourself? I have no wish to sit and watch your love games." Hardly had the screen dimmed when it chimed again.



Unlocking it, she found herself faced with Miranda's reply.



"Who asked you to watch? Last time I let you off without charge. I was practically a saint."


Verena muttered under her breath,"A saint? More like a fox."



But then,the next message made her raise an eyebrow.



"You think I wouldn't message him directly? He blocked me."



Her eyes flickered instinctively toward Luis, and then back to the phone.



Her attention darted between the man and the screen,quickening with each second.



In truth, from the first chime of her phone and her stifled giggles, Luis had been stealing glances from the corner of his eye.



Now, seeing her gaze brimming with uncontained curiosity, suspicion stirred in him.



Luis paused in his work, raised his head, and cleared his throat softly. "What did she say to you?" Verena arched a brow, eyes gleaming with mischief as she held up her phone. "She said she's lonely tonight and waiting for you at Serenity Hotel. And if you don't go,she'll find another man to share her evening."



Miranda's actual words had been far simpler-Verena had embroidered them with bold strokes of her own.



Rarely indulging in such playful pranks, she found sheer delight in the little trick.


Luis' eyelids twitched. He calmly turned away, but his furrowed brows betrayed him.



An uneasy current rippled through him, unsettling thoughts he could not quite name.



After a beat of silence, his voice grew low. "Did she truly say that?"



Seeing his reaction, Verena laughed inwardly but kept her expression calm. With feigned innocence, she nodded. "Absolutely true. Anyway, I've delivered the message, and I've said what I needed to. Luis, I'll leave you to your work."



Suppressing her smile, she gathered her laptop and slipped out of the office.



Luis pressed his lips together, made no move to stop her, and turned back to his papers. On the surface, it was as though her words were a passing breeze that left not a ripple in his heart.



Yet, when the afternoon meeting arrived,he made several uncharacteristic mnistakes with the data.



As dusk approached, golden light spilled through the window, setting his desk aglow.



Luis sat mid-signature when his pen suddenly sputtered and dried.



He tried scribbling on a blank page, but only pale scratches marked the paper.



Frowning,he tossed the pen aside, the sharp sound echoing in the quiet.


Leaning back, a tightness coiled in his chest.



He tugged at his tie, as though loosening it might untangle the knot in his breath.



For a long moment, silence hung heavy around him.Then, drawing in a deep breath, he pressed the intercom. When the line clicked open, his voice was steady,resolute. "Patrick, prepare the car."
###Chapter 326 Strictly Business Today
Luis' voice carried an urgency that broke through his usual calm, like a storm cloud suddenly splitting a clear sky.



Patrick noticed Luis' uncharacteristic tone but dared not probe, quickly replying, "Yes, Mr. Sampson, the car will be ready shortly."


Luis ended the call, rose to his feet, and strode toward the office door.



His steps were brisk, and in his haste, the edge of his folder struck the desk corner with a sharp sound-yet he seemed blind to it.



Less than half an hour later, the car rolled to a smooth halt at the grand entrance of Serenity Hotel.


The doorman hurried forward, opening the door with practiced ease.


Luis stepped out and entered the lobby, his tall,upright figure mirrored on the gleaming marble floor,polished enough to double as glass.


 
Heads turned as he passed, but no one dared approach the aura of distance he carried.


At the reception desk,Luis leaned slightly forward,his brows faintly knitted. "Which room is Miranda Brown staying in?"



Miranda had already made arrangements. The receptionist, after a quick search, gave a professional smile and reported crisply, "Mr. Sampson, Miss Brown is in Room 1608."



Luis inclined his head in acknowledgment, murmured thanks, and turned toward the elevator.



Inside,he pressed the button.



As the numbers above flickered toward his destination,his Adam's apple shifted with a trace of unease.



When the elevator doors slid open, he stepped onto the corridor and halted at Room 1608. He raised his hand and pressed the bell.


The chime rang clearly in the silent hallway, yet nearly a minute ticked by without reply.



A thought stirred in his mind, his brow twitching faintly.


Steeling himself, he was about to find staff for a keycard when the sound of the lock clicked behind him.



He turned-and there was Miranda, framed in the doorway.


Her hair was half-dry, loose strands clinging lightly to her cheeks, an air of unstudied ease about her.



She wore a champagne silk robe, its sheen soft under the light, the collar carelessly open to show a glimpse of her collarbone.



The hem skimmed her knees, leaving her calves gracefully bare.



Luis' throat moved of its own accord, his lips parting to speak-yet Miranda was quicker. "Sorry, I was in the shower and didn't hear you at first. Come in, and shut the door behind you."



With that,she turned and walked back inside.



Luis hesitated a heartbeat, and then followed.



His eyes swept the room discreetly.


On the sofa lay a neatly folded blanket, untouched.


On the coffee table, a few books lay open beside a steaming cup of coffee.



It seemed no one else had come in here.



"Here I sit, a dazzling woman in plain view, and you didn't spare me a glance when you walked in. That  stings a little, you know," Miranda teased, feigning a wounded tone.



At that, Luis finally let his gaze rest on her.


She had settled on the bed, hands resting lightly at her sides,legs crossed to reveal slender ankles.



Her posture was languid yet magnetic,drawing the eye without effort.



As she shifted, the silk robe slid from her shoulder,revealing a patch of smooth skin.



Miranda tilted her head,lips curved into a teasing smile,her gaze steady on Luis, unashamed in its allure.



Luis' breath faltered, his heartbeat stumbling against its rhythm.



Verena had been right-Miranda was a fox in plain sight.


The memory of Verena's words stirred a brief flash of irritation in his eyes.



He stepped forward, stopping before Miranda.



His tall frame loomed as he bent slightly, eyes locking with hers. Sparks flickered there, shadowed,making his feelings difficult to read. His lips parted, voice low, edged with teasing yet probing, "Miss Brown, I heard you were so lonely tonight that if I didn't come, you'd find another man instead?"



What nonsense was that?



Miranda blinked in surprise, innocence shining in her clear eyes. "I only asked you to come meet me at the hotel. I never said anything like that."



The silence that followed spoke volumes-both realized Verena's words had been stretched beyond truth.



Miranda was the first to recover, breaking into laughter. "I should thank my dear friend for giving events a little push."



She lifted her chin, eyes sparkling with mischief,her tone languid yet provocative. "So, Mr. Sampson, did you rush here out of jealousy? Seems you care for me more than you admit."



Her slender fingers slid along his tie, brushing lightly against his Adam's apple, a touch both casual and deliberate.



A shiver shot through him, and a faint haze dimmed his sharp gaze. So close,he caught the mingled scent of her shower gel and her own fragrance-subtle yet intoxicating.



Luis instinctively tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear,his Adam's apple bobbing as his gaze deepened.


He didn't answer, but his hand tilted her chin gently as he leaned closer, as if to claim her lips.



Miranda's eyes sparkled with amusement; deftly,she leaned back, dodging him.



His lips brushed her cheek instead, leaving a warm trace on her skin.



The primal tide within him surged, and the brief setback only fanned the flames.



He pressed a hand lightly on her shoulder,easing her back onto the bed.



Miranda sank into the mattress, its softness cradling her form as her hair spread across the silk sheets like a painter's stroke.


Luis leaned over, his body caging hers, his stance unmistakably assertive.



His long leg shifted, knee naturally parting her own,his hands planted firmly on either side, veins taut.



The silence thickened, broken only by the drum of  their heartbeats.



As he drew closer, breath against breath, Miranda's lips curled into a sly smile.



With a swift motion, she snatched the folder on the bed and pressed it against his chest, triumph flickering in her eyes. "Sorry, Mr. Sampson. Strictly business today-no body talk."


Luis froze for a heartbeat, caught off guard, the embers of desire still smoldering in his gaze.
###Chapter 327 What's Your Condition
After a brief silence, a flicker of complexity danced across Luis' face.



He straightened, his movements slightly stiff, legs parted just enough to ease the tension running through him.



Reaching for an unopened bottle of water on the coffee table, his long fingers tightened with a crisp click as he twisted the cap open.



Tilting his head back, he drank deeply.


The chill of the water slid down his throat, quelling the heat that had surged in his chest like a fire meeting the sea.



He didn't stop until only a third of the bottle was left,and then screwed the cap on again and placed it neatly back in its spot.



Leaning into the sofa, he crossed one leg over the other, clasping his fingers loosely on his knee,instantly regaining the composed air of a seasoned businessman With a slight raise of his brow, he fixed his gaze on Miranda, the faintest spark of interest flickering in his eyes. "Go on. What kind of cooperation?"



When Luis rose earlier, Miranda had quietly returned to sitting on the edge of the bed, fastening the robe that had slipped open.


She picked up the folder beside her, flipped through its contents, and then lifted her head to meet his gaze.


Carefree as she often was, her eyes sharpened whenever work came into play.



"According to our research, you've long harbored ambitions of expanding into Clokron."



She paused, studying the unreadable calm on Luis ' face before pressing on. "To be frank, Mr. Sampson,our company has been preparing this collaboration with you for quite some time."


Her lashes lowered for a beat, and then rose with a practiced smile. "We've pored over your past strategies and achievements. Your business acumen and methods are praised highly across the industry,and we truly admire them."



Those words were not empty flattery; they mirrored Miranda's genuine thoughts. "That's why our company is eager to partner with you,to explore new markets side by side. And conveniently,you are setting your sights on Clokron's entertainment sector, aren't you?"



Luis lifted his eyelids slightly, watching her with quiet intent.



In their previous encounters, she had always carried a devil-may-care attitude, a woman untamed and free as the wind.



But today, her manner bore an unfamiliar weight.



The corner of Luis' lips curved faintly, ripples of intrigue stirring beneath his calm.


He leaned against the sofa, fingertips drumming a steady rhythm on the armrest.


After a moment, his low voice broke the silence."Oh?Then tell me-what advantages do you bring?"



Miranda leaned forward, her tone delberate. "Our company is prepared to invest fully. We possess both deep financial reserves and a professional team, able to provide complete support for your Clokron venture." Luis chuckled quietly, shaking his head. "Miss Brown,do you really think Sampson Group is short of investors?" His voice carried depth and a slight upward lilt, the unshakable pride of a man who knew his worth.



And indeed, Sampson Group stood as a giant in the business world-money had never been their stumbling block.



As a bargaining chip, investment alone was hardly persuasive.


Yet, even as he dismissed her offer, his gaze remained steady on Miranda, as though anticipating her next card.



Miranda, unruffled, smiled with quiet determination.



"What if our investment takes the form of prime real estate in Clokron-land perfectly suited for entertainment projects? Would you still decline, Mr.Sampson?"


A subtle shift crossed Luis' features. He knew well what she meant-land considered gold in the industry,its value beyond dispute.



Sensing his brief hesitation, Miranda's lips curved as she pressed on. "You know the worth of that land.We already hold the development rights.What we need is a partner with vision-like you."


Luis gave a faint, knowing smile. "Miss Brown, that land  is no simple prize. To secure those rights must have cost you dearly. And I don't believe in gifts without a price tag."



He paused,voice lowering. "So, what's your condition?"


Miranda tilted her head, a mysterious smile lingering as her slender fingers tapped lightly against the bedsheet, the rhythm faintly enticing.


"The condition..." Her eyes misted with flirtation,her words trailing into the air like smoke.


Luis narrowed his gaze, sensing a snare hidden behind her softness.



Their eyes locked, neither willing to yield.


The air grew thick-half business, half something far more dangerous.


At last, Luis shifted his gaze, as though refusing to be caught in her net.



He reached up to loosen his tie, but before he could speak,Miranda's silken voice slipped in,teasing yet firm."Be my sexual partner-for a year."



Luis froze mid-motion. He had expected a scheme,but not this audacious demand.



"Sexual partner?" he repeated softly, his tongue  pressing against his cheek, the subtle gesture betraying the irritation hidden beneath his calm.


Inside,emotions collided in chaos, yet outwardly he remained steady as stone.


Sliding a hand into his suit pocket, he retrieved a cigarette, the action smooth and deliberate.


With a snap, the lighter's flame rose, casting light into his shadowed eyes.


He drew in deeply, smoke curling in his chest, the sting of nicotine granting him momentary calm.


Exhaling slowly, a ring of smoke drifted upward,darkening his gaze all the more.


"Miss Brown, you must be truly lonely," Luis said, his voice low and laced with biting irony. "What, no man in Clokron to keep you company?"


He leaned back lazily, cigarette in hand, smoke veiling his face in shifting patterns.



Miranda raised her chin, her eyes locked on his.



He sat in the glow of warm light, his sharp features carved into shadow and brilliance alike.



His slender fingers cradled the cigarette with practiced ease, the smoke curling upward, shrouding him in a  dangerous sort of allure.



Once,Miranda thought she disliked men who smoked.



But now she realized-it wasn't smoking she despised,only the wrong men holding the cigarette.



Shrewd as always, she sensed the probing beneath Luis' sarcasm. She only smiled, refusing to take the bait.



"Well, Mr. Sampson, you needn't worry I'll stray. I don't juggle two men at once."



She stretched out her words with playful intent, her gaze drifting over him, teasing just enough to keep him guessing.
###Chapter 328 | Won't Be Bought Into Your Bed Fo r...
Miranda's vague reply slipped under Luis' skin, pulling at emotions he thought he had buried.



A slight crease formed between his brows as his mind drifted back to the memory of their very first encounter.



He had traveled to Clokron back then, attending a lavish corporate party.


The ballroom sparkled under crystal chandeliers, with guests clinking glasses and trading polite laughter.



When the event began winding down, Luis,buzzed from too much wine, decided to retreat to his suite for some rest.



Halfway down the corridor, he crossed paths with a woman approaching from the opposite side.


Her silhouette alone commanded attention, the sleek gown hugging her waist and drawing the eye to her long,elegant legs.


Each step made the waves of her hair bounce lightly against her shoulders, a picture of quiet grace. Luis had already noticed her earlier that evening,when someone pointed her out to him-Miranda Brown, CEO of AuroraNexus.



Following that introduction, his gaze had lingered on her more than once.



With a glass of wine in hand, she had stood among a group, laughing brightly, her gestures animated.


Her smile lit her face, eyes sparkling with confidence,every tilt of her head drawing attention.



The rose-red dress she wore had only made her shine brighter.


It wasn't just her beauty that struck Luis, though.


What captivated him most was the fact that she had claimed the role of CEO at such a young age,building AuroraNexus into something formidable before most people her age had even found their footing.


Climbing to the top of the corporate ladder at such a young age, and steering a company ranked among the world's elite,was nothing short of extraordinary.



Wanting to be polite, Luis slowed his steps, ready to offer her a courteous greeting.



But what happened next caught him completely off  guard.



Miranda's stride wavered, and she stumbled slightly toward him, her cheeks tinted with a rosy flush and her eyes hazy.


Before he could steady her, her hand darted out and seized his tie, tugging with a boldness that was both playful and provocative.



The unexpected pull made him lean forward,dragged by the force of her grip.



She leaned in close, her breath tinged with wine as her sultry voice slipped between them. "Mr. Sampson,I've been watching you for a while. Stay with me tonight,won't you?"



Luis' first instinct had been to step back, but the lilt of her voice and the gleam in her eyes left him unmoored.



Whether it was the alcohol clouding his head or the allure of her gaze, he let himself falter, falling into her spell far too easily.



That was how it all began-the very first time.



And now, as her tempting words echoed in his memory, Luis recognized with a jolt that he was standing on the edge of the same mistake, seconds away from being ensnared again. When Verena had mentioned Miranda would reach out to another man if he didn't show up, a pang of inexplicable irritation had struck deep, tightening something inside his chest.



It caused him to make mistakes in meetings and hurry to the hotel once he left work in the evening.



The moment he walked into the room, his eyes had darted nervously around, searching without even realizing it.



Looking back on it, every awkward move he had made seemed almost ridiculous.



Luis mocked himself silently-because to Miranda, he had been nothing more than a fleeting distraction.



Smoke curled from the end of Luis' cigarette as he drew in deeply, his chest rising and falling in steady rhythm.



Across the room, Miranda reclined against the pillows,her eyes studying him with a mix of curiosity and amusement.



When the silence stretched on too long, she parted her lips to press him for an answer-only for Luis to snuff out the cigarette and flick it into the ashtray with finality. He rose to his full height and cut a striking figure as he crossed the space between them, his steps slow and deliberate.



He halted right before her, his stare locked onto hers while his hand tugged at the edge of her robe,exposing the curve of her body with calculated precision.



Her lips lifted into a confident smile; she was certain she had him where she wanted.



But instead of surrender, Luis leaned close,his breath warm against her skin as he spoke in a low, deliberate tone. "Yes, Sampson Group intends to expand abroad.But money isn't our problem. So do yourself a favor,Miss Brown, and drop that idea. I am still the head of Sampson Group, and I won't be bought into your bed for business."



The idea of becoming one of her casual flings filled him with raw anger.



Without another word, Luis turned sharply and strode toward the door.



Watching him leave, Miranda's smile flickered, and then stretched wider before it spilled into unrestrained laughter that echoed through the empty suite.



No matter how carefully he tried to shield himself , she  had seen it-the faint shift in his eyes when she toyed with the words "sexual partner."



From that instant forward, Luis had been trying to hold back his irritation, and his reaction thrilled Miranda.



A spark of satisfaction lit inside her-winning him might take time, but it was far from impossible.


Her eyes slid toward the door, the faint arch of her brows revealing amusement and intent.


Luis was a puzzle she meant to solve, a prize she fully intended to claim.


In her mind, men were best kept dangling, always chasing,never certain.


And of course, she would never admit to him that he was the only man she had ever allowed close enough to touch her.







Verena's journey to Ochrerayd was planned with purpose rather than haste. Suspecting Sherwood of betrayal,she knew she had to move decisively.


After finishing breakfast with her parents, she gathered her things and stepped outside.



The family driver already had the car waiting at the  curb.



Once she slid into the back seat, she instructed, "Take me to Benedict Pharmaceuticals."



With a polite nod, the driver answered, "Yes, ma'am."


Two days earlier, the announcement of her appointment at Benedict Pharmaceuticals had spread in the company.



Today marked her first official appearance, and anticipation buzzed through the company halls.


Employees clustered in small groups, trading observations and hushed theories while trying to make sense of what was happening.


A group of young employees gathered in the break room,their voices low with curiosity and speculation.


"I heard Mr. Sampson's giving his new sister full control of the company. Imnagine landing a position like that. Why can't fortune ever smile on me like that?"


"No kidding. And isn't she supposed to be around our age?"



"Let's hope she actually knows what she's doing. If she fails, it's our jobs on the line."


"She'll have to prove herself fast. The veterans here  won't make it easy, especially with Molly keeping watch."



"Doesn't matter. We should just mind our own work.What the higher-ups do isn't for us to worry about."



The chatter carried on, unchecked, and no one noticed footsteps pause outside the break room.

Molly had overheard enough. Without a word, she straightened her posture and continued briskly down the corridor.
###Chapter 329 Take Office



Inside the manager's office, Molly looked ready to explode, her face as dark as thunderclouds and her chest rising sharply with every breath. Her fists pressed hard against her hips as if anchoring her fury.



Her eyes landed on the stack of neatly arranged files sitting on the desk, and a wave of hot resentment rushed through her veins.



With a violent sweep of her arm, she sent the documents and folders crashing to the floor, the sound echoing against the walls.


Although she had received the news in advance and mentally prepared herself for this moment, it did nothing to dull the rage twisting inside her.


"Verena,do you really think you can waltz in here and steal everything I've worked for?"



A sharp knock came from the other side of the door,breaking her tirade. Her assistant's cautious voice followed. "Miss Kirk, 'the new CEO has just arrived at the building."



The news forced Molly to draw in a deep breath,fighting to pull her emotions back under control. She lifted her hand to smooth her hair,checking quickly in the mirror that she still looked every inch the composed, glamorous manager.



When she finally opened the door, she had already arranged her lips into a calm, practiced smile. "I understand," she said evenly.


Before stepping out, she gestured back toward the mess on the floor. "I knocked something over earlier.Make sure it's cleaned up."



The assistant dipped her head quickly. "Yes. I'll handle it right away."



At the entrance of Benedict Pharmaceuticals,Verena's arrival immediately drew attention. The security guard straightened his stance, giving her a subtle nod of respect, while the receptionist hurried forward, all smiles. "Mrs. Bennett, let me escort you upstairs."



Verena acknowledged with a small nod. "I appreciate it."



She stepped into the waiting elevator, and when the doors slid open at her floor, the quiet hum of the office shifted.



The noise by the entrance drew the staff's attention.Some watched out of pure curiosity. Others whispered among themselves. A few eyed the scene with obvious skepticism.



Verena didn't let it faze her. She strode into the office,looking calm and in control.



She offered the employees a small, polite nod.When someone met her eyes, she answered with a steady smile that showed confidence but didn't come off as overbearing.


As Verena walked down the hall, she spotted Molly and her group heading toward her.



After that talk about Luis, Molly had stopped acting friendly whenever Verena was around.



Molly wore a polite smile, but she kept her distance.



Once she got close enough, she dipped her head and spoke in a gentle voice. "Welcome, Mrs. Bennett," said Molly.



Molly would've preferred to use a different tone,but she had to keep things professional.


A hint of a smile flickered across Verena's face.



Stepping forward with surprising energy, a round-faced man broke out in an enthusiastic grin. His voice rang out, warm and theatrical. "At last, Mrs. Bennett!We've been waiting for you to grace us with your  presence!"



Molly quickly spoke up. "Let me introduce you. This is Jared Frederick, our deputy general manager."


Jared seized the moment, his words flowing with practiced ease. "Your arrival means great things for us,Mrs. Bennett. I hope I can arrange a dinner soon,perhaps with you and Miss Kirk?"


His usual grin never faltered, and his eyes shone with obvious admiration.



Deep down, Jared had little faith in Verena's actual abilities. In his mind, her success came down to her blood ties with the Sampson family.


But Luis' influence carried weight. Staying on Verena's good side could only help his own chances for a promotion or a pay raise.


That thought seemed to animate him even more,his smile stretching wide, the lines by his eyes deepening with eagerness.



Verena held onto her composed smile, but her gaze sharpened in an instant.


She picked up on his hidden agenda right away.



A cold stare met Jared before Verena replied,her tone steady, "I didn't come here for dinners or  pleasantries. Let's keep our attention on the job.There's no need to waste time on distractions."



Jared's grin faltered. He straightened his back, and a hint of discomfort flashed across his face.



Turning to address the team, Verena spoke with unwavering clarity. "If we want this company to move forward, it'll take hard work, not meal invitations. Let's concentrate on business and show what we're capable of. That's what real responsibility looks like."


Every word landed with weight, giving no one a chance to second-guess her intent.


Whether they meant it or not, the employees responded together, "Of course, Mrs. Bennett," they said,voices falling in line.



Color drained from Jared's face. He managed a nervous laugh and said, "You're absolutely right, Mrs.Bennett. I'll stay focused on work from now on."



Molly lingered nearby, watching everything play out.The smallest trace of amusement appeared in her eyes.


To her, Verena was putting on a show. She believed that once Verena was confronted with the mess behind the scenes, she'd realize things weren't so simple. Verena swept her gaze over the group before giving a brief nod. "If we're all on the same page, there's no reason to stand around. You can all get back to your work now."



One by one, everyone voiced their agreement and quietly drifted back to their desks.



"Could you point me to the CEO's office, Miss Kirk?"Verena asked, her tone even.



The title caught Molly off guard. She hesitated for a split second, an irritated glint in her eyes before she quickly covered it up.



She motioned down the hallway. "It's at the very end,"said Molly.



Without taking her eyes off Molly, Verena nodded."Walk with me. I want you there," she said.


Although Molly clearly wasn't thrilled,she mustered a smile and answered, "Of course."



Together, they headed down the corridor, moving in step toward the office.


Verena opened the door, stepping into a bright,spacious room.



Sunlight poured through a wall of windows, spilling onto pale walls and modern hanging lights.


A glossy, dark wood desk took center stage, so perfectly kept it looked untouched.



A black leather chair sat behind the desk. To the side,a pair of pale gray sofas with colorful pillows brought some warmth to the otherwise sleek space.



Moving with quiet confidence, Verena circled the desk and settled into the executive chair.



Her gaze met Molly's. With a tone that was gentle but left no room for refusal, Verena said,"Miss Kirk,have a seat."



She gestured to the chair opposite her.


Not sure what to expect, Molly kept her smile in place,though tension lingered at the edges of her expression. She crossed the room, keeping her composure.


Settling into the chair, Molly folded her hands and let her fingertips drift over her lap in small, distracted motions.



Questions swirled through her mind. Would Verena start criticizing her again? Would she bring up Luis and insist he never cared for her? Those worries faded as Verena spoke up from the other side of the desk. "There's no need to be on edge. I'm not here to make things difficult. I just want to get a sense of how things work around here. You've been with the company longer than I have,so l figured you'd have the inside scoop," said Verena.


Despite her own doubts about Molly's past friendly behavior and her willingness to speak badly of Miranda,Verena drew a clear line between personal grudges and work matters. In this office, only business was up for discussion.



A look of surprise flickered across Molly's face. She assumed Verena would take time to get her bearings,maybe even try to charm her way into the team.


But Verena wasted no time. She'd barely taken her seat and already wanted to talk shop.


That realization left Molly with a knot of emotion.



Most of it was irritation. Verena's determination to seize control made Molly feel invisible, like her years at the company meant nothing.


She pressed her lips together and gave a slight nod."If you want to know how things run here, I'll fill you in,"said Molly, her voice measured.
###Chapter 330 Latest Project



Verena leaned in, her elbows settling on the desk as she laced her fingers together. Her steady gaze radiated a sense of unwavering professionalism.


"I want to really get a feel for how things are running across the company," said Verena. "Let's start with each department. Fill me in on what everyone's responsible for and how the teams are structured."



She glanced at Molly and continued, "I'm also curious about how everyone's doing at work, not just the day -to-day, but the atmosphere too. Teamwork and morale matter a lot for our growth."



Her eyes sharpened as she added, "I'd like a breakdown of where most of our customers are coming from-both the industries and the regions.That's going to be key for planning out our next moves in the market."



Verena leaned back, her tone becoming gentler."I know that's a lot to cover, so there's no rush to give me everything now. Just take your time and put together a thorough report. When it's ready, send it over so I can review all the details carefully."



Molly managed a polite smile and answered in a low  voice, "Understood."


Verena spun her pen between her fingers, her gaze thoughtful. "One more thing-what are the top projects we're working on right now? How are they progressing? Have we run into any big problems lately?"


Molly hesitated at first, but honesty won out as she replied, "Because of the spike in flu cases this season,we've created a new treatment. It's almost ready for release-just a few last steps before it hits the shelves."



Verena offered a quiet nod. "The flu making the rounds this year isn't like the old ones. People are dealing with more than just coughs and fevers-muscle aches have become a real problem. This new formula should help with that specifically."



She lifted her head, her eyes focused. "So, what do the latest clinical trials show? Does the new medication actually relieve these symptoms? Have we encountered any setbacks or complications in development?"



Distracted thoughts flickered across Molly's face, but when she looked up and met Verena's eyes, she forced herself to stay focused.



She gave a nod before saying,"The early results from the clinical trials turned out better than expected. The data strongly support the drug's safety and how well it  works. Production is already lined up, and both the packaging and marketing efforts are moving along without a hitch. As soon as we get through the last stage of approval, we'll be ready to roll it out into the market."



She paused, sneaking a look at Verena, who seemned deep in thought, her brow slightly creased in concentration.



A flicker of doubt crossed her mind, but Molly quickly composed herself. "You can count on this. The whole team has poured their energy into bringing this medication to life. From the earliest stages of research right through to clinical testing, we've given every detail our full attention. I promise, there won't be any mistakes."



Verena regarded her in silence for a heartbeat, and then allowed a gentle smile to form. "Thank you, Miss Kirk. I see how hard everyone's been working. I trust your judgment, and I'm excited to see the launch go smoothly. That's all for now. Please continue with your day."



Relief washed over Molly as she got up, maintaining a steady, confident smile. "You have my word. I'll be on top of everything, every step of the way."



Without another word, she slipped out of the office. When the door clicked shut, the smile faded from Verena's face,replaced by a thoughtful stillness.



She leaned back, letting the leather chair turn toward the sprawling cityscape outside the window.


Towering buildings lined the busy streets, cars moving in endless streams far below.



A faint frown touched her brow as she drifted deep into her own thoughts.


With her background in medicine, Verena understood just how many hurdles stood between a promising compound and a finished product. Every new drug traveled a difficult path-from experiments in the lab,through rounds of testing on patients, all the way to the daunting stage of market approval.


There was no illusion that any of this would be easy.


Earlier, Verena had fired off three sharp questions, one after the other. Molly's answers to the first two were sharp and on point, each word careful and deliberate.


But when the conversation shifted to the setbacks and complications in development, Molly's response grew vague,her words skirting around the heart of the issue.


Was Molly dismissing those challenges as trivial? Or was she keeping something out of sight,maybe even "You got it, Mrs. Bennett," said Zeke, his tone crisp and steady.




...



As evening painted the city in neon colors, Verena sat in the back of the car, her face set in deep concentration. The world outside the window was just a blur as her thoughts spun.



A moment later, Zeke's figure appeared on the sidewalk. He rapped his knuckles softly against the glass.



Jolted from her reverie, Verena lowered the window.



Without a word, Zeke passed her a slim folder.


Verena accepted the file, her eyes scanning the street for signs of prying eyes before she spoke quietly."Was anyone watching?"



If word got out and the drug team had anything to hide, they would waste no time erasing the evidence.Chasing answers would become a nightmare.



Zeke reassured her, saying, "No need to worry,Mrs.Bennett. I picked it up when the place was empty.Nobody saw a thing."



Zeke didn't take the situation lightly. He knew exactly  how fragile Verena's standing in the company had become,and that awareness made him tread carefully with every step he took.



Verena gave a quiet nod and said, "I appreciate what you've done, Zeke."


As the car drifted through the city,streaks of neon spilled over Verena, painting her features in shifting colors.



She flipped open the folder and pulled out a small,sealed bag-inside, the new pills sat untouched and gleaming.



Setting the bag down, she turned to the stack of documents, leafing through page after page while the faint sound of paper echoed inside the car.



With every new line she read, her brow furrowed a little more.


At first glance, the drug's formula looked by-the-book, yet something about the ingredient ratios struck her as odd.



Just reading through the report wasn't enough to put her suspicions to rest.



Verena exhaled quietly, placing the papers aside as her eyes drifted to the unopened packet. Clearly, she would have to dig much deeper.



Back at Sampson Villa,lights glowed brightly into the night.


With Luis away handling business, Verena lingered after dinner, sharing quiet conversation with her parents in the living room.



By the time she slipped back into her room, the clock was already creeping toward ten.


Steam still clung to her skin after a quick shower, and she toweled her hair dry before settling at her desk.The sealed bag lay waiting.


She poured one pill into her palm, rolling it between her fingers, curiosity sharpening her gaze.


Raising it to her nose, she drew in a faint whiff of medicine.



She snapped the pill in half-an even,crisp break that left a fine powder clinging to her fingertips.



Turning the pieces over in her hand, she examined the shade, the consistency, and the grain of the crushed medicine.



A frown began to form, her confusion clear.


For all the fuss over this new formula, it felt oddly  familiar. Everything about it, down to the scent and texture, reminded her of nothing more than ordinary cold medicine.
###Chapter 331 Breaking The Law
With doubts in her mind,Verena grabbed her phone,scrolled through her contacts, and searched for William Cohen's name.



William stood out at her hospital as someone everyone turned to for	answers	about pharmaceuticals. His reputation for dissecting drug formulas and leading groundbreaking research made him the go-to expert.


As soon as the line connected, William's calm voice greeted her. "Evelyn,it's late. Did something happen?"


Verena got straight to the point. "William, I've run into an issue. I'm looking at a pill that's supposed to fight this year's new/ flu, but it reminds me of the usual cold medicine. The project lead keeps saying there's something special about it. Can you tell me if that makes sense?"



William paused to think it over before responding,"Evelyn, I can't give you a clear answer without seeing it for myself. Drug development is full of surprises Even a small tweak in the ingredients or how it's made can completely change how it works." He paused for a moment before adding, "To get to the bottom of it, you'll need proper lab analysis and full testing. That's really the only way to know what this pill is about."



Verena understood right away what she needed to do."William, I'll ship the pills to you first thing tomorrow.Could you take a look and figure out what's actually in them?"



William didn't hesitate. "Of course, Evelyn. Just send them my way, and I'll start testing as soon as they arrive."



When morning came, Verena wrapped the medication with extra care and mailed it off to Shoildon.



She had just finished going over the last file on her desk when her phone chimed. A message from William waited for her.



She tapped it open and found a detailed report,each section neatly labeled.


Inside, she saw crisp photos of the pills, comparison charts next to standard cold medicines, and line after line of technical data.



As Verena reviewed the findings, her concern deepened. "The ingredient ratios in this formula match standard cold medicine, but the only difference is the appearance. There's also a painkiller mixed in that just masks the symptoms, so people feel better for a bit but the illness stays. And on top of that, the pill contains substances that aren't allowed in the market.Some people might experience heart palpitations or dizziness, even if it's rare."



Verena's eyes locked on her phone as she scrolled through the list of problems, and heat flared in her chest. Fury started bubbling up inside her.


The nerve of Molly took her completely by surprise.


She pushed herself up from her chair, moving with determination as she left her office.


Molly lounged at her desk, taking her time with a cup of coffee.



Without warning, the door crashed open. The sound echoed through the office like a clap of thunder.


Molly jolted upright, sloshing hot coffee onto her pants and letting out a sharp yelp.


Staring in disbelief, she met Verena's dark glare from across the room.


Dread washed over her, and she bit back whatever  insult she had been ready to throw.


Trying to cover her irritation, Molly asked, "Mrs.Bennett,what brings you here?"


She set her coffee aside and started dabbing at the stain with a tissue.


Verena stormed across the floor and slammed her phone down in front of Molly.


The screen lit up with William's lab results, impossible to miss.


With her eyes blazing, Verena blurted out, "You call this 'giving every detail your full attention'? Explain this disaster."



Molly's attention flicked to the screen. She only needed a second to realize what she was looking at.


A flicker of anxiety crossed her features before she put on a calm smile and said, a hint of sarcasm in her tone, "So you went behind my back and had the pills analyzed."



Seeing no remorse in Molly's eyes, Verena's stare grew colder,cutting straight through her.


Planting both hands on the desk, she leaned in and shot Molly a glare. "If I hadn't checked the pills myself,I'd still be in the dark about what you've been up to. You're passing off regular cold medicine as some miracle cure? And adding all those extra chemicals-are you even thinking about how dangerous this could be for people?"


Molly met her anger with a slow, dismissive lean,folding her arms and giving her a cold look. "You're making this way bigger than it actually is. The formula works. Patients actually feel relief, so what's the problem? And those so-called extra ingredients?Nobody's dropping dead. If there are any side effects,they're barely worth mentioning."



Verena clenched her jaw as her frustration reached a breaking point.


She straightened up and locked eyes with Molly, her voice cutting through the room as she put weight behind every word. "The review isn't even close to being finished. Do you really believe the pharmaceutical bureau is going to turn a blind eye?Are you seriously treating the entire approval process like it means nothing? A drug with this many issues won't slip through thecracks. Once it's submitted,their experts will tear it apart. And when that happens,we're not just looking at a failed launch. We're talking lawsuits, massive penalties, and damage the company might not recover from."



She fixed Molly with a cold smirk. "Do you really believe your little schemes are going to fool everyone?" A sly grin tugged at Molly's lips. "Fool people? I know exactly what I'm doing. I've got friends at the bureau,so I'm not worried."



The boldness of that statement left Verena stunned for a second. Then she let out a bitter laugh, her voice sharp with contempt. "You actually said that out loud?You're proud of breaking the law? You have guts, but you're risking everything-our patients, our reputation,and the whole company."


Unmoved, Molly just shrugged. "Risk? Come on. We're here to turn a profit, and the truth is, most folks out there won't notice a thing."


She spoke as if they were talking about the weather,her attitude completely relaxed.


For a moment, Verena could hardly believe the naivety in front of her.


Fixing Molly with an unwavering stare, she said, "You might think the average person won't catch on,but there are experts everywhere, and we're not the only pharmaceutical company in Ochrerayd. Our competitors are watching us. Whatever favors you think you can call in, they won't stand a chance when the authorities get involved. The moment this blows up, nobody will have your back, and the company's name will be dragged through the mud. Headquarters will be in chaos when the stocks take a hit because of  your recklessness."


Even after hearing all this, Molly looked unconvinced,acting like Verena was turning a small issue into something much bigger than it really was.


She placed all her faith in the web of contacts she'd built, believing they could smooth over any obstacle.


With an impatient flick of her wrist, she asked, "So tell me, what's your big plan then?"


Without hesitation, Verena's answer was steady and direct. "Shut the project down. Right now."



That order was enough to send Molly flying to her feet,her face a mnask of shock.


"You can't be serious-the team's already put in so much work! Why would you pull the plug now?" Her voice cracked with urgency and disbelief. "Is this really about the company, or do you just want to throw your weight around? What about the effort the team has put into the project? Have you even thought about what this means for everyone involved?"


A sharp smack rang out as Verena's hand hit the desk,rattling papers and sending the coffee cup trembling across the surface.
###Chapter 332 This Project Will Cease At Once
Molly shrank back at the sudden outburst.


Verena shot back, her words sharp as arrows, "What effort? The effort to deceive? Hard work that feeds on lies and bends the law is nothing but empty talk.Even if I stop this project, the only casualty will be the Sampson Group's investment."


Her eyes narrowed, her voice chilled."The employees 'wages will still be honored. Not a single penny of what they deserve will vanish. But their toil must never serve as a mask for your personal profit!"


With those words, Verena pressed a protective hand to her rounded belly and strode swiftly out of the office.



"Zeke, summon everyone tied to this project. An emergency meeting in the conference room-immediately."



Her commanding tone rolled through the corridor like a drumbeat,leaving no room for delay.


Molly's face shifted, and without a second's hesitation,she rushed after Verena. However doubtful the employees were of Verena, she remained Luis' sister, and Zeke was sent here by Luis as well.



When Zeke announced, "Mrs. Bennett has called for an urgent meeting," a shiver of apprehension rippled through the team.


Though suspicion hung in the air, none dared to stall.



Within five minutes, the conference room brimmed with people.


Murmurs buzzed like restless bees, confusion etched on every face.


One whispered, "Could something have gone wrong with the project?"



Another frowned and muttered, "Who knows? She's stirring quite a storm so soon after stepping in."


While debating, their eyes flicked now and then toward the door.


 
"Is everyone here?" Verena entered, walked straight to the head of the table,placed both hands firmly on its surface, leaned forward, and swept a razor-sharp gaze across the room. On her right, Molly sat stiff,jaw tight,fingers clenched until her knuckles paled.



After the nods confirmed attendance, Verena straightened, her tone solemn. "Then I'll get straight to the point. As the one currently responsible for the company,I hereby announce-"


She paused deliberately, locking eyes with their puzzled stares, before declaring, "The new drug project for epidemic flu violates the pharmaceutical bureau's regulations and is steeped in unlawful conduct. Therefore, I have decided this project will cease at once!"



Her words dropped like a stone into a still pond, and silence swallowed the room.



One heartbeat.



Two.



Three.



Then chaos exploded.



The Kirk family had long been secretly developing their power within Sampson Group, so Molly also held sway in Benedict Pharmaceuticals.


At Verena's announcement, her followers could no  longer hold back.


A flushed, middle-aged man leapt up, voice booming."Mrs. Bennett, we've poured so much investment into this! Just when the fruits are ready to be reaped, you want to cut the tree down?"


From the corner, a young man added quickly,"Exactly!If this project succeeds, every one of us could earn a generous bonus. Shutting it down now is like robbing us of our bread and butter!"


His glance slid to Molly, as though awaiting her signal.


Molly reclined slightly, eyes locked on Verena, a faint smirk tugging at her lips.



So what if Verena dared tohalt the project?



The company's resolutions weren't hers alone to dictate; the senior executives held the final vote.


With smug ease, Molly let her gaze sweep the room.



Verena clearly didn't realize that most here had long been in Molly's camp, bound by years of shared profit and loyalty. They were not about to abandon her side.


She sat back, eager to watch Verena stumble in this snare.



A bespectacled man rose, pushing his glasses up with  pointed emphasis, and spoke with mocking disdain."Accusing this project of illegality is no small matter.Such charges require hard evidence, not mere words."



Verena's expression did not waver as she scanned the room.


They resembled startled birds, shouting over each other,their faces flushed with greed.


To them, the company's reputation and future meant little; all they saw was the glitter of potential bonus.


In that moment, Verena saw the truth laid bare:most here were Molly's lackeys.


And beyond Molly stood Sherwood-his silence and indulgence spoke volumes.



He let Molly run wild, likely eyeing the company's throne for himself.


Well,she would never allow it.


Straightening, Verena radiated a power that silenced the noise. Her voice rang with iron. "If you insist on carrying this project forward, then I, as Evelyn, vow this-whether or not rivals expose its flaws,I will ensure the public learns it is a sham."


She paused, her gaze slicing the air like a blade,sending chills down the spines of all who met her  eyes.


"Moreover, I will reveal every irregularity in the research process. Then the world will see you for what you are. And what awaits you will not be a mere loss of profit or reputation-but the heavy hand of the law."



The room froze again, her words hanging heavy in the air.



Seconds ticked before reality dawned, leaving faces pale and eyes wide as if struck by lightning.


Yes-Verena was none other than the famed medical expert Evelyn.


Her name carried weight across the medical world,and every syllable of hers bore authority.



If she spoke, the public would believe.



The project would crumble under the weight of truth,leaving only ruin, disgrace, and endless condemnation.


Worse still-prison bars loomed in their minds.


At this, fear slithered into many hearts, their earlier boldness melting into unease.



Molly watched, seething, as her once-boastful allies shrank back like deflated balloons. Fury surged hot within her.


Molly could no longer sit still.



Once, she had stood unrivaled in the company.Now,before this unexpected "disruptor," she had to grit her teeth. Her pride was choking.



Unable to stay seated, Molly sprang up and strode toward Verena, her words biting. "Mrs. Bennett,are you trying to drag Sampson Group's reputation through the mud?"



Verena,calm as still water, tilted her head slightly and met her glare without flinching. "As the head of Benedict Pharmaceuticals, the power to shape its reputation lies with me-for good or for ill."



Her voice was steady, every word carrying the weight of authority. "In the field of medicine,I stand with an advantage none of you can dispute."



Her eyes swept across Molly, then the room, before concluding, "Now then, let the voting begin."
###Chapter 333 Change Tactics
Verena's words had scarcely settled when the people in the conference room exchanged furtive glances.



Hesitation clouded their eyes, every face painted with inner conflict and contradiction.



Each was secretly weighing the pros and cons. The project promised fat profits, yet the looming shadow of prison was a price none wished to pay.



The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife,leaving everyone restless.


Molly observed coldly, savoring their wavering expressions. A trace of delight curled in her chest.She lifted her chin, a sly smile tugging at her lips, her narrowed eyes glinting with contempt-as though she were already watching Verena tumble from her pedestal.



But just as Molly was about to revel in mocking Verena's boldness, the unexpected struck.



A young man in the front row clenched his teeth, his hand trembling slightly as he slowly raised it. His hoarse voice broke the silence. "I support Mrs.Bennett."



The moment was like the first domino tipping,sparking a chain reaction.



Soon, others summoned courage and lifted their hands as well.


One,two,three...



Hand after hand rose, each one striking Molly like a stinging slap, draining the smile from her face in an instant.



Her complexion turned ashen. Eyes wide, lips trembling,fists clenched tight-her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt nothing. Never had she imagined that those who once obeyed her commands would turn their backs at such a moment.



In this silent duel, the verdict had already been cast by the raised hands.



Verena stood quietly, her gaze steady and resolute,sweeping across the conference room.



Her calm expression radiated confidence, as though she held the reins of fate itself.



"Since everyone agrees with my decision, the project  will cease immediately," Verena said with a slight nod,her lips pressed firmly, her voice sincere. "Rest assured,under my leadership, the company will walk the right path, and your hard work will not go unrewarded."


Her deliberate stress on "right path" echoed in the air.



Molly's face paled, then flushed, her eyes burning with resentment. Rage and unwillingness welled up,yet she had no words to counter.


Verena's gaze brushed lightly over her before settling on the others. "That will be all. The meeting is over-return to your work."


The attendees, all seasoned professionals, quickly grasped the undercurrents.


Without needing further instructions, they sensed the sharp edge of conflict in the room. So, once Verena spoke, they breathed a sigh of relief, rising together and filing out with lowered heads.


One after another, they left-until Molly alone remained.


Biting her lip, eyes blazing with defiance, she fixed her gaze on Verena's retreating figure.


"Bythe way." Verena halted mid-step, turning with composed elegance.Her eyes fell gently on Molly, calm as a still lake."Miss Kirk, don't forget to hand me the files I asked you to organize by day's end."



She raised an eyebrow, a flicker of a smile touching her lips.



With that, she turned and walked away.



Molly sat frozen, her chest rising and faling sharply.



The contrast of their positions-manager versus CEO -stabbed at her pride like a thorn lodged too deep.



Meanwhile, Verena returned to her office. She went straight to her desk, sat down, and drew in a deep breath.



Her fingers rubbed her temples before she reached for her phone and dialed Luis' number.


The call connected swiftly, and Verena wasted no time. "I need to speak to you about Molly. She has been putting personal gain above the company's interests,nearly letting substandard drugs slip into the market. That would not only ruin our reputation but also harm countless lives."



Luis' deep, magnetic voice carried restrained anger."She certainly has nerve." Verena continued, "I exposed the issue in today's meeting and halted the project. But she won't surrender so easily. My plan is to gradually strip her of her authority."



After a pause, Luis replied with measured calm,"Verena, I trust your judgment. Benedict Pharmaceuticals is under your care, and I have every confidence in you. No need to wait for my approval -make the decisions you see fit.Whatever you need,I'll back you."


Verena's lips curved into a soft smile. "Thank you, Luis.With your support, I feel even more assured."



Meanwhile,Molly stormed into her office,kicking the trash bin at her feet.



With a sharp clang, it toppled, spilling its contents across the floor.



Her fury surged; she swept every document off her desk,the papers scattering like fallen leaves.


Collapsing into her chair, she seized her phone and dialed Sherwood's number.



The moment the call connected, her voice cracked with rage and tears. "Dad, you can't imagine how outrageous Verena was today! She utterly disregarded me!" Sherwood's voice, deep and seasoned by years of business storms, came through steady. "Molly, calm yourself. Tell me everything clearly."



She sucked in a sharp breath, her voice sharp as a blade. "Verena openly opposed my project in the meeting. She even swayed everyone to her side,leaving me completely humiliated!"



The more she spoke, the more agitated she became,eyes red and brimming. "Dad, don't forget-we saved the Sampson family! Without us, they wouldn't stand where they are now. Yet Verena dares to treat me this way. How am I supposed to swallow this?"


Sherwood snorted coldly. "I always knew Verena and Isaac would be hard opponents. But heed me-acting rashly inside the company will only work against you."



Leaning back in his leather chair, he scattered fish food into the tank. A swarm of colorful fish darted in frenzy, fighting for each morsel.



He said slowly, "Molly, business is a battlefield where timing and tactics mean everything. It's a game of chess-win with strategy, not impulse. You clashed with her today, and what happened? She turned the tables,leaving you humiliated."



Molly's voice trembled, thick with grievance. "Then what should I do, Dad? Just choke back my pride?" Sherwood's brow furrowed, his tone sharpened."Swallow your pride? Never. But we must change tactics."



Softening slightly, he comforted her, saying "Listen carefully-calm yourself. Don't let Verena sense another move. On the surface, keep working as usual,cooperate where required."



"And then?" Molly pressed, eager.



Sherwood set the fish food aside, leaning back with narrowed eyes that carried a glacial edge. "Leave the rest to me. Trust me-I won't let you suffer."
###Chapter 334 Reaching The Age For Marriage
The night had draped itself over the city like a heavy cloak. After finishing his evening engagements,Sherwood finally returned home.



He eased himself onto the couch and reached for the honey water a servant had thoughtfully prepared,sipping gently as though to clear the cobwebs from his mind.



"Is Molly asleep?" Sherwood asked in a measured tone.


The servant inclined her head and replied with respect,"She came back in the evening and went upstairs after dinner."


Sherwood gave a brief nod. "You may go now."



Acknowledging the order,the servant withdrew quietly.



After a short rest, Sherwood took out his phone and dialed a familiar number.


"Hello, Joseph," he greeted warmly. "Forgive me for calling so late-hopefully I'm not disturbing your rest?"



Joseph's voice, easy and familiar like an old  companion, answered with a smile in his tone,"Sherwood! No, I'm still awake. What's on your mind?"



Sherwood chuckled lightly, masking his intent with small talk. "Oh, nothing urgent. Just thought I'd chat a while. Don't you usually sleep early? Haven't been feeling unwell,I hope?"



On the other end, Joseph laughed, his amusement carrying through the receiver. "Not at all. I've been taking the medicine Verena prepared, and my health has improved greatly. Perhaps it's her presence at home that makes me so light-hearted. Even though she's right here with us, I can't help thinking about her -strange how joy itself can keep one awake."



Sherwood's smile faltered for a breath, but he quickly regained his warmth. "Indeed, Verena is both thoughtful and capable. It's a comfort knowing she looks after you so well."



Joseph's laughter grew more buoyant,laced with pride."Yes, in the twinkling of an eye,Verena has grown to the point of caring for us."



Sherwood responded with a genial smnile, "Indeed,she's younger than Luis, but she's the first to start a family. Joseph, it won't be long before you can cuddle your first grandchild."


Then, shifting his tone to a lighter note, he added,  "Speaking of which, both Luis and Molly have already reached the age for marriage. Time waits for no one,does it not?"


Narrowing his eyes slightly, Sherwood leaned back on the couch, nostalgia threading through his voice. "Do you recall when they were children? Whenever they stood side by side, we would half-jest, half-believe,saying they were a match made in heaven."



He paused deliberately, allowing Joseph a moment of reflection, before continuing, "Joseph, let me be plain.What do you think of arranging their marriage?"



Joseph was momentarily taken aback, and then burst out laughing. "Sherwood, I truly admire Molly-she's kind, sensible, and capable. But Luis has always charted his own course. As his father, my influence is not as strong as you might think."



His tone carried a trace of complaint yet overflowed with paternal affection. "Still, if he agrees, I will wholeheartedly support the union."



Sherwood drained the last of his honey water,replying with a touch of humor, "Luis neither agrees nor refuses. Curiously, though, wherever he goes-be it business or leisure-he never fails to bring gifts back for Molly. Slowly, he has captured her heart,and now she waits each day for his word." Joseph frowned slightly, his voice tinged with reproach. "Luis is too vague with his feelings. To leave a girl in suspense-it's hardly fair."


Sherwood sighed softly, but Joseph quickly tempered his tone, as if to console him. "Don't worry,Sherwood.Knowing Luis, if he weren't interested, he wouldn't trouble himself with such gestures. At work he's as decisive as lightning, yet in matters of the heart,he hesitates."



Joseph's mild exasperation carried clearly through the line.



Sherwood answered with a smile, his eyes glinting with calculation, "If Molly heard your words, she would be overjoyed. In the end, though, we can only guide-the choice is theirs."



After a brief silence, he added casually, "Truth be told,I hope we can settle their marriage this very year.Molly has set her heart on Luis; her dreams revolve around him. A firm decision now would bring them peace-and us as well."



Joseph chuckled with easy broad-mindedness."Sherwood, I meant it when I said I like Molly. But Luis 'thoughts are his own, and I cannot decide in his stead."


He paused, measuring his words. "How about this: you speak with Luis yourself. If you reach an understanding,  I will not object."



Sherwood's smile deepened,satisfaction flickering in his eyes. "Very well, Joseph. Since you put it that way,I'll find time to speak with him directly."


They lingered in pleasantries a while longer before ending the call.


Sherwood leaned back on the couch, a knowing smile tugging at his lips.


If this marriage could be sealed, then whatever Verena did would pale into insignificance. With Luis being the Sampson family's heir, there would be no place for one who had already married elsewhere to meddle.







The weekend dawned bright over Ochrerayd, the sky painted in a flawless blue while a gentle breeze carried refreshing coolness.



In the eastern suburbs, a renowned golf course stretched wide, its grass clipped to perfection like a vast emerald carpet.



Sherwood arrived in a white tracksuit, his slightly rounded belly hinting at comfort more than discipline.



A matching baseball cap crowned his head. Spotting Luis, he broke into a broad smile, raising his hand in  eager welcome. "Luis, at last!"


Luis, hearing his name, strode steadily forward.



He wore a fitted black tracksuit that emphasized his athletic frame, broad shoulders tapering to a firm waist.


A black cap sat low, shadowing his sharp, deep eyes.


WVith suspicions of Sherwood's intentions in his mind,Luis' gaze now carried both scrutiny and restraint,though he cloaked it beneath composure.


As he reached him, a glint of sharpness flickered and vanished in Luis' eyes. Pressing his lips together, he greeted with steady courtesy, "Mr. Kirk, forgive the delay."


His voice was deep, touched with due respect.


Sherwood stepped forward, patting his shoulder with a show of warmth. "Luis, it's been far too long since our last game. My hands are itching for it."


He let out a hearty laugh that rang across the open field. "Today we must play to our heart's content.Don't hold back-show me just how much you've improved."
###Chapter 335 | Object



On the golf course, Sherwood and Luis each took their positions.



Sherwood bent down,took out the club from the bag,and slowly polished the shaft with his palm. Wearing a genial smile, he lined up his shot and swung first.



The white ball arced cleanly through the air before settling firmly on the fairway.



Straightening his back, Sherwood turned to Luis and asked with casual ease, "Luis, how are things going with the company lately? I hear the progress on that last project was remarkable. It seems you're becoming more and more adept at steering the ship."



Luis walked to his ball without hurry, adjusted his stance, and delivered a precise stroke.


Only after the ball soared did he respond calmly,"Thanks to your support, everything has gone smoothly."



Sherwood chuckled, carrying on the business talk.



As if remembering something suddenly, he remarked casually, "I heard about Molly's actions at Benedict Pharmaceuticals. I assume you've heard the same?"



Luis gave a slight nod, lips pressed together, choosing silence over words.



Seeing this, Sherwood exhaled gently, his tone carrying a trace of apology. "Molly was reckless this time, and her approach was indeed wrong. She deserves a hard lesson. I've already scolded her thoroughly at home."



Luis stood not far away, his posture straight, his composure unshaken.



Sherwood swung again, and then straightened and continued, "Verena is a rare talent. At such a young age, she shows remarkable decisiveness and handles matters with great efficiency. I truly seepotential in her. One day, she will surely carve her name in the business world-just like you."



As he spoke, Sherwood discreetly studied Luis 'expression.



"Mr. Kirk, thank you for your kind words." The mention of Verena drew a faint smile from Luis, tinged with quiet pride. "I trust Verena's abilities. It won't be long before she shines brightly and clears her own path."


"Luis, your fondness for Verena is plain for all to see."Sherwood shook his head with a sigh of regret. "If only Molly had a brother so protective, someone who always thought of her well-being."


He stroked his club while glancing toward the distant hole. "Still, you are right-Verena has a drive that will carry her far."


Luis remained silent, simply adjusting his stance. He raised his club with taut muscles and swung in a smooth,natural arc.



With a crisp crack, the ball soared skyward, tracing a graceful line before dropping perfectly into the hole.


Sherwood's gaze shifted from the hole back to Luis,his narrowed eyes betraying a tangle of emotions.


It was hard to tell whether he admired Luis' flawless technique or whether other thoughts lay hidden beneath.


"Time flies, doesn't it?" Sherwood sighed. "Now Verena stands on her own. I recall when she went missing-your father fell ill with worry, your mother suffered a breakdown, and you had not yet taken up the company's reins."


His sigh deepened, laced with a show of sorrow. "So l had to summon my courage and shoulder the task,coordinating relationships left and right, fearful Sampson Group might collapse in that storm."


He paused, letting his gaze sweep toward Luis as if in  passing. "There were rumors then, claiming our Kirk family wished to profit from your family's misfortune.Honestly, those days were suffocating. But you and your family never thought that way, and you placed trust in my character. Thankfully, we weathered it together."


In the past, Luis would have taken these words at face value. But ever since Verena warned him of Sherwood's hidden designs, his heart no longer heard them the same.



His smile was timed to perfection, his eyes steady and serene. As his lashes lowered, they cast faint shadows,masking whatever stirred beneath.



Yet his tone stayed respectful, his manner both humble and dignified. "Mr. Kirk, you're right. Those days were harsh, but in the end the family endured,and my sister returned. For that, we remain grateful for your help back then."



Sherwood waved dismissively with a cheerfulgrin,as though to brush aside the thanks.


Then, as if struck by a thought, he leaned toward Luis with the air of paternal concern. "Luis, I had a long talk with your father last night. Our two families have always shared a bond, close as kin."


He watched Luis' face closely and went on with a  smile, "We both agreed it's time you settled down.You and Molly grew up side by side; our families know each other inside and out. That foundation is something others only envy."


Sherwood's smile grew more meaningful. "Molly's feelings for you are no secret. She has cared for you since childhood, and she's a kind-hearted girl-an ideal partner for life."



He gave a slight pause, and then shifted the subject naturally. "You've always been decisive. If you have no objections, your father and I think it's time to choose a day this year to settle your engagement with Molly."



As he spoke, he patted Luis' shoulder gently, as if the matter were already sealed. "Once you two marry, our families will be bound even closer, and the road ahead will only grow brighter..."



"I object," Luis suddenly cut in, his voice steady and firm, breaking Sherwood's illusion like glass under a hammer.



Sherwood's smile froze, his lips still curved yet stiff,as though carved from stone. Though he had half-expected it, hearing Luis' open refusal left him unsettled and displeased.



Luis remained calm, his gaze level and unwavering."Mr. Kirk, I've always respected you. But when it comes to Molly, I have only ever regarded her as a sister-nothing beyond that."



Sherwood's jaw tensed,his smile locked in an awkward grimace.


He steadied himself, forcing warmth into his tone."Luis, I understand. Matters of the heart must be weighed with care. Still, when you're in the thick of it,clarity is often the first casualty."



His smile grew strained, his voice gentle. "Why not start with dating, free of pressure? Perhaps you'll find Molly is the perfect match after all."


"Only I can decide who is right for me." Luis' lips curved faintly, but the smile never reached his eyes."Every step I've taken, every choice I've made, has been thought through. I regret none of them."


Catching sight of Sherwood's stiff expression, Luis softened his tone though his eyes stayed sharp. "Mr.Kirk, I value your concern. But please respect my decision."



He raised his wrist, glancing at his watch. "Forgive me,I have other matters to attend to. Excuse me."



With a slight bow, Luis turned without hesitation and strode off the course,leaving Sherwood no chance to reply.
###Chapter 336 Allow Me To Set Things Right
Sherwood remained rooted to the spot, his eyes fixed as Luis' silhouette dwindled little by little into the distance.



His face darkened, the once easy smile collapsing into a tight frown, each twitch of his lips betraying the storm brewing inside him.



At first, he had believed that a marriage alliance would hoist the Kirk family higher in the business world,harnessing the strength of Sampson Group for his own gain. Yet Luis had remained as unmoved as a mountain,deaf to persuasion. Did Luis truly think he could outmaneuver him? That was nothing short of chasing shadows!



Luis walked out of the golf course and made his way toward the car.



The driver was already stationed close by, and the moment he caught sight of Luis, he hastened forward to open the car door with respectful care.



Luis gave a faint nod of acknowledgment and stepped into the vehicle. The driver handed him a bottle of mineral water and said softly, "Mr. Sampson, please have some water to quench your thirst."


Luis unscrewed the cap,took several measured gulps,and then sealed the bottle once more.


Seeing this, the driver seized the moment to ask, "Mr.Sampson,shall we head home now?"


Before Luis could reply, the shrill tone of his phone suddenly cut through the quiet of the car.


He cast a glance at the screen resting beside him.



Recognizing the caller ID, he flicked his eyes toward the driver, and then said calmly, "Circle the area a couple of times."


He pressed a button, and the partition in the car glided upward,slowly dividing the driver's seat from the rear compartment.


When the divider reached its fulI height, Luis unhurriedly pressed the answer button. His voice sank to a low register, carrying a deliberate distance. "Miss Brown, what can I do for you?"


"I just wanted to follow up personally-have you reached a decision regarding the proposal we discussed the other day?" Miranda's voice came clear  yet clipped, businesslike, as though their last encounter had left no ripple in the polished surface of their professional ties.



Luis' fingers tightened instinctively around the phone.



His eyes narrowed, a glint of frost flashing through them, and his deep voice sank even lower. "Miss Brown, let me say this one last time-Sampson Group has not reached the point where I must trade away my principles for profit."



He paused, and then gave a cold laugh,his tone edged with mockery. "So, Miss Brown, do you have another remarkable tale to amuse me with this time?"



On the other end, Miranda hesitated briefly, swiftly realizing that he had taken her words the wrong way.


She gave a light laugh. "Mr. Sampson, don't take it the wrong way. That's not what I intended. This time, it truly is about business."


As she spoke, she lifted a hand to smooth her hair."It's hard to make myself clear over the phone. If you're not too pressed for time, could you come to the hotel? I'l explain everything properly."



Luis' eyelids flickered, his Adam's apple shifting slightly. For a heartbeat, he couldn't make sense of his own sharp reaction. Perhaps he was too used to steering every current, yet whenever Miranda was  involved, he found himself drifting without an anchor.Or perhaps it was simply his refusal to seem like a man so easily toyed with-or perhaps something deeper altogether. A thousand thoughts churned through his mind.



At last, he pressed his lips together and answered somewhat stiffly, "I'm occupied-just finished discussing with Sherwood about my engagement to his daughter."



There was a pause on the other end,broken only by the faint crackle of static.



Just as Luis was about to speak again, Miranda appeared to find amusement in his words.


She stifled a laugh and teased, "You mean Molly Kirk?The very woman you can't even be bothered to converse with? Mr. Sampson, if your aim is to make me jealous, that's a rather worn-out trick."


Her voice carried playful ease, exposing his ploy in an instant.



Luis was momentarily struck dumb, a flush creeping faintly to his face. How could he have resorted to such a clumsy move?



Miranda, having laughed enough, still had traces of amusement in her eyes. She understood well enough that men were proud creatures, so she curbed her laughter in time, cleared her throat, and shifted back to a businesslike tone."Mr. Sampson, the condition I mentioned before was nothing more than a joke. Don't let it weigh on your mind. Two companies cannot build cooperation on trivial banter-mutual benefit must be the cornerstone;that's the essence of real business."



She paused, her fingers drumming lightly on the table as though weighing her next words, and then continued,"Mr. Sampson,I admit I was careless before.Allow me to set things right. Let's meet and speak thoroughly before any decision is made, shall we?"
###Chapter 337 We Should Relax And Enjoy The...

Twenty minutes later, Luis arrived at the Serenity Hotel.



The receptionist at the front desk was quick as a hawk,spotting him the instant he entered the lobby.



With a bright smile, she glided forward, bowing slightly.Offering him a room card with both hands, she said with crisp politeness, "Mr. Sampson, Miss Brown is waiting for you upstairs. The elevator is on the left;just swipe the card to reach the floor."



She gestured gracefully toward the elevator as she spoke.


Luis acknowledged her with a small nod, accepted the card, and moved toward the lift.



Moments later, he reached the right floor,swiped the card, and opened the door.



Inside, the faint fragrance of jasmine lingered in the air.Soft light poured through sheer curtains, scattering patterns across the polished floor like fragments of silk. Miranda sat with her back to him, a picture of unhurried elegance.



Hearing the door open, she turned slightly,a knowing smile curving her lips as she raised her glass. "Mr.Sampson, you finally made it. Do make yourself at home."



Luis stepped in, pausing as he came near her.



She probably had not planned to step outside that day,as she wore a light-purple loungewear set. Loose and flowing, it draped around her like a casual robe, yet still hinted at grace.



Without the embellishment of her usual polished makeup, she looked strikingly natural-her skin smooth,her beauty untempered. Her eyes glimmered with vitality, enough to make Luis' gaze hold for a moment too long.



Her wine glass tilted slightly as Miranda glanced up,noticing his silence. A spark of surprise lit her eyes.


It was her first time seeing Luis in sportswear. Devoid of his formal armor, he looked younger,almost like a college boy caught out of class.



Her gaze lingered, finding the contrast fascinating.The stern, calculating man of business now bore a fresh aura, a paradoxical charm that tugged at her  thoughts.


Her mind drifted briefly toward unspoken images, but she quickly anchored herself-she couldn't let the reins slip too soon, not after last time.



So she steadied her tone, pointing playfully to the seat beside her. "Mr. Sampson, don't stand like a statue-sit."



Luis realized his eyes had lingered longer than courtesy allowed. He drew them back,lowered his gaze, and sat beside her with quiet composure.



From that angle, her profile came into view, softened by the light, and it struck him with sudden force-delicate yet dazzling.



He turned away almost immediately, cleared his throat,and spoke evenly. "Miss Brown, regarding the collaboration you proposed earlier-do you require my feedback now, or do you have something new to bring to the table?"



Miranda's lips curved, her eyes crescented in mirth."Patience, Mr. Sampson. Good things don't ripen in haste. Let's not rush."



She rose,her movements unhurried,and glided toward the wine cabinet.



Choosing a crystal-clear glass and a bottle of vintage wine,she returned.



Standing before him, she said with a smile, "This was flown in from Clokron. A vintage of rare standing-rich, aromatic, and hard to come by here. I believe it will suit your taste."


She poured it gently, the ruby liquid catching the light.


Luis inclined his head in acknowledgment,accepting the glass.



Their fingers brushed lightly-an unintended spark,fleeting yet potent-though his face betrayed no ripple.



Still, inwardly, questions stirred. Was this meeting really about business?



He swirled the glass slowly, studying the deep color,as though admiring it while quietly taming the restlessness within.



At length, he remarked with a steady tone,"Remarkable. Clearly, you've chosen with care."



He took a sip, the rich layers spreading across his tongue.



Miranda sat back down, instinctively leaning closer.



Her eyes, unshielded, roamed over him openly. Every  subtle gesture-from the tilt of his wrist to the press of the glass against his lips-seemed to hold her captive.



Her smile deepened; her eyes narrowed in delight.This was more than wine-it was theater, and he was the star. And dressed like a student, he struck exactly the note that stirred her.


Luis felt the sofa shift as Miranda edged closer, the jasmine fragrance wrapping around him like a whisper.



When he turned, her hair brushed against his sleeve,strands cascading like fine silk threads, adding weight to the moment.



A faint dryness tightened his throat. He steadied himself, lifted his gaze, and met hers. "Miss Brown,shall we speak of business now?"



His question only fed the playful spark in her eyes.



Leaning forward deliberately, she let her hair spill over her chest, her gaze soft yet unyielding as it locked on his cool stare.



For a fleeting instant, memories of past closeness flickered in her mind.



Her pulse quickened as she recalled the warmth of his softened gaze in those intimate moments. She extended her hand,slender fingers trailing lightly across the back of his hand that held the glass.



From his defined knuckles, she traced her way upward,slow and deliberate.



Each touch was a spark, fanning a flame that threatened to leap higher.


"Mr. Sampson," she murmured, her voice a silken lure,"isn't rushing into business a tiresome pursuit?Sometimes, we should relax and enjoy the moment."



Luis' exterior remained unruffled, his eyes calm as a lake at dawn, but inside the fire already blazed. His Adam's apple shifted involuntarily; his grip on the glass grew taut.



Watching her playful smile,hearing her lilting tone, he realized-yet again-that he had stepped willingly into Miranda's snare.
###Chapter 338 The Bait Always Works On The...
Luis narrowed his long eyes, a trace of indulgence flickering before he swiftly veiled it. "Miss Brown,aren't you weary of playing the same card over and over?"



His tone carried the lilt of teasing, yet it bore no sting of sarcasm.



Miranda caught the pretense of calm on his face,amusement bubbling quietly in her chest.


Without hesitation, she reached for the wine glass in his hand, letting her fingertips brush deliberately across the back of his.



Luis pressed his lips together, a tingling wave coursing through his chest.



She raised the red wine to her lips, the liquid glossing them,lending her an air even more enchanting.



Tilting her head, she blinked slowly and flashed a triumphant smile."The bait always works on the willing."



Luis' gaze lingered on her, her cheeks prettily flushed from the alcohol. For an instant, his mind strayed back to the night they first crossed paths in that hotel corridor.


He steadied himself, speaking again, his voice turning hoarse. "You're drunk, not thinking straight."



Miranda chuckled, set the glass down,and without pause sank onto his lap.



Luis stiffened instinctively, but her palm pressed lightly against his chest, halting him mid-motion-a gentle shove that sent him reclining back.


She leaned closer,her hair brushing his cheek, a subtle spark crawling over his skin.



"Luis, I'm perfectly clearheaded now, just as I was last time." Her whisper hovered at his ear, as though spilling secrets meant for no one else.


Her bewitching eyes held him fast, filled with a challenge veiled in seduction.



Though the day still burned outside, the curtains were drawn, and only a lone floor lamp bathed the room in its amber glow, wrapping them in a cocoon of warmth and privacy.



The air thickened, heavy with heat, as though the atmosphere itself caught fire. Luis locked eyes with her, his stare unreadable and deep as still water.


He said nothing, simply watched her, jasmine lacing the air between them, his breath uneven, a surge of heat coursing through his body.



Then,with undeniable force, he leaned forward and claimed her lips.



...


On the wide king-size bed, Miranda lay languid, her hair fanned across the pillow like seaweed drifting on a tide, her cheeks still faintly stained with blush.


Her throat dry, she nudged the man beside her."I need some water."



Her voice was husky, carrying the air of a spoiled princess issuing a command.


Luis heard her, rose without a word, and walked away.



Fresh from the bathroom, his upper body was bare,muscles taut, a towel slung around his waist, every movement betraying the sharp lines of his V-shaped abs.



He returned with a glass of warm water and held it out to Miranda. Too lazy to move, she drank directly from the glass still in his hand.



"Want more?" Luis asked.



Miranda shook her head, sinking back, her gaze wandering over him-broad shoulders, narrow waist,and eight-pack abs. Born to privilege, blessed with talent, and above all, dangerously handsome-he was the kind of man women called a prize.



She tilted her head, a sly smile curving her lips, eyes sparkling like a fox with a secret. "Luis, I want to change the condition."



Her tone was feather-light, teasing. "Instead of being my bed partner, why not be my boyfriend?"


Luis was just about to set the glass down when her words halted him mid-motion.



He paused,catching the playful lilt in her tone.


Placing the glass aside, he leaned back against the headboard,reached for the pack of cigarettes on the bedside table, and pulled one free.


With a click, the lighter flared blue.



Narrowing his eyes, he lit the cigarette, drew deeply,and exhaled-white smoke drifting to shroud his face like a curtain.



"You never say what you mean," he murmured, his voice low and rasped, thick with restraint. "Today, it was mutual consent."



He hesitated, and then gave a wry chuckle. "If I ever let myself care, you'd strip me clean-down to the bone."



Miranda's composure barely wavered, though her tone grew faintly rigid. "What do you mean? I'm a good person."


Luis neither agreed nor denied, his eyes steady on her,tinged with scrutiny.


After a pause, he stubbed out the cigarette. "A bed partner works fine; I happen to need one. Will you take the role?"



Miranda's brows shot up, eyes widening. What was this turn of events? The script had flipped entirely. She had planned to reel him in, yet here she was, the one caught in his net.


"Me, a bed partner?" She bolted upright, voice rising,disbelief ringing in every word.


Luis studied her startled face, a peculiar satisfaction settling over him. His lips curved, a mischievous smile surfacing, with a rogue's glint dancing in his eyes. He reached out,long fingers tipping up her chin.



Leaning close, his breath mingled with hers, warm air pressing into the narrow space.



"Not willing?" Luis asked softly, teasing in tone,echoing her earlier play. "You were more than eager in bed just now; I thought you'd jump at the offer."


His gaze held hers captive, missing nothing in her shifting expression.



Miranda felt her patience flare, heat rising from her ears down her neck. Not shyness, but a storm between reluctance and yearning.



Inwardly, two tiny voices clashed. One cried it was absurd to accept; the other, bewitched, urged her to surrender.



She bit her lip, caught in the tug-of-war.



At last, she drew a long breath, as though sealing her choice.



Her eyes lifted to his. "I can agree, but don't you dare regret it."
###Chapter 339 It's Settled



Upon hearing Miranda's words, a flicker of complexity swept through Luis' eyes-astonishment at her agreement, yet overshadowed by an excitement he could scarcely name.



His smile deepened, drawing him closer to her until their noses nearly touched, their breaths interweaving like threads of the same fabric.



"Alright, it's settled then," he murmured, each syllable tinged with a warm breath that skimmed against her cheek.



Miranda's gaze narrowed ever so slightly, a playful spark glinting like starlight in her eyes.



She lifted her arms with unhurried grace,looping them around Luis' neck.



Tilting her head upward, she closed the distance, their lips meeting softly, intimacy flowing between them like a quiet undercurrent.



Yet in that fleeting closeness, Luis' eyes betrayedhim,drifting downward-catching sight of the faint marks scattered across her collarbone, vivid and enticing,bearing a temptation too dangerous to ignore.His eyes sharpened, a wave of heat surging through his chest as instinct urged him to deepen the kiss.



But before he could surrender, Miranda, catching his intent, curved her lips into a teasing smile and pulled away with sudden swiftness.



"I'm hungry. Let's go out for dinner." Her voice, laced with sweetness and playful mischief, chimed as her lashes fluttered.



Luis froze, desire still lingering in his expression.



He opened his mouth, but no words came-struck helpless beneath her mischief.


Twenty minutes later, Miranda emerged from the dressing room.



She had chosen a dress that hugged her figure, pairing it with silver heels that echoed softly against the floor.



Her makeup was simple, yet touched with an elegance that needed no excess.



Luis, meanwhile, had changed into a suit delivered by the staff. The black tailoring framed his striking form,sharpening his already handsome presence into something commanding.


He sat at ease upon the sofa, long legs crossed,his posture relaxed yet refined. In his hand rested his phone, his slender fingers gliding lightly over the screen.



The reason for his change of attire was simple: the sportswear he had worn earlier had met its untimely end at the hands of Miranda, who, in a hurried moment,had broken the zipper.


Now,she leaned casually against the doorframe, her eyes quietly measuring Luis. She had to admit-he was dangerously magnetic. His sculpted features and balanced physique were a banquet for the eyes, even when he was seated in silence.



The staccato click of heels ceased nearby, drawing Luis' puzzled gaze upward as he slid the phone aside.


Their eyes met.


Whether the re-ignition of passion or something deeper, the moment their gazes intertwined, the air thickened, as if charged with invisible sparks-an unspoken tension that clung between them.


"I'm ready, let's go," Miranda said, breaking the silence with lightness.



Luis gave a slight nod, rose from the sofa, and together they stepped beyond the hotel's walls.


Inside, the curtains had remained drawn, the lights  aglow. Outside, dusk had descended, and a cool evening breeze swept across Miranda's face. She shivered,suddenly reminded of the hour.



Streetlamps flickered on one after another, sketching golden halos along the street.


Noticing her shiver, Luis shrugged off his coat and gently draped it across her shoulders.


"The wind cuts sharp tonight-best not to catch a chill," he said calmly, his eyes still fixed forward.


Miranda drew the coat closer, warmed by the lingering trace of his body heat.


She tilted her head, her voice playful. "Mr. Sampson,still the gentleman. No wonder so many women hold you in their hearts."


For a moment, Luis faltered at her words. Then,with a faint upward curve of his lips, he answered only with a quiet smile.


Side by side, they walked into the deepening night, a pair so striking that passersby turned their heads,unable to resist a second glance.


At that same moment, Molly, weary from a long day,sat in her car at a traffic light.


She idled by the roadside, waiting for the green signal to appear.


Through the half-open window, the chatter of high school students drifted in.



"Look at that couple ahead-they're dazzling!" one girl exclaimed, her tone tinged with envy.


"The man's got legs so long, and the woman's figure is stunning!" another chimed in,admiration clear.


Molly's gaze, almost idle, followed theirs.


But the moment her eyes fell upon the scene ahead,her indifference cracked.


There-walking together-were Luis and Miranda.Their closeness spoke volumes, and the hotel behind them betrayed the rest.


Miranda wore Luis' coat, and the harmony between them was undeniable.


Bitterness surged in Molly's chest, sharp and sour as unripe fruit, catching in her throat and pricking at her eyes.


She knew Miranda. Rivals in love were faces she never forgot. Verena's words echoed in her memory-the hints of something between Luis and Miranda.


Jealousy, disbelief, and unwillingness crashed over her like a risingtide. Her fingers clenched the steering wheel until her knuckles whitened.



Could it be true? Did Luis truly feel something for Miranda?



Her thoughts tangled in a storm of resentment toward Miranda and fear of Luis' uncertain feelings. What unsettled her most wasn't his uncertainty toward herself, but what he truly felt for Miranda.


Molly narrowed her gaze on him, desperate to read his expression.


Yet from afar, all she caught was the subtle lift of a smile at his lips-a sight that tightened her chest as though bound by iron bands.


The traffic light turned green, cars surged forward, and the air filled with the hum of engines.


Still, Molly's eyes clung to the side mirror, reluctant to let go.


A sharp honk broke her trance, jolting her back. She tore her gaze away, started the engine, and slipped into a side street.


In the mirror, the figures of Luis and Miranda shrank and blurred, until at last they vanished into the crowd.


A hollow helplessness pressed upon her chest. Frustration and disappointment burned within her as she reached home. Storming into the living room,she tossed her bag onto the sofa with a heavy thud.



At the dining table sat Sherwood,glasses perched low on his nose, the picture of quiet wisdom as he studied his newspaper.



Hearing the commotion, he lifted his head, adjusted his spectacles, and spoke with gentle patience. "Molly,come have dinner."
###Chapter 340 Those Scratch Marks Are Rather Obvious
Yet Molly found no appetite at all.


Her mind kept replaying the scene of Luis and Miranda walking side by side, leaving the hotel together.


Jealousy and resentment swirled within her like a storm that refused to settle.



Still, she dared not breathe a word of it to Sherwood.He had already hinted that she should give up on Luis,and if she told him what she saw, it would only hand him more reason to press his point.



Molly bit her lip, steadied her emotions, and walked to the dining table.



She drew out a chair, sat down, and stared blankly at the meal before her, her heart barren of hunger.



Sherwood folded his newspaper aside and began to eat.



Molly lifted her fork, managed a few perfunctory bites,and then suddenly recalled something.



Her eyes lit with fresh hope. Setting the fork down she leaned forward eagerly. "Dad, didn't you promise long ago to discuss a marriage arrangement with the Sampson family? How is it progressing? What did Luis 'father say?"



Sherwood halted, slowly raising his head to meet her anxious gaze.


The memory of Luis' unyielding rejection struck him,stirring a sudden fury. He pitied Molly's steadfast devotion to a love that gave her nothing, but even more,he burned with anger at the Sampson family's ingratitude.


His eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing within them.


With a heavy snort, he spoke in a voice sharp as steel."Molly, the Sampsons have no wish for you. But rest assured, I won't allow you to bear this humiliation for nothing. Since they refuse our goodwill, I shall act against them."



Molly,who had been holding her breath in anticipation of good news, froze at his words. Her face went pale.Sherwood, always gentle and loving-especially to her,his daughter-now revealed a side she had never witnessed, as cold as winter frost.



A shiver ran down her spine, and she forced her voice through trembling lips.



"Dad, what do you mean by that?" Sherwood's smile masked a fierce resolve.



He reached out, patting her head, though his eyes gleamed with chilling determination. "Molly,remember this-here in Ochrerayd, only our Kirk family has the right to stand above all."


Molly looked at him in bewilderment, confusion etched into her expression.



She could not grasp why he spoke so suddenly of ambition and power, nor from where this consuming desire for control sprang.



Her heart, however, remained fixedonly on Luis. She nodded absentmindedly, her thoughts drifting back to him alone.



She knew one thing with certainty: she loved Luis.She yearned for his affection, desperate to be the sole one at his side. Even though his heart held no special place for her, her obsession had never faltered. She longed for him-by whatever terms, by whatever means.



Sherwood's gaze swept over Molly and settled in the distance, hardening with murderous intent. He understood that before striking at the Sampson family,his health had to be secured. And only Verena possessed the skill to treat him. For that reason alone,he had to keep her close until his illness was cured. The following morning, at the Sampson Villa, sunlight streamed gently through the corridor windows.



Verena,having completed her routine, gathered her things and stepped out of her room.



Just then, she nearly collided with Luis, who was about to leave for his morning jog.



He was dressed in light athletic wear, his tall frame touched by the golden glow of morning.



Noticing Verena already prepared for work, he arched a brow, curiosity flickering. "Heading to the company this early?"



Verena lifted the medical kit in her hand and shook her head. "Sherwood sent me a message last night. He asked me to treat him this morning."



The instant Sherwood's name was spoken, Luis 'relaxed look tightened,worry and caution flashing in his eyes.



After their conversation yesterday, unease over Sherwood's unpredictable nature had only deepened.



He disliked the thought of Verena going alone,but he knew that telling her to refuse might stir Sherwood's suspicion and bring greater danger. After a pause, he spoke earnestly. "Do you need me to send someone to protect you?"



Meeting his serious gaze, Verena's lips curved into a quiet smile. "I'm the only one who can treat his illness.Until he recovers, he won't dare harm me-otherwise,he'd be signing his own death warrant."



Luis inclined his head slightly. "Very well. But be cautious.If anything happens,reach out to me at once."


She nodded gently, lifted her kit, and began to leave.


After only a few steps, she stopped and turned back.


"Oh, Luis," she called softly.



His brow lifted in mild curiosity.


She studied his puzzled face, and then smiled playfully."You came back late last night. Mom and Dad were asleep, but I happened to hear you when I stepped out of the bathroom. However busy you get, don't forget to take care of yourself."



Luis faltered, recalling in an instant the events of the night before. He had intended to head home after dinner,yet somehow ended up in the car with Miranda


...



A trace of awkwardness passed over his face; he  coughed lightly into his fist and gave a nod.



Verena smiled, turned away, and had only taken two steps when she stopped once more.



"And another thing." She lifted a finger and pointed teasingly at his shoulder, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Those scratch marks are rather obvious.Button up your shirt before Mom and Dad see. It wouldn't look good."



Luis' face stiffened with embarrassment as his hand instinctively went to his shoulder.


His loose collar made the raised welts easy to feel.


For a moment, words deserted him.


Watching his discomfort, Verena chuckled inwardly but spared him further teasing.



She headed downstairs, leaving him behind.



Luis remained standing,eyes following her retreating figure, and then shook his head with resigned amusement. He glanced down at his open collar,his hand brushing the marks again. There were more than a few. If he went running now, his parents would surely notice when he came back.



Lowering his gaze, he let out a soft laugh. Miranda really was a little devil. Best to skip the jog today. With that decision, he turned back into his room and changed into a suit.
###Chapter 341 Her Initials



Arriving at the Kirk family's estate, Verena got out of the car.



An elderly man in a crisp, dark uniform moved forward with a warm, respectful smile and nodded. "Please come in, Mrs. Bennett."



She stepped inside, taking in the understated elegance of the living room. The same senior servant soon returned and set down a delicate cup of coffee in front of her, filling the room with its inviting aroma.


"Mr. Kirk is still upstairs getting ready. Please sit and make yourself comfortable while you wait."


Verena flashed him a grateful smile, and then picked up the cup, savoring the first sip before sinking onto the plush sofa. She reached into her bag for her phone,glancing down as she began to reply to work messages.



Noticing that she was busy, the servant quietly slipped away and left her in peace.



"Harry!"


A shrill voice suddenly echoed through the hallway, shattering the silence.



Verena's head snapped up, startled, as a black-and-white Border Collie shot toward her, darting down the corridor with wild energy.



The dog's fur glistened with good health, and his eyes sparkled with curiosity. Clamped in his mouth, a small object bounced with every step as he raced ahead.



Verena rose from the sofa, blinking as she tried to process what was happening.


The Border Collie screeched to a halt right at her feet,his front end crouched low, back end wiggling,tongue lolling out as he panted. His gaze flicked behind Verena, practically begging to bolt past her.



"Harry,settle down!"



The shout came from down the hall as the young man in charge of walking the dog hurried into view. His cheeks were flushed, and his hair was sticking up in odd directions.



Without a second thought, he lunged and caught the leash, gripping it with both hands as he pulled the eager pup back under control.


No amount of tugging could persuade the Border Collie to give up the fight. He dug his paws into the carpet, a deep growl rumbling from his chest, dead set on winning this battle of wills.



The servant clung to the leash, struggling for control.Sweat gathered at his temples as he shot Verena an embarrassed look. "Ma'am, I'm so sorry! He's usually better behaved than this. I lost my grip for just a second-I really didn't mean for this to happen."



Verena met his anxious eyes with a calm smile. "Don't worry about it. He just has a lot of energy, that's all."



Relief washed over the servant's face. He gave her a grateful nod, and then steered the dog away,though the Border Collie still threw longing glances over his shoulder,letting out a few soft, mournful barks as he left.



Once the pair had disappeared down the hall, Verena let out a quiet sigh and eased back onto the sofa.



Just as she made herself comfortable,something hard pressed against her foot.



She shifted, frowning, and looked down, curiosity piqued.



A glimmer on the carpet caught her eye-a slender silver necklace rested there, its pendant perfectly round and dainty.



Light from the ceiling washed over the pendant,bringing out its icy shimmer. Verena bent down, gathering the necklace into her hand, and turned as if to call the servant back.



Just then, the pendant's surface drew her focus.



Finely engraved initials stood out-elegant and precise.



Verena's curiosity sharpened. She lifted the piece,examining the tiny letters: A and S, etched with delicate care.



"Adara Sampson..."


The name slipped out, barely louder than a whisper, as Verena stared at the engraved letters.



Memories of a long-ago talk with Luis drifted through her mind, from just after she had uncovered her true identity.



She could picture her brother, stretched out on the couch, an easy smile on his lips as he explained, "You know, Mom and Dad wanted your name to be Adara Sampson. It means radiance, nobility-all the good things they wished for you. They even went all out and had a famous designer make a necklace, just for you.Your initials are on the pendant-A and S."



The way Luis had spoken that day lingered with her,every detail clear as if it had happened yesterday. Regret had softened his eyes, and the love he held for his sister was impossible to miss.



He described the necklace as something truly special -a pure silver chain, paired with a pendant so subtle,but every inch designed with care.


According to him, the letters seemed to grow from the metal itself, every curve and line blending perfectly together.


But sometimes,life twisted those wishes.



When she vanished, the necklace disappeared, too,taking her parents' hopes with it.


For the family, it became a silent ache they never quite spoke of.



Now, right in her palm, the necklace with those same initials had resurfaced at the Kirk estate.



A strange tension gripped her as she held the delicate chain, her heart thudding and an uneasy feeling rising within her.



What if her disappearance had something to do with Sherwood all along?


Her mind spun with doubts, but the sound of a door snapping shut upstairs jerked her back to the present A familiar voice floated down the stairs. "Did Harry get himself into trouble again?"


A flutter of her lashes was all it took for Verena to hide her nerves. She slipped the necklace into her bag,movements quick and quiet.


Calm settled over her face as she straightened up and focused on the stairs.


The older servant, hearing Sherwood's voice, quickly stepped forward to explain. "Sir, Harry made a dash for the living room again, but Kris managed to catch him and take him out."



Sherwood made his way downstairs, dressed now in a loose set of loungewear, and nodded. "Try to keep a closer eye on him next time."



Sherwood closed the distance between them,his smile warm and inviting. "That dog's antics didn't give you too much of a fright, did he?"


Verena returned a polite smile, careful to hide the resentment that simmered beneath her calm exterior."It's no trouble, Mr. Kirk. Harry's got a playful streak.He just needs to burn off some energy."



A soft laugh escaped Sherwood, and a touch of nostalgia colored his words. "He's never been anything but wild since we brought him home. I sometimes think he'll outgrow it, but no luck yet."



She met his gaze with a quiet nod, and then redirected the conversation. "Shall we go ahead with your treatment,Mr.Kirk?"



With a gentle sweep of his hand, Sherwood gestured for her to follow. "Of course, Verena. Let's get started."


He then set off at a brisk pace in the direction of the family clinic.



Inside the private ward, he perched on the edge of the bed and shot her an easy smile. "Looks like I need your expertise again, Verena. Sorry to keep asking."



Verena pressed her lips together, her tone even. "You don't have to apologize, Mr. Kirk. You're a close friend to my family."



While she spoke, she organized the instruments with practiced efficiency, placing each one neatly on the tray beside her.



Reaching for a needle, she gently inserted it into his arm and kept her voice low. "Since our last session,have you noticed anything different with your health,Mr.Kirk?"



Sherwood settled back against the pillows, a pleased grin spreading across his face. "Honestly, Verena,you're a miracle worker. I went through doctor after  doctor-got poked, prodded, loaded up on prescriptions-and nothing changed. But ever since you started treating me, I feel like a new man. My appetite's back, I sleep like a baby, and my energy's never been better."



All the while, a silent, self-satisfied thought flickered through his mind. That was why he kept her on, after all.



From her spot at the head of the bed, Verena's lips quirked into the barest hint of a smirk, her eyes glinting with quiet irony.



After all, her so-called remedies were just gentle tonics-nothing special, certainly not the miracle he claimed.



Sherwood's intensity came from his own mind,shaped by everything he'd convinced himself to believe.



Verena took a steady breath and flashed a reassuring,practiced smile, as though she was greeting one of her patients at the hospital. "It's good to know the treatment is helping."



There was something noticeably different about Sherwood today. His reactions to the treatment didn't match his usual habits.



He tried to appear at ease during the session,muttering under his breath, "Will this ever be over? just want to feel normal again. Can I get better soon?"



As Verena measured out his next dose, he tossed out the same questions for the third time, acting as if it were just casual conversation. "Verena, do you think I'm almost done with this whole thing? When do you think I'll finally be okay?"



Each time he asked, he changed the phrasing,shifted his tone, but the impatience in his voice kept coming through.



Verena picked up on his nervousness immediately.



Something in her gut told her that his questions today were more than concern for his recovery.



There had to be another motive beneath his words.



It felt like he was preparing for something,waiting for his moment to act.



After weighing her response, Verena met his gaze and decided to tell him a time that was ahead of his normal recovery schedule. "Mr. Kirk, you're making remarkable progress. If everything keeps going this way, you'll just need one more month before the doctor can move forward with the surgery," said Verena.



She watched closely and caught the way Sherwood's eyes flashed, as if he were unable to hide a sudden spark of hope.



Though brief, the look on Sherwood's face did not slip past her.



A hint of amusement flickered in Verena's mind,but outwardly, she kept her face neutral and focused on her work.



Her instincts told her that her words had settled deep in Sherwood's thoughts.



She suspected that if he had any ambitions, he would set his plans in motion before the month ran out.



When the session ended, Sherwood casually invited her to stick around for lunch.



She offered him a polite smile and explained she had business at the company that she couldn't put off.



He let it go, making no effort to convince her.



Verena left the Kirk estate, heading straight for the garage without looking back.



Almost at the entrance, someone grabbed her wist with startling force.



In the blink of an eye, she was pulled into a secluded alleyway,hidden from the main road. Instinct took over as Verena gasped, both hands shielding her belly.



"Molly?" Verena steadied herself and narrowed her eyes, finally recognizing who stood before her."What do you want?"



Molly pressed an object into Verena's palm, her movements rushed and desperate.



Verena's hand closed around the cold handle of a dagger.



She looked up, searching Molly's face for an explanation, but what she saw was only heartbreak and misery, not a hint of aggression.



With her voice cold and unyielding, Verena asked,"What are you trying to do?"



Molly swallowed hard, her words shaky and strained."My father tried talking to Luis about marrying me, but he shot it down right away. I've been calling him over and over, but it's like he's vanished. He just doesn't want anything to do with me."
###Chapter 342 A Dagger


Molly bit her lower lip, tears shimmering in her eyes."Verena, I'm at the end of my rope. I truly have no other choice-please, I need you to do mne this favor."



She didn't pause for Verena's reply, her gaze instead fastening on the dagger. "This dagger carries a heavy meaning. When I was fourteen, someone deliberately tried to harm Luis. In that moment, without a second thought, I rushed in to shield him. My clothes were drenched in blood, the pain nearly unbearable,yet all I could think about was keeping him safe."



Verena's eyes flickered in surprise as they settled on Molly's tear-stained face. She had never imagined Molly's feelings fo Luis ran so deep. What had begun as a tender sprout of young love had,over the years,hardened into something as unshakable as stone.



Molly sniffled, her voice thick with emotion though her gaze remained defiant. "Luis promised me back then that he would grant me one request-no questions asked."


She raised her chin slightly, drawing in a breath to steady herself, though her words still trembled. "All these years, I never called in that promise. Now I want him to honor it. My request is simple-I want him to marry me."


Her eyes locked with Verena's, each word striking like a hammer on iron. "Verena, please take my words and this dagger to Luis. Tell him I have waited all these years for this one moment."


Verena regarded her with an unreadable expression.


After a brief silence, she spoke with measured seriousness. "Molly, matters of the heart can't be forced. I'll deliver your message, but the final choice rests with him."


Her brow furrowed faintly, her tone cool but not without sympathy. "And think carefully-marriage should never be treated as a transaction bound to an old promise. If Luis isn't willing, then even a marriage in name alone will never bring you joy."


With that, Verena said no more. She turned and made her way to the garage.


Moments later, her car rolled out of the garage,sweeping past Molly as she sped into the distance.


Molly stayed rooted in place, her shoulders slumped as though every ounce of strength had drained from her.



Verena's words echoed in her mind, yet her devotion to Luis did not waver. Even if his heart was elsewhere,  she believed that being his wife-even in title alone -was enough.


Her hands clenched the hem of her shirt, and tears spilled freely down her cheeks.


Watching the car vanish, she whispered fiercely to herself-she would not regret this,not ever.


Meanwhile, Verena sat in her car. At a red light, she freed one hand, picked up her phone, and dialed Luis ' number with slender fingers.


When the line connected, she asked first, "Luis, are you at the office?"


A rustle of papers sounded on his end before his voice followed."Yes,what is it?"



"I have something for you. I'm on my way now," she replied simply, ending the call.


Before long, she arrived at the Sampson Group headquarters.


Parking her car, she strode directly inside, unhindered,until she reached the CEO's office door. She knocked lightly, and once permission was given, stepped in.


Luis was behind his desk, buried in paperwork.



Verena approached and placed the dagger on his desk. Luis looked up at the sound, his deep-set eyes reflecting a flicker of confusion.



Then his gaze fell on the dagger.


He frowned slightly, hesitation clouding his face."What is..."



Verena drew out a chair and sat, her tone even but edged with irony. "You do have a way of drawing attention, don't you?"



She gestured toward the dagger. "Molly asked me to give this to you. You remember how she threw herself in front of that blade for you? She's invoking the promise you made back then-she wants you to marry her."



Luis' eyes lingered on the dagger, his thoughts dragged back to that night of chaos years ago.


His gaze narrowed, and he laid down his pen with a sigh heavy with weariness. "That incident still gives me a headache."



Verena tilted her head in curiosity. "Why? Is there more to the story?"



Luis shook his head, his lips parting slightly. "Even though the moment was dangerous, I'd been trained rigorously from childhood. I could have avoided the strike."


Regret shaded his tone as he went on. "But Molly rushed in, upending everything. Because of that, the real culprit slipped through our fingers."


He leaned back in his chair, arms folded across his chest, his face caught between emotions. "The promise I made to her wasn't born only of duty.Sherwood did the Sampson family a great favor. That promise was my way of repaying him."


His eyes darkened, his voice cooling like ice. "But none of the promises I made extended to life's major choices."


Verena nodded slowly, her expression shifting from curiosity to realization. "I understand. I'll tell her."


Then her gaze steadied, more serious now. "But there's something else I need to confirm with you."


From her handbag she drew out the necklace.


Holding the chain between her fingers, she let the silver pendant dangle, catching the light with a soft gleam.


Luis' eyes widened slightly.


For a long moment, he only stared, hesitant, as though he doubted his sight. Finally, he reached out, his fingers closing around the pendant. When he saw the engraved letters, surprise rippled through his gaze.


"Verena, where did you come across this?"



"At the Kirk family home," she replied evenly. "I was waiting in the living room for Sherwood when their dog ran out with it and dropped it at my feet.I remembered the necklace you once described-the one Mom and Dad gave me after I was born. The moment I saw the initials, I decided to bring it to you to confirm."



Luis studied the piece intently, his expression grave.He nodded slowly. "There's no mistake. This is the necklace. Back then, Dad and I went all the way to Lasmiqua to meet the designer ourselves.We oversaw every step-from the concept to the materials."


He looked up, locking eyes with her. "So I can't be wrong. This is the necklace Mom and Dad prepared for you."



Verena tapped the table lightly with her fingers."When I disappeared, the necklace vanished with me.Now it turns up at the Kirk home. That's far too strange."



She leaned forward slightly. "Tell me-how were Sherwood and our parents getting along the year l was born?”



Luis' face grew solemn as he sank into thought.


He rubbed his temple, searching his memory for cluJes.


"Sherwood had known Dad for some time," he began slowly, his voice rough with thought. "But his ties with our family weren't very close then, and the business dealings between the two families were limited. It was only after you disappeared-when Mom and Dad were exhausted and the company took a severe blow-that he drew nearer to Dad and began appearing more often in both our lives and in business matters..."


He broke off suddenly, disbelief flashing in his eyes."So... could your disappearance be linked to Sherwood?"


The weight in the room thickened as their eyes met.



"That's my suspicion as well," Verena said gravely,her brows knitting. "When I treated Sherwood today,he acted strangely. He pretended to be casual, but kept circling back to when his health would be fully restored. It felt off, so l deliberately told him he'd recover in a month."



Her gaze sharpened. "If he is truly the mastermind behind what befell our family, then he may make his move within that time."Luis' brows knitted together, a shadow darkening his stern face, fury sparking in his eyes.


"If Sherwood is truly behind this, I'll make him pay-in blood," he snarled, each word torn through clenched teeth, his voice steeped in hatred like acid. "Verena,you've played this move well. Over the next month,I'lI arrange a team to keep him under constant watch.He won't be able to lift a finger without us knowing.At the same time, I'll personally take charge at the company and conduct a thorough sweep to uncover his accomplices."



His gaze fixed back on her, weighted with concern."Sherwood is cunning. Be careful when you treat him;don't let him suspect anything."



Verena met his eyes and answered with a calm,reassuring smile, "I understand. Don't worry, I won't act rashly."


At that moment, a knock sounded at the door.



She glanced toward it and rose to her feet. "You should get back to work. I'll be leaving now."



Luis gave a small nod. "Take care on the road."
###Chapter 343 Emergency Meeting
Verena stepped through the spinning glass doors of Sampson Group.



She made her way to the parking garage, found her car waiting in the shadows, and slid into the driver's seat.



Warmth wrapped around her the moment she closed the door.



As she buckled up, a thought cut through her focus,demanding attention.



Her face hardened. She reached into her bag,grabbed her phone, and scrolled until she found her chat with Luis. Her fingertips hovered above the keys before she started typing, choosing her words with care. "Keep your head down while you're digging into Sherwood.Don't draw his attention-he's sharp and sees through everything. Even the smallest hint will put him on high alert. The man's practically a bloodhound when it comes to secrets."



Seconds after she sent the message, a notification flashed across her screen. Luis had replied,"Understood. I'll be careful." She let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding, stowed her phone, and turned her attention to the quiet darkness ahead. Both hands tightened on the wheel, but her mind drifted back to Luis and Sherwood.



Their history went way back-Sherwood had been part of Luis' life for over two decades, watching over him as he grew up.



When Luis entered Sampson Group, Sherwood had become his mentor, teaching him the ropes and guiding him through every company challenge.



Over time, Sherwood learned nearly every nuance of Luis' personality.



Because their families shared a strong bond,Luis grew up seeing Sherwood as more than just a mentor; he was practically family.



Their shared history made it nearly impossible for Luis to probe into Sherwood's affairs without raising suspicion. Sherwood would sense it right away if anything felt off.



That was exactly why Verena had decided to reach out and remind Luis to tread carefully.



As she mulled over the situation, a realization dawned on her. Unlike Luis, she had the benefit of anonymity. She and Sherwood had never crossed paths before she returned to the Sampson family,living in separate worlds. Even now, their encounters were rare and formal. Watching from the sidelines gave her freedom Luis could only wish for.



Night settled over Sampson Villa.



Verena's desk lamp cut through the darkness as she worked late, the blue glow of her monitor lighting her focused face.



Her screen filled with files from Benedict Pharmaceuticals, each one listing names,roles, and responsibilities of major players inside the company.



She had started her deep dive the moment she got home.



Minutes blurred into hours, and soon the only sound left was the low hum of her laptop, keeping her company while the rest of the world slept.



As she scrolled through page after page, a cluster of names kept surfacing.



Leaning in, Verena narrowed her eyes, paying close attention to every résumé, project summary, and social connection.



The deeper she dug, the more intense her gaze became. The information pointed to a strong link with Kirk Group. They didn't just show up at major projects handled alongside them. They were also regularly seen mingling with members of the Kirk family,whether it was during events or through the steady back-and-forth of contact details.



The alliance was plain as day. These people already seemed certain that Molly would take the reins at Benedict Pharmaceuticals, which was why they no longer bothered to hide their alliances.



Verena's attention never wavered from her laptop.Ideas and strategies churned in her mind, each one more urgent than the last.



The next day came with a clear sense of urgency. As soon as Verena stepped into her office, she picked up the phone and punched in an internal line. Her voice was firm, leaving no room for questions. "Zeke,I want all senior executives in the conference room in ten minutes. Emergency meeting."



Zeke responded right away, his voice steady and professional.


News spread fast. A few senior executives quickly filtered into the break room, their voices low and uncertain.



One executive, a bald man who looked tired, thumped  his mug on the table and muttered, "Another emergency meeting? Verena hasn't even settled in,and we're already on our third emergency meeting.This is getting old."



A sharply dressed woman roled her eyes as she touched up her lipstick. "Who knows what she wants now? She barely lets us catch our breath."



A heavyset man crossed his arms and murmured,"That last meeting brought everything to a halt. How does she expect us to hit our targets when she keeps pulling stunts like this?"



Even though the complaints kept coming, nobody dared defy the chain of command. Everyone made their way to the meeting room before the deadline.



As they walked in, all eyes went straight to Verena sitting at the head of the table, her presence commanding their full attention.



One by one, they took their seats, each person wearing their own mix of suspicion, worry, and curiosity.



Chairs scraped across the floor, some landing with heavy thumps that bounced off the walls.



At the head of the table, Verena took in every detail -the nervous fidgeting, the darting eyes, the air of quiet rebellion. Her own expression betrayed nothing, carved in cold resolve. She sat up straighter, pressing her palms to the tabletop. Her fingers tapped out a slow, deliberate beat, commanding the roomn's attention.



When the last voice faded and all eyes settled on her,she broke the silence. "I know some of you aren't thrilled to be here. Let's skip the formalities. I'll get straight to the point."



Heads turned, a ripple of unease running through the group.



Molly glanced over with suspicion, her eyes narrow,trying to read Verena's intent.



Unbothered by the scrutiny, Verena let a thin smile cross her lips as her gaze locked on Jared,the deputy general manager.


Jared lounged in his seat, arms crossed and boredom written all over his face.



That posture vanished as soon as he realized she was watching him. He stiffened, eyes wide, and a nervous grin stretched across his cheeks.



"Mrs. Bennett, is there a problem?"His voice tried for casual,but it wavered.



Verena didn't flinch. "Jared, you've been using your  position for your own gain. You've thrown fairness out the window and broken more than a few rules. The company gave you authority to help us grow, not to serve your own interests."



Every word rang out, clear and unwavering,the weight of her authority settling over the room.



Verena stopped for a moment, keeping her eyes on Jared.



The color drained from his face, and the arms he had kept folded shifted nervously as he brought his hands together on the table, trying to steady them.



He tried to speak, lips parting in weak protest.



Verena cut him off before he could get a word out."Effective immediately, every project you manage is suspended. There will be a full investigation into your actions. Until that's finished, you're on leave. Stay home and wait for further instructions."
###Chapter 344 Couldn't Withstand Real Scrutiny
Jared's face drained of every trace of confidence when Verena handed down her verdict.



Fear wrapped around him, suffocating any bravado he had left about his title as deputy general manager.



He ignored the stares burning into him from every corner of the room and shot up from his chair, panic driving his movements.



The metal legs shrieked as he shoved the chair back,slicing through the tension in the air.



He hurried to Verena's side, bowing his head, hands clasped together, desperation plain in his eyes. "I lost my way. Greed got the better of me-I'm begging you,let me fix this. Please, just give me one more chance.I swear I won't slip up again."


Unmoved, Verena's eyes hardened as she met his gaze.



Her words came out crispand cold. "Jared, our rules exist for a reason. If I look the other way,what message does that send to everyone else? Go sit down. The investigation is moving forward, and you'll answer for your actions." Mixed emotions chased each other across Jared's cheeks. Shoulders drooping, he trudged back to his seat,unable to meet anyone's eyes.



Nobody in the room had expected Verena to drop the hammer so quickly, especially not on someone shielded by Molly. Her decisiveness sent ripples of shock across the table-some even dared to compare her resolve to that of her brother, Luis.



Most of them saw Verena as an outsider,someone who didn't fully understand the ruthless nature of corporate power. They assumed she would tread carefully, too cautious to challenge how things were already being done.



Instead,she left them reeling.



Some executives stared with open mouths, too surprised to hide their disbelief. A few furrowed their brows, casting nervous glances between Verena and Jared, silently tallying their own infractions.



Others shot wary looks at each other, a flicker of dread in their eyes. Ties to Jared suddenly felt dangerous, and they wondered who might be called out next.



A sudden voice broke the tension."Ms. Guzman."


Verena's tone cut through the hush, drawing every eye  to the woman in question. Clarissa Guzman, known for her flawless appearance and meticulous style,stiffened in her seat. Her hands clenched under the table, and her practiced smile barely held.



"Mrs. Bennett..." Clarissa's voice trembled, betraying her nerves.



A heavy silence fell as all attention shifted to her.


Verena leaned forward,lacing her fingers together on the table. Her voice was steady and deliberate. "Ms.Guzman, I've reviewed last month's marketing expenses. Not only was the budget blown, but the results were disappointing, and the financial records are a mess. As the head of the project, I'd like you to walk me through what happened."



Eyes wide, Clarissa averted her gaze, searching for words as pressure mounted.



A hush settled over the table as Clarissa tried to steady her nerves. With forced composure, she said,"Mrs. Bennett, I assure you, there's been a big misunderstanding."



Verena didn't blink. She cocked her head to one side,a wry glint in her eyes, silently daring Clarissa to keep going.



Fidgeting with the hem of her sleeve, Clarissa continued, "The marketing campaign was on track  until our partner blindsided us. They jacked up the fees at the last minute. I had to accept their terms just to keep everything from falling apart."



Every sentence was punctuated by nervous glances toward Verena, as if hoping for some sign of approval.



Verena simply arched a brow. a thin, cold smile tugging at her lips.



The pressure built. Clarissa's voice wavered. "Please believe me. I did what I thought was best."


A sharp tappng echoed through the silence as Verena drummed her pen against the table, each click a reminder of who held the power in the room.



She let the silence stretch, and then replied in a tone that brooked no argument, "Ms. Guzman, your story is interesting, but the facts will come out once we conduct a proper audit."



Her smile lingered, cold and controlled."I suggest you make sure there's nothing in those records that'll cause trouble. Company policy doesn't play favorites."



Clarissa's features tightened, and she tried to hide her nerves by adjusting her hair. "Yes, of course."


After that, no one dared make a sound.


 
Verena let her eyes sweep the room at a measured  pace before settling squarely on the bald man with his head lowered.



Platt Martin, seated across from Clarissa, had barely moved since Verena confronted Jared. He looked like he wanted to disappear entirely, shrinking into his chair as if the table might somehow hide him. The overhead lights only made it worse, casting a sharp glare off the top of his bare scalp.



"Mr. Martin, stop trying to disappear into your chair.Look up and face me."



Verena's voice cut through the tension, cold and precise.



Platt stiffened, his forced smile twitching into something almost comical.


"You look nervous, Mr. Martin," said Verena, eyes narrowing with a hint of dry amusement. "Should I be asking what you're so eager to hide? Are you worried I'll find the same skeletons in your closet as I did with Jared and Clarissa?"



Sweat broke out across Platt's forehead. His handkerchief worked overtime as he darted anxious glances toward Molly, hoping for help she never offered.



Not giving him a second to collect himself, Verena added, "Your department controls the company's  purchase plans, but our records show you've been approving raw material purchases almost thirty percent above standard market rates."


She rose from her seat, pulled out a thick folder, and laid a report on the table for all to see. "We're not talking pocket change. These numbers eat into our bottom line. As the head of purchasing, I think everyone here deserves to hear how you plan to explain this."


Leaning in, she locked eyes with Platt, her voice sharp and direct. "Let's not forget-word is,you've been spending quite a bit of time with certain suppliers at private clubs and luxury venues. Are you going to tell us there's no connection between those cozy get-togethers and our growing losses?"


Every accusation landed clean, each sentence hammering home her point.


Platt's composure crumbled. Sweat dripped down his face,his mouth opening and closing in silent panic.



Whatever excuse he'd hoped to give got stuck in his throat.


Verena watched him struggle, her eyes flashing with contempt. The Kirk family's so-called loyalists couldn't withstand real scrutiny for a minute.



With her chin lifted, she looked down at him and marked, "Since you have nothing to say right now take a leave of absence. When you're ready to give me a real answer, then we'll talk."
###Chapter 345 You're Able To Walk On Your Own Now
Verena didn't spare Platt another glance once her words left her lips.



Her eyes narrowed,scanning the room like a hawk surveying its prey.



"The way we handled Jared Frederick, Clarissa Guzman,and Platt Martin today is just the tip of the iceberg. This company is not a playground, nor a personal ATM for anyone thinking they can get away with it."



She straightened, posture rigid, her gaze lingering momentarily on Molly before sweeping across the rest "All of you hold significant sway here. Anyone who thinks they can flout regulations, abuse their power, or line their pockets will fund Jared and the others serving as cautionary tales-hard lessons dressed in reality."



Her voice carried a weight that seemed to press against the walls themselves.



After a brief pause, her tone softened, calm but deliberate. "That's all Meeting adjourned." Chairs scraped, heads bowed, expressions flickering between relief and apprehension, as everyone hurried to leave,eager to escape scrutiny.



In a matter of moments, the room emptied,leaving Verena alone.



No,there was still one more person.



She cast a sidelong glance at Molly,raising an eyebrow in mock confusion. "Miss Kirk, the meeting's over. Do you have something else to say?"



Molly,who had fought tooth and nail to suppress her anger, felt her restraint ignite at Verena's seemingly innocent question.



She sprang from her chair, eyes blazing, glare sharp enough to cut glass.



Her carefully curated calm splintered,replaced with searing fury. "Verena, are you pretending not to know why I'm still here? I've swallowed this injustice again and again, yet you have the audacity to openly reprimand my subordinates in front of me!"



Her words echoed, sharp and unyielding, bouncing off the walls like a hammer striking steel.



Verena's lips curved in a cold, teasing smile, her gaze icy. "Molly, stop performing as if you're on the verge  of collapse."



She stepped closer, measured and unhurried."Take note-I will root out anyone dabbling in dishonesty,no matter who they are."



Molly felt an unspoken chill radiate from Verena, a silent storm of authority that left her breath shallow,lips trembling, her tongue tied though her mind screamed for a retort.



Verena let out a low, scornful snort, lifted her bag, and moved toward the door.



Then, as though a memory surfaced, she paused.



"Oh, right." A dagger slid from her bag as casually as one might remove a pen. "I'm returning this to its rightful owner."



The dagger hit the table with a muted thud.


Molly's anger flared, but the sight of the blade froze her tongue for a heartbeat. "You didn't give it to Luis for me?"



Verena's smile deepened, amused as if watching a play unfold. "Luis asked me to return it. True, you took a hit for him-but his promise never included sacrificing his own marriage to repay you."



Tilting her head with deliberate slowness, she added,  "Miss Kirk, perhaps you should revise your expectations."



Each word struck Molly like a sudden gust,leaving her swaying, hand gripping the table edge to steady herself.



"Impossible... how could he..." she whispered,recalling every sacrifice she had made for Luis.



She had only joined Benedict Pharmaceuticals because she believed marriage to Luis might one day require her to understand Sampson Group.



And she never intended to curry favor with Verena.She only sought a cordial footing with a future sister -in-law.



Yet now,those sacrifices felt like a series of deafening slaps.



Verena watched her devastation without a flicker of pity, and then turned to leave.



That night, she sat at her desk in her room,eyes locked on her laptop, absorbed in work.



Hours slipped by unnoticed until fatigue began to bite at her eyelids.



Rubbing her eyes, she glanced at the clock-it was past midnight. She rose and moved to the floor-to-ceiling window,gazing out at the city lights glittering like scattered stars.



At that moment, warm arms wrapped around her waist from behind.



Verena stiffened, startled, but the familiar scent immediately grounded her.



"Isaac?" she whispered, incredulous.


Turning, she saw him, tal, gentle, his eyes soft yet hungry with longing.


"How are you here? Am I hallucinating from working too hard?" she asked, blinking in surprise.



Isaac's eyelashes brushed down as he drew her into an embrace, hearts syncing, pulses echoing the unspoken bond between them.



"I missed you, so I came," he said softly, his voice roughened by travel but tender.


Only then did Verena realize he was standing, holding her close.



"Isaac, you're able to walk on your own now?"



Her eyes shone, voice trembling with joy and disbelief. 
He nodded, brushing her hair back with a gentle hand."| followed your advice and exercised every day. I'm stronger now, can stand longer... and I wanted youto be the first to see that."



Tears glimmered in her eyes as she hugged him tightly,as though anchoring herself in the reality of his presence.



For long minutes, they held each other, the world shrinking to the sound of two hearts beating together.



After nearly ten minutes, Isaac's legs trembled slightly.



He leaned his head on her shoulder, voice hushed."Verena, I'm tired... I can't stand anymore."


Verena, snapping out of her reverie, shifted to support him, heart tightening at the sight of his exhaustion. "Then sit down, quickly."


When Isaac stood tall, his broad shoulders blocked her sight completely.



As he turned slightly, Verena finally noticed Jacob at the door,quietly holding a wheelchair,ready for him
###Chapter 346 Do You Miss Me
Only the desk lamp glowed in the bedroom, its lone light battling the vast sea of night.


Verena stepped from the bathroom, wrapped in an oversized nightgown that draped loosely across her figure. Her damp hair clung to her cheeks in wayward strands, setting off the delicate flush upon her skin.



She eased down on the bed's edge, reached for the towel beside the pillow, and began to blot away the lingering traces of water.


At that moment, Isaac concluded his talk with Jacob outside. Entering the room, he caught sight of Verena -quiet,poised,and radiant in her simplicity.


A smile, tender and indulgent, rose unbidden as he rolled his chair forward and stopped before her.



Sensing his nearness, Verena lifted her gaze. Their eyes met, and she answered him with a soft smile of her own.



Words seemed needless. Isaac reached for her hand,drawing her gently into his arms. Then,without pause,he took the towel from her grasp,beginning to dry her hair himself-stroke by stroke,careful as though he were handling spun silk.



Every motion bore patience, every touch a silent vow.



Verena closed her eyes halfway, surrendering to the moment, her body light with the calm bliss of being cared for.



The bath's steam lingered, veiling them in a hushed warmth.



Now and again, his fingertips grazed her ear, igniting a red glow that deepened beneath his steady gaze.



He faltered briefly, and then bent to place a delicate kiss on her earlobe.



"Verena, do you miss me?" His voice, low and magnetic, carried a teasing lilt, each syllable stirring her heart like strings plucked to a secret tune.



Her eyes opened, and in one fluid movement she circled her arms around his neck.



Lowering her head, she pressed her lips to his. "Yes,"she breathed.



The kiss grew deeper, their breath tangled, urgent, as though time itself hastened around them. Finding the angle awkward, Verena shifted to rise, and Isaac, attuned to her every cue, followed her onto the bed.



He bent closer, and her hand instinctively shielded her rounded belly.



For an instant she recoiled, yet his roughened palm steadied her lower back, cradling rather than restraining.



On the table, a glass trinket caught their entwined shapes, merging shadow and silhouette into one.


"Isaac, you're hurting the baby."



His breath scorched her skin, but his words carried a paradox-warmth threaded with ice. "No, never. I could not bear to harm either of my treasures."


The faint rustle of his trousers brushed against her nightclothes, a whisper in the silence.



Verena laughed softly, pushing at his chest, only for him to capture her wrist and press it gently against the pillow.



His fingertips traced her ribs, and she shivered,her cheeks flaring with a tempting blush.



"Do my parents know you came suddenly?" The question spilled out, cut by her gasp as she turned her face away from his mischievous lips. But lsaac only nuzzled her ear, relentless in his teasing.



His laughter rumbled low, vibrating through his chest."They had already retired, so I left them undisturbed.But I did encounter Luis on the way up-"


The words never finished. Verena stiffened, fingers digging into the back of his neck with sudden force.


Midnight wrapped the villa in stillness.



Upon the great bed, Verena and Isaac lay entwined in sleep.



Yet Verena suddenly frowned in slumber, her body curling,unease betraying itself.


One hand pressed against her belly; a soft groan escaped her lips.


Though faint, it rang like a bell in Isaac's ears, rousing him instantly from the edge of dreams.



His eyes snapped open, the haze vanishing,replaced by a blade-sharp alertness.



He sat upright, bending toward her,his voice taut with alarm. "Verena, what's wrong? Are you in pain?"



Her lips pressed tight, sweat pearled at her forehead,  and her hand clutched her stomach with desperate force. Isaac's chest clenched painfully, as though an iron grip had seized his heart.


In a heartbeat, he flung off the covers, swung to his feet, and scooped her into his arms-swift yet painstakingly careful.


She lay limp, her brows knotted, her weak whimpers carving into him like knives.


In that instant, the world held nothing but her and the fragile life within her womb. His steps quickened toward the door.



He forgot entirely that he usually relied on a wheelchair for quick movements. Now, his legs carried him without falter.



Through the corridor he strode, the moonlight stretching and shrinking his silhouette as though testing his resolve.



His arms strained, sweat dotting his brow in rhythm with hers-whether from fear or effort, he did not know.



Only when the cold wind of the villa's entrance struck his face did he realize-he had walked the length unaided.



But miracle or not, he gave it no thought. His world  was Verena.



Calling for the chauffeur, his gaze never left her pale face,his voice trembling on the edge of command.



The chauffeur hurried forth, but froze at the sight-Isaac, who had been bound to a chair, now stood tall,Verena in his arms.



Shock widened his eyes. The words stumbled out,broken. "M-Mr. Bennett... you... you can stand?"


Yet the urgency of the moment crushed his astonishment. His gaze darted to Verena, panic overtaking disbelief. "What happened to her?"


Isaac had no time to explain. His brow furrowed,voice cutting sharp as a blade. "Don't just gape! Drive us to the hospital-now!"



He pressed forward into the garage, his steps swift yet measured, shielding her against every jolt.


The chauffeur, startled into action, leapt into the car,fumbling the keys until the engine roared alive.



Tires shrieked as the vehicle tore into the night.


Through it all, lsaac held Verena close, his hand stroking her belly, his voice a steady murmur. "Verena,don't be afraid. We're almost there. Just hold on." But his trembling fingers betrayed the fear he tried so hard to mask.
###Chapter 347 I'd Do Anything For You
The emergency room was bathed in harsh white light,and the smell of disinfectant stung with every breath.


As soon as Isaac stepped out of the car, he scooped Verena into his arms and dashed through the hospital entrance, moving so fast that the air seemed to rush in his wake.



Panic clung to him. He shouted for help with a desperate urgency, his voice cracking under the weight of his fear.



Nurses raced over with a gurney. Isaac lowered Verena onto it with shaky hands, his gaze glued to her pale,drained face.



When the nurses wheeled her into the examination room, Isaac's heart pounded so wildly that it felt as if it might burst. He stood frozen, gripped by a cold terror he'd never known before.



Unable to keep still, he paced the corridor outside.Every step was frantic, restless, and he hardly noticed his own achievements slipping from his thoughts in the chaos. He kept stopping, staring at the examination room doors. His fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles stood out, white and bloodless.



Sweat gathered on his brow, rolling down his cheeks and soaking into his shirt collar.


Each passing moment dragged on,slow and torturous,as if time itself wanted to punish him.



The memory of Verena groaning in pain wouldn't leave him. He ached with guilt, wishing he could take her place and spare her from suffering.



After what felt like an eternity, the doors to the examination room finally creaked open.


Isaac rushed forward as soon as he saw the doctor appear.



He tried to speak, but his throat felt raw and his words barely formed. "Doctor, my wife-"


The doctor slipped off his mask and offered a gentle smile. "You can relax. She's not in any real danger.The pain is from fatigue and stress, and it's affecting her digestion. The baby is doing great, and so is the mother. What she needs now is plenty of rest and a steady routine of nutritious meals to help her body bounce back smoothly."Relief swept through Isaac, loosening every tight muscle.



He drew in a trembling breath, eyes shining with tears that threatened to spill, the exhaustion melting away as relief took over.



After giving the doctor his heartfelt thanks, Isaac hurried off to see Verena in the ward.



Verena rested quietly in the hospital bed,her features still pale, but sleep finally granted her some peace.


Moving with care, Isaac eased himself into the chair beside her. He reached out and drew her hand to his cheek, holding it as if he never wanted to let go.


"You have no idea how much you scared me," said Isaac,his voice barely above a whisper.



He sat lost in thought, brushing his thumb over her knuckles with a kind of reverence.



"I thought I was going to lose you," he said,his words spilling out in a shaky breath.


Beyond the glass, night gave way to a faint glow. The first strands of daylight crept across the floor,bringing the promise of a new morning.



Isaac paid no mind to the rising sun or the changing  hour. He only wanted to stay by Verena's side, refusing to look away as if his watchfulness alone could shield her from harm.



Every now and then, he leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her brow.



When dawn turned into a brighter day, Verena stirred at last.


Still half-asleep, she tried to stretch but found her right hand caught in a strong grip she couldn't shake free.



She wrinkled her brow and turned her head. That was when she saw Isaac beside her, slumped forward in the chair,chin tucked to his chest, deep in exhausted sleep.


Sunlight fell across his face, smoothing away some of the sharpness in his features. Even so, the shadows beneath his eyes betrayed a long, sleepless night.


He must have stayed up the entire time.


As Verena glanced down, she finally noticed their fingers laced together. His hand dwarfed hers, and he was holding on as if afraid to let go.



The sight sent warmth flooding through her chest,and a soft smile touched her lips before she even realized it. She lingered there, watching lsaac, not wanting to move and break the fragile moment of peace he had found.



While still drifting between sleep and waking, Isaac felt a gentle tug against his palm.



His eyes fluttered open, and the first thing he saw was Verena's gentle smile gazing back at him.


"Hey, you're finally awake," said Isaac, his voice still thick with sleep, but the happiness in his tone was unmistakable.



He shot upright, hands framing her face, searching her expression for any sign of pain.



"Are you okay? Do you feel any pain? Is there anything bothering you?" he asked, his questions coming out in a worried rush.



His words rushed out, tumbling over one another,all of his worries spilling out in a single breath.



When Verena didn't answer right away,he leaned in closer, resting his forehead against her cheek and breathing deeply, desperate to steady his nerves.



He dotted her with gentle kisses. First her forehead,then the spot between her brows, the tip of her nose,and finally,her lips. "I was scared out of my mind last night. I can't even think about what I would've done if I'd lost you," said Isaac, his voice wavering before it trailed off.



He pulled her in, holding her so tightly it was like he wanted to erase the distance between them.



Verena felt the tension running through him, so she wrapped her arms around his back and tried to comfort him. "I'm alright, see? I made it through."


Leaning back a little, she met his gaze. "Isaac, my head was foggy last night, but I remember it clearly now.You carried me all the way here, didn't you?"



Bits and pieces of the night before started to come back to her, a look of wonder flickering across her face.



Even through the pain and confusion, she remembered Isaac carrying her down the stairs and into the car.



Her eyes dropped to his legs. The realization made her voice tremble with happiness. "Isaac, your legs-you're completely healed. You won't ever need a wheelchair again."



Tears glittered in her eyes as she cupped his cheeks,brushing her thumbs across his skin and holding him close "Nothing could top this. You have no idea how happy I am for you," said Verena, her smile lighting up her whole face and making her eyes shine so brightly that Isaac felt all the heaviness in his chest begin to fade.



He blinked back tears, the edges of his lips lifting in a soft smile as he brought her hand to his cheek,soaking up her warmth as if he could keep it with him forever.


"For you, and for our baby, I can do anything,"said Isaac, his voice deep and full of feeling. "Honestly,none of this would have mattered if you weren't by my side. I'd do anything for you."


He wrapped his arms around her, lowering his chin so it rested on top of her head.



Listening to the strong, steady beat of his heart,Verena melted into his arms, her own heart swelling with contentment. Still, she couldn't help but tease him.


With a sly grin, she looked up at him and joked, "So, if I asked for your life, would you hand it over just like that?"



The playful question lingered in the quiet room, with only birdsong drifting in from outside.


Isaac hesitated, caught off guard by her words, but then he grew serious. He drew back a little, his hands holding her shoulders as he stared right into her eyes. "I'd give you everything, but not my life. If I gave that up, I couldn't stay with you. And the idea of anyone else being here with you instead? I couldn't handle it."


Verena had only meant to poke fun, but she hadn't expected him to take her so seriously.


Maybe it was the rush of emotions, or maybe it was just her hormones, but tears pricked at her eyes the moment she heard his answer. She reached for lsaac,wrapping him in a tight embrace and pressing her face into his chest. "I was only kidding. We're going to be alright. From here on out, nothing's pulling us apart."


Isaac gathered her close, holding her tight, and pressed a tender kiss to the top of her head, his quiet nod promising he would never let go.
###Chapter 348 How Did This Happen
Isaac and Verena lingered in each other's arms,holding on for a few quiet moments. Eventually, she leaned back and fixed Isaac with a steady, urgent look."I've been meaning to tell you something important,but I haven't found the right moment until now."


With a gentle touch, Isaac brushed her hair back, his voice soft and encouraging. "Tell me, Verena.Whatever it is, I'm here."



Brows knitted together, Verena took a breath and spoke with care. "The other day at Sherwood's place,I noticed his dog darting out of a room carrying something.The dog stopped right at my feet, and when a servant finally left with the dog,I realized there was a necklace lying on the floor."



For a second, she hesitated, swallowing hard as if the memory stung. "I picked it up for a closer look and saw letters carved into the pendant. Luis told me once that my parents designed a special necklace for me when I was born. I recognized it straight away. It was definitely the one they made. But what I can't figure out is how it ended up at Sherwood's house.Something about it makes me think my disappearance all those years ago is tiedto him."



Frustration and confusion clouded her eyes as she tried to make sense of it.



Isaac took in every word. The tenderness on his face faded,replaced by a chilling resolve.



He squeezed her hand and his tone dropped, steady and unshakable. "You can count on me, Verena. I'm not going to let this go."



His gaze sharpened, steel in his voice. "It doesn't add up-Sherwood having the necklace your parents gave you, and no explanation for it. I'll turn over every stone, call in every favor I have, until we know the truth. If anyone has been trying to hurt you or your family,they're going to regret it."



While Isaac spoke, he reached up and gently eased the tension from Verena's brow, as if worried she might shatter under too much weight. "You don't have to shoulder this alone, Verena. I'm right here. When we finally get to the bottom of everything,I'll make sure you and your parents receive the justice you deserve."



Her lips curved into a small smile as she gave a little nod, but then a thought seemed to strike her. "I should head home and change my clothes. There are a few things at the office I need to sort out." Isaac's brow creased as concern flashed in his eyes."You just went through a lot, Verena. And you're still not back to full strength. Can't you rest for a dayor two? Work will stilI be there."



With a light laugh, Verena glanced up at him and gave his hand a reassuring pat. "I appreciate how much you care. I really do. But there are issues at work that only I can fix. I'll feel better once I've handled them myself.Honestly, I'm feeling fine. I just want to change clothes and get everything settled at the office."



He let out a quiet sigh, realizing there was no point in arguing with her when she had her mind made up.


Gently, he cupped her cheeks in his hands, his thumb tracing soothing circles against her skin. "Okay, I'll come with you. At least let me help you get home and change."



Soon after, the doctor arrived with equipment for a detailed checkup.



Once the exam was over, the doctor addressed Isaac directly. "She's still in a delicate state and needs lots of rest. Make sure her meals are balanced and full of nutrients, especially vitamins and minerals. Cut down on anything spicy or oily. Try to keep her stress-free,physically and emotionally-that's important for both her and the baby. And if anything at all seems off,don't hesitate to bring her straight to the hospital." Isaac gave the doctor a grateful nod, silently promising to remember every detail. "Thanks for letting us know. I'll do everything you suggested."


Once they had the approval to leave, lsaac helped Verena up, made sure she looked comfortable, and led her out of the hospital together.



As the car rolled closer to Sampson Villa, Verena leaned in, her voice low and careful. "Let's not talk about last night with my parents when we get home,Isaac."



He glanced at her, picking up on the graveness in her eyes.



She drew in a steady breath. "Dad's getting on in years,and he worries about the smallest things at home.I don't want Mom feeling anxious, either. If they find out I was at the hospital because of stomach pain,it'll just make them worry even more."



His answer was firm, his mouth set in a line. "Alright,we'll keep it to ourselves. You're the only thing that matters right now."



By the time they arrived, the house was quiet.Joseph and Marisa were still in their bedroom, and Luis was probably out jogging.



Verena and Isaac slipped upstairs, changed into fresh  clothes, and straightened up a bit before heading down to join the others.



The smell of breakfast drifted through the house,greeting them as they stepped into the dining room where Joseph and Marisa were already seated.



Marisa looked distant, her thoughts elsewhere as she stared at the table.



Joseph, ever patient, leaned closer,softly talking her through something as he offered her a piece of bread.



Without really noticing, Marisa took a bite, but her gaze remained lost, as if she was searching for an answer that never quite arrived.



Joseph noticed Marisa's confusion and patiently scooped up some cereal, blowing on it to cool before gently coaxing her to take another bite. Whatever he whispered seemed to smooth the worry from her face.



Marisa's gaze wandered, and then suddenly caught sight of Verena and Isaac descending the stairs. Light came into her eyes, transforming her whole face with a bright, childlike joy.



Waving both hands, she called out, "Come on, let's eat together!"



Joseph, hearing her cheerful voice, looked up automatically. His warm, familiar smile greeted Isaac "Isaac, you made it! Grab a seat and join us."



He turned his attention back to Marisa, gently helping her with another spoonful.



For a moment, Joseph stayed focused on Marisa-then it hit him. His eyes snapped back to lsaac,disbelief washing over his features.



"Wait-Isaac, you're standing? Is that really you?" The surprise lifted his voice higher.


Marisa didn't quite grasp the details, but the excitement in the room caught on. Her blank expression broke into pure delight. She clapped and cheered, "Yay,yay!"



With a laugh, Joseph set the bowl and spoon aside and stood, excitement radiating from him. "Verena,Isaac-how did this happen? Why didn't you tell us?"



Isaac, still holding Verena's hand, walked over with a wide grin. "Once Verena started helping me, I never missed a day of rehab. Yesterday, I finally realized I could get around on my own. I wanted her to be the first to know, so I came straight to her."



Verena squeezed his hand, nodding as she looked at Joseph. "Dad, he came by late last night, but you and Mom were already asleep. We didn't want to wake you with the news."
###Chapter 349 It Will Be Determined By Our Boss

Hearing the good news, Joseph gave lsaac a hearty pat on the shoulder and exclaimed with unrestrained delight, "Excellent! This is a blessing beyond measure,truly wonderful!"



Verena and Isaac exchanged a quiet, knowing smile before settling at the dining table to share breakfast.



As they ate, lsaac now and then handed bread or pastries to Verena, his expression brimming with tenderness.



When the meal ended, Verena bid farewell to Joseph and Marisa, preparing to return to the office to deal with pressing matters.



"Verena, take care on the road. If anything happens,call me at once," Isaac reminded her softly as he helped her intoher coat.



She nodded, rose on tiptoe, and brushed a gentle kiss across his cheek. "I know-don't worry so much. I'll look after myself."



With that, she stepped into the back seat of the car. The driver, following her orders, started the engine.and the vehicle rolled slowly out of the villa gates.


Isaac remained standing, his eyes fixed on the car until it faded from sight.


A faint frown creased his brow: after a brief pause,he drew out his phone and dialed swiftly.


The call connected at once. Isaac's voice dropped into a deep, commanding register. "Send me two best mercenaries immediately.”


The man on the other end responded with crisp respect before the line went dead.


Before long, two towering figures appeared-burly,sharp-eyed, exuding the quiet menace of men seasoned in battle.



Isaac regarded them with gravity. "Protect my wife without drawing attention. She's on her way to the comnpany. Follow her closely, and if anything unusual occurs, inform me at once."



Both men gave a solemn nod, moving in unison as they set off in the direction Verena's car had taken.



Meanwhile, Verena's vehicle glided through streets teeming with traffic. Behind, the mercenaries followed in a low-profile black car,keeping steady pace.


They held their distance carefully-close enough to watch over her,far enough not to catch her notice.


At first, the ride was uneventful. But as they reached an elevated bridge.the mercenary behind the wheel of the black car narrowed his eyes at the rearview mirror.His calm expression hardened.


"There's a problem," he muttered,tapping the brakes lightly, a note of warning in his voice.


The passenger straightened,scanning the mirror.


Sure enough, a gray car lingered behind Verena's vehicle at an oddly constant two-car length. Its driving pattern was highly suspicious. It never overtook,never drifted back, never altered with the traffic. Like a shadow clinging to its source, it followed with unwavering persistence.


"It's been on her tail since the last intersection,keeping the same rhythm," the driver said in a low tone.



"Keep watching.Once we're off this bridge,we move,"the passenger replied,already slipping a handgun from beneath his seat with practiced ease. He checked the magazine, flicked the safety off, and tucked it smoothly beneath his jacket.


Unaware of the looming danger, Verena sat in her car,eyes on the tablet in her hands, absorbed in her work.


Within ten minutes, the car exited the bridge and turned onto a quieter road.



The gray vehicle tried to follow-but the mercenaries made their move. Their black car shot forward like a hawk diving, boxing the pursuer to the side.



Tires screeched in protest, the sound slicing through the air.


Both mercenaries advanced swiftly toward the trapped car.


Inside the gray car,Howe slammed the brakes, nearly striking the steering wheel with his forehead. Realizing things had gone awry, he gripped the wheel and tried to maneuver desperately, the car rocking under his frantic efforts.


Before he could escape, one mercenary's hand shot out and gripped the door handle tightly, handgun drawn in one seamless motion.



The barrel was aimed at Howe's temple through the window as the mercenary growled, eyes fierce, "Out -if you value your life."



With death staring him in the face, Howe had no choice but to obey.


Though fear coiled in his gut, his years on the streets had taught him to mask weakness. He forced a shaky smile. "Gentlemen, is there some kind of problem?"


His voice wavered, yet he tried to sound casual,hoping to douse the flames of tension.


But the mercenary's eyes were like cold steel. He snorted. "You know perfectly well why we're here."


The words struck Howe like a hammer blow. His forced grin faltered, lips dry as he licked them nervously, yet he summoned another thin smile."There must be some misunderstanding. Lower the gun,and we can settle this peacefully."



As he spoke, he shifted his feet subtly, searching for an opening to flee.


But the mercenaries were quicker.


The other mercenary closed in with sharp precision,delivering a kick to Howe's leg that sent him crashing to his knees.



In a flash, his wrists were pinned behind him in an iron grip. Pain twisted Howe's features as he struggled, but against trained fighters, resistance was nothing more than thrashing in quicksand.


"Whether this is a misunderstanding or not," the mercenary said coldly, "will be determined by our boss."



In a high-end club in Ochrerayd, Isaac sat quietly on a wide sofa,authority radiating from him like heat from the sun.


Though still, he resembled a lion biding its time-calm on the surface, yet daunting to behold. His tailored black suit outlined the hard lines of his tall frame,projecting an air of unshaken command.


He lifted his head slightly, a glimmer of frost flashing through his eyes, gaze locking onto Howe, who knelt trembling before him.



Under that piercing stare, Howe dared not raise his head. His breathing came shallow and uneven.


The room held its breath, broken only by the ragged rhythm of Howve's lungs and the soft, deliberate rotation of Isaac's wine glass between his fingers.



The silence stretched tight as a bowstring, every second thick with tension, ready to snap at the slightest provocation.
###Chapter 350 Playing Both Sides
A single lamp cast long shadows across the private room,highlighting every edge of Isaac's sharp jaw and the tension in his posture. He leaned forward, elbows braced on his knees, the unbuttoned collar of his dark shirt drawing the eye to the cut of his frame. The gloom thickened around him, giving off a sense of dominance that was impossible to ignore.



"Do you even realize the kind of trouble you've landed yourself in?" Isaac's voice was cold and unyielding,each word slicing through the silence.



Howe nodded so hard his whole body trembled, the color draining from his face. Years spent climbing the business ladder had taught him to recognize a dangerous man, and Isaac was morethan just a rumor.Howe had only done as he was told, never expecting to end up face-to-face with someone like this. Now,all he felt was pure dread.



"Mr. Bennett, I made a big mistake! Give me another chance-I'll never cross the line again. Please, just let me go!"



Curled up, Howe dropped lower and lower,bowing  over and over until his forehead nearly scraped the carpet.



A sound of disgust slipped from Isaac, his eyes flashing with icy cotempt.


He straightened, taking slow, measured steps toward Howe.Every footfall echoed, turning the silence into something oppressive.



Without warning, Isaac drove his foot into Howe's shoulder, knocking him flat with a sharp cry.


"Now you're scared? It's a bit late for that. You really thought you could get away with tailing her?"


Isaac's voice sounded more like a growl than words,heavy with rage and a threat he didn't bother to hide.


Dropping to a crouch, he seized Howe's jaw, forcing the man to meet his eyes.



Their faces were close, and the icy intensity in Isaac's stare was enough to make anyone flinch. It was as if he could see straight through Howe, stripping away every last defense.


"Who told you to track my wife?" Isaac questioned,the words barely above a whisper, but packed with menace that pressed in on all sides.


His grip tightened, making it painfully clear who held  all the power in that room.



A shiver ran through Howe's body. Fear robbed him of his voice, but he clamped his lips together,desperate to keep the secret buried. He understood that talking now would only shift the danger from lsaac to the man pulling the strings.



Seeing that Howe wouldn't talk, Isaac's eyes went colder,his patience running thin.


He let out a short, cold laugh, and then signaled with a flick of his hand.



One of the mercenaries moved without hesitation,wrenching Howe's arm back with brutal efficiency.



A sickening pop filled the air as the joint gave way.



Howe's scream split the silence, raw and desperate,echoing off the walls.


Sweat streamed down Howe's face,glistening under the dim light as he bit down hard, desperate to hold back any sound.



A dangerous glint flared in Isaac's eyes, his patience hanging by a thread.


Reaching for a knife from the glass table, he let the blade catch the light before turning back to Howe. Without a second thought, Isaac plunged the knife deep into HHowe's thigh. The muffled sound of steel sinking into flesh cut through the silence.


Howe convulsed, his limbs snapping with every wave of agony. His eyes stretched wide in terror, mouth frozen in a silent scream before a guttural, shattering cry escaped-one so fierce it seemed to rattle the bones of the room itself.


Blood spread fast, soaking through his pants and dripping onto the cold floor, each drop glinting in the sparse light.


Wracked with pain, Howe's fingers dug into his palms.


"Ready to open your mouth now?" Isaac's voice cut through the chaos, flat and chilling, like he was discussing the weather.


He loomed over Howe, his gaze cold, locked,impossible to read.


Pain and fear finally broke what was left of Howe's resolve. He slumped, tears and sweat running together, vision swimming as he fought to stay conscious. Every scrap of defiance vanished from his voice as he blurted out, "It was... Sherwood Kirk. He made me do it."



His words trembled in the air, wrung from him by  agony,his features twisted and slick with sweat.



The pain became too much to bear. Howe's confidence shattered, and all he could do was spill everything he knew.



Isaac showed no reaction, accepting the confession as if he'd expected nothing less.



He straightened, his eyes narrowing to slits as he considered the answer.



After a moment, Isaac let his lips curl ever so slightly and spoke in avoice edged with cold. "So Sherwood's gutsier than I thought."


Each word sounded calm, yet danger lingered beneath every syllable.



"What else did he have you do?" Isaac asked, the words quiet but sharp.



Howe lowered his head, the knife still jutting from his leg,every throb making him shudder.



Gritting his teeth,he stammered through the pain, "He..he only told me to keep an eye on Verena. I'm supposed to follow her and report everything. That's it, I swear. I don't know anything else."



His voice was barely above a whisper, each word sapping the last of his strength. Isaac's brow furrowed as he moved closer, his gaze bearing down. "If you're hiding something, you'll wish you'd never crossed me. Think carefully before you answer again."


Howe bobbed his head desperately,terror plain on his face. "I-I promise, that's all I know. Please, just let me go."


Isaac's eyes narrowed as he studied Howe's trembling form, noting the sickly pallor and sheen of sweat."Your name?"


Lifting his eyes, Howe blurted out, "Howe Adams," his voice trembling, eyes wide and haunted.


Isaac lowered himself onto the sofa, crossed his legs,and regarded Howe in silence, deep in thought.


After a long pause, a thin, chilling smile curled across Isaac's lips. He spoke slowly, each word deliberate. "I might just let you live."


Hope flickered in Howe's eyes, a desperate spark after so much terror.


He parted his lips, ready to blurt out thanks, but Isaac cut him off, saying, "But you'll have to earn it. From now on, you're working for me-playing both sides."


Howe's relief shattered, giving way to confusion and  dread.



Isaac leaned in, his voice quiet but razor sharp. "Keep feeding Sherwood the updates about Verena as you were told. Make sure nothing feels out of place. But whatever he says, whatever he does, I want a full report. Miss a detail, and we'll have a problem.Do you understand?"



Trapped and out of options, Howe nodded, jaw clenched. "Yes, sir. I get it. I'll do whatever you say."


A satisfied glint flashed in Isaac's eyes. He grabbed Howe by the collar and spoke in a low, dangerous tone. "Try anything clever, and I'll make you regret it more than you can imagine."



With a flick of his hand, Isaac signaled the mercenary to pull Howe to his feet.


Howe leaned heavily on the mercenary, biting back groans as he hobbled away, his leg screaming with every step.
###Chapter 351 Unusual Questions
Howe staggered out of the room, dragging his injured leg behind him. Isaac remained rooted on the sofa,his expression unreadable and his eyes icy and unblinking,as if nothing could disturb the calm beneath the surface.



He reached for his phone on the glass table, the glow from the screen outlining the hard lines of his face.


A few taps, and he was dialing without a pause.


The call barely rang before someone picked up. Isaac wasted no time on small talk. "Luis, you're pretty close to Sherwood, aren't you? I need to know what he's got his hands in right now. Which project is taking up all his attention, and what major investments has he made lately?"


On the other end, Luis arched an eyebrow, surprised to hear Isaac prying about someone else's business. That wasn't his style-especially not when it involved someone like Sherwood,who hardly crossed his path.Maybe Isaac already suspected Sherwood was a danger to Verena and was gearing up to move first.



No one needed to be told twice just how much Verena meant to Isaac. Anyone daring enough to lay a hand on her would have to answer to him, and he'd never back down from a fight. She was his wife-protecting her came as naturally to him as breathing.


Luis took a second to process Isaac's unusual questions, and then quickly collected himself.


He spoke in a steady, thoughtful tone. "If you want the truth, Sherwood's got his eyes locked on building that new energy industrial park. He's dumped a fortune and half his workforce into it, determined to see it through. And if you're talking about recent big moves,he's also thrown his hat into the smart city upgrade.He's teaming up with some of the industry's top players, all in the hope of carving out a huge piece of the action for himself."


Isaac kept his silence, his face unreadable as he weighed every word Luis shared.


Occasionally, he gave a slight nod, the movement so subtle it almost seemed accidental.


With his gaze sharpening, shadows from his lashes masked the full intensity of his stare.


The moment Luis finished, Isaac continued,his tone unwavering, "I need you to do something else, Luis.Get me a complete list of everyone holding senior roles in Sherwood's projects. Send it to me as soon as you can."


He looked up, his features hardening in the low light,his mouth set in a determined line.



Less than twenty-four hours later,an email from Luis appeared in Isaac's inbox, the requested names all accounted for.



By early morning, a thick layer of mist hung over the edge of the city, where an abandoned steel mill stood -its hulking shape lost in gloom, giving off a chill that seeped into the bones.


A suffocating haze of rust and old metal hung in the air,stinging the lungs with every breath.



Henson Griffiths was forced down by two hulking mercenaries. Each one pinned a shoulder, making escape impossible as he lay sprawled against the unforgiving gravel.


Sharp stones dug mercilessly into his skin, scraping his face raw until streaks of blood mixed with dust and painted jagged marks down his cheeks.



Fear stretched his eyes wide,his whole body quivering with dread.



Still, a stubborn streak drove him to shout, "Do you have any idea who l am?" A voice as cold as steel cut through the air. "Just another one of Sherwood's lackeys."



Instinct made Henson look up. Isaac stood only a few feet away, the tails of his black coat flicking in the stale wind, his stare colder than ice, devoid of sympathy.


Before Henson could move, Isaac closed the distance.



He leaned down slightly, locking eyes with the shivering young man.


Then, without warning, Isaac drove his boot hard against Henson's cheek.


A strangled cry burst from Henson as the blow landed.


Isaac's mouth twisted into a frigid, mocking smile."You think being loud makes you untouchable
###Chapter 352 Put On A Show Of Authority
Henson was still new to the corporate world, hardly more than a beginner among sharks.



Stories about powerful tycoons had always floated around him-lsaac's name seemed to echo everywhere,a living legend in the business world.


He'd heard plenty about Isaac's achievements, but he had never crossed paths with the man himself.


So, even though the real lsaac stood inches away,Henson didn't recognize him as the force everyone whispered about.


Once his nerves settled, he started believing that these strangers just didn't understand what true influence looked like.



With misplaced confidence, Henson's boldness returned, his fear vanishing as he tried to put on a show of authority borrowed from his boss.


Twisting and squirming,Henson's face turned scarlet as he shouted, "Since you've realized I work for Sherwood Kirk, you'd better let me go now! Around here, Mr.Kirk's word is law. The whole business district  answers to him! Ever heard of Sampson Group?Joseph and Luis might have clout, but even they have to show respect when they stand in front of Mr. Kirk!"



He worked himself into a frenzy, voice cracking and flecks of spit spraying with every boast.


Isaac said nothing, simply narrowing his eyes and fixing Henson with an icy stare from above.


One mercenary shot a look at Isaac and spoke. "Want me to shut him up for good,Mr.Bennett?"


No sooner had the threat been made than the other mercenary slipped a dagger from his boot, pressing the sharp tip right beneath Henson's chin,his movements calm and silent as he waited for the signal.


With the cold steel kissing his skin, Henson's confidence vanished. Fear seized him, leaving him frozen and breathless.


His face was distorted, his eyes so wide it looked as if they might burst from their sockets. Stammering,he tried to muster another threat. "Y-you-if you lay a hand on me, Mr. Kirk will destroy you all. He'll make sure you're left with nothing!"


He clung to Sherwood's name like a lifeline, hoping it would be enough to scare his captors. But his bluff shattered instantly.


The knife at his throat pressed even closer, the steel biting into his skin, cold enough to steal the breath from his lungs.


Each shallow breath fogged the blade, and his mouth went dry, the words catching painfully in his throat until he couldn't force another sound.


Isaac remained unmoved, his expression carved from stone. "You think tossing Sherwood's name around will save you? l, Isaac Bennett, am not the sort who bows to anyone-not even your Mr. Kirk."



His eyes narrowed, a dangerous glimmer flickering in their depths. "It's a waste of breath to threaten me.Out here, no name carries enough weight to shake me.If you want to keep breathing, forget about Sherwood and start following orders. Even if he showed up in person, he couldn't pull you out of this mess."


Isaac pulled his foot back, giving the floor a lazy tap that sent Henson's head snapping sideways.


The knife beneath his chin moved with him,leaving behind a sharp, red line on his cheek that beaded into a thin trail of blood.


Stunned, Henson hardly registered the sting. His shock rooted him in place as he looked up at Isaac. His eyes traveled up from the gleaming shoes, taking in the imposing length of Isaac's frame, the set of his powerful shoulders, and finally landed on that unyielding, stone-cold stare that sent a chill racing down his spine.


Henson's throat bobbed as he swallowed hard,lips quivering as he muttered,"You-you're Isaac Bennett?From Shoildon's Bennett Group?"


His words came out broken, terror and disbelief twisting his voice. He had never imagined he'd cross someone so powerful.


A cold dread washed over him, leaving him breathless and on the verge of collapse. Desperation overtook his pride as he crawled toward Isaac's feet.


"I've never done anything to you, Mr. Bennett! If anyone's caused trouble, it's Sherwood Kirk-not me,"Henson begged, his voice hitching as he pleaded for mercy.


Isaac remained silent, watching with cold detachment.Seeing no response, Henson rushed to add, "Ask me anything-anything about Sherwood. I'll spill it all.I know every dirty trick he's ever pulled, all his secrets!"


Tears and snot streaked down his face as he continued to grovel. "Just let me go. I'll do whatever you say,I swear! If I lie,may I have a miserable fate!" Isaac finally looked down, his eyes filled with nothing but contempt as he regarded the pitiful sight at his feet.



He hadn't picked Henson at random. Luis' list made it clear-Sherwood trusted Henson, keeping him close as a trusted right hand. But clearly, the man crumbled under pressure. On top of that, Henson and Howe had a long-standing feud that made him all the more useful.


A glimmer of cold amusement flickered across Isaac's lips.


With arms folded, he stared down at Henson, his voice sharp as ice. "You're going to tell Sherwood you saw Verena and Howe have a private meeting. Say you couldn't catch their conversation, but you know exactly where and when they met. Make sure you repeat every detail I give you-word for word. Don't slip up, not once."


"Howe?" Henson echoed, his surprise quickly giving way to something darker. The realization dawned-Isaac was setting up Howe,and Henson found himself relishing the idea.


For a moment, he hesitated, and then old resentments came flooding back. He remembered all the times Howe looked down on him, always pushing him into the shadows. Now, for once, the upper hand  was his.



Grinding his teeth, Henson nodded hard. "Understood,Mr. Bennett. I'll handle it-just the way you want."



A crooked smile broke across Henson's face. He'd never cared for Howe, never understood why Sherwood put him on a pedestal. Now, with Isaac's plan in motion, Henson saw his chance to bury Howe for good.


Isaac spotted the hint of satisfaction in Henson's expression, recognizing just how perfectly the pieces were falling into place. Men driven by envy and ambition were the simplest to manipulate-and the most disposable.



He folded his arms, lifted his chin, and delivered a warning that cut straight to the bone. "Just do exactly what I told you. Don't even think about pulling any stunts. If you mess this up, you won't get another warning from me."



The chill in lsaac's voice sent a tremor through Henson.



Desperate to please, Henson bobbed his head,forcing a shaky smile. "Of course, Mr. Bennett. I won't slip up,I promise. Everything will be exactly as you ordered."
###Chapter 353 Fake Footage And Transaction Record
The city lights slid past as the black vehicle made its way through the crowded streets.


Isaac leaned back in the rear seat, closing his eyes for a brief moment before opening them again,lost in his thoughts.


He reached out his phone, his fingers moving with practiced precision as he punched in a number.


A cheerful voice answered almost instantly. "Isaac!What's the occasion? Did you finally get yourself into some trouble?"



The playful tone belonged to Stevie.


A faint grin tugged at Isaac's mouth. "Knock it off,Stevie. I've got work for you."


Sensing the shift in mood, Stevie's voice turned serious. "Name it. What do you need?"


"Ever heard of Sherwood Kirk?" Isaac asked, his tone all business.


Stevie paused, thinkingfor a second. "Yeah, I know  the name. He's a heavyweight in Ochrerayd-right up there with Joseph and Luis. Makes friends in high places."



Isaac's gaze dropped, his voice low and steady. "He's crossed a line with someone very important to me.I want to make sure he pays for it. Here's what l need: use your skills to put together a convincing video of Howe Adams-one of Sherwood's trusted men-meeting with Verena somewhere private. I want it airtight, no room for suspicion. And, while you're at it, funnel some cash to Howe's wife from an untraceable account. I'll send you Howe's photo and his wife's banking info in a boit."



The moment Isaac mentioned "someone very important,"Stevie instantly caught on-Sherwood was targeting Verena. That alone was enough to spark outrage on the other end of the line.


Stevie's voice shot back, loaded with anger, replying,"That stubborn old man really thinks he can go after Verena? He's in for a rude awakening. Don't stress,Isaac. I'll make sure he regrets it."


Within seventy-two hours, Stevie pulled off the job flawlessly.


The fake footage was so seamless, it looked like genuine security cam footage of Howe and Verena having a private meeting-no obvious gaps, nothing that would raise an eyebrow.


Meanwhile,the payment to Howe's wife landed right on schedule, impossible to trace back to lsaac or Stevie.



Every move was made in silence,leaving no evidence behind.



On the other side, Henson was a bundle of nerves,Isaac's threats still fresh in his mind. Resentment toward Howe and dread of what lsaac could do kept him moving.


He grabbed his chance and walked into Sherwood's office.



Sherwood sat at his massive desk, rolling a pen between his fingers. As soon as Henson appeared,Sherwood pinned him with a cold, measuring stare."I have another meeting soon. You've got ten minutes,so don't waste them."



Facing Sherwood, Henson felt a cold sweat bead at his temples. To most, Sherwood played the perfect gentleman, always composed and polite. Those in his inner circle, though, knew there was something far more dangerous beneath the surface.


Trying to steady his nerves, Henson balled his fists and drew a shaky breath.He rolled his shoulders back, lifted his chin, and looked Sherwood in the eye. "Mr. Kirk, there's something you need to hear. Just a few days ago, l caught Howe sneaking off to meet Verena in private."


The words hung in the air. Sherwood's eyes flashed,and the pen he'd been spinning stilled in his grasp.


Encouraged by the reaction, Henson pressed on,chewing his lip as he spoke. "I couldn't hear what they were saying, but I saw them together-no mistake."


Sherwood leaned in, suspicion sharpening his gaze."Are you sure? You'd better not be making this up.If I find out you're lying, you know what'll happen."



Henson nodded his head vigorously, anxiety etched on his face. "I wouldn't dare, sir. I made sure to note down everything-when and where I saw them."


"May 3rd. Lisea Club. I saw it all myself," he added,rattling off the details exactly as Isaac had instructed.


Sherwood reclined in his chair, his face unreadable,shadows flickering in his eyes. Howe had served him faithfully for years-trusted,loyal,always reliable.The accusation didn't fit. And yet...


Sherwood eyed Henson, sizing up the certainty in his voice. For a moment, it almost seemed plausible Even with his doubts, Sherwood kept his poker face.Decades in the game had taught him never to show his hand too soon.



He let out a calm chuckle, waving Henson off. "You've got it twisted. Howe was following Verena on my orders-keeping tabs, nothing more."


Henson's heart skipped. The answer matched Isaac's prediction exactly.


Hiding his nerves, Henson pulled out his phone and navigated to a prepared file. He slid the device across the desk. "Honestly, I thought it might be a misunderstanding at first. I wanted to be sure, so l did a little digging. Here's something I managed to capture-take a look for yourself."



He tapped play, and the screen lit up with footage of Howe and Verena tucked away in a quiet corner,appearing to hold a private exchange.



No sound played, but the image alone hinted at something secretive, their closeness difficult to ignore.



"And that's not all," Henson added, retrieving a document from his briefcase and sliding it across the desk. "I pulled every string I could to get this transaction record-it shows a payment made to Howe's wife from an untraceable account. I didn't want to bring you rumors, Mr. Kirk. You deserve solid  proof. You've always trusted me, and I wanted to make sure you saw the truth for yourself. The whole thing just didn't sit right, and I couldn't let it go unreported."



As soon as the words left his mouth, Henson kept a close watch on Sherwood, gauging every twitch of his face.



Sherwood's expression darkened, his eyes flicking between the damning footage and the transaction record.



An uneasy silence gripped the office, heavy enough to smother the room.



Having spent years under Sherwood's command,Henson recognized the storm brewing just beneath that cold exterior.



Seeing an opening, Henson leaned in, dropping his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Mr. Kirk,look at this carefully. Does any of this feel like a routine surveillance report to you? You said Howe was supposed to keep you in the loop about Verena,right?Has he ever mentioned actually meeting her-face-to -face?"



Sherwood's brow drew tight, the tension in his jaw growing with each second. Not missing a beat,Henson continued, "If everything was above board,he  would've come to you the moment it happened.Instead, you hear nothing until now."



A muscle jumped in Sherwood's cheek. His chest rose and fell in short, sharp bursts, but he stayed quiet,holding his tongue.


Henson drew in a shaky breath and delivered his last push. "And there's something else. The day after that secret meeting, Howe's wife suddenly gets a big deposit from a mystery account. Are we supposed to write that off as luck? Why would Howe hide that from you if everything was clean? It just doesn't add up.Maybe..."


He let the thought hang, just as lsaac had instructed,letting suspicion fill the void.
###Chapter 354 | Cherish My Own Wife
Sherwood had first harbored doubts about what Henson said.



Yet when the evidence was laid before him, his innate skepticism leapt up like a spark in dry grass, and unease slithered into his chest.


Even so, years in the meciless battlefield of business had trained his face into stone; his turmoil was hidden deep, showing only in the taut line of his jaw. That single tightening betrayed the storm raging within.


He raised his head, his eyes sharp as an eagle cutting across the sky, fixingon Henson. His voice now carried a frost that chilled the air. "Very well, I understand.Your loyalty still stands acknowledged. As for this matter,I will investigate it thoroughly. You may go now."



A flick of his hand dismissed Henson.



Henson gave a small nod, his face composed in dutiful respect, though inside he rejoiced quietly-part of his aim had already taken root. With measured steps, he withdrew, shutting the office door as if sealing away secrets. Alone in the office,Sherwood sank back into his chair.Silence pressed down heavily, punctuated only by the steady tick of the wall clock, as though time itself counted toward a reckoning.


His gaze darkened; the pen in his grip had bent beneath the strain of his clenched fist,its cap rapping against the desk like a drum of war.


He narrowed his eyes. Howe had been beside him for years,privy to every shadow-unethical maneuvers in the marketplace, hidden dealings with forces better left unnamed. If Howe truly turned his back and revealed those secrets, Sherwood's empire,painstakingly built brick by brick, could crumble in a single night. That could not-must not-happen.Better to be overly cautious than to let danger grow unseen.



Placing the pen aside, Sherwood folded his arms over his chest,leaning back with deliberate calm.


His gaze hardened, resolve crystallizing; the thought of removing Howe sank like an anchor, pulling deeper by the moment.



And so, plans began to weave in his mind-how to erase Howe with ruthless discretion, how to leave no trace,no whisper, while securing his own safety above all. ...


In a restaurant's VIP room in Ochrerayd, Isaac sat at the head of the table, posture straight, a quiet storm of authority radiating from him. His long lashes shadowed his eyes, masking the currents of thought beneath.



Across from him, Howe hunched slightly, unease etched into his features.



That morning, scarcely had he stepped out of his door when two silent giants seized his arms and bundled him into a car.


Now, faced with Isaac in this room, dread gnawed at him over what command might follow.



Trying to soften the air, Howe spoke first, a note of flattery lacing his tone. "Mr. Bennett, I've done exactly as you ordered. Sherwood hasn't suspected a thing."


Isaac gave no answer, his expression cool as still water.



A silence stretched-then his gaze lifted, cutting directly to Howe's face. His lips parted slowly. "If I'm not mistaken, Sherwood is already scheming how to rid himself of you."



The words froze Howe; shock flashed in his eyes. It took him a long breath to recover, straightening quickly as he protested, "Mr. Bennett,please-don't try to sow discord! I've stood by Sherwood for years.How could he possibly..."



Before he could finish, Isaac lifted a hand,his long fingers tapping the table with lazy precision.



Then he slid forward the forged video and transaction record.



Howe glanced down-and his eyes widened in horror."What...what is this?"



He stared at the footage and the document as if they were snakes. He had never met Verena, nor had his wife seen such a sum!



Isaac,legs crossed and chin tucked,regarded him with a gaze heavy and crushing. "You're not mistaken. 1forged these and had someone hand them to Sherwood."



His lips curved into a thin smile, cold enough to bite."Knowing Sherwood's suspicious nature, do you think he'lI still trust you once these take root in his mind?"


Howe's heart sank. A chill crept up his spine as panic flickered in his eyes. He knew Sherwood well: suspicion was his constant companion. Once doubt took hold, Howe's days were numbered.With Sherwood's ruthless hand, elimination would not take long.



The thought sent shivers racing from his soles to his scalp,his body trembling.


"Mr. Bennett," Howe rasped, his voice strained, "what is it you want from me?"



"You have no choice but to obey," Isaac said calmly,fingers interlaced as he leaned forward. "Work with me openly. Reveal everything Sherwood has done against the Sampson family-leave nothing hidden."


His tone chilled further. "Of course, you can refuse.But remember this: Sherwood already doubts you.Once he acts, your power will be stripped without mercy.And the more you know of his secrets, the more dangerous you become in his eyes. Should he strike, your wife will not be spared. Neither of you will escape."



Howe's hand clawed at his hair; his jaw twitched as panic,hesitation, and rage warred within him.


After a long silence, he suddenly shot upright, eyes wild."But I've stood with Sherwood in so many acts against the Sampson family!"



Veins throbbed on his temples as he shouted, voice breaking. "If Luis learns the truth, how could he ever forgive me? Wouldn't I be facing certain death?" Biting his lip hard, he drew a shaky breath before mustering the courage to say, "Mr. Bennett,forgive me-but I cannot agree to your request."


Isaac did not flare with anger as Howe expected.


Instead, he sat back, calm as ever, the faintest smile on his lips-though it never touched his eyes.


Turning slightly, he signaled to his aide with a soft command. "Escort Mr. Adams out."


Howe blinked in surprise. He had braced for coercion,threats, or endless persuasion-yet Isaac released him with such ease.



After a stunned pause, Howe quickly rose, gave a small bow, and left in haste.



As the door closed, Jacob frowned, glancing at Isaac."Mr.Bennett,it seems Howve won't bend so easily."


Isaac leaned back, shaking his head, his voice rich yet steady. "Human nature seeks to weigh gain against loss. Unless danger presses hard against their throat,they'll never risk it all."



His gaze shifted to the bustling street outside,thoughtful. "Keep watch-if Sherwood makes a move against Howe, we'll fan the flames until the fire roars higher. But under no condition should Howe be  He carries Sherwood's secrets, and they're key to our plans."


At the mention of Sherwood, Isaac frowned,impatience flickering. "Luis is such an obstacle-entangled in trifles, slow to act, hesitant at every step."


Jacob nodded, a hint of knowing humor on his lips."And is that why you push yourself daily, handling everything at once, just to carve out time to aid Mrs.Bennett with her burdens?"



The moment Verena's name was spoken, Isaac's sternness melted. A smile curved his lips, and warmth lit his eyes. "Naturally. I cherish my own wife. She has given so much to me and our family. The least I can do is shoulder these storms for her."
###Chapter 355 Impossible Choice
Howe hobbled out of the restaurant, struggling to keep his composure as he slid into the back seat of his car.



Slumping against the leather, he fought to catch his breath,his pulse still drumming wildly from everything that had happened.


Thinking back on the showdown with lsaac in that private room left his nerves raw and his mind unsettled.


He understood that walking away wasn't the end of it.Turning Isaac down was only going to make things messier.


Sherwood's suspicions had already been circling, and now Howe felt like he was trapped in plain sight,just waiting for disaster to strike.


But staying silent would only look like an admission of guilt,and he knew it.


Staring at his phone, Howe's fingers trembled as he hesitated before finally pressing Sherwood's contact. Sherwood's voice came through the line a moment later,low and unreadable. "Hello?"



Clearing his throat, Howe forced himself to speak up."Mr. Kirk, it's me. Howe."


There was a beat of silence, and then Sherwood replied, his tone flat, "What do you want?"


Panic rising, Howe rushed to explain himself. "Mr. Kirk,that video and transaction record you've seen-they're fake. Isaac set the whole thing up to make you doubt me. You have to know l've always stood by you,no matter what. Please, you've got to believe me."


A heavy pause lingered on the other end before Sherwood finally answered, voice unshaken, "I've heard what you have to say. I'll decide for myself what's real and what's not. Just focus on the work l gave you."


When the call ended, Howe let out a shaky breath,but relief never came. His nerves felt as tight as ever.


All he could do now was hope his loyalty would count for something in Sherwood's eyes.



Across town, Sherwood set his phone down on the desk, a deep furrow in his brow.



He left his seat and crossed the room to the wide  window, hands clasped tightly behind him.


Staring down at the traffic below, his eyes grew cold and distant, like a storm gathering on the horizon.



Howe's desperate words rang hollow in his ears.



Real or not, the video and transaction record changed everything. Howe was too involved, too knowledgeable-and with Isaac fixing his eyes on him,things had reached a breaking point.


A cold sneer twisted Sherwood's lips as he muttered to himself, "So this is how it is. If you've forced my hand, don't expect any mercy."



He strode over to his desk, picked up the phone, and dialed a number with a sinister glint in his eye. A cold,twisted smile touched his lips as he said, "Tell the men I've trained for years it's time for a real job."



A low murmur came from the other end. Sherwood listened,his grin only sharpening, the threat in his eyes becoming unmistakable.


He straightened, voice as sharp as broken glass. "No loose ends. I want him gone. That's the price for betraying me."


Jacob caught wind of Sherwood's orders and wasted no time, rushing back to the restaurant where Isaac waited. Jacob entered in a hurry and delivered his report. "Mr.Bennett, Sherwood's already set things in motion.He's got his most trusted enforcers ready to make a move on Howe. These men aren't amateurs-they're hitmen,and Howe doesn't stand a chance if we don't act fast."



Waiting for further instruction, Jacob fixed his gaze on Isaac.



A single brow lifted as Isaac let a cold smirk slip onto his face. His voice was low and resolute. "Good work.We stick to the plan. Reach out to Howe right away.Tell him we have proof Sherwood is sending men for him. He needs to disappear now."


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood. I'll see to it immediately."



He spun on his heel and hurried from the private room.



Meanwhile, at home, Howe sat talking with his wife when Jacob's warning came through.



As the news registered-assassins were coming for him on Sherwood's orders-Howe froze in shock, disbelief etched deep in his face. "Are you serious?" he asked,voice strained.



Jacob wasn't surprised. He stayed calm and moved fast. "Check your inbox. I just sent the evidence. Look it over and call me when you're ready to talk." As soon as the call ended, Howe opened the file and stared, thunderstruck by what he saw.


Gabby Adams, his wife, walked in from the kitchen carrying two mugs of coffee. Noticing the horror on Howe's face, she set the mugs down and leaned in,her gaze falling on the strange tattoos in the photos.


"Honey, what's with those tattoos on their necks?" she asked,worry lacing her words.


Words failed Howe. He just sat there, throat tight,unable to answer.


At last, Howe found his voice. "These men-Sherwood's private killers. He trained them for years,planning to take down the Sampson family. Now he's decided I'm the first to test their abilities."



A cold shudder ran through him, settling deep in his bones.



It was unthinkable that after all his loyalty, Sherwood would turn around and mark him for death.



His hand slackened around the phone, and he slumped back against the sofa, weighed down by the impossible choice he now faced.



Sherwood was ready to see him gone. Isaac, on the other hand, was offering a lifeline-but only if Howe was willing to cooperate.



After a long inner battle, Howe finally called Jacob back.



He made his decision. For now, he would go with Isaac's plan and disappear before Sherwood's men could find him.


Soon,with Isaac's help, Howe and Gabby slipped away into hiding at a safe house no one else knew about.


Days passed, and when Sherwood realized Howe had vanished, his temper exploded.


He grabbed the nearest cup and sent it flying across the office. The crash echoed off the walls,coffee splattering everywhere.


"Useless! Every last one of you!" he shouted,the veins on his forehead throbbing with rage.


To Sherwood, Howe's escape screamed guilt. In his mind, only someone with something to hide would run.


He stormed around his office, curses tumbling from his lips, the fury in him building by the second.


"Find him. I don't care what it takes-track him down!"Sherwood's voice boomed,cold and absolute.


His eyes burned with a wild intensity, promising  retribution if Howe was ever brought back alive.



He understood the risk. Howe knew every secret,every hidden detail. If the wrong people got to him first, Sherwood's empire could come crashing down.



Meanwhile, Isaac took the news of Sherwood's meltdown in stride.


Leaning back in his chair, he crossed his arms, the hint of a smile on his face as Jacob waited for instructions."Now's our window," said lsaac, his gaze sharp."Sherwood's scrambling. We need to act."


Jacob nodded. "Just say the word, Mr. Bennett.What's next?"


Isaac's lips curled into a calculating smile. "Spread the news. Let everyone know Howe's got evidence that Sherwood was behind the Sampson family's troubles all those years back, and he's ready to take it to the police."
###Chapter 356 No Matter What It Takes
Isaac's words settled in the air, and Jacob offered a small nod. After a moment's hesitation, he spoke up."Mr.Bennett, when this gets out, Sherwood's going to lose his mind. If he panics, he might get reckless.Should we be preparing for what he might do next?"


Isaac dismissed the concern with a wave of his hand,his voice steady. "Let him stew. Sherwood's already backed into a corner. The more he freaks out, the more he'll slip up. All we have to do is sit tight and watch him unravel. As soon as the news hits, he'll bend over backward to keep Howe from saying a word.That desperation will show his real face soon enough."



A thoughtful look crossed Jacob's face before he nodded again. "That makes sense,Mr. Bennett. I'll handle the arrangements right away."



Without waiting for a reply, Jacob spun on his heel and hurried out.



Efficiency was one of Jacob's strengths. Word of Howe's so-called plan quickly reached Sherwood.



True to Isaac's prediction, the news threw Sherwood into a frenzy. Already rattled by Howe's sudden disappearance,Sherwood felt as if the ground had been ripped out from under him. He was painfully aware that if Howe talked to the police, the Sampson family would destroy him, and his reputation would be left in ruins.



The realization left Sherwood teetering between panic and rage.



Pacing his office, he locked his hands behind his back,each step striking the floor with a forceful thud.


His eyes, dark with frustration, burned with spite as he muttered to himself, "Howe Adams,you backstabber.After everything l've done for you, this is how you repay me?"


Sherwood suddenly stopped in his tracks and punched in a number on his phone.


As soon as the call connected, he asked, "Did you track him down yet?"


His subordinate's voice trembled through the receiver."Mr. Kirk, Howe's slipped through every net we've thrown out. We've searched everywhere-there's no sign of him. We're going to need more time."



"Time?" Sherwood's voice exploded, his fist crashing onto the desk. The force sent documents flying and coffee sloshing dangerously close to the edge. "I don't care what it costs," he barked,the words sharp as knives. "I want Howe found, no matter what it takes.Bring him to me-alive or dead. And hear me-if he opens his mouth, not one of you will walk away unscathed!"



The subordinate stammered a promise, barely managing to squeak out a reply under Sherwood's blistering rage.


Sherwood yanked his tie loose, trying to breathe past his anger. "Put your best people on the police station.I want eyes everywhere. If anything changes, you let me know first."



A nervous affirmation crackled through the line before he ended the call.


On the outskirts of Ochrerayd, a dull house sat shrouded in gloom, the air inside heavy with tension.



Howe slumped on the sofa, fatigue etched into every line of his face. His hair stuck up in wild tufts, and deep shadows ringed his eyes-a testament to too many restless nights.



Gabby peered anxiously through the curtains before turning to him. "It's been five days, love. We're completely in the dark out here."


Howe rose and crossed the room to her, offering a reassuring hand. "We're walking a razor's edge, Gabby.Isaac's the only one who can keep us safe now.Sherwood won't stop hunting us, but as long as we stick to Isaac's plan, we have a chance."
###Chapter 357 Threats And Sweeteners
At the Sampson Villa,moonlight spilled through the thin curtains, washing Verena's room in a cold,silvery haze.



Isaac stepped inside and spotted Verena perched on the bed, flipping idly through a magazine.


Just seeing her there seemed to lift the fatigue from his shoulders. His pace softened as he moved closer.


"Verena, I don't think we've actually talked all day," he said, easing down beside her and slipping an arm gently arouund her. His words carried a mix of exhaustion and quiet affection.



Verena set her magazine aside, concern flickering in her eyes as she studied him.



Isaac's late nights and early mornings had started to take their toll, with shadows darkening his eyes. She reached over and brushed his hair back. "Isaac,something's weighing on you, isn't it? You look dead on your feet."


He gave a small nod, meeting her gaze. "There's something important I need to share with you." Verena fell silent, her attention fixed on him.


After a deep breath, Isaac began to explain everything -how he made Howe a pawn, how he schemed against Sherwood, every step of his latest battle.



Verena listened, her face growing more solemn with each detail. By the end, her brow was tightly knitted in worry.



Silence hung between them for a moment before she spoke. "I remember seeing Howe outside Sherwood's place once. He struck me as odd, so I checked up on him afterward."



Her voice turned sharp, every syllable steady. "From what you've told me, it has to be Sherwood who orchestrated my disappearance. Howe must have been his accomplice."



Isaac squeezed her hand, his tone reassuring. "Don't worry,Verena. I promised I'd get answers for you.Howe knows the truth, and tomorrow morning, I'll go straight to him."



Verena didn't hesitate. "I want to be there too," she insisted,her voice steady.



Isaac could see she needed to hear the truth straight from Howe.He gave a reassuring nod. "Of course. We'll face this together."


A small smile broke through Verena's worry as she rested her head on his shoulder, her heart caught somewhere between relief and concern.



"So all this running around, you've only done it for me,"she said softly, a hint of worry in her tone. "You just got back on your feet. You shouldn't exhaust yourself."


Isaac tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, his words gentle. "Don't say that. You're my wife. If it's for you,nothing is ever too much."



Morning sunlight poured through the curtains,spreading warmth across their bed.


By sunrise, Isaac and Verena were already up, quickly preparing to leave. Soon, they were on the road to the house where Howe was hiding out.



A heavy silence hung between them as they drove.Verena wrestled with her emotions, torn between wanting answers and the bitterness of knowing how Sherwood had fooled her parents and brother all these years, causing them pain.



Isaac noticed the tension in her posture and slipped his hand into hers, his rough thumb tracing slow,soothing circles across her palm. When they finally arrived, Howe was still planted on the sofa, while Gabby kept her hands busy, trying to distract herself with small tasks.



The door swung open quietly, and Isaac's silhouette filled the doorway. Howe stiffened instantly, unease written across his face.



Spotting Verena at Isaac's side only deepened his unease, and his eyes dropped to the floor.


Verena stood tall, every inch the consummate professional, her poise unshaken by the tension in the room.



Howe pushed himself up from the sofa, lips parting as if to speak, but no words found their way out.



"We're not here to waste time, Howe. I have some questions, and I expect honest answers," Verena said,her voice ringing with clarity and a touch of frost.


Unable to meet her eyes, Howe dropped his gaze.shifting uncomfortably.


His wife caught the silent cue and quietly slipped away,giving them space.


As the room fell quiet, Howe swallowed and finally remarked, "Mrs. Bennett, ask me anything you need to know. Verena steadied herself with a slow breath. "I want the truth about what happened all those years ago. Was it Sherwood who planned my disappearance? And what exactly wvas your part in it?"


Despite bracing himself for this moment, Howe's hands shook ever so slightly at her directness.


After a long pause, he nodded, voice low. "It's true.Sherwood was behind everything. He set it up hoping to hurt your father and line his own pockets.As for me,1... I handled some of the dirty work because he told me to."


A spark of anger flashed in Verena's eyes. "You knew what you were doing would ruin lives. How could you go along with it?"


Regret crept into Howe's voice, his shoulders slumping."I was scared out of my mind. Sherwood threatened my family. He said if I didn't help, they'd pay the price.I lost my nerve. I couldn't see another way out..."


Back then, Sherwood didn't just corner Howe by using his family as leverage.



He also laid out an offer that was too tempting to ignore. If Howe agreed to help him stage Verena's disappearance, he'd walk away with a hefty payout and find himself rising fast through the ranks of Sherwood's company. For as long as he could remember, Howe had craved status and money. Presented with Sherwood's tantalizing offer, he hadn't even hesitated before getting his hands dirty.


But now, under Verena's unwavering gaze,he realized confessing everything would only seal his own fate.


Desperate, Howe decided to play down his involvement and pin the blame entirely on Sherwood.


Isaac, however, had seen too much to be fooled by such a performance. Years in cutthroat boardrooms had trained him to spot the lies hiding behind a mask of regret.


To most, Howe's words might sound humble and desperate. Isaac heard only self-preservation and half -truths.


Sherwood never relied on threats alone; he was the kind of man who mixed promises of fortune with a touch of menace, always knowing how to bait his traps.



A slow, cold grin spread across Isaac's face, but it carried no hint of kindness. He leaned in, voice dry with sarcasm. "So that's how it is, Howe? You really think you can brush me off with half-truths? You think I've spent a lifetime in business and can't see through your games?" Howe visibly flinched.



All that bravado vanished. In Isaac's eyes, his so-called cunning was nothing but a pitiful display.


Howe's shoulders caved, hands curling into tight fists at his sides. Sweat broke out across his brow. Dread crawled up his spine as the weight of the situation closed in on him. There was no escape, and if he kept the truth buried any longer, Isaac, with all that he was capable of, would unleash consequences far worse than he could bear.


After a shaky breath, Howe finally forced himself to meet Isaac's gaze, eyes wide with fear. "Mr. Bennett,you're right. I shouldn't have tried to hide anything.The truth is, Sherwood not only threatened me-he offered me a huge payoff and a big promotion if l helped him. I let my greed get the better of me.That's why I agreed to his plan."
###Chapter 358 The Entire Truth
"Howe, since you've started confessing, I want the entire truth-every detail," Verena said,her stare cold and unflinching.



Howe's hand shook as he wiped sweat from his brow."Sherwood called me into his office one afternoon.Once the door shut, he speled everything out. He slid a photograph of you across the desk and told me if l made you disappear, the rewards he promised would be mine."



He faltered, searching for the nerve to continue.


Isaac's voice cut through the silence. "Don't stall. Tell us exactly how you pulled it off." His eyes narrowed,glintingwith suspicion.



After a long gulp, Howe added, looking at Verena,"Back then, I'd studied the hospital's layout and memorized the nurses' rotation schedule. On the third night after you were born, I dressed as a member of the staff and used forged identification to slip into the maternity ward without raising suspicion. Your mother was resting alone in the room when I arrived. I walked up to the crib, lifted you into my arms, and wrapped  you carefully in a blanket I'd brought with me.Without hesitation, I carried you out and left the room behind."



Verena's voice cracked through the room, raw with anger. "Did you really think you could get away with that? What about the cameras? The security?"



The accusation sent a shiver through Howe. He struggled to steady his voice. "Sherwood thought of everything. He paid off the chief of security to cut the cameras near the ward right before I went in. He even set up a getaway car waiting at the back exit. The second I left the building, I got into that car."


Verena's tone was razor-sharp. "What happened after that? What exactly did Sherwood intend for me?"



Howe's eyes dropped to the floor, his voice barely more than a whisper. "After I took you, I followed Sherwood's orders and drove out to a remote village I thought my part would end once I handed you off.But things started falling apart. The contact who was supposed to take you vanished, wouldn't answer any calls. I panicked and phoned Sherwood. He lost his temper and told me to clean up the mess myself. He even said... if there was no way out, I could get rid of you for good."



As the words left his lips, his hands shook. Fear and shame flickered across his face. "I couldn't bring  myself to do it. No matter how desperate I got,you were just a baby."


Fora split second, regret flashed in his eyes, but the darkness of old choices swallowed it quickly.


"I scrambled for another way out. I remembered an old friend who had ties with several maternity hospitals, so I got the contacts from my friend, and then ordered my men to reach out and see if anyone could help."



Howe's gaze flickered to lsaac and Verena, catching the storm brewing in their expressions. He quickly looked away,voice even softer.


"It just so happened there was a hospital where a woman collapsed during childbirth, and her newborn didn't make it. I grabbed the chance and told Sherwood right away. He said to bring you over immediately. He would line up the surgeon to smooth things over. I hurried you to the hospital, and everything went off just as Sherwood wanted."



His throat felt like sandpaper as he swallowed hard.



When Howe finally glanced up again, his voice came out rough and small. "That couple... they never found out their own baby was gone before you took her place."
###Chapter 359 You've Got Some Nerve
Verena could not move,her entire body numb with shock as she tried to process Howe's confession. For a moment, the world faded around her.


"So... I ended up as Laura and Alec's daughter because of a scheme like this?" she whispered,barely believing her own words.



Isaac stepped in and pulled Verena close, wrapping her upin his embrace. His hand moved gently over her shoulder, trying to chase away the chill that had settled into her bones.


He shot Howe a look so cold it could have turned stone to ice. "Howe, you and Sherwood will answer for everything you've done. Don't think a confession gets you off the hook. After you sent Verena away,what did Sherwood do next?"



Terror flickered in Howe's eyes beneath the weight of Isaac's demand.



Whatever courage he had left collapsed. With a heavy thud, Howe dropped to his knees, head bowed in defeat. "Mr. Bennett, after Sherwood had me get rid of your wife, he set his sights on the Sampson family. He wormed his way into the Sampsons' trust, slowly sinking his claws into the company."


Isaac squeezed Verena's hand, his grip steady, his voice relentless. "What happened after that?"


Howe's shoulders sagged. "Not long ago, when word got out that the Sampson family had found their long -lost daughter,Sherwood rushed back to the city. He saw you at her side and panicked. He realized if his secrets came out, he'd be ruined. That's when he dragged me into more of his schemes, trying to get rid of both you and your wife..."



Howe's words faded, and he bowed even lower,unable to look up.


A cold determination filled Verena. Her hands balled into fists as she locked eyes with Howe, her gaze sharp as flame. "So Sherwood sent you to keep tabs on me,waiting for his chance to strike after l'd cured him?"



Howe's entire frame shook; he was unable to meet Verena's stare. He nodded frantically, words tumbling out in a faint, trembling rush. "Yes, Mrs. Bennett.That's exactly it. Sherwood wanted to tie up every loose end. He told me to keep an eye on you, and the moment you managed to cure him, I was supposed to alert his men." Isaac's presence beside Verena was like thunderclouds gathering-his face carved in shadow.



"You've got some nerve, Howe Adams," Isaac said,his voice cutting through the tension like a blade.



The accusation hung in the air, echoing in every corner of the room.



Howe collapsed in on himself, bowing again and again."Mr.Bennett, I'm sorry-I truly am! I let greed and fear get the best of me. Sherwood tempted me, and I lost all sense of right and wrong. Please, forgive me. I'll do whatever it takes to make this right."



Tears streaked down his cheeks, his words thick with regret.



Verena drew in a slow, steady breath, fighting to steady her emotions. Her eyes swept over Howe's pathetic figure. "Regret won't erase what you've done,"she said, voice cold and unyielding.



Without a backward glance, Verena straightened and strode for the door, chin lifted high.


Isaac watched her leave, a knot of pain and fury twisting inside him.



He cast one last,chilling look at Howe-his expression promising retribution, just not yet. Then Isaac turned and went after Verena, his tall frame a silent promise of protection as he walked at her side.
###Chapter 360 There's No Way Sherwood Is Getting....
 Inside the car, Isaac pulled a small recorder from his pocket, the device still warm from running nonstop through Howe's confession.



He studied Verena with a look of grim resolve."This recording is our ticket to finally taking Sherwood down.But audio alone won't hold up in court. We'll need to work with Luis, dig up the evidence Howe talked about. Luis has the connections to make that happen -he knows Sherwood's every weakness."



Verena gave a determined nod. "Let's not waste any time.We need to see him right away."


Without delay, they made their way to Luis' office.Luis looked up in surprise as they entered but quickly flashed a welcoming smile, motioning for them to sit.


Isaac didn't bother with small talk. He set the recorder on the desk and pressed play, letting Howe's confession fill the room.



Luis listened, his expression growing darker wvith every passing second. Deep lines furrowed his brow as Howe's voice spun its tale of betrayal and greed. By the time the audio finished, Luis' anger could no longer be contained.


He shot to his feet, hands slamming down on the desk with a thunderous crack.



Papers jumped, a mug nearly toppled, and a pen clattered to the floor.



"Sherwood Kirk is a monster!" Luis screamed,his voice raw with rage. His face reddened, veins bulging at his temples.



His eyes burned with hatred, as if Sherwood were standing within arm's reach, and he was ready to rip him to shreds. "I actually used to see him as someone worth admiring. But he threw all that away for money and went as far as using a newborn to get what he wanted. Verena has spent all these years drowning in misery because of what he did, robbed of the life she should've had. And my parents, they were dragged through all that heartache for absolutely nothing."



Luis' next words came out hard and slow, anger sharpening each syllable. "All this time, I thought we were indebted to him and repaid his family with money and projects. Without us, the Kirk family never would've gotten so far."



Luis turned toward Verena and Isaac, determination blazing in his eyes. "Verena. Isaac. I swear to you-Sherwood will answer for everything he's done," Luis said, voice steady but trembling with the force of his resolve. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles blanched, every muscle in his arms coiled with anger.


Isaac held Luis' gaze, his tone measured but firm."There's no forgiveness for a man like Sherwood.I promise you, he'll face every consequence, down to the last."



Verena stood silently beside them, watching the fire in Luis' eyes, a swell of gratitude blooming inside her chest.



She stepped closer, her words gentle yet unyielding."Luis, we need your help to finish this. We came to discuss a plan with you. Sherwood has run free long enough, and now it's time for justice. We won't let him walk away from what he's done."



Verena's life had begun with hope-she was the child everyone in the family longed for, the center of their dreams. Before any of that love could reach her, she was stolen away and lost to them.



That loss never faded for Luis. The pain ran deeper each time he remembered it. He squeezed Verena's shoulder, meeting her gaze with unwavering conviction. "You mean the world to me, Verena. No one will ever lay a hand on you again. I'll see to it personally that anyone who tries will regret it."


Belonging washed over Verena, a feeling so powerful it stung her eyes with tears. She managed a shaky smile and nodded, voice soft with gratitude. "I believe you,Luis.I always have."



Isaac stepped forward, enveloping her in a protective embrace. "With the three of us standing together,there's no way Sherwood's getting away."
###Chapter 361 It's Time To Let Go Of Your Feelings F...
Night had fallem over the Kirk estate, and Molly stood in the wide expanse of Sherwood's study,her gaze fixed on the polished floor.



Frustration burmed in her eyes.After she wrestled with her thoughts, she fimally found the courage to say."Dad. Verena's been letting people go left and right.It's turning into chaos, and everyone's worried, Jared and some of the others keep coming to me for answers,but I honestly have no idea what to tell them.She holds a higher position than I do, which means there's nothing I cam do to stop her, I've tried everything,but I just can't figure out how to get those people she let go rehired."


Sherwood was lost in paperwork, but the moment he heard her words, he froze and raised his head, eyes narrowing with suspicion. "Really? Verena actually dares to stir up trouble inside the company now?"


A new concem crossed Molly's mind. Fighting back tears,she pressed her lips together before she said,"And...Luis,he turned me down again, I triedreaching out, but he just won't talk to me." As soon as she brought up Luis, the dam broke. Tears slid down her cheeks, soaking into her blouse. "Dad, I just don't understand why Luis refuses to give me a shot. I've done a lot of things for him, but he won't even look my way."


Watching his daughter break down left Sherwood feeling helpless, an ache settling deep in his chest.


Letting out a tired sigh, he rounded his desk and quietly approached her.


He stepped closer and rested his hand softly on Molly's shoulder, offering what little comfort he could.


Meanwhile, Henson's recent report and Howe's unexplained disappearance replayed in his mind,adding another layer of worry to his thoughts.


He was certain that Luis and Verena had already pieced together most of the truth about the past, and every day the odds seemed to tip further against him.


Breaking the silence, Sherwood finally called out,"Molly."



His voice carried a rough edge as he said, "It's time to let go of your feelings for him. The Sampson family is against us now, and that fact isn't going to change."



Determination flickered in his eyes while his fingers  curled tightly at his side. "We can't afford to let personal attachments distract us from what needs to be done."



The words left Molly in shock. She stared at Sherwood,unable to hide her disbelief. "Dad, how could the Sampsons suddenly be our enemies? And what about Luis?"



"Luis and Verena are both out to destroy me."



That revelation made Molly freeze, her breath catching as she struggled to process what he'd just confessed.



Sherwood paused for a steadying breath, and then continued, "Molly, there's a lot I tried to protect you from because I didn't want you to get hurt. But I can't keep it from you anymore."


"In the past, I did something underhanded, all in an effort to undercut the Sampson family's business.Verena's disappearance was tangled up in that as well.Now that Luis and Verena know the truth, there's no way they'll forgive or forget."



After listening to Sherwood's confession, Molly simply stood there in stunned silence, unable to move or respond.



Years spent by Luis' side had taught her everything about his character. She realized that if Luis ever learned the truth about Sherwood's actions against his family, any hope of salvaging their relationship would vanish completely.


The thought made Molly's heart sink. "Dad,how could you do this? Do you have any idea what you've put me through? If Luis ever finds out, he'll never forgive mne."



Tears overwhelmed her, and she dropped to the floor,hands covering her face as sobs wracked her body.


Sherwood lowered himself beside her and wrapped her in a gentle embrace. "Molly, please don't cry.What's done is already behind us. All we can do now is figure out a solution. You have to be strong, for the Kirk family's sake. We can't afford to fall apart right now."



He kept patting Molly's back, trying to offer some comfort.



Eventually, Molly's tears slowed, and she glanced up wvith fierce determination shining in her eyes. "Dad,what are we supposed to do next? I can't just walk away from Luis. I need to find him, tell him the truth,and hope he'lI listen to me."



She wiped her face and made to leave the room.



Sherwood reached for her arm, his expression stern."Molly, stop! Rushing over to Luis now will only create more problems. We need to come up with a polan before making any moves toward him or Verena."
###Chapter 362 Uprooting



After their last strategy meeting, Verena wasted no time pushing forward with her plan to eliminate every Kirk family supporter in the company.



Inside the CEO's office at Benedict Pharmaceuticals,a small group had gathered, including Molly, who stood tense among them.



Despite the flawless makeup, the fear in Molly's eyes was unmistakable.



Only last night had Sherwood revealed those old secrets, so now she found herself unsettled in Verena's presence.



The memory weighed on her, and Molly sneaked a nervous glance at Verena.



Verena, arms folded andleaning against the desk,regarded everyone with an unyielding stare.



Sensing Molly's attention, Verena looked up, and their eyes briefly locked.


Caught off guard, Molly quickly looked away, avoiding Verena's gaze as her nerves spiked.


 
A faint, mocking smirk played at the corners of Verena's mouth. She clearly noticed Molly's discomfort.


Turning her attention back to the rest, Verena's eyes swept the room.



Her voice cut through the tension, cool and decisive."I called you all here today because there are problems within the company that need addressing."



Without warning, Verenafixed her gaze on a man in glasses. "Your project from last month is way behind schedule, and your report is full of errors. Is this what you call professional?"



The man fidgeted and couldn't manage a reply.



Her focus shifted to someone else. "As for you, you used company resources for your own benefit. Did you think the rules in this company don't apply to you?"



That employee kept his eyes glued to the floor, too intimidated to answer Verena.



Verena didn't hold back. She laid into each person with harsh, unfiltered criticism, making sure everyone in the room felt the pressure.



With a casual glance, Verena eyed the three employees who hadn't dared to speak up. She lifted her chin and announced, "The rest of you aren't off the hook. You know exactly what you've done." Her tone left no room for argument. "There are clear rules in this company, and you're not immune to the consequences. Starting now, you're all suspended for a month. Try to push back and you'll be out of a job entirely."


A wave of anxiety passed through the group as they exchanged uneasy glances. Their hands clenched tighter, and their heads hung even lower than before.


Once she'd finished addressing the group,Verena set her sights on Molly, her stare unwavering. "Molly,these people report to you. Their mistakes reflect directly on your leadership,which means you've failed in your role."


Molly's whole body went rigid. Color drained from her cheeks, and though she tried to defend herself,Verena's icy glare shut her down before she could speak.


Verena added, "You're suspended as well, effective immediately. While you're out, I expect a detailed report on your shortcomings and your plans for improvement. When you have an answer for me, I'll decide if you're fit to come back."



It was obvious to everyone in the room that this supposed suspension was just Verena's first step in seizing control. To Molly and the others, this so-called "suspension"was nothing more than a cover for Verena to bring in her own loyal supporters.


Never in her life had Molly felt so humiliated. Rage and pain churned inside her as she dug her nails into her palms,trying desperately not to break down.


But finally, she couldn't hold back anymore. Her voice trembled as she shouted, "Verena, this is too much!These people have given years to this company. How can you just cast them aside? Who gave you the authority to treat us this way?"



Verena didn't bother to respond. She simply nodded toward the door and told the other employees, "You may go now."


Without another word, the suspended employees slipped out, frustration and defeat written all over their faces.



Once the office door clicked shut, Verena turned her attention back to Molly. "You want to know what gives me authority?"



A cold, dismissive laugh slipped from Verena's lips before she replied, "The answer is simple, I'm the CEO of this company. My title alone is enough. Your failure to lead has put everything at risk. Molly, if you want to keep your job, I suggest you follow my orders Otherwise, you'll have to face the consequences yourself."



Verena's warning made Molly's eyes flash wide with outrage, her breaths coming quicker as anger bubbled up inside her.



She snapped back, her voice ringing with accusation,"Who are you kidding with this so-called suspension?I'm not blind, Verena. Don't try to fool me with these fake reasons. I know exactly what you're up to. First,uprooting my entire team, and now you're coming after me. It's obvious you're pushing me out so you can claim the company for yourself."



Her frustration boiled over, and she marched toward Verena, her heels striking the floor with unmistakable force.



Fists clenched tight, Molly stood her ground, as though she was bracing for a confrontation with Verena.



Verena didn't flinch. Her gaze remained steady, eyes glacial and unyielding, with a mocking smirk spreading across her face. "And if I am?"



She narrowed her eyes, her tone colder than ever."Have you ever stopped to think about what your father had really done, Molly?"



The directness of Verena's question left Molly  momentarily stunned.


She faltered for a short moment, instinctively breaking eye contact and knotting her hands together in front of her, the pain grounding her as she tried to regain her composure.


She refused to give in, shaking her head defiantly."That's a lie! My father never did anything to you. Stop spreading these ridiculous accusations!"


Even though her words sounded resolute, Molly's unsteady voice made her anxiety impossible to hide.


Verena had no patience for Molly's act. She spoke with deliberate clarity. "Drop the charade, Molly. Let's get one thing straight. I'm here to bring down the Kirk family for good."



She paused, eyes burning with conviction. "Not long after I was born, your father had me taken away. That decision changed my entire life, turning my family's world upside down. All the pain we endured traces back to your family, and now it's time you faced the consequences."



Tilting her chin, Verena cast a frosty, almost superior look at Molly.



Her tone sharpened as she spoke. "You weren't even born yet when all this happened, so for now, you're not my target. But I expect you to resign from this company. Remember, Benedict Pharmaceuticals has always belonged to the Sampson family. I'm not stealing it, I'm just taking back what's ours. Just because you've been here for years doesn't make it yours."


The calm finality in her voice struck Molly like a physical blow, each sentence cutting deeper than the last.


All strength drained from Molly's legs, leaving her unsteady. Panic flashed across her face as she struggled to keep standing.


She tried to respond, but her lips quivered and no sound came out, her voice caught by the weight of shock.


Verena's icy stare didn't waver, unmoved by Molly's obvious distress.


While Molly trembled with outrage, overwhelmed by the loss of everything she'd worked for, Verena seemed to remember something else. With a slight arch of her brow, she added coolly, "One more thing."



A wary glance passed from Molly as she met Verena's gaze, uncertain of what might come next.
###Chapter 363 Negotiation



Verena said, "You can be the one to tell your father the truth that I never treated his illness."



She paused, watching Molly for a reaction before adding, "Any improvement he feels is nothing more than a trick of his own mind."



All the color drained from Molly's cheeks,her anger replaced by sheer disbelief. The news left her feeling weak and unsteady.



Desperation took over as she gripped the desk and shouted,her voice raw, "How could you do something so cruel?"



She continued, her voice trembling, "Did you ever actually trust our family? Aren't doctors supposed to save lives, not play games with them? You're unbelievably cruel. Don't think you'll escape the consequences-karma always catches up!"



Molly's usual poise had vanished. Her hair was out of place,and streaks of ruined makeup marked her angry face.



Meanwhile, Verena stayed completely composed,regarding Molly with detached indifference, as if she were just another unreasonable complaint.



"Karma?" Verena echoed, her tone almost amused. "If karma really exists, then Sherwood should be the first to face it. What he's done is far worse than anything you're accusing me of. I only help people who deserve it."



Verena's eyes narrowed, and she spoke with deliberate precision. "Sherwood lost any claim to my help a long time ago. Everything he's done to me and the Sampson family can't simply be forgiven. After all the harm he's caused, do you really expect me to just let it go and act like none of it happened?"



Taking a slow step forward, Verena locked eyes with Molly and gave a faint, fearless smile. "I have no regrets about my choice. If you want to call me cruel,then so be it. I'll carry that burden without shame."


Molly stood frozen, staring at Verena in shock, utterly unable to react.



Elsewhere, Isaac had just finished going through the documents about Sherwood's potential investments,materials that Luis had carefully compiled. Wasting no time,he set up meetings with the key players heading the project.



Inside an exclusive club at Ochrerayd,the glow from a majestic crystal chandelier bathed the room in a warm light.


Isaac, impeccably dressed in a tailored black suit,sat with perfect posture on a sleek leather sofa.


A glass of rich wine rested on the table in front of him,its scent filling the air.



He brought the glass to his lips, savoring a slow,measured sip.



Gathered around him were the project leaders, each wearing a different expression, though worry and uncertainty flickered in all their eyes.



With another unhurried taste of his wine, Isaac set his glass down, his movements controlled and confident.



He let his gaze drift across the table, and then leaned in and broke the silence. "Thank you all for coming,everyone. I wanted to discuss the smart city project with you personally. With the Bennett family's support,I have no doubt we can make this venture far more successful than anyone imagined."



His voice, deep and commanding, carried a charisma that filled the room and left an impression on everyone present.



A ripple of unease passed among his guests as they exchanged wary looks. Finally, a portly, middle-aged man, clearly the main leader, cleared his throat and addressed Isaac with a measured tone. "Mr. Bennett, there's no question about your reputation, and everyone knows the Bennett family's influence in this industry."



He paused for a moment, a strained smile tugging at his lips while his brow knitted tighter. "But you have to understand. Ochrerayd is the Kirk and Sampson families' stronghold. Getting caught up in a dispute with either of them is a nightmare for us. Mr. Sampson has a lot of sway as well. Once we make a deal with that side, backing out would mean outright conflict.Honestly, Mr. Kirk approached us about this project a month ago. His company's credentials and financial power were more than enough, so after weighing all options, we signed with him. You stepping in now puts us in a really complicated position."



He let out a defeated sigh, the worry etched on his face making his reluctance clear.


The bald man beside him chimed in, "That's right, Mr.Bennett. This isn't only about upsetting the Kirk family.In our line of work, reputation and trust mean everything. We've already committed to working with Mr. Kirk. How could we just walk away from that agreement now? People would hear about it, and we'd never recover our credibility in Ochrerayd." He gestured helplessly, as if to show how little room they had to maneuver.



Throughout the exchange, Isaac listened without interruption, a gentle smile fixed in place, but there was a glint of irony in his eyes that didn't quite reach his lips.



Everyone here was a veteran in business, each one sharp and calculating.


Their talk about "reputation and trust" was just a polished front.


The truth was simple. Sherwood's offer was far too tempting to refuse, and their longstanding history with the Kirk family made them wary of burning bridges.


The Bennett Group had influence, sure,but its empire was rooted in Shoildon.



From their perspective, taking a stand against Sherwood in his own territory felt far more dangerous than upsetting an outside powerhouse.



Isaac's gaze sharpened as he slowly looked around,sizing up everyone at the table.


Rather than reply right away, he reached for the wine bottle and began to top off their glasses, moving with unhurried confidence. His unexpected gesture caught the others off guard,prompting polite words of thanks.



As they mumbled their appreciation, the group kept a watchful eye on lsaac, quietly trying to read his intentions.



Still, Isaac gave nothing away. His lips curled in a subtle, mysterious smile that only made them more uneasy.



"Has something slipped your minds?" Isaac finally asked after a brief, thoughtful pause.



Curiosity flickered in every eye as all attention turned to him, waiting for what would come next.



"My wife is from the Sampson family; she's Luis ' beloved sister. You say you're worried about both the Kirk and the Sampson families, but it seems you've conveniently left my wife's family out of your calculations. How about you talk to Luis himself?"



He tilted his head slightly, a knowing smile hinting at the edges of his mouth as he studied their reactions.



A subtle wave of panic rippled across the table; some shifted uncomfortably in their seats, and the bald man's face went pale.



Before anyone could stop him,Isaac calmly took out his phone, tapped out Luis' number, and pressed the call button, all with practiced ease.



He set the phone on the table and switched it to speaker,his movements deliberate and sure.



"Hey, Isaac, what's going on?"



Luis' voice rang out over the speaker, cutting through the tense silence in the meeting room.

###Chapter 364 Track Them Down
Isaac sat a little straighter and spoke into his phone."Luis, I'm in talks with the project leaders about teaming up, but it seems they've already spoken to Sherwood. Now everyone's getting nervous. Can you step in and talk to them?"



His tone carried an easy authority, deep and steady, as if he had everything under control.



After a brief pause, Luis' voice cut through, cold and unwavering. "Understood. Here's the bottom line.Sampson Group and Kirk Group don't mix. If they go with Kirk, they're cutting us off for good. And I'll make sure Kirk Group doesn't get anywhere."



He let his words hang for a second before adding,"But if you choose Bennett Group, you'll have the Sampson family's support in ways you wouldn't expect. You know exactly how much pull Sampson Group has in this business. You should think about this before you make any moves."



Luis' voice carried through the speaker, chilling the room and sending a real warning to everyone listening.



The project leaders looked uneasy, each one quietly  wiping at their foreheads as if they were breaking out in a cold sweat.


They might have had influence in Ochrerayd, but everyone knew Sampson Group's reach went way past the city and stretched across the entire southern region.


The room became so quiet that it felt like all the air had been sucked out.


No one spoke. They only traded tense glances, not daring to decide.


After a long silence, everyone's eyes landed on Jeff Lee,the main project leader.


A man with glasses finally broke the tension. "Jeff,we'll leave it up to you."


Others quickly followed, echoing his words.


Isaac watched for a moment, and then calmly ended the call.


He rose from his seat, braced his hands against the table, and leaned in, his dark eyes never leaving Jeff."Mr. Lee, where do you stand? Are you open to working with me?"



In that moment, Jeff felt all the color drain from his face. He could only curse his terrible luck in silence. What was he supposed to do in a situation like this?


Could he even call this a real choice?



With two powerful forces closing in from different corners, Jeff found himself completely boxed in. He knew there was no other option left for him.



That was the only path he could take.



Even though his mind raced, his lips refused to move,as if his words had been swallowed by panic.



Inside his head, two voices clashed, each one desperate to take control.



One urged him, practically shouting,"Say yes already!Partnering with both the Bennett and Sampson families could open doors you never imagined. Miss this, and you'll be left behind forever, no matter how hard you try to catch up."


The other voice trembled, filled with dread. "But what about Sherwood? You know how much sway he holds in the south. If you cross him, he won't hesitate to ruin you."


Their bickering left Jeff with a pounding headache that refused to let up.


He scanned the faces of his colleagues, seeing both hope and worry written all over them.


Their anxious stares felt like a weight pressing down on his chest.


Looking over at Isaac, he found the man watching him,steady and unyielding, leaving Jeff with nowhere to turn.



Eventually,Jeff released a long breath, finally making up his mind. He reached out and shook lsaac's hand."Mr. Bennett, we're in. We'll work with you."


Isaac didn't look the least bit surprised. He gripped Jeff's hand and said, "Good call, Mr. Lee. I'm sure this partnership is going to set the project apart."


While all this was unfolding, Luis had his own matters to handle.


Back in the CEO's office, he ended his call with Isaac and rubbed his temples, trying to ease the tension building in his head.


He'd spent the whole mnorning glued to his desk,eyes fixed on his computer, only taking a short break for lunch.



Luis drummed his fingers across the desk, creating a steady rhythm that echoed through the quiet room.Deep in thought, his brows drew together as he mapped out his next move. The audio Howe delivered had become his strongest weapon so far.



He never wished for Sherwood's death. That would have been far too simple. Watching Sherwood's world collapse, forcing him to answer for every sin as the public turned against him-that was the justice Luis wanted.



But to put Sherwood behind bars, he needed undeniable proof.



The driver and doctor who were involved in Verena's disappearance-Luis knew they were the missing pieces.



His assistant, standing at the edge of the desk,waited with patience. "Mr. Sampson, how can I assist you?"


Luis met his eyes and gave clear instructions. "Start a thorough investigation on the driver and doctor Howe worked with when he took Verena away. I didn't care what it cost-track them down. I wanted their locations immediately."



The assistant straightened his posture and took the order seriously. "Understood, sir. I'll begin at once.Since so much time had passed, there was a chance they'd disappeared, so it might not be easy."



Luis didn't waver. "No matter how hard it gets, you  keep searching. If we have to, widen the search and hire private investigators. Tell them to focus on doctors in the obstetrics department from that period.Check every local hospital."


His assistant nodded quickly, determination in his eyes."I'll do everything I can to get results for you right away."


Without another word, he turned and quietly exited,closing the door with care.



Luis lingered on the empty doorway for a moment before his focus shifted to the glowing computer screen, its surface scattered with half-formed leads and elusive connections.


The clues in his grasp were few, but they gave him something to hold onto.


Pressing his fingers to his brow, Luis made a silent vow."Sherwood, I'll drag every secret you're hiding into the light. I swear you'll answer for all of it."


Meanwhile, in Kirk Group's gleaming headquarters,Sherwood ended a meeting with a client and stepped out into the hallway just as his phone buzzed.



He picked up the call while making his way down the corridor.



"Hey, Molly. What's going on?" said Sherwood, his tone laced with a touch of warmth.



Molly's shaky voice spilled through the receiver, thick with panic. "Dad, something awful happened. Verena's letting people go left and right, and she's even kicked me out of the company!"



Sherwood came to a dead stop. The confident grin faded from his lips, replaced by a scowl.


His grip on the phone tightened as he struggled to process the words. "What are you talking about?"


Rage snapped through his voice, much louder now."Who does she think she is?"



The sudden outburst startled several employees in the corridor,sending them scurrying away with nervous bows.



Without wasting another second, Sherwood charged down the hall, burst into the CEO's office, and slammed the door shut behind him.


Fuming, he shot a glare at the wall and growled, "That woman's decided to turn against me openly. She doesn't even bother to hide it anymore."



Before Sherwood could fully take it in, Molly's sobs continued. "Dad, there's more. Verena told me she never actually treated your illness. Every treatment she mentioned-she made it allup."
###Chapter 365 Turned His Whole World Upside Down
Shock slammed into Sherwood so hard it left him rooted to the spot his entire body rigid as if the room itself had frozen around him.



"Repeat that,Molly! Tell me exactly what you just said!"His voice cracked with fury and disbelief.



Molly mumbled through the catch in her throat,her words trembling, Dad... Verena lied. She didn't help you. You're still sick."



A wave of nausea washed over Sherwood,making the floor feel unsteady.He lurched for the table, gripping its edge to steady himself.



Wide-eyed and speechless, he stared straight ahead,lips twitching wvith unspoken words.



His thoughts spiraled out of control.



Every strategy, every grand vision he had built for his business-gone in an instant, collapsing because of this one truth.



He always thought he could outsmart fate, that even his illness was just another problem to solve. That illusion shattered now.



Verena's deception wasn't just a setback; it turned his whole world upside down.



Time crawled before Sherwood could force out a sound. "That woman's going to pay for this," he remarked,voice shaking with rage.


He drew in ragged breaths, anger burning so hot his face turned red, and then ghostly pale.


Bitter curses spilled from his lips as he wrestled with shock and fury, unable to settleon one emotion.



Slamming his fist onto the desk, Sherwood sent papers flying across the room.


"She wants a fight? She'll get one!" Sherwood shouted.

"There's no way I'm letting her get away with this..."



Fighting to contain the storm inside, he sucked in a deep breath and tried to steady himself for Molly's sake. "None of it changes what I'm planning to do.Molly,I want you to stay at home and wait for my call.Do not step outside, you hear me?"


He spoke each word slowly and forcefully,his eyes burning with fierce determination.



"Dad,please listen-" Molly tried to explain, her words trembling with hurt.



"Enough, Molly!" snapped Sherwood, his voice sharp and cutting through the call. "Things are getting out of hand. You're safest if you stay home. That's not up for discussion!"



Molly's voice quivered with uncertainty. "But what about the company? I can't just let it go."



Sherwood cut her off,his voice sharpening like broken glass. "Forget about the company for now. I'll take care of everything. Just stay put and don't make things worse. If Verena wants to challenge me, she's going to regret it."



Left with no room to argue, Molly finally gave in."Okay, I understand. I'll stay home."


He ended the call, but the fury still burned hot inside him.



Suddenly, the door crashed open.



His secretary rushed in, panic scrawled across his face,the calm professionalism gone.



Sherwood, already boiling with anger, pointed at him in outrage. "Who told you to just barge in here? Have you forgotten how this company works? You think this is a street market?" The secretary stammered, trying to catch his breath,"Sir, I'm sorry, but it's urgent!"


Sherwood exploded at his secretary, determined to vent every bit of his fury. "What could possibly matter more than following the most basic workplace rules?Go on, tell me what this so-called emergency is! And if your reason doesn't hold up, you're not walking away from this without consequences!"



Barely able to keep his voice steady, the secretary blurted out, "Sir, we've just been informed-Bennett Group took over the project we've been chasing. It's gone."



Rage erupted inside Sherwood, spreading fast and wild -every nerve felt scorched as if someone had thrown fuel onto an open flame.



He squeezed his fists so tightly his knuckles turned white. There was a dangerous glint in his eyes, and his entire face twisted with fury.



His voice dropped, cold and thunderous. "Say that again. I want to hear it from your mouth."



"I'm telling the truth, sir. It was Bennett Group," the secretary said, voice shaking as he shrank into himself,head bowed. "They somehow got wind of the whole thing and went straight to the people in charge of the project. Then they dangled unbelievably generous terms in front of them. We didn't even have time to respond before the deal was sealed. Even when we mentioned the penalty for breaching the contract,they accepted everything on the spot. They left us with nothing to fight back with."


"Isaac Bennett! That snake never misses a chance to ruin things for me!" Sherwood screamed.


He launched a savage kick at the leather chair,sending it crashing into the wall where it split apart, scattering pieces everywhere.


Glaring at the chaos, Sherwood shouted, "Do you realize how long we spent building up for this? The time, the people, all the resources-just gone! Isaac swept in and wiped it all away like it was nothing!"



Sherwood stormed back and forth across the office,fury radiating off him, hatred simmering behind his eyes.



All these years, he'd treated his connection with Howe as his secret weapon, carefully managed and hidden from everyone. He had always believed the plan was airtight-nobody would ever see through it.


But now Isaac had shown up, tearing everything apart.


It wasn't just the business Isaac was meddling with.Now Isaac had gone and tangled himself in the ugly fight between Sherwood and the Sampson family. shattering every last illusion of control.



"What's our next move,sir?"



His secretary barely spoke above a whisper, as if afraid that even the smallest sound would spark another outburst.



Sherwood paused, eyes narrowed and gleaming with the cold threat of a predator stalking its target.



"What's our next move?" he sneered, voice simmering with venom. "Isaac wants a war? He'll get one.Nobody crosses me and walks awNay unscathed."



Each word dropped like ice,his anger sharpening with every syllable. "Verena, Isaac,Luis-you really think you've beaten me? You're dreaming if you think I'll go down that easily."



His jaw clenched, making his face twist with suppressed fury.



Ruthless ambition had gotten him this far.



He'd clawed his way up by cutting corners, making threats,slipping envelopes under the table-whatever it took to win and push rivals aside.



Sherwood had crossed a lot of lines to get where he was. To him, doing whatever it took was just part of surviving in business.



Those risky choices had helped him build his whole empire.



Nobody was going to bring him down without a fight.


He knew he was no angel.



But Luis, who ran Ochrerayd's underworld, was far from clean himself.
###Chapter 366 The Purchase
Sherwood's office felt like a cave where shadows huddled, thick with an uneasiness that lingered in the air.



He let a cold, crooked smile form on his lips, and there was something wicked curling behind it.


"Nobody ordinary stands a chance against those who hold real power. No matter how wealthy a businessman becomes, he's still just someone the authorities can crush," said Sherwood, his voice a rough whisper, each word carrying a bitter chill.



Anyone working in this city's business world knew a single truth: beneath the polished surface and busy deals, there was a line no one dared to cross.



If someone got reckless enough to ignore the rules set by those at the top, it was the same as inviting disaster.



Sherwood's gaze drifted to the tall window. Luis had done everything he could to keep his people away from the things that could destroy him. But if he really thought he was safe, then Sherwood would make sure they waded in so deep they'd never pull themselves free." With his hands folded behind him, Sherwood squinted into the city lights, his expression alive with the feverish confidence of someone willing to gamble everything for revenge.



His mind kept circling back. He wondered how long Luis' calm would last when the evidence landed in his lap.



Sherwood spun away from the window and crossed to his desk. With a few sharp raps of his knuckles, he instructed his secretary, his tone as cold as ice, "Get me Daren's contact information and send it to me.I need to set up a meeting. I'll handle it myself."



For a split second, the secretary froze, caught off guard by the request.



He understood the kind of trouble Daren Robles could bring, and if Sherwood wanted to get in touch,it could only mean he was about to do something dangerous,something outside the law.



Still, after so many years at Sherwood's side, the secretary knew better than to hesitate.



He dipped his head and replied without question, "Yes,sir. I'll get right on it."



He turned on his heel to leave. "Hold on." Sherwood's voice cut through the room.



The secretary turned back to face him and gave a small nod. "Is there anything else you'd like me to handle,sir?"


"Replace that chair," said Sherwood, eyeing the broken seat by the desk. His order was as clipped as a slap.



The secretary didn't blink. "Right away, sir."



With a crisp nod, he offered a respectful bow before stepping out and shutting the door behind him.



A moment later, Sherwood eased himself into the new chair his staff had provided. Every ounce of his attention was fixed on the tiny hourglass nestled in his palm.



Crystal-clear glass caught the light. Golden grains trickled through the slim waist of the hourglass,pooling at the bottom with silent urgency.


He rolled the delicate object between his thick fingers,eyes narrowed and dark with a simmering malice as he watched each speck of sand slip away.



"Time's running out for me, just like the sand in this thing," said Sherwood, his voice a low rumble that echoed through the stillness of the room. "Everything I want comes down to this move."



Sherwood found himself thinking back to the long years he had spent clawing his way through the ruthless world of business, remembering how he had gone from a man no one noticed to someone with power and a name that carried weight.


He was the only one who truly understood the weight of the trials he had pushed through, the kind that left no marks but never really faded.



Yet now, Verena, Isaac, and Luis seemed determined to stand in his way.



His jaw tightened as he glared at the wall. "You three,you have no idea what I'm capable of. I'm not the type to let anybody walk all over me," said Sherwood,his tone ice-cold.



Turning the hourglass upside down, he watched the sands begin anew and let out a sharp, mocking snort."If I can flip the hourglass, I can flip this whole game.You'll all regret crossing me."


Moments later, his phone lit up with a new message -Daren's number, courtesy of his secretary.



Without hesitation, Sherwood copied the number,tapped it into his phone, and waited for the call to connect. For a while, only the sound of ringing filled his ear.Then someone picked up.



A disguised voice, so muffled and deep that it could have belonged to anyone, spoke. "Who's there?"


Sitting straighter, Sherwood cleared his throat, and his voice took on a bright, almost cheerful note. "Daren.It's Sherwood Kirk. Been a long time. How's life treating you?"



The smile on his face was all for show, though Daren couldn't see it.



Through the voice distortion, Daren answered with a hollow laugh, "So you finally remembered me,Mr.Kirk?I'm just trying to stay alive out here. That's all I can ask for. I bet things are looking up for you, though,huh? Business must be good."



Neither man spoke plainly, every line carefully wrapped in polite words while their true intentions flickered beneath the surface.



They kept up the illusion of friendly conversation,trading small talk and pleasantries, but every phrase came with a hidden edge. With each reply, they searched for weakness or motive, never letting their guard down.



Sherwood steered the conversation with patience,  well aware that Daren wasn't someone who'd be lured in by reckless promises. He needed to let the tension build,drawing Daren in little by little.



Once he sensed Daren was listening, Sherwood dropped the pretense. "Listen, Daren, I've got a job for you. There's something I want to buy, something special. You know how I operate. I pay well, so you won't regret it."



A beat of silence hung in the air as Daren considered his options.



Daren lived on the edge, always watching for threats.He never stuck to one place, and he avoided anything that felt like a setup.



When he spoke again, his answer came measured and cool. "I can tell you're sincere, Mr. Kirk. I'll see what l can do, but this won't happen overnight. Give me until the night after tomorrow. We'll talk face-to-face.Does that work for you?"


Sherwood's lips twisted in a faint, satisfied grin. "Good enough for me. I'll wait for your call."



Once the arrangement was set, both men ended the conversation without further ceremony.



Leaning back, Sherwood shut his eyes halfway and let his thoughts run wild. Golden trophies and expensive art caught the light around his office. His mouth curled with a cold amusement as he glanced at them.



"Daren, everything depends on you. Don't disappoint me," he whispered, his voice carrying a quiet warning meant for Daren alone. ...


Two days later, the sun dipped behind the city,neon signs flickering to life as the evening deepened.


Not long before, Daren had phoned in to say he was already waiting at the club for Sherwood's arrival.


Dressed in a crisp, dark suit patterned with subtle stripes, Sherwood tugged his sleeves into place. He looked at the butler, Aiken Morley, and asked, "ls everything ready on your end?"



With a respectful nod, Aiken replied, "Everything's handled,just like you wanted."



Sherwood made a low sound of approval and then gave Aiken a sharp look. "Watch Molly closely. She's not to leave this house, especially if she tries to see anyone from the Sampson family."



Aiken acknowledged with another nod. Just then, the driver appeared, bowing slightly as he announced, "Sir, your car is out front."



Sherwood nodded in response and strode toward the door.



A gleaming black vehicle waited by the entrance,the tinted windows concealing everything inside from the outside world.



Without a word, the driver stepped up and opened the door for Sherwood, who slipped into the back seat.
###Chapter 367 Why Don't You See For Yourself What I'v...
City lights slipped past as a sleek black vehicle drifted along the road.



Inside,Sherwood shared the back seat with a man who could have passed as his double. Both wore matching tailored suits,every detail of their hair and posture meticulously mirrored. At a glance, they might have been brothers, or even twins, so closely did they resemble each other.



"Deandre, stay sharp and keep your eyes open. We don't have room for even the smallest mistake,"Sherwood said to the driver in a low voice as he glanced out the car window, scanning the streets for anything that looked out of place.



Since things went south with Verena and the others,he felt their eyes on him at every turn.



A single mistake could ruin everything.



Fingers tight on the wheel,Deandre Burton nodded without glancing back. "You can count on me,Mr.Kirk.All precautions are in place."



Smooth as silk, the vehicle glided through busy  streets and pulled up in front of a club that glimmered beneath neon lights.



Clusters of people lingered near the entrance, making it easy for someone to slip in unnoticed.



"This is where you get out," Sherwood murmured.



Obeying with practiced calm, the man beside him nodded,drew a long breath, and swung the door open.



Every step he took mirrored Sherwood's usual bearing with flawless precision. A black hat tilted just enough to shadow his face, helping mask his features. The patterned black suit he wore shifted with the breeze as he stepped out of the car, its hem swaying gently.Around his neck hung a pendant etched with a detailed design, matching Sherwood's down to the last line.



Once outside, he paused to adjust his jacket, scanned the crowded sidewalk, and strode through the commotion toward the club, merging into the press of strangers as if he belonged there.



The vehicle rolled forward once more,weaving through side streets and winding turns before finally heading toward a nearby parking area.



Deandre maneuvered the car into a secluded space.hidden away from prying eyes. He turned and spoke quietly. "We're here, Mr. Kirk."



Moving with purpose, Sherwood slipped out of the car,keeping his head low as he ducked beneath the gaze of the security cameras. He made for a narrow exit at the lot's far edge, barely making a sound.



There, in the shadows, an old van waited for him.



Sherwood tugged open the van door and slipped inside,letting it click shut behind him.



Dust and the scent of old upholstery filled the cramped space. Dim light barely crept through the narrow windows, painting shifting patches on the threadbare seats.



With barely a glance at the driver, he kept his voice low. "Head for the club outside the city.You know the one."



Not wasting any time, the driver nodded and brought the van rumbling to life.



Rough roads led them out past the city's edge, where the van rolled to a halt in front of a nondescript building half-lost in shadows.



Streetlights offered little more than a dull haze,making the club blend right into the sleepy outskirts. Rather than attract attention by going through the front, Sherwood slid out, eyes sharp as he scanned the empty sidewalks. Without missing a beat, he skirted the busy entrance and made for the back.



A thickset guard waited by the rear door, eyeing Sherwood up and down. After a brief pause, he opened the door in silence, letting Sherwood slip inside.



Low-lit hallways stretched before him,walls muffling the sounds of distant music. Sherwood moved quietly,pausing only when he reached a closed door.



A light tap brought a voice from within. "Come in."



Drawing in a slow breath, Sherwood opened the door and stepped into the suite.



Golden lamplight glowed against red velvet couches and dark carpets, giving the space an air of hushed decadence.



There, sprawled across a sofa, Daren puffed on a cigar, gray smoke curling through the air above him.



"About time you showed up, Mr. Kirk," said Daren,his grin crooked and his teeth yellowed by years of tobacco. He pushed himself upright, greeting Sherwood with a handshake that was strong but far from friendly Gaudy rings sparkled on Daren's fingers. His shirt,open almost to his navel, showed off a thatch of chest hair and a bit too much bravado.



Sherwood's smile was thin, polite, but empty. He shook Daren's hand and said, "Didn't mean to keep you waiting,Daren."



Their grip was firm, but their eyes told a different story, each man sizing the other up.



"You're always a gentleman. Take a load off,have a drink," said Daren, grabbing the whiskey bottle and pouring a generous measure into a glass.



Sherwood accepted the offer, sampling the whiskey as his gaze drifted around the shadowed room. "You really know how to pick a place, Daren. Not exactly easy to stumble into."



Daren let out a rough laugh, dropping onto the sofa and stretching out his legs. "In our line of work,discretion is key.I figured you'd appreciate the privacy."



"Absolutely," said Sherwood,nodding. "You don't last long in this business if you're careless about where you meet."



Daren's smile stretched wider. "I know you're not here for small talk, so let's not waste time. Why don't you see for yourself what I've brought?" Snapping his fingers twice, Daren signaled toward a side door.



Two hulking men entered carrying a stack of heavy boxes, setting them down in front of Sherwood with careful precision before flipping the lids open.



Leaving his whiskey on the table,Sherwood rose and moved to inspect the merchandise.



He crouched down, scanning the contents with an expert's eye, every move careful and deliberate.



A small sample caught his attention. He pinched it between his fingers and lifted it for a discreet sniff,picking up the scent with practiced ease.



After that, he grabbed a portable tester from the table and checked the goods thoroughly, his face giving away nothing.



When he finally stood up, a flicker of approval crossed his lips. "Impressive work. The quality's top-notch."



Daren's cheeks rounded as he grinned, barely containing his pride. "Only the best for you, Mr. Kirk.This batch has been moving fast, so l made sure to reserve the best for tonight."



With a dramatic puff,Daren released a cloud of smoke, and then pointed at a few more boxes. "If you like what you see, I've got a few premium pieces in those as well. You might find them even more interesting."



Sherwood's brow tightened just a little as a flicker of doubt crept into his eyes, subtle but unmistakable.



He made his way to the stack of boxes, crouched beside them, and slipped his hand deep into one of the containers.



His fingers swept over the goods, testing for texture and weight, while a spark of interest flashed in his gaze. "This isn't easy to find. Must've cost you some trouble."



Tapping the ash from his cigar, Daren's eyes narrowed with a calculating glint. "It wasn't easy, that's for sure.But for you, Mr. Kirk, we'll make it happen. As long as you're happy, the effort's worth it."
###Chapter 368 I'm Representing The Samps...

A cold gleam flickered in Sherwood's eyes as he sized up the contents of the boxes. Nothing about this haul was ordinary. Anyone with half a brain could see these were the kind of items that would ruin reputations, if not entire empires. All it would take was a single leak to the authorities, and the damage would be irreversible.



Luis thought he could crush him and erase every trace of his legacy, but tonight, Sherwood was rewriting the script. If these goods found their way into Luis' world,the fallout would be swift and catastrophic. Every ounce of power Luis had clawed for would turn to ashes the moment the police closed in.



Sherwood's knuckles tightened, but he forced himself to stay composed. No hint of emotion crossed his face as he met Daren's gaze.



Pulling himself upright, he met Daren's eyes with calm resolve. "You know, Daren, you're right about one thing: we both know how precious time is in this game.So let's skip the formalities. I'm representing the Sampson family on this job. Mr. Sampson has a particular need for exactly this quantity, and he's put me in charge of the transaction."



Letting his words hang, Sherwood pressed on, "You understand what kind of reach the Sampsons have. If we make this work, you'll see even bigger deals coming your way. So, tell me, what's your number?"



Sherwood spoke with a calmness that sounded effortless, but every word was deliberate, meant to uncover something hidden. He understood that with someone like Daren, who always played two steps ahead,the smallest detail could shift the outcome. He needed Daren to believe the Sampson family was running the show, so when the dust settled, the blame would land exactly where he wanted it.



The question made Daren's smirk fade just a little,and he studied Sherwood's expression with wary calculation.



A beat passed as Daren drummed his fingers against the arm of the sofa, lost in thought.



Finally, he looked up, a sly glimmer returning to his eyes.



He flashed a number with his fingers and replied in a voice that left no room for negotiation, "I hear you loud and clear. The Sampson family is a force to be reckoned with, and I'd like nothing more than to work with them long-term. But these days, every move  comes with more eyes watching, and we both know the risks aren't getting smaller. For this kind of shipment, that's the lowest I'll go."



Sherwood's face didn't betray a thing. In truth, he was willing to pay whatever it took to make sure Luis fell into his trap. But for now, he kept up the act, playing the loyal agent to perfection.



Sherwood's brow furrowed as if he'd just swallowed something bitter, a shadow of uncertainty flickering in his eyes. His hesitation hung in the air, every muscle in his face telegraphing reluctance.



He kept silent for a moment, and then finally met Daren's gaze. "That's a steep figure, Daren. The Sampson family isn't reckless with their money, no matter how deep their pockets go. Every deal gets scrutinized, every penny accounted for. How about cutting us a break on the price? Show some goodwill now, and you'll have a powerful ally for the future.When the next opportunity comes up, you'll be the first we call."



Trying to sound reasonable, Sherwood pressed his advantage. Daren's smile stayed in place, but a sharp edge crept into his eyes.



Reclining farther into the couch, Daren flicked his cigar ash to the floor and let the silence linger. "Mr. Kirk," he said,keeping his voice steady but steely,"the rate I'm offering is more than fair,considering the climate we're working in. The authorities are watching everything and making my job a headache. Pulling these strings cost me, and I took on plenty of risks getting this order together."



He straightened, voice losing any hint of playfulness."You might be the face of the Sampson family,but my reputation is everything in this business. If I'm seen folding on prices, no one will take me seriously again.I have to draw the line somewhere."



A moment passed as Daren searched Sherwood's face for any sign of wavering. "There's nothing left to negotiate. I can't budge on the number."



When Sherwood caught sight of Daren's unyielding posture,he recognized the signal. The performance was nearing its end, and dragging it out any longer would only raise suspicion and invite trouble.



A slight crease formed between his brows as hesitation settled across his face, the kind that revealed a quiet resistance he wasn't ready to voice.



With a resigned shake of his head, he finally spoke."If that's your answer, then I suppose we have to make do."



He took a new tack, not missing a moment. "Still, a transaction of this size deserves some flexibility. The Sampson family is ordering in bulk, and we'll need more soon. Let's talk payment terms. We'll start with a deposit. Once everything arrives at the drop and passes inspection, the rest will be paid in full. That's only fair,right?"


Daren's eyes narrowed,suspicion clouding his features for the first time.


He stayed quiet for a moment, and then managed a forced smile. His tone held steady, though there was a faint trace of reluctance beneath it. "I'll admit your request seems fair on the surface. But think about this.We're dealing with a high volume of goods, and keeping that supply moving without interruption is already proving difficult."



While Daren spoke, he gave a slight shake of his head."The upfront cost on my side-manpower, supplies,and money-isn't something I can brush off. With what you're asking, if anything slips out of place, I'll be the one left picking up the pieces."



A chill settled over Sherwood's features, his eyes narrowing as he replied with unmistakable frost,"Daren, are you really doubting my word, or the Sampson family's name? Have you forgotten who l am to them?" He leaned in, elbows on his knees, never breaking eye contact. "Luis is about to marry my daughter. I'm not just a friend to the Sampson family. My place in their circle is secure. With the family's influence in Ochrerayd, do you honestly believe someone as wealthy as Luis would risk defaulting over a payment?"



A calming nod from Daren followed, but the sly glimmer in his eyes gave away his suspicion.



He shifted in his seat, pretending to wrestle with the idea, and answered, "Mr. Kirk, no one in their right mind would question your reputation or the Sampson family's power. Everyone respects what they've built.Still, you know how it is in our line of work; being careful is just survival."



Letting out a sigh, Daren ran a hand through his hair,worry lining his face. "We're talking about a shipment that could make or break my entire business. If anything goes wrong, I lose everything."


He hesitated before adding, "It's not about trust. It's about making sure every detail is airtight. For something this important, I'd feel better calling Luis Sampson directly to confirm the payment arrangements. That should settle any doubts, don't you think?"



Hearing Daren's response, Sherwood could only sigh inwardly, recognizing the man's skill at maneuvering through shady deals. Even when Daren acted humble, he missed nothing and left no loopholes.
###Chapter 369 | Want This Partnership Just As Much...
A sly smile tugged at Sherwood's lips as he let his palm smack the tabletop, annoyance pulsing beneath the gesture. "So that's how it is, Daren? You're not worried about the Sampson family; you just don't trust me.Luis wouldn't hand this off to anyone but me, but you keep treating me like some outsider."



Without missing a beat, Sherwood snatched his phone from his pocket, flicking through contacts with quick,sharp movements. "If you're so desperate for proof,I'll get Luis' right-hand man on the line right now.Maybe he can convince you. Sure, my family isn't the Sampson family,but everyone in Ochrerayd knows the bond we have."



He rose from his seat,jaw clenched in frustration,and let the chair screech loudly as he shoved it back. "If you're set on doubting me, maybe we should call this off and stop wasting each other's time."



He made a show of turning toward the door, hand outstretched,already halfway out of the room.



A flicker of anxiety stirred in Daren's chest. But years spent maneuvering through the ruthless world of  business had taught him how to keep his composure,no matter how stormy things felt beneath the surface.Within seconds, he pushed the tension aside,steadying himself as his thoughts turned toward weighing every risk and advantage.


He drew in a deep breath from his cigar before grinding it out in the ashtray with a firm hand. He understood just how rare a chance like this was.Working alongside the Sampson family didn't come often, and missing it might mean waiting years for anything close. Sherwood's payment terms carried their share of risks, but with the weight of the Sampson name behind it, locking in a long-term deal could send him climbing quickly through the ranks of the industry. On the other hand, if he pushed too hard and lost Sherwood now, the fallout wouldn't just be the loss of profit; it could mean crossing the Sampson family and bringing a storm he didn't need.



Before Sherwood could leave, Daren shot to his feet,a new, eager smile plastered across his face.



"Wait, Mr. Kirk, let's not be hasty! I misread the situation, and I'll admit it. You're absolutely right. Let's work it out your way. The payment terms are fine, and I want this partnership just as much as you do."



The sound of the voice behind him made Sherwood scoff silently, though his face gave nothing away Daren had responded just as he expected. The  moment Sherwood brought the Sampson family into play, the outcome was already tilting in his favor.Businessmen were always chasing the next big opening, and Daren, despite being a seasoned schemer, wouldn't be able to resist for long.The promise of profit would eventually push him to weigh his choices and give in where it mattered.



Sherwood kept his back turned, masking the satisfaction curling through him.



He let the moment stretch, and then finally turned around,his features set in a stern mask, but a spark of victory lighting his eyes.



Sherwood let out a short sigh and fixed Daren with a steady gaze. "I always pegged you for a man who didn't mince words," he said, voice even but edged with warning. "For the sake of moving forward,I'll let this slide. But remember, when it comes to the Sampson family, there's no room for carelessness.Even one mistake could be costly for everyone involved."



Closing the distance, Sherwood joined Daren at the table, both men reclaiming their seats as if sealing an unspoken agreement.



Daren gave a slow, measured nod that struck a careful balance between modesty and quiet self-assurance. Every movement was deliberate, keeping  up the appearance of deference toward Sherwood while letting just enough of his street-smart edge slip through the cracks.



"No worries, Mr. Kirk. My team and I will handle everything. You have my word that this deal is my only priority."



A flicker of curiosity crossed Daren's face. Swirling the wine in his glass, he glanced at Sherwood with a casual air, though his eyes were sharp and probing.


"Forgive me for asking, Mr. Kirk," he said, turning just enough to reach for the wine glass on the table. He lifted it and gave it a slow swirl, watching the liquid catch the light. "If I'm not mistaken, the Sampson family has always kept things clean around here.They've never shown much interest in this kind of business before."



He stopped for a moment and lifted his eyes to Sherwood.The look seemed relaxed, but there was a sharpness hidden in it. "Tell me, what made Luis suddenly decide to jump into this line of business?"



Sherwood didn't answer right away. He reached for the glass of wine on the table and gave it a lazy swirl.



The dark red liquid shimmered beneath the light as it turned in slow circles.



Tilting his head just slightly, he let a faint smile tug at the corners of his mouth.



"Big money changes people faster than anything else,"said Sherwood. He let his gaze drift across Daren as if measuring him. "And I'm sure you know Isaac Bennett from Shoildon, don't you?"



Sherwood leaned into the name,making sure it landed with weight. "Luis' sister just came back, and she's not someone who likes to play small. She and her husband have already planted their flag in Ochrerayd."


He gave a quiet smack of his lips and shook his head,looking like a man sighing at life's ironies. "You know the saying. There can only be one at the top. Luis has no choice but to push back, and putting together money is just one of the ways he's planning to do it."



Sherwood lifted the glass to his mouth and took an unhurried sip.



Daren kept his composure, though his thoughts moved quickly. He was no stranger to the Bennett family's reputation in Shoildon. Isaac had built their power with cold precision, stronger than those who came before him.



Daren had heard plenty about Isaac's ruthless style,and he knew the man wasn't someone to cross. Then there was Verena, the Sampson family's daughter who had recently returned, already making waves of her  own.



His eyes narrowed a touch as he thought about the stories tied to her name. She was young, yet already seen as Isaac's equal. Her boldness had given her a reputation that few could ignore. Together, those two had made their entrance into Ochrerayd, and no one in the Sampson family could afford to dismiss them.Families like these always wore polite faces in public,but when money and power were at stake, blood ties never stopped them from turning into enemies.



Though the thought made him sneer inside, Daren's expression softened into a charming smile as he looked back at Sherwood.



"Mr. Kirk, you've really given me clarity," said Daren,nodding as if grateful. "If that's the case, we'll move according to your plan. We'll get things ready at once and make sure the shipment meets Mr. Sampson's expectations."



He paused, holding Sherwood's eyes with a confident grin. "As for the payment, we'll follow whatever arrangements Mr. Sampson sets. His family is known for their precision, and I'm sure every detail has already been thought through."



Every word Daren spoke carried respect for the Sampson family, but beneath it lingered a quiet reminder that promises carried weight.
###Chapter 370 Living On Borrowed Time
Sherwood rose from his seat with an easy grin and extended his hand. "Naturally. Daren, may our partnership be smooth and profitable."



Daren clasped his hand firmly, returning the smile."I look forward to it, Mr. Kirk. You can trust me to deliver."



Their handshake sealed the moment, and Sherwood strode toward the club's entrance.



The instant he stepped outside, the smile drained from his face, leaving behind a hardened look.



His eyes darted quickly across the street, checking every shadow before he moved toward a van waiting nearby.



He yanked the door open, slid in without hesitation,and gave a sharp order. "Drive."


The engine purred to life, and the vehicle slipped into the evening traffic.



It wasn't long before the van arrived at the dim parking lot where his black vehicle was waiting. Sherwood blinked his eyes open, shoved the door aside, and stepped out into the stale air of the parking lot.



With his head bowed, he moved swiftly across the concrete floor until he reached the sleek black vehicle he knew all too well.



He climbed into the back seat with the fluidity of someone who had repeated this routine many times before.



The man who looked almost identical to him was already waiting inside, sitting silently.



Sherwood spared him a brief glance before focusing on Deandre at the wheel. "You caught everything?No one suspected a thing?"



Deandre kept his gaze ahead as he answered with calm assurance, "Nothing to worry about, sir. From the moment you walked into the club until you stepped out, I checked every angle. No tails, no prying eyes."



A slight nod was Sherwood's only reply.



The vehicle rolled onto the streets, and Sherwood leaned back against the leather seat, his fingers tapping idly on his phone screen. A glint of cold calculation lingered in his eyes. A line creased his forehead as he pressed the call button.



The butler's familiar voice came through, careful and respectful. "Sir, is it finished?" asked Aiken.


Sherwood's mouth curved into a sly grin. "Everything's in place. Now we wait for the right opening."


Aiken's voice brightened, almost celebratory. "Then allow me to congratulate you,sir."


Sherwood straightened, his tone sharpening like a blade. "I'm giving you something new to handle."


On the other end, Aiken fell silent, waiting for the details.



Sherwood's voice dropped into ice. "Draw out Luis ' right-hand man. Then arrange for Daren and him to walk into the same club, one after the other."


For a moment, only silence carried across the line until Aiken's uncertain voice returned. "Forgive me, sir,but I don't quite follow."


Sherwood cut to the chase, his voice tight as he outlined the scheme. "Find some of Luis' loose affiliates. Slip the product. Let it look like his crew is moving the goods inside his own venue." A sharp glint lit up his eyes as he let the thought settle."Picture this. The merchandise gets traced back to Luis' place. We'll arrange Daren's payment to line up just right and make sure Luis ends up at the scene.When the authorities show up, all the evidence ties him to the goods and the deal. Let's see him try to explain that once they start digging."



A low laugh escaped Sherwood, the sound threaded with sharp satisfaction as he imagined the public fallout.


Concern crept into Aiken's voice as he answered,"Sir,this carries a serious risk. What if it is uncovered?"


Sherwood met that worry with a cold chuckle. "Risk is the currency of big moves. If we plan cleanly and execute without slips, the exposure will be minimal.Follow orders, and your cut will be handsome."


Aiken swallowed and agreed, his tone steady despite the doubt. "Understood, sir. I will set it in motion right away."


Sherwood drove the point home, insisting on precision."Every step must be flawless. Small mistakes are how things unravel."


Aiken repeated his promise, voice firm with implied loyalty. "You can rely on me,sir." After he ended the call, Sherwood leaned back and let his mind run through the logistics.


He imagined the contraband reaching Luis' territory and the breadcrumb trail for the police falling exactly where he intended it.



The image of Luis exposed and humiliated lifted Sherwood's mood into something that looked a lot like triumph. He pictured Joseph and Marisa, still fragile from that old wound two decades past,collapsing under the shock of the news.



A dark smile crept across Sherwood's face as he pictured the moment Joseph and Marisa would hear about Luis' ruin, crushed beneath the weight of it all.In the storm that followed, with the Sampson family stripped of its leader, their empire would be his for the taking.



Thoughts then swung to Verena and Isaac, and his expression turned sharp. Verena had survived when he assumed she would not, and that stubborn return gnawed at him. For a moment, he wished events had ended differently back then, and the memory hardened into renewed resolve.



A sharp snort slipped from him as displeasure tightened his features. Verena's return felt to him like a live wire ready to short out the careful order he had built inside the Sampson family ranks. Had she acted  the part of the dutiful daughter, he might have let her presence slide and treated her like a mere ornament.She refused that safe role and chased revenge instead,a choice he found reckless and infuriating.



The memory of her using his illness as a trap made his nostrils flare with hot anger. He scoffed at the thought that a young woman could overturn what he had spent years constructing. He dismissed her as little more than an irritant under his heel. He planned to see whether her boldness would survive the consequences he intended to bring.


Then there was lsaac to consider.


Even the mention of that man stoked a darker fury inside him.



"You carved out your strength in Shoildon and now you come here to undermine me," Sherwood muttered through gritted teeth. "You and Verena prance around like you own the place. You may be feared back in Shoildon, but Ochrerayd answers to me.Try to act without caution, and you will learn what that costs."



Sherwood shifted his gaze toward the blurred city beyond the tinted glass, his eyes dark and filled with a cold hunger for blood. The bond between Verena and Isaac was something he would never allow to grow.Letting it breathe felt like handing them power he  meant to keep for himself.


Wearing a cruel smile steeped in venom, Sherwood had every intention of trapping them in a tragic love story,one soaked in misery and sealed with despair.


Sherwood let his eyes fall shut once more, drawing in a slow, steady breath to quiet the rush building inside him.



Every step was unfolding just as he had intended.Luis,the Sampson family, Verena, and Isaac-all of them were living on borrowed time, and he could already see the end closing in.
###Chapter 371 We Can't Destroy Him Like This
Inside the shadowed study of Kirk Villa, Sherwood lounged behind an imposing mahogany desk, its surface gleaming with intricate carvings that caught the dim light. A slender pen twirled between his fingers, clicking softly against his palm. His gaze,however, was anything but idle-cold, sharp, and carrying a sinister weight.



The door creaked open, and Aiken stepped inside with a measured bow. A glint of pride lingered on his otherwise composed face.



"Sir," he began, his voice low, colored with faint amusement. "It's done. I managed to buy off one of Luis' men-a fellow by the name Rowland Green."


The pen stilled mid-spin. Sherwood's eyes lifted,glinting like steel, his silence prompting Aiken to elaborate.



"Rowland's an orphan," Aiken went on, licking his drying lips nervously. "He's been living with his grandparents. So, I had them quietly taken away. As expected, the young man panicked. With his grandparents in our grip, he bent to our will  immediately."


Sherwood's mouth curled into a cruel smile. "Humph.People with soft spots are the easiest to break."


He set the pen aside, leaned forward, and laced his fingers together.atop the desk. "But tell me-can he be trusted? How deep is his reach into Luis' circle?"


"Quite far, sir," Aiken said quickly, eager to prove his worth. "I've checked thoroughly. Rowland oversees the movement of goods for Luis. Not the core inner circle, but close enough. With him in hand, slipping anything into Luis' territory will be effortless."


A glimmer of satisfaction crossed Sherwood's eyes as he sank back into his leather chair. "Good. Very good.But keep him on a short leash. And remember-his grandparents are our leash. If anything goes awry,you'll pay the price."


The butler dipped his head swiftly. "Yes, sir. I'll see to it personally."



Sherwood gave a curt nod. "That will be all."



"Yes, sir." Bowing once more, Aiken retreated, the door closing with a muted click.



The study fell silent again.



Sherwood exhaled slowly, slouching into the embrace  of his chair. His hand slipped into his jacket, rough fingers fishing out his phone.


The device glowed against the dim room as he tapped in a number with practiced precision.



Meanwhile,Molly was ascending the stairs, her steps light, a plate of jewel-toned fruit balanced in her hands. Dressed casually, she radiated a softness that seemed out of place in the brooding house.



At the landing, she nearly collided with Aiken.


He bowed swiftly, plastering on a respectful smile."Miss Kirk."



Molly returned his smile with a gentle one of her own."Aiken, finished with your duties already?"



Her gaze drifted past him, lingering on the closed door at the far end of the corridor. "Is my father still working?"


Aiken dipped his head, his voice cautious. "Yes. He's still occupied with important matters."



Her brow furrowed faintly, but the tension passed as quickly as it came. "I see. I'll take him some fruit-he should rest a little."



"How thoughtful." Aiken stepped aside to  make way seizing the chance to flatter. "Mr. Kirk hardly spares  himself rest. Having a daughter like you is truly his blessing."



Molly's lips curved into a modest smile. "It's nothing more than my duty."



With graceful ease, she stepped around him and continued upward.


At the study door, she paused, balancing the plate in one hand as she rapped lightly on the wood.


No answer. A doubting small crease formed on her brow, but she pressed her palm against the knob and turned it, pushing the door open.



When she stepped into the room, the first thing she noticed was her father on the balcony, phone pressed to his ear, voice lowered to a conspiratorial murmur.



"No wonder he didn't hear me knock," she whispered under her breath, slipping quietly toward the desk to set down the fruit plate she carried.



Her task done, she drifted closer to the balcony,intending to gently coax her father in for a bite.



But as the distance narrowed, his words sharpened in clarity. "The last batch was pure. The next must match it exactly. I'll send you the time and place of the exchange later." Molly froze mid-step, the blood draining from her face. Shock flared in her wide eyes, her breath snagging in her throat. She didn't need a full explanation-growing up in this circle, she knew exactly what the words "batch" and "pure" meant.Contraband. Illegal goods. In other words, her father was involved in criminal activity!



Sherwood, oblivious,	continued his hushed conversation.



Only when he hung up and turned back did his gaze land on Molly. She stood a few paces away, pale as moonlight.



A flicker of hesitation passed over him before his features melted into their familiar, practiced warmth."Molly, when did you get in? Don't just stand there have a seat."



Heart hammering, she rushed forward, clutching his sleeve with both hands. "Dad, we can't-this is dangerous, illegal! If you're caught, the consequences could destroy everything!"



Instead of bristling, Sherwood's smile deepened,almost tender. He reached out, smoothing a hand over her hair. "Sweetheart, you worry too much.I know what I'm doing. I'd never drag us into anything like that." Her taut nerves slackened at his reassurance, a shaky breath escaping her lips.


But then his voice shifted, chilling in its calm cruelty."I'm going to let the Sampson family handle it."


The words slammed into her, knocking the air from her lungs. Molly's lips parted soundlessly, her face a mask of disbelief.



"No... that can't be." She stumbled a few steps back,shaking her head. "Dad, you'll ruin Luis."


She had always assumed Sherwood's feud with the Sampsons was just a business skirmish, a matter of contracts, dirty tricks and cutthroat competition; just frictions here and there to teach Luis a lesson. At worst, she thought he meant to make Luis suffer financial losses, perhaps tarnish his standing in the industry. That, she could still rationalize. But this? This was deliberate ruin, a scheme to plant illicit goods and condemn Luis beyond redemption. It would not only shatter him but drag his entire family into devastation!



How foolish she had been to ever believe otherwise.And Luis-God, she loved him. How could she stand by and watch him meet such a tragic end?


Her fingers seized Sherwood's sleeve again, trembling."Please, Dad, I beg you-don't do this. Luis hasn't wronged us. We can't destroy him like this." But Sherwood wrenched his arm free,irritation flashing in his eyes. His smile was gone. His voice cut sharp."Molly, you're still far too naive."
###Chapter 372 | Can't Bear Losing You
"Tho reality isin't that we re provoking the Sampson family. but that they te hell-bemt om ammihilating usi"



Sherwood's wance clrmfed without warming as ho daapod his hamds bellmnd mo back. lounching into のosHess 内acng.Basd c How Lars and Vorona aro bohmving now,tm centamn thhey vo uncovorod whatI did oll thore xaas aeo Uilass wo movo first. wo'll sim ply be sitthng dlucks wa ailina for oun exocution.Whon that hoppons. the Kak fanmilly will be completely wiped out."



With those wards, he approached Molly and gripped her shoulders furmly



Leaning closer, he locked eyes with her directly.His stare held paternal authority. though underneath lurked unmistakable traces of desperation.



"Molly." His voice plummeted suddenly, becoming gravelly with emotion. "My precious daughter,consider this carefully. Can you honestly stand by and watch your father perish? Between Luis and me, are you genuinely prepared to sacrifice your own father's life?" His grip unconsciously intensified as he spoke.


Molly trembled beneath Sherwood's penetrating gaze,her face contorting with internal warfare.



To her, Sherwood represented her sole protection against life's cruelest storms.



Losing her father-the person who cherished her most-remained unthinkable.



Molly found herself completely torn, tears welling in her eyes.



Luis occupied one side of her heart with deep romantic love,while her father claimed the other with years of devoted care.


Complete paralysis seized her in that moment.



Following a prolonged silence, Molly finally managed to speak. "But Dad, resorting to criminal methods could expose everything and destroy our entire family.I can't bear losing you,but..."



Molly attempted to continue her plea, but Sherwood spun away and raised his palm to silence her. "Not another word. These matters are beyond your understanding."



His tone carried absolute finality, severing Molly's  protest before it could fully form.


Recognizing his excessive harshness, Sherwood turned back toward Molly, his stern mask dissolving into genuine warmth. He reached out to stroke her hair with the tenderness reserved for consoling a hurt child.



"For now, simply stay home and find ways to relax.Read your books, watch your programs, pursue whatever brings you joy." His voice softened considerably, adopting an almost indulgent quality."Once this business concludes, I'll arrange an extended overseas vacation. We'll visit any destination you choose, and you can properly decompress.Upon our return, I'll introduce you to someone who matches Luis in every way."



Sherwood pressed on with growing confidence. "I guarantee that whether considering family background or personal capabilities, this person equals Luis completely. You might discover instant chemistry,and before long, Luis will become nothing but a distant memory."



Molly absorbed her father's elaborate plans with her chin tucked low.



Silent rebellion churned within her heart, knowing that nobody except Luis could ever claimn that place in her life. Molly stole a cautious look at Sherwood.


Though his expression appeared warm and caring,Molly understood this facade didn't guarantee his temper remained under control.


Vivid memories surfaced of her childhood accident when she'd shattered Sherwood's prized collectible.Her typically gentle father had transformed into a terrifying stranger within seconds.


That twisted mask of rage and his bone-rattling fury still haunted her dreams.



From that defining moment, she'd learned that beneath her father's everyday kindness lurked someone utterly dangerous when pushed beyond his limits.



This realization made Molly's hands curl into tight fists without conscious thought, her nails carving painful crescents into her palms.







Within an exclusive VIP lounge of an upscale Ochrerayd nightclub, Isaac maintained perfect posture on the corner sofa, his expression completely unreadable. His composed presence created a stark contrast to the wild celebrations echoing beyond the soundproof doors. A plainly dressed operative approached Isaac with quick, efficient steps, bowing respectfully before delivering his report.


"Mr. Bennett, your suspicions proved accurate.Sherwood arranged for a body double, someone matching his exact build and clothing, to execute this elaborate ruse. Their initial move involved taking a black vehicle to a downtown club. The decoy entered the establishment while the real Sherwood slipped away and climbed into a beat-up silver van."



The operative paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing. "That van drove straight toward the city's edge before pulling into some isolated private club."



This information prompted Isaac to uncross his legs and lean forward with renewed interest, pushing for more details. "What kind of business was conducted inside that facility?"


The man's head dipped respectfully as he delivered his explanation with evident caution. "Mr. Bennett, we couldn't risk getting too close. That place is crawling with dangerous people, and there's bound to be plenty of informants mixed in with the crowd. Our only option was maintaining surveillance from the perimeter. Sherwood remained inside for nearly an hour before finally emerging and returning via the same silver van." Isaac settled back against the plush sofa cushions, his penetrating stare cutting through his drink's amber surface as his mind processed the intelligence.


After they had monitored Sherwood's movements for this long, his panicked reaction to news about Howe came as no surprise whatsoever.



Sherwood had spent decades mastering corporate warfare, building an extensive network of allies and maintaining a spotless public reputation.


However, Howe represented his single greatest vulnerability.


Operating under Sherwood's direct commands,Howe had committed countless felonies, including the vicious actions of taking Verena away from her parents.



Now that they'd strategically leaked Howe's confession regarding the incriminating evidence he possessed, Sherwood's agitation was completely predictable, and his desperate countermeasures were inevitable.



Isaac's eyebrow lifted slightly as he murmured to himself, "Looks like it's time to begin drawing them into our trap... gradually."

 
Following a moment of contemplative silence, he  reached into his jacket's inner pocket, elegant fingers dancing across his phone screen to connect with Luis.



The call went through immediately, and Isaac spoke without preamble. "Luis, my surveillance team followed Sherwood to some club in the suburbs last night."


′′Asuburban club?" Luis' voice carried obvious skepticism through the connection.



"Exactly.Since Ochrerayd falls under your jurisdiction,I can't just charge in blindly. This investigation belongs to you. Sherwood's too clever to choose that location randomly. He selected that remote club for specific reasons. Investigate everyone connected to that establishment, from employees to regular customers.Leave no stone unturned. The answers we need might be hiding in plain sight."



"Understood," Luis confirmed. "Rest assured, I'll dispatch a team immediately. We'll tear that establishment apart piece by piece."


"Perfect.Maintain tight surveillance on Sherwood, but don't tip him off." Isaac's tone grew more cautious."He's already heightened his defenses. One wrong move could send him running. We need to capitalize on his current vulnerability and force him into making desperate choices." "No need to worry," Luis assured him. "I've got experienced operatives handling this assignment.There won't be any slip-ups. You'll hear from me the second we uncover anything significant."


Isaac gave his approval. "Excellent. I'll await your report."





Both men terminated the connection.



At Sampson Group, Luis tucked his phone into his trouser pocket and pushed himself up from his chair.One hand braced against his desk while the other reached for the landline receiver, just as someone rapped on his office door.
###Chapter 373 Only To Find Herself Ensnared Instead



Luis instinctively turned his head toward the door and spoke with firm composure. "Come in,please." The door swung wide, and at the threshold stood Miranda, her figure striking, her very presence commanding attention.



She wore a playful smile, her eyes sparkling with hidden mischief."Mr.Sampson,ItrustI'mnotintruding?"



The instant Luis' gaze landed on her, a current of joy rushed through him.



Their last meeting had been at the hotel, and since then, his days had been swallowed by endless affairs,leaving him no time to breathe. Yet at night, she often lingered in his dreams like an unfinished melody.



It almost seemed that, after reaching an agreement with him the other day, she had cast him aside completely,never once taking the initiative to reach out.



Now, seeing her before him, Luis could not hide a flicker of surprise.He cleared his throat, gesturing toward a nearby sofa,his voice calm but edged with diplomacy. "I have matters on my plate right now. Please, make yourself at ease over there. You'll find fruit and desserts."


With that,he lowered his head, his long fingers swiftly pressing numbers on the landline.


Miranda,instead of obeying, stepped closer,tilting her head ever so slightly, her gaze glimmering with a teasing spark. "What's this, Mr. Sampson? Have your fortunes climbed so high that you've begun neglecting your guests?"


Luis paused, her words hanging in the air. He lifted his gaze, eyes narrowing slightly, as though trying to read the meaning behind her tone.



Sensing his confusion,Mliranda unzipped her bag and drew out a photograph.



Her slender fingers pinched the corner of the image as she slowly set it before him. "If I remember correctly, given the ties between the Sampsons and the Kirks, Sherwood counts as one of yours, doesn't he? Well, I had an outing with a friend last night, and the moment I walked into the club, I caught him skulking about."



As she recalled the sight, her eyes narrowed, her tone carrying an unconscious trace of judgment. "It struck me as odd, so l kept alookout. When I passed by his private room, I seized the chance to snap this before the door was completely closed."



Her voice was steady, deliberate, as she extended a finger to the photo. "The man seated across from Sherwood-I've crossed paths with him several times in Clokron. From what I know, he's the top boss of that illegal tade there."



Though she spoke vaguely, both knew what she meant.



Miranda leaned in, her eyes locked on Luis, probing."Luis, are you certain you want to be entangled in such murky waters?"



Luis lowered his gaze to the photo.



In the dim haze of the club's private room, the image revealed Sherwood opposite a corpulent man.



Sherwood wore a calm, dignified mask, his posture loose yet sharpened by a furrow of authority between his brows-a face often seen in business talks.



Across from him, the heavyset man lounged on a sofa,a thick cigar burning in his grasp. Smoke swirled upward, cloaking his features yet magnifying the shadow of his underworld weight.


From their gestures, Luis needed no further hint;  something unsavory was clearly under negotiation.


Miranda's words and the image together drew the truth in bold strokes.


"So, that's how it is," Luis murmured, lips curving into a faint smile. "No need for further probing-the facts already speak."


His eyes narrowed. The picture was clear: Sherwood intended to drag both him and the Sampson family into this mire. And knowing Sherwood, he would not hesitate to wield the Sampson name as a shield for his deals. Once the scandal broke and the authorities stepped in, the Sampsons would fall. With their ruin,Sherwood would naturally rise, seizing the seat of Ochrerayd's tycoon.


Luis let out a soft laugh, bitter as it was mocking."Sherwood has indeed mnade a clever and profitable move."



Miranda,still seeing the Sampson-Kirk bond through the lens of Luis and Molly's childhood closeness, had no notion of the deep fissure now between the two houses. Thus, when she saw Sherwood's secrecy the night before, she never imagined any feud. Had she known, her temperament would have urged her to walk away without a glance.


But now, observing Luis' ironic smile and his apparent ignorance of Sherwood's schemes, the truth dawned on her.



Her eyes gleamed with sudden realization. Curving them into crescents, she smiled, raising her hand to lift Luis' chin with playful boldness. "It seems I've unwittingly handed you quite an advantage."


Her lips tilted into a seductive arc, her tone soft, yet teasing. "How do you plan on repaying me?"


Luis did not retreat from her touch; instead,his gaze locked hers with unwavering intensity.


He leaned closer, voice deep, resonant, carrying the weight of unspoken resolve. "Your timing spared me from a great deal of trouble."



Before Miranda could respond, Luis' arm encircled her waist,his hand fastening firmly around her slender form.



With an effortless lift, he set her atop the wide desk.



A shiver coursed through her. She drew in a sharp breath, her hands clutching the desk edge in startled reflex, torn between surprise and a strange thrill.


Her eyes widened, disbelief flashing as she stared at him.





But Luis only leaned closer, his gaze darkening,his pupils mirroring her flustered face. Miranda's lips parted, words trembling on the edge.Yet before she could speak, Luis' hand cradled the back of her head, and his lips descended upon hers.



The kiss came like a storm-impulsive, consuming-as though he meant to release days of pent-up fire in a single moment.


Miranda's mind went blank. What was happening?Wasn't she the one who came to tease, only to find herself ensnared instead?



Her resistance melted. Eyes closing, her hands slid from the desk's edge, wrapping tightly around his shoulders.



The office grew silent, save for the thundering of two hearts, each beat echoing against the other.



The air thickened, charged with rising heat.


Her fingers, as though moved by instinct, drifted across the hard planes of his chest,trembling as they unfastened his shirt button by button.



Yet when her hand reached the final clasp, Luis caught her by the shoulder.



He pulled back slightly, sweat glistening across his brow and slipping down his cheek. The sudden distance left Miranda dazed, confusion clouding her gaze.


And then she saw Luis slip a hand into his trouser pocket, draw out his phone, and press the cal button.
###Chapter 374 You're Not Wriggling Out Of This
The erotic atmosphere in the room evaporated instantly as Miranda stared at Luis with complete confusion.



Luis now gripped his phone tightly. When the call connected, his voice carried its characteristic controlled authority. "Isaac, last night one of my contacts happened to be at the same club. She witnessed Sherwood conducting business with Clokron's top contraband supplier. This confirms he's absolutely determined to frame the Sampson family for drug trafficking. I've got photographic evidence to back it up."



On the other end, Isaac straightened in his seat, his expression shifting to deadly seriousness as his fingers began drumming a steady rhythm against the table.


"That manipulative snake is really pulling out all the stops." Isaac's mouth twisted into a frigid smile,darkness clouding his features. "Looks like surveillance was the smart play. He's planning to destroy the Sampson family completely so he can seize control of the entire Ochrerayd market. What's your strategy for handling this evidence?" "Turn his own weapons against him." Luis' eyes narrowed dangerously, fury creeping into his tone."Since he wants to use this trafficking scandal to demolish our family, we'll let him think he's winning while we prepare his downfall."



Hearing this response, Isaac's eyes sparked with genuine satisfaction. "My thoughts exactly."



Luis continued, "I'll reach out to trustworthy contacts within law enforcement and deliver the evidence through secure channels. We'll have them prepare everything but hold back until we give the green light.When the deal goes down, Sherwood will have every detail perfectly orchestrated. We'll trap him using his own elaborate setup. This operation won't just expose his framing scheme but also destroy his whole empire."



After considering the plan carefully, Isaac replied,"Understood. I'll coordinate from my end. I've got several expert investigators on my payroll. I'll deploy them to trace Sherwood's financial connections and uncover additional criminal evidence. We're going to expose every dirty secret he's hiding."



Something else occurred to Isaac, prompting him to add,"Another crucial point: you need to exercise extreme caution when working with police contacts.Sherwood might have planted informants within the department." This warning made Luis' expression grow even more serious.He responded with unwavering determination,"You're absolutely right. This situation is critical, and l know exactly how to proceed."


After ending the call, Luis set his phone aside.


When he instinctively turned back toward Miranda, he suddenly realized she'd been observing him intently throughout the entire conversation, curiosity and intrigue dancing in her eyes


Simultaneously, he became aware that at some point during the call, he'd unconsciously pressed Miranda's waist against the desk's edge while his right hand had remained firmly planted on her shoulder.



Recognition of their intimate position caused Luis 'eyes to darken slightly as he swallowed with visible difficulty.


He immediately stepped backward, straightened his posture,and awkwardly ran his hand along the back of his neck.



A subtle smile played across Miranda's lips as she straightened up, crossing her arms with deliberate confidence.



Her head tilted at an angle that managed to be both innocent and mischievous. "Luis, you're incredibly  attractive when you're handling business matters.However, I'm not entirely pleased with that thank you gesture from earlier."



Luis cleared his throat uncomfortably, averting his gaze toward the window. "Without your help, we would have wasted considerably more time and resources..."



Before he could complete his deflection, Miranda closed the distance between them with measured steps, and then angled her face upward to capture his eyes directly.


Her expression held layers of playfulness, mock indignation, and something deeper that remained tantalizingly unspoken.



"Nice try, but you're not wiggling out of this," she said,her smile becoming more pronounced. "I'm genuinely dissatisfied with your previous attempt at gratitude.I understand you have pressing matters to handle, so l won't keep you now. But you definitely owe me a proper thank you later."



Luis' attention remained fixed on her face for several heartbeats. Despite understanding perfectly what she was implying, he chose to maintain his facade of innocence. He arched one eyebrow with feigned confusion.  "Really? What exactly would constitute an appropriate expression of my appreciation?"


Miranda saw straight through his calculated performance, her eyes dancing with pure delight.


She drew out her words with deliberate emphasis, her tone dripping with playful threat. "Don't worry, I won't make this too difficult for you. But I'm definitely keeping track of this debt, and there's absolutely no escape. And another thing..." She paused,one eyebrow lifting with subtle mischief. Her slender finger extended to tap gently against Luis' chest. "Next time,perhaps you could be more mindful of our positioning?I was practically trapped against that desk."



With that playful reprimand delivered, Miranda gracefully collected her bag and glided toward the exit.



Her departure carried an effortless elegance that left Luis completely mesmerized, his attention fixed on her retreating form.



His hand rose instinctively to press against the spot where her finger had made contact. Even through the fabric of his shirt, he could feel his pulse hammering wildly, as though his heart might actually break free from his ribcage.



His gaze remained locked on Miranda's figure until the  office door swung shut, finally cutting off his view Only then did consciousness fully return to him.



Luis drew in a shaky breath, desperately attempting to slow his frantic heartbeat. Yet his thoughts refused to cooperate, continuously replaying every gesture,every smile, every subtle movement Miranda had just displayed.



He found himself questioning what kind of enchantment Miranda had woven around him that could so effortlessly reduce him from a composed,intimidating force in the corporate world into someone who could barely maintain his equilibrium.
###Chapter 375 Now Isn't The Time
A long silencestretched before Luis finally settled back into his desk chair.



His hands found the surface, fingers interlacing as gravity settled over his features.



Within moments, Luis reached for the landline phone and placed the call.


His assistant's respectful voice filtered through the receiver almost immediately.



Straightening in his seat, Luis leaned toward the microphone with quiet authority. "Notify the senior executives immediately. We're holding an emergency meeting in ten minutes. Everyone must be present on time."



The phone clicked back into place as Luis sank deeper into his chair, lost in thought.


Eerie silence blanketed the office, broken only by the steady rhythm of the wall clock marking time.



Luis knew all too well that Sherwood's calculated planning meant he was ready to escalate his  campaign  against the Sampson family. When it came to Sherwood's methods, the man would likely stop at nothing. The urgent priority now was alerting Sampson Group's core members, ensuring everyone was mentally prepared and wouldn't be blindsided by Sherwood's next move.



Fingers pressed against his temples as Luis tried to massage away the tension that had been building for some days.



A quick glance at the clock confirmed it was time.He rose from his chair, straightened his tie, and made his way toward the conference room.


The moment he pushed open the door, animated conversations died mid-sentence. Every pair of eyes swiveled toward him.



Sampson Group's most trusted senior members occupied seats around the long rectangular conference table.



On the left side of the table's head sat an elder gentleman, silver threading through his temples,though his ggaze remained razor-sharp. For years, he'd served as Luis' most valued business advisor.



Beside him, a middle-aged woman with a precise bob cut adjusted her elegant gold-rimmed glasses. Her stern expression matched her reputation for cutting  straight to the point.


On the right side of the table's head stood Luis ' longtime capable assistant, Neville Salazar. His tall frame carried a resolute bearing that radiated pure efficiency.


The remaining seats held elites from their respective fields, each renowned for exceptional ability and unwavering loyalty.


Luis approached the conference table's head,palms pressing against its surface as his gaze swept the assembled group.



Brief silence preceded his words, lips barely parting as he spoke. "Everyone, I've called you here because Sampson Group faces an unprecedented crisis."


The moment his words settled, tension thickened the air. Every person straightened in their chair, breath held in complete attention.



Drawing a measured breath, Luis' expression grew grave as he unveiled Sherwood's entire scheme.


Astonishment rippled through the room once the revelation concluded.



"How dare Sherwood commit such outrageous betrayal!" The elder gentleman on the left struck the table with his fist, sending documents fluttering. "Exactly! Sampson Group has always conducted business with integrity.How could he frame us like this!"Another member voiced his agreement.



Luis lifted his hand, commanding silence before continuing. "We now possess evidence of his conspiracy. However, our immediate priority is stabilizing Sampson Group's internal situation. We absolutely cannot afford to panic. Losing our composure would be handing Sherwood exactly what he wants. Furthermore, we cannot let the outside world detect even a hint of weakness. In business, the smallest disturbance can trigger massive stock market fluctuations, and our partners might begin questioning our reliability."



At this, a senior member's hand rose with a question."Mr. Sampson, should we take the initiative and expose Sherwood's conspiracy now?"



Luis shook his head, maintaining his composed demeanor as he responded, "Now isn't the time.While we have evidence, it's not yet sufficient. Rash action could alert Sherwood, giving him the chance to destroy evidence or even escalate to more extreme measures."



He paused deliberately, eyes narrowing with a calculating gleam as his words came slowly."We must wait for the perfect moment to bring Sherwood down."
###Chapter 376 You Have Our Full Support
The woman with the bob cut leaned forward,her brows drawn tight. "Mr. Sampson,what's our next step?We can't just sit on our hands while Sherwood makes his move."



Luis lowered himself into his chair, lacing his fingers together on the polished table. "Stay calm," he said evenly. "I've already mapped out what we need to do."



The atmosphere shifted instantly, the restless whispers dying as every pair of eyes turned his way.



He let a moment stretch before speaking again, his voice carrying quiet authority. "Our first priority is to keep this under wraps. Sherwood must never realize that we're ahead of him, or he'll strike out of desperation. Second, we'll work hand in hand with the police, providing what they need to build the case.And finally, no matter what happens, Sampson Group has to operate without a single hitch. Every project must run as though nothing is amiss, or the outside world will smell weakness."



Heads nodded all around the table, the weight of his words pressing the group into unanimous agreement. The elder gentleman on the left stroked his neatly groomed beard thoughtfully before speaking. "Luis is right. If the company falters even slightly, the vultures outside will circle. Sherwood is just waiting for a crack in our armor. We need to stay steady, let everything move as usual. Not one project can stall."



Neville leaned in eagerly, his voice firm. "I'll keep my finger on the pulse of public opinion. If any rumor or smear surfaces, we'll respond immediately and shield the company's image before it spreads."



Their unified resolve filled the room, and Luis allowed his gaze to drift slowly across their faces. A rare warmth flickered through him, pride threaded with gratitude.



He gave a firm nod, his tone steady but tinged with emotion. "Each of you was chosen by my father, and together we've carried Sampson Group through storms that would have sunk lesser families. As long as we stand together, Sampson Group will remain unshaken."



A hush fell over the room as emotion showed on every face. Each person rose and moved in unison,bowing to Luis with a plain, determined grace. The elder gentleman declared, "You have our full support,Mr.Sampson. We will stand with you and do whatever it takes."Across town, in the Kirk Group CEO suite, plans were unfolding.


"Mr. Kirk, everything is on track. Once Luis shows up at the spot of the transaction and the police arrive there, the Sampson name will be broken. Then we step in and claim what follows."



A middle-aged man leaned in close, his smile oily as he laid out the scheme.



Sherwood let that sink in and then allowed a self-satisfied grin to spread. "Luis still does not understand the game here. I will remind him who runs Ochrerayd."


He stretched back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk, letting his posture say more than his words.



A shadow crossed his face as a new thought sharpened his expression into something predatory.



"Do not slack," he warned. "Make sure Rowland handles the message with extreme care so nothing slips."



The man across from him nodded eagerly, his flattery obvious. "You have my word, Mr. Kirk. I am watching Rowland closely. His grandparents are leverage. If he betrays us, he will pay dearly."


"Good. I'm counting on you to see it through."  Sherwood slowly raised his eyelids and fixed the middle-aged man with a sharp, unblinking stare that held both warning and expectation. "This job has to go off without a hitch. If it falls apart, we both go down with it."
###Chapter 377 Latest Findings



The middle-aged man nodded, his words tumbling out with determination. "Mr. Kirk, everything is secure. I've already struck a deal with Rowland. If hebrings Luis to the appointed spot, his grandparents walk free, and he pockets a hefty payout. The moment he heard it, his face lit up; he's desperate to see this plan through."



"Good. Keep watch and update me the instant anything changes." Sherwood dismissed him with a flick of his hand.



Taking the order for what it was, the man slipped out of the office without hesitation.



Alone again, Sherwood let his attention settle on the glowing monitor that displayed Sampson Group's internal files. A sly grin tugged at the corners of his lips



After Luis recently directed his assistant, Neville, to dig deep into the doctor and driver connected to Verena's abduction years ago, the one carried out by Howe,Neville brought the latest findings within three days



He spread the papers across the desk, flipping briskly to marked sections. "Mr. Sampson, our review uncovered several hospitals that tampered with records during that period. And these drivers, their travel paths match Howe's movements almost exactly.They're highly suspicious."


Luis studied the documents, his expression hardening as his eyes locked on the sections tied to Verena's disappearance.



His tone was low, steady. "Neville, we've broken through. Those hospitals and those drivers must become our immediate focus."


He lifted his gaze, sharp and unwavering. "Form a unit and investigate them one by one. If you find anyone questionable, move in fast and take control before they react."



Neville straightened, thumping his chest with conviction. "Understood, Mr. Sampson. We'll be careful but decisive."



After a short pause, Neville stepped closer, his voice dropping. "There is something else. My latest findings suggest a man named Rowland Green has been pulled into Sherwood's pocket. It looks like coercion mixed with promises of reward."



Luis' pen paused for a breath before moving again.His calm reaction revealed little, though it was clear he had already anticipated this outcome when he sent Neville digging in that direction.


Years of spending time with Sherwood had taught Luis the shape of his enemy, and he understood how far Sherwood would push to win.


Nothing about Sherwood's methods surprised him; the man stopped at very little to seize an advantage.If Sherwood chose to undermine the Sampson family,Luis knew he would try to peel allies away and sow discord. Still, the family's inner circle held firm, loyal and watchful, so simple infiltration was unlikely to work. Beyond that, since Sherwood decided to frame the Sampson family with illegal transactions, he would surely turn his attention to the employees who had access to the edges of the company's core business.


Luis leaned back and closed his eyes briefly,brow smoothing as he gathered his thoughts.



When he opened them again, his focus returned, and he fixed Neville with intent. "I figured he'd try something like this," Luis said, his voice steady. "Tell me everything about Rowland."


Neville flipped through a fresh notebook and spoke with measured clarity. "Rowland started out doing small delivery runs and seemed reliable. Lately,he frequents places tied to Sherwood, and his movements have grown secretive. Our inquiry revealed he was raised by his grandparents after losing  his parents. We checked on his grandparents and learned they have been away from home for a long stretch. All signs point to coercion or bribery by Sherwood's people."



Luis tapped the table once, thoughtful and calm.After a moment, he spoke with resolve. "Sherwood is using the oldest trick in the book: threaten the family to bend the man. Now that we know, we cannot let this plan take hold."
###Chapter 378 Found The Driver And Doctor
Moonlight seeped through the blinds, casting pale streaks across the office floor.



Luis toyed absently with the pen in his hand, his eyes fixed on the paperwork in front of him, every line scrutinized with cold precision.


The sudden buzz of his phone shattered the quiet.


He lifted his gaze to the screen, saw the caller's name,and swiped to answer.



Neville's voice came through in a hushed tone. "Mr.Sampson,I tracked down the doctor and driver tied to Howe's operation. The driver's name is Reginald Todd;he's hauling freight on the west side now. The doctor,Bohumil Navarro, delivered Laura. He left Plentlight Hospital years ago and now runs a small private clinic."



For a moment, Luis didn't speak, his fingers tapping a slow rhythm against the desk.



When he finally did, his voice dropped like ice. "Good.Follow standard procedure. Move them to the suburban warehouse. I'll handle the questioning myself. No one else is to know." "Yes, sir," Neville replied, before cutting the line.


Within the hour, Neville gathered two bodyguards and headed out.


At the freight station, they lay in wait. Three long hours passed before Reginald appeared, unloading cargo. The men grabbed him fast, pinning him on both sides, and shoved him into the back of a van.



Bohumil proved no harder. Neville booked an appointment under a false name, and the moment the consultation room door clicked shut, cold steel pressed against the doctor's back, ushering him out without a sound.


By nightfall, the warehouse was alive with shadows.


A dim bulb dangled from above, its weak light swaying across the grim interior.



Bohumil was lashed to an iron chair, sweat dripping down his temples as his wide eyes stayed glued to the entrance.



Reginald sat slumped on the floor, mud smeared across his clothes, his fingers nervously tracing the cracks in the cement floor.



Once both were restrained, Neville dialed Luis again with the update. Luis gave only one order-to guard them closely,before grabbing his coat and striding out of his office.


The rumble of his black vehicle soon broke the silence of the outskirts. Gravel crunched beneath the tires, and the headlights cut jagged beams through the warehouse gloom.



Reginald shrank into the corner, one arm lifted against the blinding glare. Panic slipped through his trembling fingers.


Bohumil turned his face aside, eyes flickering with dread.



The car door creaked open, and Luis emerged. His polished shoes splashed into shallow puddles,each measured step echoing in the captives' chests like thunder.



As he walked through the wash of headlights, the hem of his trench coat swept in the wind, his face concealed in darkness.



Only the glint of a silver tie clip broke through,catching the light as it swayed with his movements.


Reginald's throat bobbed as he forced a swallow, his voice cracking. "Y-You... you're..."


Luis closed the distance before Reginald could choke  out another word.



The single bulb overhead carved deep shadows across his features, and the icy weight of his stare pinned Reginald in place. Having spent years working for Howe,Reginald knew at once who stood before him.



Reginald remembered the sting at the back of his neck, sharp and fast,hitting him just after he set down the final box at the freight station. Then everything faded into darkness. When he came to, he was lying in this warehouse, disoriented and cold. At first, he figured he must've crossed someone during a delivery,maybe ticked off the wrong client. If that were all it was, he could have shrugged it off and moved on. But what shook him to his core was discovering who had ordered the abduction. It was Luis. That truth landed like a punch to the gut.



Ever since that incident years back, Reginald had stayed hidden behind a false name, just as Sherwood told him to. He kept his head down, stayed out of sight, and made sure the Sampson family never caught wind of him. But now, Luis had tracked him down. It was clear things weren't nearly as simple as he had once believed.



Across the room, Bohumil sat bound to the iron chair,ignorant of the truth.



He hadn't realized the man cowering nearby had been  Howe's driver, nor had he recognized the figure in the shadows as the brother of the baby girl he had placed beside Laura two decades ago. He only knew he had once followed Howe's orders, and the guilt of it lingered.



Luis advanced with deliberate steps, and Neville moved quickly to meet him, spine rigid as he presented a file bound in brown paper. "Mr. Sampson,I've gathered their records."


The cover bore two names, circled in red: Reginald Todd and Bohumil Navarro.



Luis flipped it open. Yellowed photographs slipped out,followed by worn statements.



The first image showed a man in a baseball cap putting a black suitcase into a van. The license plate matched the vehicle Howe had used in those years past.



There was no longer any doubt,Reginald had been the one behind the wheel, helping Howe pull off the job.



Next came Bohumil's résumé, the word "health reasons" scrawled as the cause of his resignation from the hospital.


The weak excuse fell apart against the truth that he now practiced freely at a private clinic. Finally, Luis reached the bank records.


Luis let out a cold, mirthless laugh.



Each month, on the fifteenth, identical deposits landed in both men's accounts. The sums dwarfed their supposed earnings, five times what a freight driver or a modest clinic doctor could expect.



Luis studied the evidence in silence, and then crouched low in front of Reginald.



His hand, long-jointed and steady, smacked the file hard against Reginald's chest. The sound echoed in the warehouse, and the man jerked instinctively,recoiling deeper into the corner.
###Chapter 379 We Have Ways To Make You Talk
Luis' voice came out low and controlled, as cold and dark as a winter night, and his stare pinned Reginald like a speck of dust on glass. "Do you remember what you did on the night of June 15th, twenty-five years ago?"



Reginald's pupils dilated; his whole body recoiled as if from an invisible blow. "I... I don't know what you're talking about," he stammered, each word thin and hurried.



"You don't know?" Luis' lip curled. He leaned in until his breath-cool and sharp-feathered Reginald's cheek. "Do I have to bring Howe here for you to remember how to answer?"



Fear mapped itself across Reginald's face. He hadn't had any dealings with the Sampson family in two decades, but the memory of Luis in the newspapers-the rumors, the headlines-had lodged in his brain like a splinter. He had no wish to experience Luis' methods firsthand. And yet Sherwood's old threat, the one that had shadowed him for over twenty years, tightenedits grip in his chest He turned his face away at the thought, jaw clenched so hard his molars sang, and shouted with an edge of practiced denial, "I don't know! Whatever happened on June 15th has nothing to do with me. I'm just a truck driver-working to make ends meet. How would I remember something from so long ago?"



He barked the lie and stole anxious glances at Luis from the corners of his eyes, every nerve on fire.Nothing he felt could be spoken aloud; Sherwood's threats had been with him for over twenty years, a dead-end road any confession would only cement.Admitting the truth felt like signing his own sentence.



So he kept up the act, louder now, frantic. "You've got the wrong man! I really don't know-so why am l being held?"



Exactly the performance Luis had expected. Sherwood had trained men well-made them skittish, made them predictable.



Luis rose slowly and eased his tie loose with the motion of a man removing a shirt after a long day."Trouble remembering?" he said softly, almost conversational. "Maybe you need a little help."


He meticulously adjusted the creases on his sleeve,his expression hardening to stone. "Don't worry. We have ways of making people remember." He flicked his eyes toward Neville. Neville obliged with an almost animal efficiency.



Two men moved like predators closing on prey. They tore at the ropes around Reginald's wrists with blunt efficiency and hoisted him upward before he could gather his thoughts.



Coarse hemp chafed his skin. The pulley groaned and Reginald's world tipped; the floor dropped away and the ceiling rushed to meet his vision.



The blinding incandescent lamp above him stabbed at his eyes, forcing them shut; blood thundered in his temples and the room slid into a white,disorienting hum.



"Let me go!" he screamed, flailing as chains clattered and metal complained. "You're breaking the law!"



The only answer was a brief flare as Luis struck a match. The cigar's flame painted his lips in a flicker of amber.



Smoke curled from the stub, a lazy veil that did nothing to soften the ruthlessness in his gaze.



Luis leaned against a rusted iron frame, eyes narrowed,as if the sound of Reginald's pleas were nothing but distant rain. Neville stepped forward and forced Reginald's jaw open, fingers pinning the loose flesh with a deliberate,clinical pressure. "Mr. Sampson asked you a question.Answer truthfully."



He tightened his grip, his voice an ugly calm. "If you don't speak, we'll hang you until your blood vessels burst. We have ways to make you talk before you draw your last breath."



Before the threat finished settling, the man at his side began turning the pulley.



The ropes cinched. Reginald's scream was swallowed by iron and echo, a raw, terrible sound that bounced off the empty walls of the warehouse and left behind only the metallic rhythm of chains.



When Luis uttered "June 15th,twenty-five years ago"and mentioned Howe, Bohumil jerked in the iron chair as if jolted by a live wire. His head snapped up, glasses sliding low on his nose, eyes widening at Luis with raw,unguarded horror.



The interrogation cracked open the vault of yellowed memories-the harsh glare of a delivery room, the woman lying there with a stillborn baby, Howe pressing a manila envelope into his trembling hands,and, most damning of all, the faint, muffled whimper of a newborn whose face had been smothered beneath a palm... Bohumil swallowed hard. Sweat crawled down his temples, nudging his spectacles until they slid halfway down his nose, baring eyes on the brink of collapse.


"Luis... Luis Sampson? You're Luis Sampson-the CEO of Sampson Group?" His voice cracked apart, each syllable rasping like broken glass.



Luis, cigar balanced elegantly between his knuckles,turned with leisurely menace. A smile ghosted across his lips, but his gaze cut like a blade.


"Ah," he drawled, each word stretched thin and cold."So at least someone here remembers how to think."



His leather soles whispered across the damp concrete,carrying a draft of chill that seemed to follow him. He stopped before Bohumil,leaning forward.Ashes from the cigar tumbled, one glowing ember landing squarely on Bohumil's trembling shoe. The man flinched but dared not move.



"Since you seem to remember the past," Luis murmured, his tone deceptively calm, "let's talk properly. Tell me,Bohumil-how did my sister end up raised as another family's child?"


Fear tore through Bohumil. Unlike Reginald, Bohumil had never been hardened by Howe's training. Luis ' presence-his reputation alone, his ruthlessness-shook him to the bone. 
He babbled, desperation pushing him to absolve himself. "Mr. Sampson, I-I had no choice! Howe sent men to my house, knives pressed to my daughter's throat. He showed me a video, said if I didn't forge the birth certificate and switch the babies, he'd sell her off to some godforsaken place."



His voice cracked into a sob. "I'm a father too! Please,for my daughter's sake, spare me-"



Before the words had fully left his mouth, Luis' low chuckle sliced through the air. Smoke curled from his lips in a sinister ribbon, twisting like a serpent around his grin.



Neville,watching, narrowed his eyes.



Years beside Luis had taught him to read the slightest shift in his employer's expression. That cold gleam in Luis' gaze needed no translation.


He stepped forward. His fist shot out, slamming into Bohumil's right cheek with bone-snapping force.


The dull thud rang in the silence, whipping Bohumil's head to the side and sending the iron chair screeching against the floor.



His gold-rimmed glasses spun away, skidding across the floor until one lens fractured into a spider's web. Gentle as he might appear in daily life, Neville was lethaI when unleashed, having been by Luis' side for years.


Blow after blow fell with surgical cruelty-jaw, nose,eye socket-each punch placed to break without mercy. Blood spattered, teeth clattered against the floor in a wet rattle.



"Mr. Sampson asked you a question," he growled,pinning Bohumil's jaw in one hand as his other fist crashed down again. "You don't get to dodge or mumble half-truths."



Seven strikes later, Bohumil's face was a ruin-nose bent grotesquely, one eye swollen shut.



He wheezed through a crimson froth, his voice a rasping plea on his battered lips. "Mr. Sampson...mercy, please... I'll talk. I'll tell you everything..."


The warehouse swallowed his hoarse cries, leaving only the echo of his ragged breath.



Luis lifted a hand. "Shhh." That single gesture silenced Bohumil more effectively than any gag.
###Chapter 380 I'll Confess Everything
Luis let his mouth curl into something that was neither smile nor frown, his voice sharp as broken glass. "Tell me, what did Howe dangle in front of you that was worth your soul? Forged papers, swapped infants,you played God like it was child's play."



His words cut short as his eyes slid toward Reginald,dangling upside down like a slaughtered beast.



He continued with a bite of contempt, "And you,Reginald Todd. Sherwood painted you a dream of quiet days and easy living. That fantasy ends tonight."



Luis' brow tightened, and his tone shifted,pressing harder. "Was there really nothing more? Did you sell yourself just to keep driving trucks, or..."



He leaned in, voice dropping low,each word dripping poison. "...or is Sherwood holding your son's life overseas as ransom?"



The mention of his child sent Reginald into a fit of panic. He thrashed wildly, rope biting deeper into his flesh until blood streaked his ankles, his eyes wide with desperate terror. Luis watched the spectacle with cold detachment, lips twisting into a cruel line. "I have time," he murmured,almost amused. "So start talking. I'll listen to every word."



A deafening crack of thunder tore through the night sky.



Rain hammered against the warehouse roof, sheets of water racing down the walls.



The storm rattled the building until the hanging bulb swung violently, shadows jerking across the captives ' faces in grotesque shapes.



In the shifting glow, Luis' figure towered, the outline of a predator circling its prey. He rolled the cigar between his fingers, the ember pulsing in rhythm with the glint of steel in his gaze.


Bohumil shook so hard the chair rattled beneath him.When the thunder rolled again, he flinched, his swollen eyes lifting just enough to lock on Luis with raw fear.



Reginald writhed harder with every crack of thunder,his body swinging like a pendulum. His eyes, veined and wild, brimmed with terror. The rope dug mercilessly into his ankles until fresh blood spilled down, dripping onto the concrete and blending with the rainwater swept in through the slightly open  window, forming a grotesque crimson pool.


Luis broke the silence with a voice that cut colder than the storm outside. "Do you hear it? That thunder is the echo of my sister's screams twenty-five years ago,the helpless cries no one answered. It is also the mourning of my parents. Tonight, it is your turn to pay for it all."



Another violent crash of thunder rattled the rafters,making the bulb sway madly.



The warehouse seemed to shrink in on itself, thick with suffocating dread that pressed against every chest.



Unable to endure the weight of it any longer, Bohumil cracked. His wrists strained against the ropes, his swollen eyes rolling in panic before his voice tore free.



"I'LL speak! I'll confess everything!" The words spilled out,ragged and desperate, flecked with spit and blood."It was June 15th, twenty-five years ago. A woman in my care started hemorrhaging during childbirth. The baby... the baby was already gone."


Luis' gaze locked on him, unblinking, and Bohumil lowered his head as though scorched. "I was about to report it," he whispered hoarsely, "when Howe stormed in. He shoved his phone in my face, a video of my daughter. He said if I didn't do as he asked, she'd suffer."



Rain whipped harder against the metal roof, water dripping through in erratic streams. The light flickered,buzzing like an electric warning, throwing the scene into a stuttering nightmare.



Luis dropped his half-burned cigar onto the wet floor,grinding the ember out beneath his shoe. "Keep talking."



Bohumil darted a glance upward, caught the icy blade of Luis' stare, and immediately looked away again.



"He told me to switch the Sampson baby girl with the dead child and to falsify the records. In exchange, he handed me two million. But his warning was worse than the bribe; if I breathed a word of it, I'd never live to see forty."
###Chapter 381 Aren't You Going To Confess
Luis narrowed his eyes, the veins at his neck throbbing as though anger itself pulsed through them. "So you forged a birth certificate to aid and abet?"


Bohumil gave a silent nod, his head sinking as if the weight of the world pressed upon it. "Later, I followed their orders and resigned, hiding on the outskirts of the city to open a small clinic. On the fifteenth of every month, Howe would send me some money..."


With every word, his voice ebbed away, softer and weaker,heavy with resignation.


Luis no longer spared him a glance. His gaze shifted instead to Reginald, strung up in the air like a marionette without strings of his own.


He unfastened the cuff of his suit jacket, revealing a silver watch that gleamed coldly beneath the harsh white light. His tone cut through the silence like steel."And you? Aren't you going to confess?"



The question had barely left his lips when Reginald's inverted body thrashed violently.



Bohumil's confession had been a spark in dry tinder,  and Reginald's buried fury roared to life.


Blood rushed to his face, swelling it into something grotesque,his eyes red and near to bursting. "Bohumil,you traitor!" he howled.



Luis stepped closer, producing a yellowed photograph from his pocket. It showed Reginald's son, radiant and proud, receiving an award at an international piano competition.



"A prodigy, was he?" Luis' finger traced the photo's edge as a bitter smile curved his lips."And yet I heard hisleft pinky was severed more than twenty years ago?"


The words struck Reginald like a hammer blow,leaving him rigid and mute.


A broken whimper escaped his throat, and the defiance in his eyes collapsed into dust. "It was Sherwood... he forced me!" he gasped. "After I helped Howe,Sherwood ambushed me."


Grinding his teeth, he pressed on. "He said I knew too much-either take three million and vanish, or..." His voice cracked."He clamped my son's hand with pliers right before my eyes. He swore if I dared to speak a word,he would cut off all ten fingers."



The memory dragged Reginald back into that nightmare: Sherwood's smile cold as ice, his son tied to a chair, staring with hopeless eyes. When Sherwood first demanded that he sink to the life of a truck driver, Reginald could not bear it.



But the slightest hint of resistance was enough.Sherwood severed his son's pinky without hesitation.


Reginald's face burned crimson, his voice thick and heavy. "I had no choice but to yield. I changed my name and went into hiding. For over twenty years, I've been driving freight, nothing more."



Luis' expression shifted, a storm of emotions flickering in his eyes.



Now,most of the truth had surfaced, yet his hatred for Sherwood burned hotter than ever in his heart.



He clenched his jaw, forcing his fury into silence.He knew these two were only pawns on the chessboard,and keeping them alive might serve a greater plan.



Luis raised a hand and rubbed at his temples, steadying his breath.



His eyes fell on Reginald, whose face was purple and swollen from hanging, and he spoke with chilling casualness. "Let him down."



The bodyguards moved without delay, stepping forward to loosen the ropes. Reginald dropped heavily to the floor, coughing violently as he gulped for air.


Luis stood over him, gaze sharp and disdainful. "Give him some water."



Then he turned to Neville, his words low and frigid,each one precise as a blade. "Keep them under strict watch. Ensure they have enough food and water.Don't let them die. And be wary of Reginald-he knows how to fight."



With his orders delivered, Luis turned on his heel and strode toward the warehouse door.
###Chapter 382 It Still Tastes Just As Good
In the CEO's office of Sampson Group, Luis sat in his leather chair, shoulders hunched over a sea of paperwork, eyes scanning line after line of text.



A knock sounded against the frosted glass door. He rubbed at his temples, easing the dull ache there, and looked up just as the door creaked open.



Verena peeked in, a bright smile on her lips and an insulated food container tucked carefully in her arms.Isaac trailed after her,balancing an elegant meal box as though it were something precious.



"Luis," Verena called, her voice carrying an eager warmth that instantly lifted the air.



At the sight of her, Luis set aside his pen and shifted past the scattered reports, his gaze catching on the container she held. "And what have you brought me this time? So mysterious."



Before Verena could answer, Isaac stepped forward,smoothly taking the container from her hands and setting it on the coffee table beside the meal box."Marisa made borscht for Verena," he explained."Verena said you've been working yourself ragged and skipping breakfasts. She thought you might need this."



Luis reached for the container, the quiet click of the lid snapping open ringing in the stillness. It hit him all at once-the aroma, the faint warmth curling into the air. A pang tightened in his chest.



Marisa hadn't cooked in ages-not since her illness had taken that part of her from him.



It had been years since he'd tasted the flavors she used to prepare with such care.



"In that case," he said, his voice gentling as his eyes glistened faintly, "thanks to Verena, I can enjoy Mom's cooking again."


Verena carefully drew out a porcelain bowl, delicate as a piece of art, and ladled in the steaming soup."Then try it now," she urged with a playful smile. "Mom even added her secret spice."



She passed the bowl into his waiting hands. Luis held it a moment longer than necessary, fingers tightening around the smooth ceramic, before he finally lowered his head and took a bite with a spoon.



The broth was hot, rolling down his throat with the gentle bite of pepper, the sweetness of tomato, and the hearty depth of beef.



"Over twenty years," he murmured, his voice husky,  thumb tracing the rim of the bowl as though it grounded him. "It still tastes just as good."



His knuckles whitened against the porcelain, and Verena, noticing the strain, slipped down onto the sofa beside him. She placed a light hand on his, smiled,and gave it a reassuring pat. "Don't worry, Luis,"' she said gently. "There will always be more chances like this. Oh,by the way..."



She pivoted the conversation with practiced ease."Has Miranda reached out to you lately? Yesterday she wouldn't stop pestering me about the new jewelry line at Sampson Group-insisted she had to try on the bracelets."



Her phone was in her hand before Luis could answer.The glow of the screen lit her face, sharpening the impish curve of her mouth. "See? She was desperate enough to blow up my messages. I didn't even dare reply."



Luis lowered the bowl carefully, his lips parting as though to respond-but a sharp knock on the door cut through the moment.



"Sir, Rowland requests an audience," came the assistant's voice from outside, level and formal, every syllable crisp against the quiet office.


The interruption snapped the air taut. Luis' expression  hardened, his eyes instinctively flicking toward the frosted glass door.



Verena, sensing the shift,tucked away her phone, her earlier playfulness vanishing like mist.



Isaac bent quickly to straighten the clutter on the coffee table, his movements discreet, almost ceremonial.



A beat later, Luis lifted his brows in the faintest acknowledgment, his face unreadable as he opened the file before him. "Send him in."



The door swung wide a breath later.Rowland stepped inside with a smile polished too brightly, his eyes betraying the jitter beneath it.



Left alone with Luis, he advanced to the desk, inclining his head in stiff deference. "Good morning,sir."



Luis met his greeting with a calm, unblinking stare.When he finally spoke, his voice was even, measured -controlled. "What brings you here, Rowland?"
###Chapter 383 | Never Forget Whom I Serve
Rowland moistened his parched lips, cleared his throat,and spoke with a hint of foreboding. "Mr. Sampson,unless fate takes an unexpected turn, trouble is about to knock at our door."



"Oh?" Luis paused mid-flip through his files,his brow furrowing in doubt. "And what kind of trouble would that be?"



"It's Darrell," Rowland stepped forward boldly, his voice dropping to a hushed urgency. "Last night...I caught him red-handed. He was using that stuff-the contraband! I saw it myself, sealed in tiny plastic bags.He was sneaking about with someone-looked very much like a deal in the making..."



Darrell Sugden had been Luis' handpicked man to oversee the entire network of underground clubs in Ochrerayd.



Luis had entrusted him with enormous authority, a domain stretching from polished private lounges to the darkest gambling dens.



Through the years, Darrell had managed the underworld with meticulous care, sending Luis a steady  stream of staggering profits.



It was this very success that secured Darrell's seat at the heart of the organization.



Before Rowland could finish, Luis' palm struck the desk like a hammer, sending the pen springing half a foot into the air.



"What did you just say? How many times have I told you all-keep your hands off that poison! Do my warnings echo into a void?"



Luis shot to his feet, his eyes flashing like drawn steel,his presence weighing heavily on the room.



Startled by his fury, Rowland staggered a step back,his shoulders hunching instinctively.



"How many years has Darrell commanded Ochrerayd's underworld affairs? And now this? As if my words were mere whispers in the wind!" Luis' voice dripped witha frost so cold it froze the air. "Tell me, how can I keep my standing in the underworld with this mockery hanging over me?"



Snatching a porcelain ornament from the desk, he hurled it with force against the wall. It shattered in a sharp crash, fragments scattering like icy snow and leaving a veil of dust settling over the carpet.



Rowland trembled at the violent outburst, his knees  quivering beneath his trousers.



He fought down his fear, his Adam's apple rising and falling as he forced a shaky smile. "Mr. Sampson, I know your anger is justified..."


But Luis whirled.on him before he could go on,his stare sharp as an eagle's beak, cutting the air between them.



Rowland's throat tightened. He swallowed hard, and then pressed on with caution. "But the real danger lies ahead. If Darrell's case isn't dealt with, others may take courage from it and follow the same path."



He deliberately softened his voice, trying to sound earnest as he bent to gather the broken shards,stealing a glance at Luis' clenched jaw while doing SO.


Rowland had seldom uttered a falsehood in his life,yet here he stood, lying to one of the most intimidating men he knew. His heart thundered in his chest,his hands trembling so much that they betrayed the anxiety he worked hard to conceal.



"Leave it," Luis said slowly, his tone firm as stone."Someone else will see to the cleaning."



Rowland quickly set the fragments aside, straightened up, and answered with respectful haste, "Yes, sir."


Luis lowered himself back into his chair, his icy gaze  sweeping over Rowland's taut expression.


"Rowland." His voice dropped to a deliberate calm."I'll ask you once more-are you absolutely certain?"


The question, though mild in tone, struck Rowland's ears like thunder.



He clenched his teeth, his nails digging into his palms,and forced himself to meet Luis' gaze.



But when he saw those eyes that seemed to strip away every pretense, a flicker of panic crossed his own.



With sheer will, he smothered the fear,lifted his head abruptly, and declared with strained conviction, "Mr.Sampson, I swear it on my very life. Darrell carries a gun at his back, and the crates are filled with those contraband goods-"



His voice broke, and he slammed his left hand on the desk. "If I'm lying, take this hand as the price!"



Though his words rang with trembling intensity and his legs shook beneath him, Rowland forced himself to stand steady, determined not to let his fear betray him.



As his vow fell into the air, silence swallowed the office whole.


 
Rowland's unease grew unbearable-his Adam's apple  bobbed visibly, cold sweat trickling down his neck and seeping into his collar, spreading into a dark stain at his waist.



Every heartbeat of Luis' silence was like the blade of a guillotine dangling above his neck.



At last, just as Rowland was about to collapse under the weight of it, Luis suddenly threw back his head and laughed.


Rowland blinked in confusion, caught off guard.


Luis lifted a handkerchief and calmly wiped the photo frame beside him. "Rowland, you've done well.Few dare keep such a watchful eye on Darrell. I'll remember this courage of yours."


He lowered his gaze, concealing the flicker in his eyes.



Rowland, hearing this reprieve and sensing no mnore suspicion from Luis, loosened his stiff back and exhaled heavily.



Straightening his posture, he stretched a sycophantic smile across his face. In a tone thick with devotion,he said, "Mr. Sampson, I never forget whom I serve. No matter how fearsome Darrell may seem, I'll face him head-on. Whatever danger lies ahead, I'll bear it for you!"



Luis kept polishing the frame, his gaze fixed downward. Rowland's fervent oaths rang through the office, yet in Luis' heart, a quiet, mocking sneer had already taken root.
###Chapter 384 Someone Crucial
Luis' eyes glittered with a cold, amused irony. To him,Rowland's declaration of loyalty was nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing. His lies, full of seams and weak stitches, looked laughable under that stare.



Luis fought down the laugh that wanted to burst free,the corner of his mouth barely twitching as his narrow,deep-set gaze roved over Rowland's flushed face.



One look told him everything: the man's forced calm,the eagerness for approval. A pawn desperate for a favor-already the most obvious piece to be sacrificed on the board-and he didn't even know.



Luis set the photo frame back with deliberate cae,turning it face down on the desk. He neatly folded and smoothed the handkerchief beside it with precise,almost ritualistic motions.



Then, lifting his head, he asked softly, "You've worked under me for years. I want to hear your thoughts. If we were to deal with Darrell, how do you think we should proceed?"


Rowland blinked, taken aback for a heartbeat, and then pasted on a sycophantic smile so fast it might have been rehearsed. Excitement threaded his voice."Mr. Sampson, if it were up to me, we'd gather everyone tied to the underground businesses. Make an example of Darrell in front of them. Let those punks see that breaking your rules leads to only one end: death."



His hands sketched phrases in the air as he spoke,nervous flourishes betraying his confidence. "Think about it. If word spreads about Darrell, the underlings will riot. Authority has to be established-in public."


Luis leaned back into the leather, fingers tapping a slow, measured rhythm on the armrest. A small,almost amused smile curved his lips. "Rowland, that makes sense."



Pride swelled in Rowland's chest. He fought to wrap the feeling in deferential humility. "All thanks to your guidance, Mr. Sampson."


"You can go," Luis said,waving a hand without looking up. His voice dropped, flat and certain. "I'll handle Darrell's mess myself."



"Yes,sir," Rowland answered, bowed, and left the room with practiced, respectful steps.
When the door shut, Luis let his eyes narrow until they were slits; the warmth drained from them like color from a photograph. Silence settled in the office, broken only by the steady tapping of hs fingertips against wood-a slow,dangerous metronome in the hush.



The lounge door slid open without a sound. Verena and lsaac glided in, exchanging a brief, loaded look with Luis.



Isaac broke the quiet first. "Looks like this drama's headed for its climax."



Luis' hand closed on the photo frame and flipped it upright.



In the yellowed photograph, a younger Joseph stood in a dark blue suit, Sherwood's hand thrown over his broad shoulder; the old courtyard wall behind them crawled with ivy, both men smiling into the sun.



Now the glass reflected Luis-cold, hard, implacable.He pressed a fingertip to Sherwood's faint smirk as if trying to blur the man from existence.



Sherwood in that image was, to Luis, nothing more than a snake that had learned to grin.



He fixed his gaze on that frozen smile, the words low and bitter as gravel. "Those who stir trouble from the shadows will be paid back in the same coin."


Verena settled herself across from him, pearl earrings  swinging softly, catching the lamp's light.


She rested her elbows on the desk, thumb and forefinger supporting her temple, and spoke in a controlled,thoughtful cadence. "Sherwood is trying to pin serious crimes on the Sampson family, but he can't do it alone: Daren-the old fox-is the linchpin Sherwood needs him to manufacture the frame. We need to have the police monitor their calls and record transactions, timing of deliveries. That's how we expose his setup."



Listening, the hatred in Luis' eyes refashioned itself into something sharper-an icier, more focused light.


He set the frame down with the same deliberate calm and looked at Verena and Isaac. "You reminded me of something."



He let his plan show in the corners of his mouth. "I'll put a few trustworthy officers on Sherwood-24/7surveillance of his communications."



He met their eyes, a cold promise curling into a smile."This time, let's make Sherwood taste the sting of his own trap."



"There's someone else we've overlooked-someone crucial." Isaac drummed his fingers against the desk,each dull thud echoing like a ticking clock.


Verena leaned back in her chair, brows knitting as she  studied him. "We've already accounted for all of Sherwood's cards, haven't we?"



Luis halted his pen mid-spin, his confusion mirroring hers as his eyes settled on lsaac.



A thin sneer curved Isaac's mouth. "Sherwood's a wily old fox. He's willing to throw himself into the fire, but notice how he keeps his daughter under lock and key at home. That's his weak point."



Their network of informants had mapped Sherwood's daily life to the smallest detail-his routines,his guards, even the rhythm of his household.



Isaac folded his arms, gaze dipping with cold certainty."We could track him forever and still come up short.But if we hold his daughter, he'll fold. No questions asked."



Understanding flickered across Verena's face like sudden light. Her eyes brightened as she leaned forward. "You're suggesting we use Molly as leverage?"



A low laugh slipped from her lips. "Sherwood hides her away with guards at every corner. Getting her out of that fortress will take more than brute force-it'll take finesse."



Isaac opened his mouth, but Luis was already sliding his pen aside. He reached for a leather-bound calendar, fingers skimming across its pages until they came to rest.



"In three days," he said, his voice carrying a cold edge,"the Mile Art Museum is holding its Emerging Artists Exhibit. Molly will be there without question."



Painting was Molly's passion, though her canvases betrayed no natural gift. Backed by Sherwood's inexhaustible wealth, she staged annual shows regardless, each one swarming with social climbers eager to curry favor with her father.



Half a year ago, she had pressed an invitation into Luis ' hand. He'd declined, but his mind catalogued details with the precision of a blade; one glance was all it took for the memory to resurface.



After listening to his explanation, Verena nodded slowly. "So that's our window."


Her gaze lingered on Luis' tightened jaw, and then shifted to the fire burning behind Isaac's eyes. At last she straightened, lips curling with a confident tilt."Neither of you fits that crowd. Molly's circle is all about high society ladies. I can pass as a staff member-slip in, slip out, no one the wiser. Let me take the lead on this one."



Luis' expression softened, pride flickering through the warmth in his eyes. He reached out, laying a steady  hand on her shoulder. His voice was low, threaded with the quiet authority only an elder brother carried. "No one sees details the way you do. You're the only one who can pull this off. I can breathe easier with you in charge, but promise me you won't take reckless chances. Your safety comes first."


Verena covered his hand with hers, giving two light pats of reassurance. "I know. Don't worry. Trust me."



Beside her,Isaac lifted a hand, brushing a loose strand from her face with reverent care. His touch lingered,thumb grazing her cheek as though she were something too rare to mishandle. "I'll see the museum's cameras disabled, and my best men stationed nearby," he promised.



His voice, indulgent yet commanding, pressed close."Stay sharp. If anything feels wrong, signal me. I'll bring backup and break the doors down myself if l have to."



Verena's lips curved in amusement at his tension.She tilted her face up, eyes glittering with mischief. "With my husband watching over me, what could I possibly fear?"
###Chapter 385 Is This Your Idea Of Asking For A Favor
Three days later, the Mile Art Museum glittered like a jewel box. Crystal chandeliers fractured the light into diamonds that danced across the marble floor,painting the exhibition hall in shifting mosaics of brilliance and shadow.



Molly swept in wearing a custom mint-green gown the hem whispering with each step. Diamond hairpins caught the light like shards of ice, scattering sparks with the sway of her head.


She stood before her crown jewel of an oil painting,her voice smooth as silk as she described the inspiration behind her work. Guests leaned closer,faces bright with fascination-or at least the polished version of it society demanded.


The moment she fell silent, a woman at her side pressed a manicured hand to her chest, nearly wilting against the weight of admiration. The hem of her gown fanned across the carpet as she gasped,"This composition is divine! Miss Kirk, your command of light and shadow would shame the masters."



Not to be outdone, another rich lady in scarlet heels  teetered forward, her lips glossed into a perfect smile."Molly, you're extraordinary. The way you wield color,your brushwork-it's genius. Picasso reborn, surely."


From behind them, a third voice chimed in, sweet as honey and twice as sticky. "I hear you're preparing for a solo tour? My husband insists we must secure one of your originals for our collection."



Praise wrapped around Molly like a silken cloak. Her smile widened, bright enough to reach her eyes, and she lifted her chin, shoulders drawn elegantly back With a dainty hand grazing her lips, she laughed lightly."I'm truly flattered."



The chorus came at once. "You're too modest, Molly Far too modest."



Compliments swelled, rippling through the room like music. Yet when Molly turned, fixing her gaze on the canvas, the sound faltered into a brief hush.


The women's smiles froze in place, but their eyes betrayed the truth-a flicker of shared understanding.Crooked lines, clashing colors, chaos disguised as art.Still, what did it matter? Keeping Molly pleased meant keeping Sherwood's influence close, and business always trumped honesty.


From the shadows at the edge of the hall, Verena observed. A tray balanced on her hands, her work  badge catching the light, she studied the scene through narrowed eyes.



The exaggerated gasps, the syrupy laughter-it was theater, nothing more. A faint smirk tugged at her lips beneath the mask.



The intermission music swelled.



Guests drifted toward the buffet, gowns shimmering like liquid jewels, champagne flutes winking under the chandeliers' fractured glow.



Molly brushed the pearl tassels at her temple, and then turned, her white heels clicking as she glided toward the lounge.



Verena adjusted her grip on the tray, slipping through the tide of servers. She hugged the wall, following at a measured pace.



The carved doors closed behind Molly with a heavy sigh, shutting out the din of the hall.


Inside, she sank onto the sofa and flicked open her compact, tilting the mirror toward her painted lips.Then a knock came sharp and sudden.



"Miss Kirk, would you like a glass of specially prepared lime soda?" Verena's voice, deliberately softened,came through the door. "No Leave it. Molly murmared dabbing at her lipstick her eyes never leaving the reflection



The latch clicked. The door swung open A huzr followed as it closed again.



Verena entered without ceremony, the tray steady in her hands. She set the glass down, porcelain against marble in a crisp chime.



"I told you, don't you understand-" Molly spun, only to falter mid-sentence.



Verena was already seated on the sofa opposite, mask discarded,her delicate features revealed beneath the low light.



Molly blinked, confusion flaring. "What are you doing here? And in those clothes?"



Verena looked up with a calm that felt more like command than courtesy. A playful glint lingered in her gaze. "Do you have a moment? We need to talk."



Molly's laugh was short and sharp, breaking through clenched teeth.



She smoothed the skirt over her knees, coral nails dragging slowly across the fabric. "Talk? Is this your idea of asking for a favor? Verena, when you shattered the team I personally built in front of all the senior executives,you weren't half so polite "



She stretched out the word "personally", letting it roll off her tongue like poison, before pinning Verena with a blazing glare. "And now you come to me-just to talk?"



Verena idly twirled a lock of hair before tucking her curls behind one ear, the casual motion drawing attention to the sharp line of her jaw. Her voice was smooth, almost indifferent. "Miss Kirk, you misunderstand. Every choice I mnade at the company was deliberate-and I don't regret a single one."



Her tone was as mild as small talk, but the ice underneath was unmistakable. "Parasites don't last forever. Clearing them out was only a mnatter of time."


The words struck like flint. Molly snapped her compact shut, tossing it aside as she leapt to her feet,finger stabbing the air at Verena. "Then why are you here-just to gloat?"



Verena rose at her own pace, smoothing her uniform as if the confrontation were no more than an inconvenience. She crossed the room with measured steps, stopping just within reach of the lamp's warm glow.



Her eyes, lit clear and bright beneath the yellow light,fixed on Molly. Her voice softened into sincerity."I want to talk about Luis."



The name struck like ice water thrown over flame.Molly froze, her anger slipping away mid-breath. The arch in her brows faltered, knitting together as confusion clouded her gaze. "Luis?" The word broke from her lips uncertain, fragile.



Her voice, so sharp moments ago, dipped into something almost tentative, almost breaking.



"But..." Her hand drifted to her skirt, fingers tracing the pleats as memories flooded in-that number she dialed until her fingertips ached, messages that vanished into silence as if the phone itself had swallowed them, like a bottomless sea...



She lowered her gaze, voice heavy with the weight of that absence. "Luis doesn't want to talk to me anymore. He must be furious."



Verena studied the bowed figure before her,something indefinable stirring in her chest-an emotion she couldn't quite name.



Collecting herself, she spoke with calm precision."Let's continue this somewhere else."


Molly lifted her head. The fight had gone from her eyes, replaced by a helplessness flickering in their depths. "I wish I could. But my father ordered me not to step foot anywhere except the art museum. He's got bodyguards posted outside. There's no way out"



Her glance slid toward the door, a sigh caught on her lips. "They've been loyal to him for more than a decade. Forcing our way past them would be impossible."



At that, Verena turned, tugging open the storage cabinet tucked against the lounge wall. A folded gray uniform tumbled out, creased with lines from long neglect.



She shook it loose and offered it to Molly, and then drew a plain mask from her pocket and set it neatly on the low table. "Which is why you're going to change into this."



Ten minutes later, the carved wooden door of the lounge eased slightly open.



Two figures emerged-Verena and Molly, nearly unrecognizable in identical gray work uniforms, masks shadowing most of their faces.



Verena angled her badge just enough to look careless,her stride brisk and practiced, the picture of someone hauling supplies under pressure. Her eyes,however,flicked sharp and watchful over the crowd.



Together they melted into the line of servers ferrying trays of drinks, swallowed by the flow of bodies moving through the hall.
###Chapter 386 It's All My Father's Scheme
The hum of conversations and the merry clink of wine glasses formed a convenient curtain, shielding what unfolded behind the scenes.



Verena and Molly quietly slipped away from curious eyes and took the elevator down to the underground parking lot.



At the entrance stood a black vehicle, waiting like a silent accomplice. Verena pulled open the door,ushered Molly into the back seat first, and then followed her inside.



The moment the door clicked shut, the vehicle rolled forward,gliding out of the lot and into the night.


Inside,Molly seemed oblivious to the growing distance from the art museum; her mind circled only one name -Luis.



Picking up where their lounge conversation had broken off, she leaned forward, words tumbling out in a rush. "You said you'd tell me about Luis. How is he these days? Why won't he answer my calls or messages? Has work worn him out until he's fallen sick?Or Her questions dried up all at once. Her throat tightened, and tears shimmered in her eyes. "Or... is it because I did something wrong?"


Verena hesitated, weighing her words, before speaking softly. "No, he isn't angry with you, and he isn't ilL."



She allowed a deliberate pause, and then added, "He's simply been burdened with troubles, the kind that weigh heavily on a man's spirit."



Molly's brows furrowed as she pressed on, saying,"What troubles? Tell me-I might be able to help."


Lowering her gaze to her interlocked fingers, Verena let out a sigh. "One of Luis' subordinates has blundered badly. Now a lawsuit looms over him,and prison may not be far behind."



Her voice quivered slightly, her eyes shadowed with worry. "That's why Luis hasn't been eating or sleeping properly. He's lost so much weight. I may be his sister,but I don't know him as deeply as you do-you grew up at his side."



She raised her eyes and fixed them on Molly. "That's why I came to you. When Luis suffers, how should ease his pain? I can't bear to see him like this."


After speaking, Verena kept her gaze steady, quietly studying Molly's shifting expression. Molly, who had been consumed by worry, froze.Instinctively, she drew back, pressing against the car door.



"What did you just say?"



Her voice rasped like a frayed thread, her coral-painted nails digging crescents into the leather seat.Her eyes flickered uneasily-first to the blur of greenery rushing past the window, then to Verena's steady gaze, and finally down to her own knees.



In an instant, memories stormed back-fragments of a phone call she had overheard in Sherwood's study only days before. Suddenly, she understood: her father's carefully laid plans were unfolding far faster than she had imagined.



Her heart thundered in her chest, each beat striking with dread. Luis' tender smile overlapped in her mnind with her father's stern, unyielding face. Could her father truly be so merciless?



A silent scream tore through her heart as her nails bit into her palms. Their families had once been as close as kin-how could her father trample all sentiment and strike Luis so cruelly?



Scenes of her past with Luis spun before her eyes:him shielding her from childhood bullies, patiently teaching her business affairs as they matured. Those precious  moments now felt overshadowed by her father's ruthless designs.



The more she thought, the tighter her chest became,as though she were sinking beneath waves of regret and fear. She couldn't-she wouldn't-let disaster fall upon Luis.


Clenching her fists until her palms stung, she forced out a hoarse whisper. "It's my dad."


The low hum of the air conditioner did little to hide the uneven rhythm of her breathing.



Verena blinked, momentarily startled, and then lowered her eyes to conceal her reaction. She hadn't expected Molly to confess so quickly.


Gathering herself, Verena lifted her head again, just enough astonishment in her tone. "What do you mean?"



Molly's hands twisted in her lap, crumpling the fabric of her trousers.



Her throat felt dry as sand; she swallowed hard before blurting through clenched teeth, "It's all my father's scheme. He's plotting against the Sampsons-against Luis!"



Tears broke loose midway, spattering onto her knees and leaving dark circles. "He wants to pin smuggling charges on Luis. That's all I know-l overheard by chance. My father never told me the details, nor would he allow me to ask."



Looking at Molly's ashen face, Verena felt a sudden tightness in her chest.



Molly's eyes, rimmed with red, brimmed with guilt and torment for Luis' sake.



Seeing this, Verena's heart pricked with both guilt and sorrow. She had used Molly's feelings to reach this truth, yet she couldn't deny being moved. Sherwood's sins were his own; Molly was innocent.



Verena's sigh was soft, her voice gentler without her realizing it. "Molly, thank you-for still thinking of Luis in such a moment."



Molly wiped her tears with trembling fingers,choking out, "I'd do anything for him. I just don't want him hurt.I only want him safe."



Suddenly, as if struck by a desperate thought,Molly seized Verena's wrist. Lifting her tear-streaked face,she pleaded, eyes glistening, "Now that I've told you the truth-though my father has sinned-if it isn't too late,could you forgive him this once?"



Her sobbing words trembled like a drowning soul clutching at driftwood. "He's blinded by greed, but if he stops now, things can still be mended... Luis wouldn't want me turned out into the cold, would he?" Fresh tears coursed down her cheeks.



At that, Verena's first impulse was to lay bare every wound Sherwood had inflicted upon the Sampsons.Yet when her eyes met Molly's tear-streaked face and trembling lips, the words lodged in her throat.


She turned her gaze aside, swallowing back the sharp retort that rose within her.



At length, she spoke slowly, choosing her words with care. "I'll pass your message to Luis."


Molly, blind to the storm behind Verena's eyes,heard only a promise. Her taut shoulders slackened as she brushed away her tears, smearing streaks across her cheeks, and summoned a fragile smile. "Thank you."



Verena studied her tear-dampened face and returned a faint,reluctant smile.


The car settled into silence, broken only by the steady sound of their breathing.
###Chapter 387 Proof



VeE ,Mally'e vnica broko through the silence like 目 wltsaRd confessian， instantly transforming the Eār's ātlogphēre,


Verera's attention shifted at the sound, finding Molly with her ehin tueked low, fingers anxiously working the fabFie of her shirt inte tiny wrinkles.


Rather than Bressing fer details, Verena simply waited with patient understanding for Mally to find her words.


Several heartbeats passed before Molly finally raised her eyes. "Do y8H honestly think I'm not worthy of Luis?"


"That thought has never crossed my mind," Verena's response came without hesitatien:


Her steady gaze locked with Mally's troubled eyes,radiating both warmth and unwavering conviction."More importantly, when love enters the pieture,worthiness becomes completely irrelevant. Elther the feelings exist or they don't. All the rest ls just noise."


The unexpected wisdom hit Molly like a physieal blow.fresh moisture gathering in her eyes as Verena's brutal honesty cut straight to her heart: Her lips parted, throat constricting with bitter recognition, words scraping out like broken glass. "So Luis doesn't feeL anything for me, does he?"


Verena's mouth formed a tight line, choosing silence over cruel confirmation.



Molly recognized that sometimes the absence of words spoke volumes. Deep down,she'd been seeking validation for something she already understood perfectly, though her heart remained stubbornly resistant to accepting the truth.



"What about Miranda then?" Molly's voice emerged raw and damaged, like vocal cords dragged across concrete.


Confusion flickered across Verena's features,eyebrows drawing together slightly.


Before any response could form, Molly collapsed backward into her seat, staring at the car's ceiling with hollow,defeated eyes.



"Does Luis have romantic feelings for Miranda?" The question tumbled out in barely a whisper, tear-dampened lashes casting shadows on her cheeks.


Even as she spoke, vivid memories flooded back of witnessing Luis and Miranda emerge from that hotel together, their shared smiles radiating obvious intimacy.Excruciating pain sliced through her ribcage,throat closing around a knot of anguish that made every inhale feel like swallowing razor blades.


Verena's gaze dropped to Molly'swhite-knuckled fists,still bearing angry red crescents where her nails had bitten deep.


A heavy sigh built in Verena's chest, though she managed to suppress it.


Following a prolonged pause, she finally spoke. "I honestly have no idea about that situation. I can't offer you any certainties.However,after knowing him for all these years, you must understand his character better than anyone-"



Her words faded into nothing as Molly's head turned toward her.



The instant their eyes connected, Verena witnessed the devastating heartbreak swimming in Molly's gaze.



"Luis has never been the type to lead anyone on.When someone manages to get close to him..."Verena's tone grew quieter, though every syllable still reached Molly with crystal clarity. "There's always something genuínely special about them."



Despite Verena's careful attempt to soften the blow,her diplomatic phrasing couldn't mask the brutal truth. The message hit its target regardless, and Molly understood perfectly. Her teeth sank into her bottom lip as crushing weight settled across her chest.


"Tell me about Miranda. What kind of woman is she?"The question emerged with Molly's eyes fixed on Verena,burning with a volatile mixture of raw jealousy and reluctant fascination.


Yes, Miranda stirred intense envy within her,while simultaneously commanding her grudging respect


Harsh overhead lighting carved deep shadows beneath Molly's eyes, her tear-streaked makeup telling the story of her exhaustion and heartbreak.


Curiosity battled against her desperate denial,the same torturous question that had haunted her through countless sleepless nights. Years of silent devotion had been poured into loving Luis, endless attempts to breach the walls around his heart, yet he'd remained completely unmoved by her efforts. Meanwhile,Miranda had somehow slipped past every defense and claimed residence in his heart within a short time.Where exactly did she fall short compared to Miranda?



Verena's expression remained perfectly composed as she brushed an errant strand of hair behind her ear.



Molly's stubborn refusal to accept reality couldn't have been more obvious, drawing another gentle sigh from Verena's lips.



Keeping Molly distracted was essential to buy lsaac the time he needed.



With that goal in mind, Verena settled into her narrative. "My first encounter with Miranda happened back at school..."




.·.


Earlier,while Molly disappeared into the dressing room to change into the work uniform, Verena had already fired off a quick text to Isaac, confirming her success in keeping Molly completely occupied.


The moment Isaac's phone buzzed with the message,he sank deeper into the plush leather seat of his black car, elegant fingers dancing across the screen.


Once the call connected, his voice carried arctic authority. "Move forward with the plan."


At that very moment, inside an upscale restaurant in Ochrerayd, Sherwood was playing the gracious host to his dinner companions.


Halfway through the evening's festivities,alcohol had left him pleasantly buzzed without crossing into complete intoxication.


Rising from his seat, he excused himself and navigated away from their private dining room.


The overhead fixtures seemed to sway and blur through Sherwood's alcohol-hazed vision. His fingers worked to loosen his constricting tie as he stumbled toward the men's room.



His footsteps created muffled impressions against the thick carpeting until something abruptly shattered the rhythm.



Sherwood's spine crashed against the frigid metal framework of an emergency exit, never catching even a glimpse of his attacker's identity.


A cloth reeking of harsh chemicals clamped over his mouth and nose with violent efficiency.



The metallic click of the emergency door's lock engaging echoed through the narrow space.



Sherwood's body responded with desperate thrashing,but iron-strong fingers seized his suit jacket, his skull connecting brutally with the fire door as brilliant explosions of light burst behind his eyelids.


For one precious moment, his airways cleared,allowing him to bellow his fury. "Release me this instant! Do you have any idea who you're dealing with..."


"Your precious daughter is currently in my possession."
The stranger's tobacco-roughened voice sliced through Sherwood's threats with chilling efficiency."Thirty million in cold cash. The abandoned steel mill near Horizon Bridge. Two hours from now. If you dare call the police-"



The stranger let silence stretch deliberately before delivering his vicious threat. "That pretty girl won't be returning home in one piece."


Sherwood's throat worked twice as he swallowed hard,fighting to regain his composure.



"Do you know who I am?" His voice carried the commanding presence forged through decades of corporate warfare, though a slight tremor betrayed his growing fear.


Sherwood's mind raced beneath his controlled exterior. This wasn't some random street crime. The attacker knew exactly who he was and had deliberately targeted his most vulnerable point. Was this an orchestrated plan or an opportunistic grab?


Thoughts churned violently through his head, but he kept his expression neutral, studying the shadowy figure for any weakness or hesitation.


In the emergency corridor's weak lighting, the man's crouched form threw distorted shadows across the walls.



Through the dim glow, Sherwood could see his captor  wore tattered clothes, looking like any homeless drifter from the city streets.


The man released a mocking laugh. "Mr. Kirk, if I didn't know who you were, why would I risk demanding thirty million upfront? Everyone in business circles knows about your ruthless reputation. But if you want your daughter alive, you'll do exactly what I say. Otherwise,she gets cut up and dumped in the river."



Pain hammered through Sherwood's temples as he dug his nails deep into his palms, using the sharp sensation to control his shaking body. The alcohol had completely burned off.



He pushed down the terror clawing up his throat and let out a contemptuous sound. "You're lying."



Sherwood needed to confirm whether this was actually real.


The moment those words left his mouth,the man's sneer deepened as he pulled out a phone and dialed a number.



When the call connected, Sherwood heard Molly's panicked voice crying out, "Dad, save me!"


The man spoke calmly into the phone. "Mr. Kirk doesn't quite believe us yet. Give him better proof."


Then came the horrifying sounds from the other end: the wet slice of a blade cutting flesh and the sharp snap of breaking bone.


Molly's scream hit Sherwood like a dagger straight through his chest.


The man pressed the phone against Sherwood's ear,grinning as he spoke. "Hear that clearly? Mr. Kirk, if you're still doubting me, her wrist is next."

###Chapter 388 Now Fortune Has Shifted
Sherwood pressed against the frigid fire door, brutal metal edges carving into his spine. His legs had turned to water, as though someone had extracted every bone from his body.



His throat worked painfully before words emerged in a trembling whisper. "I'll accept your conditions, but thirty million isn't pocket change. You need to alow me additional time."



The attacker's mouth twisted into a malevolent grin."You're a wealthy man, Mr. Kirk. If you genuinely care about your daughter's survival, quit trying to negotiate.Two hours maximum,not one second longer.Attempt any deception and-"



He let silence stretch deliberately before Molly's muffled weeping crackled through the phone speaker."We have plenty more creative ideas for entertaining her,"



Ice flooded Sherwood's veins. His voice emerged as a harsh rasp through clenched teeth. "I'll meet your demands, but you must cease hurting my daughter this instant!" The stranger's fingers suddenly clamped around Sherwood's throat,his voice dropping to a threatening murmur. "Stay calm. Deliver the cash to that steel mill punctually, and your precious daughter remains unharmed."



Those fingers tightened without warning,cutting off his airway completely. Sherwood produced strangled,choking sounds as his tie twisted awkwardly and dark bruises bloomed across his throat.



Just as unconsciousness began creeping over him, the grip vanished and oxygen rushed back into his lungs.


Sherwood crumpled onto the floor, curling into a protective ball in the corner while violent coughing seized his body.


His hands shook uncontrollably as they clutched his ravaged throat, searing agony shooting between his trembling fingers.


In the weak emergency lighting, the attacker's footsiteps receded into silence, his shadow disappearing around the stairwell's bend.


Once his bruital coughing fit subsided, Sherwood's quaking hand fumbled inside his jacket for his phone.


The device's cold ilumination cast ghostly shadows across his ashen features. His fingers slipped  repeatedly before managing to unlock the screen, and he pressed the call button with desperate force.



Then the relentless busy signal made Sherwood's chest tighten with dread.


After what felt like an eternity, a robotic female voice delivered the crushing news through the receiver."Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unreachable..."


Sherwood's eyes remained fixed on the "Call Failed"notification glowing on his screen, his thumb frantically stabbing the redial button. "It won't connect, it just won't..."


Perspiration burned his eyes, leaving them bloodshot and stinging. Panic overwhelmed his system, causing his phone to slip from his nerveless fingers and crash against the floor with a hollow clang.



He scrambled to retrieve it, pressing his forehead desperately against the cold surface."Molly,please be safe," he whispered through gritted teeth.



Meanwhile,Molly remained comfortably seated in the luxury vehicle Verena had arranged, listening with rapt attention as Verena shared stories of Miranda's impressive accomplishments.



Hidden beneath the leather upholstery, a compact signal jammer pulsed with eerie blue light, effectively  creating a dead zone where no communications could penetrate.


Molly's phone rested silently in her purse, its screen never illuminating since entering the car.



Naturally, no calls or messages could possibly reach her.



Across the city, Isaac waited patiently in his own car,anticipating updates. When his phone buzzed, his fingers glided across the screen to accept the call.



A deliberately disguised voice filtered through the speaker. "Mr. Bennett, we've successfully handled Sherwood. After hearing those fabricated recordings of Molly's distress, he completely fell apart. He's currently scrambling to gather the ransom and will arrive at the steel mill in twohours as scheduled."



Following a brief pause, the operative continued."Mr.Bennett, should we position surveillance teams to monitor his movements and prevent any potential tricks?"



Isaac's fingers drummed a steady rhythm against the window frame as cold laughter escaped his lips."Unnecessary. We've struck him where it matters most. He wouldn't dare attempt anything foolish."


Isaac's assessment proved absolutely correct. Upon discovering Molly's phone remained unreachable,  Sherwood immediately contacted his longtime butler with frantic urgency. "Aiken, I don't care what it takes,but I need thirty million in cash assembled within two hours."



Before Aiken could even begin processing this enormous request, Sherwood had already terminated the call.


Next, Sherwood's trembling fingers dialed his bank manager's direct line. "I need access to every available dollar in my accounts."


The manager's cautious voice emerged from the speaker,attempting to outline potential complications,but Sherwood's patience had evaporated entirely."Spare me the lectures! Do it now, immediately! Or I'll guarantee your quarterly numbers hit absolute zero."


After slamming down that call, he continued his desperate campaign, reaching out to various business associates with the same urgent plea. "I need to secure a substantial loan..."



Inside the CEO's office of Sampson Group, Luis glanced up as approaching footsteps echoed outside his door.



Spotting Isaac's arrival, he moved forward to offer a premium cigar while inquiring, "What's our current status?" Isaac kept his hands casually tucked in his pockets,shaking his head to decline the offer as a knowing smile curved his lips. "Everything's unfolding exactly as we anticipated."



Luis rolled the cigar between his fingers, his rich laughter carrying a distinctly merciless undertone."Perfect. I'll have Sheppard arrange that meeting with Daren right away."


Upon receiving these precise instructions, Sheppard Hewitt immediately launched into action.



Within the luxurious penthouse suite of an exclusive Ochrerayd nightclub, the atmosphere was saturated with the rich aromas of whiskey and expensive ambergris.



Daren sprawled across the plush leather seating in complete relaxation.



His diamond-encrusted timepiece caught the ambient light, throwing brilliant reflections as he tiltedhis head back and emptied his whiskey glass in one smooth motion.



The ornate crystal chandelier bathed Daren in warm,golden illumination,highlighting how his serpent-print shirt strained against his considerable bulk.


When Sheppard entered the private suite, he found  Daren methodically cleaning his teeth with a wooden pick,his fleshy cheeks compressed into two gleaming,oily creases.


"Look what we have here, Luis' faithful attack dog," he sneered while adjusting his crossed legs. "What's this?You made my existence miserable years ago, and now you come crawling back seeking reconciliation?"



Four imposing bodyguards flanked Daren's position,their dark sunglasses reflecting the warm lighting while telltale bulges beneath their jackets suggested concealed armaments.



Sheppard's throat worked visibly as he settled into the chair opposite Daren.


Amber whiskey gleamed on the polished marble surface where a server had placed it, until Sheppard's palm covered the glass completely,his steel cufflink producing a sharp ring against the crystal rim that lingered in the thick air.


Removing his sunglasses revealed Sheppard's weathered features, marked by numerous battle scars.



Despite Daren's obvious baiting, Sheppard responded with a sardonic grin, "Mr. Robles, you appear remarkably tense, still dwelling on incidents from three years past."



References to their history only intensified Daren's  fury. His massive fist crashed down onto the table with thunderous force, sending crystal stemware and porcelain dishes into a cacophonous symphony while liquor erupted over every rim.



The excess flesh around his throat quivered from the violent motion, and pure hatred blazed in his beady eyes as he bellowed, "How could I possibly forget?I showed you nothing but respect, practically begging for a business partnership. What was your response?You shredded my contract into confetti right in front of my associates, declaring, 'Scum like Daren doesn't deserve to conduct business with Mr. Sampson!'"



Daren's breathing grew ragged, purple veins throbbing visibly across his flushed features. "Do you have any idea how much face I lost within our professional circles? Who exactly do you think you are? Nothing more than Luis' obedient servant!"



Completely unruffled, Sheppard methodically straightened his sleeve cuffs with deliberate precision."Mr.Robles,your recall is impressive, though you seem to have mixed up certain specifics. What I actually said was, 'A piece of trash like Daren, who lacks even elementary business sense, has the audacity to fantasize about collaborating with Mr. Sampson.'"


He shifted forward slightly, meeting Daren's crimson face directly. "Tell me something. Three years has passed, and you still can't comprehend basic social  interaction?"



Daren's rage reached its breaking point as he shot upright, sending his chair crashing backward.



His security detail stepped forward instinctively,but one piercing look from Sheppard froze them completely in place.



Daren thrust a quivering finger mere inches from Sheppard's nose,his voice cracking with unbridled fury."Sheppard Hewitt, you've got some nerve! Today we're going to settle every single grievance between us!"



His massive torso rose and fell with each labored breath. "But I'm dying to discover how long you can maintain this cocky attitude without Luis here to protect you!"


Sheppard brushed nonexistent lint from his jacket, his keen eyes noting the weapon grips barely concealed beneath the bodyguards' clothing. "Mr. Robles, such volatile temperament explains why your enterprises have remained questíonable all these years."



The moment Sheppard finished speaking, all four bodyguards reached for their concealed weapons in perfect synchronization.


Daren raised his hand to halt their advance,his heavy eyelids narrowing with predatory calculation. Understanding the silent command, his men retreated back into the surrounding shadows.


Daren suddenly collapsed back against the sofa cushions, erupting in theatrical laughter. "So what if my operations aren't entirely legitimate?"



He shifted sideways, purposefully closing the distance to Sheppard, the stark contrast between his gaudy serpent-print shirt and Sheppard's immaculate suit becoming painfully obvious.



"Years ago,I practically prostrated myself before Luis,presenting him with the finest cigars and premium whiskey, yet he wouldn't even acknowledge my existence." Daren paused deliberately, his thick lips twisting into a vindictive grin. "But fortune has shifted,and now I hold all the cards while Luis comes crawling to me on his knees."



He released a contemptuous snort, his clouded eyes sliding toward Sheppard with malicious satisfaction."The next time Luis seeks my business partnership, I'll be establishing some ground rules. Starting with teaching certain parasitic underlings who survive on scraps to grovel properly."


With that declaration, Daren seized his whiskey tumbler and emptied it completely, amber liquid streaming down his chin and soaking into his collar creases while his expression radiated pure smugness  and long-awaited revenge.



Sheppard's jaw muscles twitched slightly, though he quickly recalled his actual purpose here, forcing his composure back into place.



His fingers drummed a beat against the sofa's armrest,maintaining perfect rhythm. "Mr. Robles, I'll ensure every syllable of your enlightening wisdom reaches Mr. Sampson's ears."



Daren interpreted Sheppard's response as complete capitulation, feeling immediately vindicated as arrogant satisfaction spread across his features. "So then, what brings you here ahead of our scheduled transaction?"



He hesitated briefly, barely concealed contempt flickering through his gaze as he added casually,"Surely you didn't travel all this way just for nostalgic conversation?"



Sheppard maintained silence for several moments, his icy stare locking with Daren's before speaking.been compromised."



The instant those words registered, the fresh cigar Daren had extracted tumbled silently onto the luxurious carpet below.



His expression froze completely as he stared at Sheppard in stunned disbelief. "What exactly did you  just say?"


Sheppard retrieved a grainy photograph from his jacket's inner pocket and slid it across the table toward Daren.



The image captured several plainclothes operatives engaged in conversation beside shipping containers at a waterfront location, the telephoto lens even revealing faint weapon outlines beneath their clothing.
###Chapter 389 Bait And Switch
Daren's thick fingers clenched around the photograph,his gaze fixed so tightly on it that his cloudy eyes seemed ready to bore a hole through the paper. His voice rasped, sharp with disbelief. "When the hell was this taken?"



"Three days ago," Sheppard replied, tone flat,almost careless.



"Three days ago?" Daren spat, hurling the photo onto the table. His head snapped up, the folds of his neck straining as he glared at Sheppard. "Impossible! My people swore the docks were clean!"



Sheppard didn't flinch. He tapped a finger against the glossy print with deliberate weight. "As your goods crossed the high seas, our man inside the police sent this back. Now every trash can on Coastal Road has ears, and even the old street vender on the corner is one of the cíty's shiny new agents."



The mention of Coastal Road made Daren's throat tighten. That was supposed to be his and Sherwood's transaction ground-safe,agreed upon.



He swallowed hard, but his Adam's apple barely moved beneath the rolls of flesh.



He knew Luis' reach; planting eyes and ears where no one expected was child's play for him. It was that very sharp thoroughness that had secured Luis' standing in Ochrerayd years ago.



If Luis confirmed the docks were compromised,then the threat was real.


And yet Luis wanted his deal. Their handsome profits depended on it. Which meant the cargo had to move.



Daren stared at the photograph, fury seething just below the surface.



He tried to choke it back, but rage flooded out of him in a sudden roar.



With a violent shove, he overturned the coffee table.Crystal glasses shattered across the floor, the sound knifing through the silence.



The bodyguards lurking in the shadows stiffened, their hands twitching,breaths held.



Daren clawed at the collar of his serpent-print shirt,his face blotched red, spittle flying as his alcohol-stained breath filled the room. "Fuck! My men have been creeping like mice-changing the time, shifting the place. Even the cargo ship circled the high seas three damn times. And we still get tailed?" Sheppard only narrowed his eyes, voice calm and precise. "That's why Mr. Sampson sent me. Change the site to the abandoned steel mill by Horizon Bridge.But keep the transaction time."



Daren wheezed, sweat glistening along his temples."Why not change both? If we stick to the time,we're still laying ourselves bare!"



Sheppard toyed with the strap of his wristwatch,the metal glinting under dim light. "That's exactly the point."



Daren blinked, confusion flashing across his beady eyes. Sheppard leaned in with a ghost of a smile."At the original location, there'll be other 'transactions'-ones the police can't touch. While their eyes are fixed there,ours will pass unnoticed."



Realization dawned, and Daren slapped his thigh,his meaty hand making the sofa creak. "Ha! Brilliant!That's bloody brilliant!"



His double chin trembled as laughter burst from him."Mr. Sampson truly is a master. A perfect bait-and-switch! I've prowled these streets for over twenty years and thought I'd seen everytrick in the book, but this...this is flawless!"



But just as suddenly as it came, his laughter died. The folds of his sagging face stiffened into hard lines, his  piggish eyes narrowing with suspicion.


After a long pause, he said slowly, "Go tell Mr.Sampson I understand. The goods will move on schedule."



He let the silence stretch, and then added with weight,"But his promised final payment had better not disappoint me." ###Chapter 390 Surrounded



After parting ways with Sheppard, Daren wasted no time barking orders to his men, directing them to shift the goods to the new hiding place.



Elsewhere, Sherwood was burning through every favor and contact he had, scrambling to pull together thirty million in cash before time strangled him.


Forty minutes later, the abandoned steel mill near Horizon Bridge lay crouched under a mass of storm-heavy clouds.


The air reeked of rust and rain, a damp wind slapping against the corroded beams.



Headlights cut through the gloom as a truck rumbled in, its tires hissing over wet asphalt.



Sherwood rode in the front,stone-faced,while behind him thirty million in cash lay bundled in black waterproof cloth, the stacks piled high like a dark mountain sealed in crates.



The truck ground to a halt at the steel mill's entrance.



Almost on cue, another growl of engines reverberated through the night-Daren's convoy storming into the parking area.



His men fanned out with practiced ease,unfastening the trucks' bolts. The doors crashed open with a metallic groan, revealing the neatly layered bundles glinting beneath the weak light.


Once his truck was parked, Sherwood stepped out, his leather soles crunching over the gravel, the slam of the truck door echoing like a gunshot.


As he straightened, he caught sight of Daren across the parking area, forcing his bulky frame out of a vehicle.



Sherwood stopped cold. Impossible.


Daren should have been meeting with Luis by now in their agreed-upon destination-snared in the police trap he had prepared.



What was Daren doing here?



Daren's crocodile-leather shoes rasped over the stones, and then came the snap of a lighter. A small flame bloomed, and the end of his cigar glowed red beneath the stormy sky. He exhaled a ribbon of smoke and smirked. "Didn't expect you'd be stuck handling the final payment as well, Sherwood."


His laugh was coarse, carried on the wind along with the stench of tobacco. He narrowed his eyes, studying  the man across from him. "I figured Luis himself would've shown up for something this important after his subordinate talked to me earlier."



The words slammed into Sherwood. His pupils shrank;his chest tightened. "What did you say? Luis...contacted you?"


Daren cocked his head, watching him through a haze of smoke, doubt flickering in his eyes.



He flicked the cigar again-embers scattering against his polished shoes.


"You didn't know?" His tone carried a lazy edge of surprise. "An hour ago, Sheppard-Luis' right hand-came to me. Said the dock was crawling with police.We switched the drop to here, last minute."



He sounded almost casual, utterly unaware of the noose tightening around him.


He tipped his chin toward the sky, another cloud of smoke curling upward. "Strange," he drawled."Aren't you close with the Sampson family? Luis is guarding this deal like it's his crown jewel. Didn't he bother filling you in?"



Each syllable struck Sherwood's skull like a hammer.His ears rang with a merciless buzz, like a storm of needles tearing at his nerves. Luis had spoken to Daren!



That meant Luis knew everything-and had spun a countermeasure behind his back.



The snare Sherwood had laid so carefully had become his own cage.


His mind jolted back to two hours earlier, to the stranger dragging him to the emergency exit and claiming they had kidnapped his daughter. His hands shook violently at the memory.



He scanned the area, his eyes wild. Not a single figure lurked in the shadows-only Daren's smoke-wreathed silhouette standing before him.



No sign of his kidnapped daughter. No sign of the so -called kidnaappers.


A cold ripple climbed his spine. His throat worked convulsively, Adam's apple jerking as he edged backward,gravel crunching beneath his shoes.


Above, a sudden commotion split the silence. A flock of crows burst from the rafters of the steel mill, wings beating furiously, shredding the stagnant air with a storm of sound.



The storm that had drenched the world minutes ago had already passed, yet the sky remained heavy, choked in darkness-now further blotted out by the circling wings above.



The birds wheeled overhead, their flight a grim choreography,as though calling death to witness.



Their coarse caws cut the silence, shrill and unearthly,like screams torn from hell's throat.



Their guttural cries scraped across the parking area,eerie and shrill, like the howls of spirits clawing out of hell. Black bodies swooped low, talons and beaks slashing the air so close Sherwood swore he felt them graze his shoulders.



Stray feathers drifted down like ashes, brushing against the cold sweat at the nape of his neck. Each touch jolted another chill through his body.


Meanwhile,Daren exhaled a slow stream of smoke,the curling tendrils twisting into grotesque shapes under the shadow of circling wings-mocking, sinister,alive.



Sherwood stood rooted in place, his throat working three desperate times before he finally rasped out a breath between clenched teeth.



And in that moment,understanding hit.



Luis-damnable Luis-had laid this snare to drag both Daren and him straight into hell. For ten seconds, silence held the place. The wind rose suddenly, lashing sand against Sherwood's slack face.



Then Daren's puzzled voice broke the spell.Sherwood's eyes bulged,breath tearing from his lungs.Veins corded his neck as he shouted, "Leave! It's a trap!"


He spun on his heel,lunging for his truck.


His fingers had just brushed the handle when a shrill whistle cut through the night. From the darkness,the police surged like predators.


Their riot shields locked into formation with brutal precision, an armored wall snapping into place.In an instant, Sherwood and Daren were swallowed whole.



Red and blue lights strobed wildly across their faces,throwing monstrous shadows across the rusted trucks.Spotlights blazed down, so harsh that Daren instinctively flung up a hand to shield his eyes.


His bodyguards barely twitched for their weapons before being tackled and crushed to the gravel. Their knees struck hard, thuds muffled beneath the chaos.


Metal clicked and snapped as cuffs bit into their wrists.



Above, at high secret vantage points, snipers waited,scopes glinting on their targets. Police dogs scrambled up the trucks around them,their feral barking shattering the night.


Daren's pupils tightened to pinpoints. Everywhere he looked, rifles stared back. The cigar slipped from his fingers, scattering sparks across the dirt until they died like fallen stars.



His shadow flickered and writhed against the rusted hull of a truck, grotesque in the flashing lights.


"Sherwood Kirk!" he roared, voice hoarse with rage.His hand clamped onto Sherwood's collar, dragging him close. "You bastard-you led them here, didn't you?"


He still couldn't see the truth of it. In his fury, he thought Sherwood had exposed himself and been tailed by the police, never suspecting Luis' hand in the snare.



But before his fury could burn further, two officers lunged from the side. Riot shields rammed into his ribs,sending him sprawling.



His knees slammed the concrete with a crack. Through the haze of pain, he glimpsed Sherwood thrashing against another group of officers,already subdued.



"Stay down!"The amplified voice of a commander thundered through the chaos. Floodlights glared, a dozen gun barrels gleamed, and the loudspeaker boomed again as a commanding officer strode forward with a blinding flashlight. "Daren Robles! Sherwood Kirk! You are surrounded! Any resistance is useless. Hands on your heads-now! Continuing to defy us will only worsen your fate!"

###Chapter 391 Painstaking Effort
Daren was slammed to the ground, officers pinning his arms as his knees grated against the gravel. Pain shot up his legs, yet he thrashed wildly, veins bulging along his neck like knotted ropes, refusing to surrender.



His bloodshot eyes blazed with fury as he bellowed at the man restrainedbeside him. "Sherwood! What the hell is going on? Who leaked the information?"



The roar shredded his throat, spraying spit onto the dirt.



Sherwood's chest heaved; his face burned crimson with rage.



His teeth ground together, tendons standing out against the corded line of his neck. Then, in a voice that cracked with fury, he shot back, "It was Luis!We've walked right into his trap!"


The words struck Daren like a hammer. His eyes bulged,blood flooding them red.


"A trap? This is a trap..." His lips twitched, his expression warped by disbelief and rage .Then, as if something inside him snapped, he threw back his head and let out a jagged laugh-wild,despairing, bitter enough to shake the night air.


"Well played, Luis Sampson! So ruthless! You never wanted to negotiate business. You just wanted the police to cage me in one strike!" His voice cracked into a feral scream, spitting curses into the sky. "Luis Sampson! You'll never rest easy. Even as a ghost,I'll come for you!"


"The number of people who want me dead is endless,Mr. Robles. You're nothing special."


A reply slid through the wind, low and mocking.


Daren and Sherwood whipped their heads toward the voice. Two silhouettes emerged, striding side by side,their shadows stretching long beneath the searchlights.


Luis,who habitually wore glasses at night, had frames that glinted coldly in the light, and the silver-threaded patterns on his tailored black suit caught the light,flashing like knife edges. Gravel crunched beneath his shoes, every step deliberate, echoing.


Beside him walked Isaac, hands sunk in his pockets,mouth set in a hard line. His gaze was glacial,depthless-a frozen lake that reflected nothing. He didn't even blink at Daren's roaring. The wind stirred  the hair on his forehead, unveiling sharp brows and eyes that gleamed like unsheathed blades.


Daren slammed his knee into the earth, ignoring the pain, forcing himself upright against the officers' hold.His voice tore from his chest. "Luis! How dare you deceive me-"



Luis cut him down with a chilling laugh. "Daren, you parade as a businessman who lives dangerously, yet you can't tell predator from prey."


The strobing police lights caught his lenses, casting twin sparks across his eyes. "Did you really think you were striking a deal with me? Ha! Pathetic. From the moment you set foot in this city,your fate was sealed.You were always going to end up in chains."



The blood drained from Daren's face. His veins, once swelling with fury, dulled to a sickly violet. He sagged,body collapsing inward as though his bones had melted,leaving him hollow.


For a moment, the silence swallowed him. Then his lips moved, dry and mechanical. "Impossible... this can't be..."



Like a cornered beast, he erupted again, straining and thrashing violently until the cuffs cut into raw flesh,streaking his shirt with blood. His cries grew savage,broken. "I'll kill you, Luis! I'll rip every last one of you apart-""Ha-ha!"



Daren's rage was drowned out by a sudden shriek of laughter.Sherwood,still pinned to the ground,erupted into a sound so sharp it scraped the night air like nails on steel. Even startled crows burst from the trees above them and, wheeled into the sky.



Luis turned his head and fixed Sherwood with a cold,unblinking stare behind his glasses. The light caught the rims and made his eyes look harder than they were.


"Cough... cough-" Sherwood laughed until a fit of coughs ripped him in half, bending forward as if the sound could choke him. When he lifted his bloodshot eyes again, the smile on his lips had unraveled into something that might have been madness.


"What a serpent in the grass... now I know what it means." His voice was a gravelly thing,flecked with phlegm and old fury. "Well played-using others to do your dirty work. No wonder you grew up under my wing...you learned fast!"



Luis lowered his lashes and took in Sherwood's warped expression.



"Yes," he said, but that single word dripped with biting mockery. "I learned a lot. How so-called loyalty  dissolves in the face of profit. How to dress cruelty in velvet and shove an enemy off a cliff. Those were your lessons-your 'teaching by example.'"



He bent a little closer, voice dropping. "But, the student sometimes outgrows the teacher. And when that happens, the teacher becomes a problem and must be eliminated."



Sherwood's composure cracked; for a heartbeat,panic flickered across his face, betrayed by the nervous bob of his Adam's apple.



He was grasping for an angle, so he tried to play hurt -the practiced victim.



"Luis, I never imagined you'd turn like this! I did so many things for you-showing you the ropes, helping you fight rivals. Have you forgotten my painstaking effort all these years? Without me, you wouldn't be where you are today, and Sampson Group would've been ruined long ago!" His desperate accusations ricocheted off the empty machinery, thick with years of buried grievance. "And now you repay me with betrayal, driving me to the edge?"


Luis stayed bent, the corner of his mouth tilted into a smile that didn't reach his eyes.



"'Painstaking effort'?" he repeated,each syllable a cold rasp between his teeth. His voice cut across  Sherwood's protest like a file. "Sherwood, you cast yourself as savior so often you must believe it yourself. Say a lie enough times and even you start to swallow it."



Sherwood opened his mouth; words rose and died.Luis' stare shut him down.



"You want to remember the past? You bribed the traffickers to carry my newborn sister away to the mountains. When that initial plan went awry,you colluded with a doctor so my sister ended up in someone else's arms. My parents couldn't bear the pain of losing their daughter. My mother cracked;my father's hair went white overnight. Sampson Group nearly collapsed. While my family fell apart, you wormed your way in, earned my parents' trust, and dressed your self-interest as 'support.' You just used me. All these years, you skimmed from the company,made shadowed deals-did you think you could hide that from me forever?"



The police lights washed over Luis' profile, carving his jaw into stone.



He straightened, looming over Sherwood. "For each of those betrayals, I could've punished you with more ruthless methods. Instead, I showed mercy. You should be grateful."



Luis' dismissal sent shame and rage warring in Sherwood's face by then. For a long, brittle beat he said nothing. Then, with a thin, bitter laugh that hardly sounded like a laugh, he spat the confession as if flinging a final, ugly truth. "If I'd known then what know now-l'd have killed you, you ungrateful bastard -years ago!"
###Chapter 392 Regret



Sherwood had been restrained, but the cuffs around his wrists did little to hide the animal beneath.His hands were balled into fists behind his back, veins standing out on knuckles like cords, and his face was a savage mask of rage-ready to rip, to tear. "I should have made that wretched Verena die the day she came back! She ruined everything. If not for her,the Sampson asset would already be mine!"



Luis felt heat spike through him at the insult toward his sister. He opened his mouth to strike back, but Isaac moved first-a dark blur cutting the space between them.



Isaac had been quiet until that moment; now his eyes burned cold, narrowed to a hardness that promised harm.



He stepped forward and the toe of his polished shoe hammered down onto Sherwood's chest.



The impact landed with a dull thud and the sharp hiss of fabric ripping. The two officers holding Sherwood staggered from the force, cuffs screeching against the ground.



Sherwood went airborne like a ragdoll, his back slamming into a rusted container; flakes of orange metal floated down around him.



He curled inward, seized by convulsions, each breath a ragged wheeze-as if death itself were peering in.



A couple of officers exchanged uncertain looks.



The commanding officer's hand tightened on his holster, but he didn't draw.



"Mr. Bennett-this is against protocol..." a young constable began, voice thin with the urge to do the right thing. But the commanding officer clamped a firm hand on his arm and leaned in close with a shake of his head.



"Don't be an idiot. This man's connections will drown this precinct in lawsuits by tomorrow. He hasn't crossed a line we can't paper over-just watch and keep your head down."



Who,in that charged instant,wanted the fallout?



Nobody.Everyone knew Bennett Group's roots were everywhere-political, financial, the kind that made a precinct think twice before acting. A rash move today could mean a storm of legal thunder by morning.



Isaac advanced on Sherwood, his jaw locked in a hard line,menace carved into every angle of his face. "You dare speak of Verena like that?" He reached down and hauled Sherwood upright by the collar until the man had no choice but to look him in the face. "If she hadn't insisted on letting the law do its work, do you think you'd still be breathing? Letting you live was mercy you don't deserve. Insult her again and I'll give you the lesson you seem to need-right here." Isaac ground out the words through teeth.



Sherwood's sweat-matted hair clung to his forehead;his eyes rolled white at the rims, fever-bright.


For a second he stared at Isaac's stern face, then at Luis, muscles twitching beneath his skin. Then he began to laugh-thin, high, and cracking at the edges."Isaac, you think I don't see through you? Luis, don't be fooled by appearances. Isaac didn't come to Ochrerayd for love. He left everything in Shoildon-businesses, interests-to wade into this... mess. Do you honestly think it's only for Verena?"



He found footing with an elbow and propped himself up,gaze ping-ponging between the two. "Mark my words: today it's me with an eye on Sampson Group;tomorrow it could be Isaac. You know about Bennett Group's aggressive acquisitions over the years. They have even swallowed three old financial giants 'conglomerates. And you really believe they have no designs on Sampson Group? Come on, don't be so naive!"
His hoarse laughter ricocheted off the corrugated skeleton of the abandoned steel plant, cut through by the thin keening of police sirens. "Once he smooth-talks Verena, you'll be losing your company next.When the one at your side stabs you, that's when you'll see I told the truth today-"



He never finished. Isaac's shoe slammed into Sherwood's shoulder with a brutal, precise force that sent a gust through the metal container and a heavy thud rolling across the concrete.



Sherwood crumpled, a ragged heap against a slick pool of his own blood. The strobes of the patrol cars lit his distorted features into a ghastly flipbook of pain and rage.



Isaac stood over him, watching him squirm. "Even now,you're trying to turn us against each other?"



A cold, humorless chuckle escaped Isaac. "The Sampson family's affairs aren't my concern. I'm here to deal with scumbags like you. I don't meddle in their private wars-"


He paused, leaned in close until his breath fogged Sherwood's ear. "But before you die, you can start rehearsing how you'll explain those shady ledgers."



Behind Isaac, Luis was a study in composed menace,a long shadow folded around him. The glasses masked the glitter in his gaze, but the chill behind them was a bottomless pool.



He stepped forward, slow and deliberate, and regarded Sherwood with a thin, contemptuous smile.



"The Sampson business is none of your concern.You spent years believing you'd outsmarted everyone. In the end you were performing for an empty house."



For a moment his face softened; Verena's image passed through his eyes. "If Verena wants Sampson Group," he said, measured and almost tender, "I'll hand it to her."



Then the softness snapped back into steel. His gaze cut Sherwood. "As for me? I ask for nothing more than a scrap to keep me fed."



Sherwood's stare snapped between Isaac and Luis, wild and unhinged, veins standing out at his temples.



A brittle laugh tore free-more death rattle than amusement. "So that's it? You two, united?"



He fixed them with a stare that was all hate and a lifetime of grudges, voice rising in hysteria."I regret not finishing you when you were fledglings! I regret not putting Luis down sooner, not keeping lsaac in Shoildon.And Verena-"



His voice shredded into a rasp,eyes bloodshot and  wild. "I should have strangled her in a cradle. I should have never let my plans be ruined!"



Isaac barely listened to his ranting. He inclined his head toward the officers waiting in the shadows. "Take him away."



Two officers moved in with practiced efficiency and lifted Sherwood. For a heartbeat, Daren-still trembling from adrenaline-tore free,lunging with a raw, animal roar. "I'm not done! Isaac! Luis! Just you wait-"



But the officers flattened him without drama before he could finish.



He hit the concrete with a clatter and began to ram his skull against the ground, each strike more desperate than the last.


Meanwhile, Sherwood, limp and muttering, was borne past them like a broken marionette. His hair fell in a filthy curtain over his face; even as he was carried,he kept whispering the same brittle word: regret.



Regret for the plans that had unraveled,for the power that slipped through his fingers, for the puppets that had turned their strings on him.



His carefully spun web of schemes lay in shreds, and all he could do was watch from behind iron bars as the wealth and power he once clutched bled away into nothing.



As the officers marched him toward the idling cruiser,Luis' voice floated down, quiet but sharp as ice.



"You'll have plenty of time to regret what you've done in prison."
###Chapter 393 Just Returning Fire
Police car lights gradually faded as Sherwood and Daren were escorted into the vehicles, metal doors clanging shut behind them.



A quick glance at his watch prompted lsaac to pull out his phone. "I need to inform Verena," he told Luis.



Shadows swallowed him as he stepped away, cold phone light carving sharp angles across his face.



Taillights disappeared around the corner while Luis watched,and then footsteps approached from behind.



Bloodshot eyes filled with gratitude as the commanding officer removed his cap. "Mr. Sampson,we couldn't have managed this without your cooperation."



His Adam's apple bobbed as he reached out to shake Luis' hand, "Daren is incredibly skilled at evading surveillance. Three years we've been chasing him without a single breakthrough..."



Paper scraps scattered in the night wind as the officer lowered his voice. "As for Sherwood,he was clearly working with that drug lord in secret, trying to pin  everything on you. Without the solid evidence you provided beforehand, this case could have dragged on indefinitely."



Phone tucked away, Isaac returned just then.



Back went the officer's cap before he saluted. "We'll handle everything from here. You two can head back now."








Cold phone light illuminated Verena's face as she read Isaac's message repeatedly. "Sherwood has been arrested." Her fingertips unconsciously traced the device's edge.



Molly's presence beside her made Verena quickly darken the screen and slip the phone back into her bag.



Unmistakable awkwardness twisted Molly's expression after Verena finished recounting everything about Miranda.



"Fine, I'll admit it. She really is impressive." Begrudging admiration leaked through her voice as she straightened her posture, refocusing her energy. "But even so, I still burn with envy that she captured Luis 'heart." Rose perfume invaded the space as she suddenly  leaned in close, her words directed past Verena as if Miranda herself were listening. "Don't think sharing all this with me wilI soften my stance toward her one bit.Peace between us is impossible; she'll remain my rival until the end."



Her declaration hung in the air while Molly registered Verena's distant stare, lost somewhere beyond the car window where twilight deepened.



Irritation sparked as she snapped her fingers directly before Verena's glazed eyes. "Earth to Verena! What's got you so spaced out? Are you even listening to me?"



The sharp sound yanked Verena back to the present,their contrasting faces staring back from the window's reflection.



"Night's falling," she murmured gently. "You should get home."



Shock crossed Molly's features as she checked her phone,realizing how much time had slipped away.



Panic drove her movements as she snatched her bag and burst through the car door. "Dear God! Dad will absolutely punish me if he discovers I'm out this late!"



Those words slammed into Verena's chest like a sledgehammer.



Pure instinct made Verena lunge forward, fingers  catching Molly's coat tail. "Hold on."


Confusion painted Molly's face as she spun around from outside the vehicle. "What's wrong?"



Molly's piercing stare made guilt claw at Verena's insides, her head dropping under the weight of shame.Several heartbeats passed before she clenched her fists and forced herself to look up again.



Words barely escaped her lips as she whispered to Molly,"I'm sorry."


Dense as Molly could be, even she couldn't ignore the twisted anguish written across Verena's face or her tortured hesitation.



Suspicion darkened Molly's features as she yanked her coat free from Verena's grip, stepping back warily."Verena, what are you talking about? Stop being cryptic and tell me straight."



Molly's demanding gaze made Verena's throat constrict, overwhelming guilt making it impossible to maintain eye contact.



Downcast eyes hid behind lashes that cast delicate shadows across her cheekbones.


Time stretched endlessly before Verena drew a shuddering breath, pushed open the half-closed car door, and stepped into the night. Sharp clicks echoed through the stillness as her flat shoes struck the asphalt with each measured step.



Streetlights wove their shadows into an intricate web as she approached Molly with deliberate slowness.


Dry leaves skittered around their feet in the faint breeze, powerless to cut through the suffocating tension.



"Sherwood was arrested tonight on drug trafficking charges."



Ice seemed to coat the wind as it carried Verena's words like razor-sharp fragments.


Molly's lashes fluttered as her eyes went wide with shock.



All color bled from Molly's face as she stumbled backward,her body hitting the car with a hollow thud."What did you just say?"



Her voice cracked and splintered, as though torn from the very depths of her being.



"I'm sorry," Verena's hand pressed against her stomach as she bent forward slightly, the apology pouring out of her. "I asked you out today because l was using you. Our plan was to make Sherwood believe you'd been kidnapped, baiting him into  bringing ransom money to his scheduled meeting with the drug lord... That way, the police could capture both him and the dealer in one coordinated strike."



Molly's knees gave way as she collapsed against the car, her fingers clawing desperately at the metal surface with a harsh screech. "You're lying! Dad's too smart to get caught so easily! This has to be some sick joke. I'm calling him right now to prove you wrong!"


Desperation fueled her frantic search through her handbag.



Coral-painted nails trembled across the phone screen after she found it, fumbling the password three times before finally unlocking the device.



Sherwood's number rang through to nothing but a cold,mechanical busy tone.


"That's impossible..." Suddenly, she shoved the phone toward Verena. "Look! It's not connecting because the line is busy. You're making this whole thing up!"



Verena reached out and locked Molly's phone screen."You won't reach him," she said quietly.



A subtle gesture directed Molly's attention toward the car's interior, making her lean forward to follow Verena's indication. Blue light pulsed ominously from a black device tucked beneath the leather seat where she'd been sitting. "Signal jamming equipment has been running in this car. Every communication to your phone was blocked the moment you stepped inside."



Ashen pallor crept across Molly's face as Verena continued with deliberate slowness, "So during our entire conversation, you received no texts or calls.And right now, Sherwood can't receive any of your messages or calls."



Crimson fury blazed in Molly's eyes the instant Verena finished speaking, her glare turning murderous.



Movement from the driver caught Verena's peripheral vision,but she raised her hand to wave him off.



Sharp nails bit deep into Verena's collar as Molly grabbed her. Scalding tears carved tracks down her cheeks while ragged breaths tore from her throat. "So you targeted me deliberately, used me as bait,all to destroy my father!"



Smeared makeup transformed her face into a canvas of destruction, hatred burning in her eyes like wildfire."Why? What did my dad ever do to you? Why are you trying to destroy him like this?"



Verena stood firm, letting Molly shake her without resistance.



Guilt over this entire situation had made her stop the  driver from intervening earlier. Still, she wouldn't shoulder all the blame.



Verena's steady gaze met Molly's bloodshot eyes as bone-deep resolve froze Verena's guilt solid. "Molly,I'll admit | used you, but claiming | destroyed Sherwood..."



Iron strength gripped Molly's wrist, forcing her to release her hold with a sharp wince. "That's completely false," Verena added.


Night wind caught Verena's hair, whipping it across her face as her voice turned glacial. "There are truths you've been sheltered from your entire life. Twenty-five years ago, your father orchestrated my separation from my family."


Each step brought her closer, her arctic stare reflecting in Molly's dilated pupils. "He shattered my mother's mind and broke my father's health. My brother had to sacrifice his youth to save Sampson Group and hold our family together, nearly falling into the trap of marrying you... the daughter of our destroyer!"



Bitter laughter erupted from Verena's throat, saturated with years of buried rage. "Did you imagine that evidence materialized from nothing? Do you have any clue how many atrocities your father has committed in the shadows?" Molly's hands froze mid-air, her mouth working soundlessly like a fish gasping for breath. Questions turned to ice shards lodged in her throat, too sharp and frozen to escape. Streetlight halos blurred through her tears as each of Verena's words struck like hammer blows, splintering her image of her devoted, principled father into fragments.



"That's impossible..." Desperation made Molly shake her head violently, rejecting every syllable. "My dad,he...there's no way he could..."



Her voice withered to a whisper, trembling with disbelief she couldn't even convince herself to feel.Ambition was the worst she'd ever attributed to her father, never imagining he could sink to such unthinkable depths.



Fresh tears carved new paths down her ravaged cheeks at this realization.


Complex emotions churned through Verena's chest as she watched Molly collapse into muffled sobs behind her hands. Molly's trembling silhouette stirred memories of her mother's hollow stare, her father's withered frame-harsh reminders that Sherwood had planted these seeds of destruction himself.



"Molly,twenty-five years ago your father made a wrong choice, and now, he repeated it." Ice coated Verena's words despite the slight tremor in her voice.  "Every action breeds consequences.Children understand this fundamental truth. Surely he did too.Yet he still chose to shatter the law, and what followed was justice's inevitable verdict. As for you..."



A gilded business card emerged from Verena's purse,catching streetlight in cold flashes.


"Police will soon dissect every shadowy corner of the Kirk empire." The card slipped into Molly's shaking palm, contact with those frozen fingertips making Verena's heart stutter unexpectedly. "An overseas friend needs a design director. Your talent could build something new, maybe even better than what you're leaving behind."



A soft exhale escaped Verena's lips as she turned away, sliding into the car and sealing the door with finality.



Streetlight stretched Molly's hunched shadow into something grotesque and endless as tears carved fresh channels down her face.



Sharp card edges bit into her palm while gilded letters swam through her blurred vision.



Sand particles stung her cheeks in the night breeze as Verena's words echoed: "Every action breeds consequences."



Molly's nails carved crescents into her skin-her  cherished father had been systematically destroying other families in darkness.



An uncontrollable sob tore from her throat at the revelation.



Hatred burned for her father's criminal choices, but self-loathing consumed her more for endangering her father over a man who didn't love her. Though perhaps, if her father had chosen differently from the start, Luis would never have struck back so ruthlessly.



Engine noise hummed in the distance as Verena's taillights faded around the corner.



Molly lifted her gaze to track the disappearing vehicle,the card's metallic edges slicing into her white-knuckled grip. Liking Verena remained impossible, yet blaming or resenting her felt equally futile. Just as Verena had declared, they were simply returning fire now.
###Chapter 394 The Time Has Come For Him To Answer
The next morning, pale sunlight filtered through the barred windows of the police station, scattering across the long table in fractured squares of light and shadow. Luis sat at its center, his hands steady, his long fingers fanning out the documents as though laying bare a man's sins one sheet at a time.



He gathered the stack with measured care, sliding the thick bundle into a weathered manila pouch and looping the twine shut with practiced precision.



Across from him, steam curled lazily from the commanding officer's chipped mug,yet it did nothing to cut the heaviness pressing down on the room.



"These are the money-laundering records from Sherwood's company," Luis said, pushing the pouch across the table. "Five years of transactions-every cent funneled through at least three shell corporations. The most recent, an eighty-million deal,was tied directly to arms smuggling."



The officer slid his glasses higher on his nose and thumbed through the files. From between the papers,a faded photograph slipped free. He studied it with quiet intensity: Sherwood in his youth, raising a glass with a foreign businessman at the docks two decades earlier.



Behind them, half-hidden by stacked crates, a container bore a faint skull emblem.


Luis drew another piece of evidence from his side-a videotape, its casing mottled with mold. He nudged it forward. "This came from Howe Adams, one of Sherwood's men. It's a backup of the surveillance from the port warehouse back then. The footage is grainy,but you can still see him-Sherwood, giving orders,containers moved, large sums of cash exchanged."


"Quite the empire he built," the officer muttered,taking off his glasses to rub them clean with a handkerchief. "No wonder we couldn't break that smuggling case back then. He wasn't just involved-he was orchestrating everything."



Luis reached into the evidence stack again and brought out a sealed bag. Inside lay a yellowed scrap of paper, its ink smeared with age. Yet a few words still bled through: "the Sampson newborn", "hush money,"



His fingertip tapped once on the pastic. "This came from intermediaries-Reginald Todd, Howe Adams,Bohumil Navarro. They all pointed to Sherwood.He orchestrated my sister's kidnapping twenty-five years  ago."



The officer adjusted his glasses again, his clouded gaze softening as it swept over the spread of files,photos, and relics of corruption. Relief settled over his features like a weight finally released.



Removing his gloves, he began filing the evidence by year,his voice thick with memory. "With this... we can finally close the case. The one that's haunted us all these years."



Back then when Verena was taken, he had been a rookie fresh out of academy. He could still see the Sampsons rushing into the station that night-Joseph and Marisa nearly collapsing from grief as they begged for help. The whole city had been thrown into uproar,police combing every street corner, interrogating hundreds of witnesses. And yet, after months of searching, the only thing they'd produced was a thin file marked with the cruel stamp: "No Evidence Found."Now, a quarter of a century later, the truth lay before him at last.



The officer slid the last file into its folder and raised his eyes to Luis. There was something unreadable in the older man's gaze-pride, sorrow, resolve, all layered in the fog of time.


"Mr. Sampson," he said gently, "rest assured.Sherwood will face justice. Twenty-five years is long enough. The time has come for him to answer."


Luis' eyes lowered to the table, to the evidence stacked neatly like gravestones of the past. His throat moved as he swallowed, thelight striking across his features in sharp angles. He looked stone-cold.


"May I see him with my father?" he asked quietly."There are things he needs to hear face-to-face."



For a moment, the officer simply looked at him, and in that face he glimpsed the echo of a boy who had once stood here weeping, begging for his baby sister's return.



After a long pause, he nodded. "By regulation,suspects awaiting trial can be visited only once a month, no longer than thirty minutes each time.But given the weight of this case, I can arrange a visit with Sherwood soon. Just remember-officers will be monitoring every word. That's procedure, and it's for your safety as much as ours. I trust you understand."



Luis inclined his head and nodded. "Thank you. Half an hour will do."



The commanding officer wasted no time and made the arrangements. Soon, a younger officer led Luis and Joseph down the narrow corridors of the detention center. The air grew heavier with every step,until they reached one of the stark interrogation  rooms.



When the guard pulled open the iron door,the hinges wailed with a piercing groan. The sound jolted Joseph;his knees buckled, and he nearly lost his balance.



Luis caught him at once, steadying the older man's stooped frame, his hand brushing against Joseph's trembling arm.


Only last night, Luis had spread the damning evidence across Joseph's desk.


Joseph had sat in his study for hours, unmoving,the ashtray filling with cigarette butts as he stared at the endless list of Sherwood's crimes.



Not once had he spoken. He had only smoked, chain after chain, as if each drag might burn away the disbelief tightening his chest.


Now, in the sterile glare of the interrogation room,Sherwood raised his head at the sound of the door.



His cuffed hands rested with casual arrogance on the chair's metal armrests.



His hair was a tangled mess,his shirt wrinkled from the night, yet that sinister trademark smile still clung to his lips. He looked less like a man cornered by justice and more like a host awaiting guests in his parlor. His gaze flicked lazily from Joseph's pale face to Luis ' tense jaw. A chuckle rumbled out of him, low and taunting.


"I knew you'd come," he drawled, the jangle of his handcuffs only adding to his insolent poise.


He leaned back in his chair, eyes gleaming with amusement, as though he were a spectator at a play whose ending he had scripted long ago. "So," he mused, stretching out his words,"you came to watch me tumble from my throne? To savor the spectacle?"



The lines of exhaustion carved into his face only deepened the mockery in his smirk, as if twenty-five years of crime and the suffering of others were no more than dust on his shoulders.



Joseph's eyes widened, bloodshot and glassy. The veins along his neck coiled upward like withered vines,his chest heaving with unspent rage.



"Why?" The word scraped from his throat, raw and broken.



Then fury broke loose. He shook free of Luis' hand,staggered toward the table, and drove his fist into the reinforced glass with a crack that rattled the room."Sherwood Kirk! How can you still laugh?"



His voice tore through the room, ragged with twenty -five years of pent-up bitterness. "I treated you like my own brother-and you stole my daughter! You tried to sell her to traffickers like she was nothing!After Verena vanished, you even sat beside me and wept!"



Spit sprayed across the glass as Joseph's rage consumed him. His hand clawed at his collar,yanking it open to reveal a jagged scar running across his chest. "Do you remember this, huh? I earned this scar saving you from that crash! I risked my life for you,and all the while you schemed to sell my daughter into hell!"



His knee struck the table's edge, but he didn't even flinch. He bent over, trembling, eyes burning into Sherwood's mocking calm. Tears cut down the creases of his face as his voice broke apart. "Tell me,Sherwood-don't you have a guilty conscience? Do you really sleep soundly at night? All these years? Or did my daughter ever come to you in your dreams,demanding your life?"
###Chapter 395 You Will Live
Sherwood leaned back against the iron chair, the metalic clink of his handcuffs striking like cruel music against the silence.



"Humph.Like brother?" He sneered, his eyes glittering with contempt as they lingered on Joseph's twisted face.Remorse had no place there. "Joseph, if you had ever truly treated me like a brother, you wouldn't have swallowed the Ochrerayd market whole!"



He suddenly leaned forward, veins straining in his neck."You knew I was too ambitious to crawl beneath you.While you basked in the sunlight at the summit,I spent every day plotting how to drag you down into the mud!"



His agitation mounted; he gasped as sweat slid down his face."Conscience? A useless trinket! In this world of wolves, only profit is eternal. You know what?When I stole your daughter all those years ago,watching you collapse in despair became my sweetest victory!"



Sherwood threw his head back and laughed-a harsh,unhinged sound that filled the cramped interrogation room like a banshee's cry. "Every time I watched you lot running in circles, struggling, I raised a glass at parties to toast to power and money.With those two,one could always sidestep the law."



Suddenly,he leaned toward the bulletproof glass, his nose almost touching the cold surface, his breath fogging it.



He narrowed his eyes and appraised Joseph, who barely held himself upright, from head to toe.A sinister smile tugged at his mouth. "Joseph, look at you now. No longer standing on top of the world,huh?How did you wind up like this?"



He drawled the words with mockery, the laugh carving deeper lines in his face. "Joseph, do you think I'd feel guilty? Let me tell you the truth-every time 1remember you sobbing at the police station, I felt I'd done something monumental. Hahaha!"


Luis remained rooted, his nails biting into his palms,the metallic taste of blood filling his mouth.



He watched his father's faltering figure while his mother's cries in a hospital room-echoes that had haunted them for twenty-five years-rang in his ears.



The overhead light in the interrogation room hummed,throwing Sherwood's insolence into stark relief.



Luis felt his temples throb as he stared at Sherwood's contorted face. The urge to kill nearly drowned out reason. The thuds of Joseph hammering the bulletproof glass grew louder, his voice raw with rage. "You bastard!You'll die a miserable death!"



At once, the older commanding officer and two younger officers moved in and restrained Joseph,who had lost control.



"Sir,please calm down. There are cameras here," one of the young officers warned, the sound of metal clattering underlining his words.



Luis drew a steadying breath to swallow the tidal wave of fury and turned to Joseph. "Dad, please go. I'll handle this."



Though his tone was decisive and measured,a tremor still threaded through it.


Once Joseph was escorted out, Luis walked slowly to the bulletproof glass and dragged an iron chair to sit.The chair's legs scraped across the floor in a grating protest.



He sat upright, hands folded on his knees, unusually composed.



Through the glass he locked eyes with Sherwood,his gaze cold as steel, aiming to pierce the madness behind Sherwood's stare. "Go on. I'm curious about what other filthy words you have." Sherwood shook his wrists in annoyance. "What?Feeling sorry for your old man?"



He cocked his head, eyes bright with provocation."Watching him crawl into churches and beg for salvation back then-that was the real entertainment."



As Sherwood finished, Luis leaned forward without warning. "Do you think that rattles me?"



His voice dropped low but carried an unmistakable force. "Don't forget: now that you're cuffed,you'll spend the rest of your days repenting behind bars."


He paused, enunciating each word like a measured strike. "The more you thrash, the clearer your fear becomes. Wait and see-the law will make you answer for every vile word and every crime."


Sherwood paused his fiddling with the handcuffs. His Adam's apple bobbed; veins in his neck bulged like pale cords.



The glass caught the tiny constriction of his pupils,and Luis seized that fleeting hint of panic.



Before Sherwood could twist his mouth into another sneer, Luis moved closer, the collar of his suit grazing the metal table's edge. "You were comfortable for over twenty years, living like royalty. Did you really believe it would last forever?" Sherwood's spine stiffened involuntarily. His chair scraped faintly against the floor.



Luis curled an index finger and struck the table with it -a heavy knock that made Sherwood flinch.



He tapped out a slow, deliberate rhythm; the metal's vibration sounded like a metronome aimed at Sherwood's core.



"Money laundering, arms smuggling, child trafficking ..." Luis let the list hang, slowing his cadence to watch the color drain from Sherwood's face. "When the verdict comes, you may not have much time left even in prison."



Fear-real and raw-finally showed in Sherwood's eyes.





The thought of waiting for a verdict in a cell, or of someone else deciding his fate, tightened like a vise.


For a man who worshipped his image, the prospect was unbearable.



Then Sherwood seemed to recall something;his tense shoulders eased.



He gave a hoarse laugh. A sick, victorious flicker lit his eyes. "Luis, you must've forgotten-I'm a cancer patient." He coughed on purpose, a flush rising faintly on his sallow face. "The cancer's everywhere; the doctors say I'm not long for this world. My health's failing by the day..."



He lingered on the last words, a warped smile twisting them. "I won't be suffering in prison for long. You won't get the satisfaction."



Luis watched Sherwood's theatrics with a cold smile.



He rose slowly and looked down at the man behind the glass, irony plain in his eyes. "Do you really think you can wiggle out of this with that?"



He drew a diagnostic report from a folder and slammed it down on the table. "I'll have Verena treat you. Don't forget-she's Evelyn, a renowned medical mind, and highly skilled at treating so-called terminal patients like you."



Luis leaned in, words clipped and precise. "Rest assured, you will live. And you will watch the law take you apart."
