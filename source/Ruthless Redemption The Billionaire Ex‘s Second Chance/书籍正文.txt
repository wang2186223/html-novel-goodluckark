###Chapter 1

The intense passion in the bedroom finally subsided after two hours. The sound of water splashing against tiles soon echoed from the shower. Eleanor Thompson, still trembling, got out of bed and picked up her clothes from the floor. Nathaniel Carter had been rougher than usual today, leaving her feeling disoriented. She fumbled with the buttons of her pajamas, struggling to fasten them.

Nathaniel emerged from the shower, tall and strikingly handsome, with a towel wrapped around his waist. Water droplets glistened on his abs. Noticing Eleanor still in the room, he frowned slightly.

Eleanor avoided his gaze, continuing her battle with the buttons.

"Isabella will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow," Nathaniel said abruptly as he passed her. "Go pick her up. I've already told your mother she can stay here for a while."

Eleanor's hands froze mid-button. She turned to look at Nathaniel, her husband of two years and the heir to Amity Group. The woman he mentioned was her adopted sister, Isabella Morgan.

When Eleanor was five, she went missing at an amusement park and was only found at sixteen. By then, her parents, Edward Harrison and Margaret Bennett, had adopted Isabella. Edward had explained solemnly that during Eleanor's absence, Margaret had been inconsolable, leading them to adopt a girl from an orphanage.

Upon Eleanor's return, the family was reunited, but life wasn't as harmonious as expected. Eleanor had grown up in a rural village, while Isabella had been raised with all the privileges of the Harrison family, mastering dance, painting, and piano.

More importantly, the Harrison family had a prearranged engagement with the Carters. Nathaniel's fiancée had always been Isabella until Eleanor's return. Nathaniel and Isabella were childhood sweethearts, a bond disrupted by Eleanor's sudden reappearance.

Lost in thought, Eleanor quickly regained her composure, abandoning her struggle with the buttons. She pulled her clothes together and said, "Alright," before leaving the room. Her bedroom was at the end of the hallway.

On their wedding night, Nathaniel had told her he wasn't used to sharing a bed. Eleanor understood immediately and moved to the guest room without a word.

Eleanor was perceptive. Even when Nathaniel didn't inform her in advance about Isabella staying, she wouldn't question him. After all, this was his house. If he decided to replace the lady of the house, no one would object, and as his wife, Eleanor had no right to speak.

...

The next day, Eleanor drove to the hospital. Standing outside the hospital room, she heard voices inside.

"So, is Mr. Carter coming to pick you up today?"

"I'm not sure," Isabella replied softly. "He's always so busy with work. I doubt he'll come."

"That's not for sure. You're special to him. If Eleanor hadn't shown up back then, you would have become Mrs. Carter! Everyone in our circle knows Nathaniel likes you."",
###Chapter2

The voice belonged to Olivia Davenport, Isabella's closest friend and heiress to a prominent fortune. Olivia and Isabella had been inseparable since childhood, and she had always been the most vocal supporter of Nathaniel and Isabella's relationship. Now that Eleanor had taken Isabella's place as Nathaniel's wife, it was no surprise that Olivia treated her with open hostility.

Even when she noticed Eleanor standing at the doorway, Olivia showed no remorse for her harsh words.

It was Isabella who broke the silence first. "You're here, Eleanor."

Eleanor nodded. "I came to take you home. Have you packed everything?"

"Yes, I'm ready. Let's go," Isabella replied with her usual gentle smile.

Olivia couldn't resist chiming in, "Where's Mr. Carter? Isabella is being discharged today. Isn't he coming to pick her up?"

"He's at the office," Eleanor replied curtly.

"Oh, how convenient. I wonder if he's too busy or if someone is keeping him away," Olivia sneered, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

Before Eleanor could respond, Isabella interjected softly, "Olivia, please."

Olivia let out a cold laugh. "Why shouldn't I say it? Am I wrong?"

Eleanor didn't engage. Instead, she unlocked her phone, scrolled to Nathaniel's contact, and handed it to Olivia.

"What's this supposed to mean?" Olivia asked, her brow furrowing.

Eleanor's expression remained calm. "If you're so curious, why don't you call him yourself and ask?"

"You—" Olivia's temper flared, but Isabella quickly grabbed her arm, shaking her head. "Don't argue with Eleanor," she pleaded.

"You're too kind," Olivia muttered through gritted teeth. "That's why people take advantage of you."

Eleanor ignored Olivia's jab. She grabbed Isabella's suitcase and walked ahead. As soon as she got into the car, her phone rang.

It was Margaret. "Did you pick up Isabella?"

There was a noticeable tension in Margaret's voice when she spoke to Eleanor.

"Yes," Eleanor replied.

"Is she alright? The doctor said her irregular eating habits were the cause. Your father and I are still overseas. Make sure you take good care of her when you get home, okay?"

"Okay," Eleanor answered, her tone steady.

Margaret seemed to realize her tone had been harsh. After a brief pause, she added, "You're her older sister, after all."

Eleanor's grip on the steering wheel tightened. A swirl of emotions rose inside her, but she suppressed it and responded softly, "I understand. Is there anything else?"

After a moment of silence, Margaret said, "Give the phone to Isabella."

"Alright." Eleanor handed the phone to Isabella, who was sitting in the back seat.

"Hi, Mom," Isabella spoke to Margaret in a soft, sweet voice, the kind a daughter uses when speaking to her mother affectionately.

The contrast with Eleanor's cold and formal tone was stark.

Eleanor didn't turn around. She simply fastened her seatbelt and started the car, her expression composed.

"You're here, Ms. Morgan!" As soon as Eleanor's car stopped in front of the villa, Grace Harper, the housekeeper, rushed over. Her face lit up the moment she saw Isabella.

"Grace, it's been so long," Isabella greeted her with a radiant smile.

"Yes, it has! You've grown even more beautiful. I made your favorite barbecued ribs today. You must try them later." Grace had already led Isabella inside as she spoke.

Compared to Isabella, Eleanor's presence as the lady of the house seemed almost invisible.

Still, Eleanor was used to this. She simply instructed the house helper to bring Isabella's suitcase to the guest room. Then, she retreated to her own room.

She had just taken out her tablet when Isabella's voice sounded from the door, "So this is where you live." Eleanor turned her head sharply.

Isabella's gaze wandered around the room before she asked, "Eleanor, do you and Nathaniel... sleep in separate rooms?"",
###Chapter3

At precisely 7:00 pm, Nathaniel returned to the mansion. Eleanor happened to be in the living room when he arrived.

The moment she saw him, she walked over excitedly to greet him. "You're back, Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel gave her a slight smile as he looked up at her.

Eleanor pursed her lips and stepped forward to take his coat. She said to him, "Dinner is ready."

...

"I'm sorry, Nathaniel. Am I encroaching on you and Eleanor by staying here?" Isabella asked quietly at the dinner table. She snuck a glance at Eleanor before continuing, "I told Mom I could stay home on my own, but she insists that she doesn't feel at ease if I'm alone at home..."

"It's fine. Stay as long as you like. If you need anything, just ask," Nathaniel replied.

"Really? I don't want to be too much trouble."

"It's no trouble at all."

"Ms. Isabella, it's better that you're staying here," Grace chimed in as she served the dishes. "It's been a long time since this house has felt so lively."

Upon hearing that, Eleanor's hand that was holding the spoon froze midair.

Nevertheless, Grace wasn't wrong. Eleanor was rather quiet and reserved, unlike Isabella, who could easily get everyone to like her. It wasn't just Grace—Eleanor had never heard Nathaniel speak so much before. Eleanor knew she was just taking up space by being there. So, she hastily finished the food on her plate and stood up. "I'm done eating. So, I'll head upstairs first. You all take your time and enjoy your food." "Are you sure you've had enough, Eleanor? You ate so little. Shall I accompany you upstairs?" Isabella offered with concern.

"That's not necessary," Eleanor replied, pulling her hand away from Isabella's grasp. "It's fine. Enjoy your dinner."

With that, she turned and walked upstairs. Just before leaving the dining room, she overheard Isabella asking cautiously, "Nathaniel, is Eleanor upset? I guess I shouldn't have come here and disrupted your lives..."

There was a hint of grief and a slight choke in Isabella's voice when she said that.

Eleanor didn't want to hear anymore. She didn't care how Nathaniel responded to Isabella, either.

Back in her room, she opened her computer again. But even after she opened her work file, she couldn't seem to start on it. She didn't know how much time had passed before a message popped up on her phone.

It was from Nathaniel, and there were only two words: "Come over."

Eleanor glanced at the message but chose to ignore it. Nathaniel didn't send a second message.

She stared at the uncolored panels on her screen for a while longer. After some time, she turned off her computer and left the room.

This was the reason Nathaniel never needed to send a second message—he knew she would eventually go to him.

When Eleanor arrived at the master bedroom, Nathaniel had just stepped out of the bathroom. The first thing he noticed was that she hadn't even bothered to change out of the clothes she'd been wearing earlier. He frowned slightly but didn't dwell on it. He reached out and grabbed her hand, pulling her into the bathroom forcefully.

Warm water cascaded down onto Eleanor from the showerhead, drenching her hair and body in an instant. The discomfort from the wet clothes sticking to her skin made her wince. Just as she was about to push Nathaniel away, he grabbed the back of her head and kissed her.

Their lips and tongues intertwined. Nathaniel was assertive and domineering—so were his kisses. Even after two years, Eleanor still hadn't fully adjusted to it. Being in the bathroom with him only intensified her sense of suffocation.

Her legs weakened, and her whole body slumped against Nathaniel's.

At that moment, they both heard a feminine voice from outside the door. "Nathaniel, are you in there?"",
###Chapter4

Eleanor's body stiffened. Her eyes flew open, and she tried to push Nathaniel away with all her strength. But Nathaniel acted as if he hadn't heard anything. He gripped her wrists effortlessly and pressed her against the wall. His movements were as forceful as ever.

Eleanor wanted to cry out, but she quickly remembered that Isabella was right outside. She bit her tongue and swallowed the helpless whimper that was about to escape her lips just in time.

The sound of the water from the shower continued. With the door between them, Isabella seemed to be unaware of what was happening inside.

She called out again, "Nathaniel?"

Eleanor turned her head to look at Nathaniel. Her face was flushed, possibly due to anger or some other intense emotion. Her eyes were opened wide as she glared at Nathaniel. In contrast to her usual quiet and withdrawn demeanor, she looked far more animated at that moment.

Her expression caused Nathaniel's movements to become bolder. It was almost as if he were venting. Their bodies moved in perfect sync. Soon, Eleanor reached a state of absolute ecstasy.

Isabella was still speaking outside the door, but Eleanor couldn't make out a single word she was saying. When Nathaniel pressed her down again, she couldn't hold back and let out a soft moan.

Right away, the person outside the bathroom door fell silent.

Upon realizing this, Eleanor clenched her hands tightly. Just then, Nathaniel bent down and picked her up. With his body lowered, his shoulder came close to her mouth. Without hesitation, she bit down.

Eleanor's heart was filled with frustration and resentment. But despite her grievances, she didn't bite hard. After a gentle bite, she let go and looked up.

Nathaniel's deep and intent gaze was fixed on her.

Eleanor didn't say anything but turned her head to avoid his stare. But in the next second, Nathaniel grabbed her chin and kissed her again.

The night passed quickly. Eleanor couldn't remember how she made it back to her room. As soon as she collapsed onto the bed, she fell into a deep sleep.

...

The next morning, it was Grace who came to remind Eleanor that she should be heading back to Carter Manor that day.

Eleanor jolted awake immediately.

Grace continued, "Ms. Isabella was up early and even made breakfast for Mr. Carter."

There was a distinct note of displeasure in her voice.

Eleanor noticed it but chose not to make a fuss about it. She merely grunted in acknowledgment and got out of bed.

"Are you getting ready to go to Carter Manor?" Isabella approached with a smile as soon as Eleanor came downstairs. "Shall I go with you? Grandma Clara called me a couple of days ago and asked me to visit her when I had the time."

"Okay," Eleanor replied readily. To be more accurate, she responded indifferently because it didn't really matter to her.

Isabella raised an eyebrow in mild surprise, but then her smile deepened. "Please wait for me. I made Grandma Clara's favorite crab cakes-they'll be ready soon."

Eleanor agreed nonchalantly as usual.

But as Isabella headed back into the kitchen, a thought suddenly crossed Eleanor's mind. Isabella was fully capable of making meals, as well as desserts and cakes. Would she be unable to take care of herself? It was something Margaret hadn't considered, and Nathaniel didn't seem to have thought of it, either. But wasn't he supposed to be the smart one? Perhaps he had realized it, but he simply went along with it. Eleanor pushed those thoughts aside and turned to look out the window.

The sky was gray and overcast-it looked like it was about to rain.",
###Chapter5

Eleanor had grown up with Nathaniel, so she was even more familiar with Carter Manor than Isabella. As soon as she entered the house, she walked over to the elderly lady while exclaiming, "Grandma Clara!" 

"Oh, it's Ellie!" Nathaniel's grandmother, Clara Montgomery, was overjoyed. "Let me take a look at you. Have you lost weight again?"

"Not really. Look! I made some lobster rolls for you," Eleanor replied.

"You sweet girl! How thoughtful of you," Clara praised.

The two of them chatted affectionately, and Clara was all smiles. However, the moment Isabella approached, her smile faded significantly.

Isabella acted as if she hadn't noticed anything and respectfully greeted, "Grandma."

Clara glanced at her and was about to say something, but Isabella shifted her attention to the top of the stairs and called out, "Mom."

"Madam Carter," Eleanor greeted, straightening up. She had been leaning on Clara's shoulder just a moment ago. She became timid the moment she saw the person at the top of the staircase.

"Hello, Eleanor." Victoria Sinclair, Nathaniel's mother, acknowledged her with a nod. Her attitude was somewhat distant but still polite, making it impossible to fault her.

Then, she turned to Clara and greeted, "Mom."

Clara merely responded with a slight hum, her expression even icier than Victoria's.

Nevertheless, Victoria didn't seem to mind. She glanced at the food Eleanor had brought and commented, "The doctor said Mom has been having indigestion lately. Lobster rolls are too rich. They're not suitable for her consumption."

After a slight pause, she instructed their butler, Arthur West, to take the snacks away, "Take them to the kitchen, Arthur."

Throughout the entire exchange, Victoria didn't bother to consult Clara or even look at Eleanor.

Eleanor was very good at winning people over. But no matter how hard she tried, Victoria never seemed to like her.

Victoria had always maintained a cool, distant demeanor. She treated people with grace and elegance, never extending any hospitality deeper than general courtesy.

It had been Victoria who insisted on fulfilling her late husband's wish. She insisted that if Isabella had truly gone missing and could no longer be found, then the prearranged engagement would naturally fall through.

But since Isabella had returned to the Harrison family, she was the one who should marry Nathaniel. If it weren't for Victoria's insistence, Isabella wouldn't be Mrs. Carter now.

Of course, Eleanor felt resentful toward Victoria. But then, she never dared to show it openly.

Victoria, on the other hand, paid no mind to how Eleanor felt. After giving her instructions to Arthur, she turned to Isabella and said, "Come upstairs with me."

"Sure," Isabella replied, making her way up the stairs.

Once they reached the tea room, Victoria handed Isabella a business card. "I found an old alternative medicine practitioner through some connections. Go see him tomorrow and let him assist you with your health."

Isabella pursed her lips, and she didn't reach for the card.

Almost as if she could tell what Isabella was thinking, Victoria continued, "You and Nathaniel have been married for two years now. It's time to start thinking about having children.

"Eleanor was raised by Clara, so she may be a little biased toward her. But once you have a child, she won't trouble you anymore."

It was rare for Victoria to speak so much to Isabella.

Isabella kept her head lowered and didn't utter a word.

Upon seeing this, Victoria added, "What happened last time was just an accident. It's been over a year since then. You need to move on."

Victoria's words caused Isabella to shudder, and she clenched her hands tightly by her sides. Her lower abdomen even ached reflexively.

Was it an accident? Of course... It wasn't.

Despite what everyone said to comfort her, Isabella knew better than anyone that it wasn't an accident at all.

Eleanor had deliberately caused her to fall down the stairs!",
###Chapter6

Nathaniel arrived just before dinner. Clara was all smiles when she saw her grandson. She held Nathaniel's hand and asked about his day.

"Look at you. You've lost weight again," Clara said with a frown. "How is it that you've gotten even thinner after getting married? How has your wife been taking care of you?"

Her criticism was directed at Eleanor.

Before Eleanor could respond, Isabella spoke up, "Grandma Clara, please don't scold Eleanor. She's been very busy lately. I heard she has another graphic novel that is about to be published. Didn't you notice that she's also lost a lot of weight? I felt so bad for her when I saw her yesterday."

Isabella's words seemed to be in Eleanor's defense, but something about them felt off. Only Eleanor could fully grasp the hidden jab in them.

After hearing what Isabella said, Clara's displeasure deepened. "Bah, graphic novels! Those worthless things can't even be called art. You—"

Clara was about to lecture Eleanor when Nathaniel interrupted her, "Can we eat now?"

"Nathaniel, you—" Clara began, but Victoria stepped in and cut her off, "Mom, Nathaniel is a grown man. He knows how to take care of himself."

Since she put it that way, Clara could only swallow her reproaching words. She then turned to Isabella and said, "Isabella is always the best—so sensible and caring. If only..."

Clara's voice trailed off because she realized she was about to say something inappropriate again. Victoria changed the topic swiftly, saying, "Eleanor, are your parents still abroad?"

"Yes."

"It's not very convenient for Isabella to stay at your place for such a long time. I think it would be better for her to stay here for a while. After all, didn't you just say you wanted to spend more time with my mom, Isabella?"

As soon as Victoria made that suggestion, Isabella's expression faltered. "I—"

Victoria didn't give her a chance to object. She went on, "Besides, I've found a few promising young men for you. This would be the perfect opportunity for you to get acquainted with them."

"That's not necessary," Isabella muttered, her eyes beginning to redden.

But before she could say more, Clara interjected, "Isabella is still young. Her parents aren't exactly in a rush to marry her off, either."

"That's not true. Margaret and I spoke about this before. She asked me to help introduce some good prospects to her. Recently, I've come across—"

"I don't want to!" Isabella shrieked. Her shrill voice startled everyone in the room.

Isabella realized that she had reacted too strongly. She bit her lip and added, "I... I don't want to think about marriage just yet."

Victoria didn't say another word. She merely narrowed her eyes as she studied Isabella.

Isabella couldn't bring herself to meet Victoria's gaze. So, she turned to Nathaniel instead. "Nate, I... I don't want to consider marriage right now. Help me..."

"Nate, huh?" Eleanor scoffed inwardly. She felt a sudden urge to laugh upon hearing that nickname.

But before the smile could reach her lips, she heard Nathaniel's response.

He said, "If Isabella isn't ready yet, then let's leave it for now. We'll discuss this another time, Mom."",
###Chapter7

"Nathaniel, thank you for standing up for me earlier," Isabella murmured from the back seat as they drove home. Her words tumbled out in a rush, "I never expected Mom to bring this up with Mrs. Sinclair. I was terrified! If you hadn't intervened, I wouldn't have known what to do. I'm not ready to get married yet."

Nathaniel was focused on the road, his response a curt "hmm." His aloof demeanor didn't bother Isabella; she knew it was just his way.

She turned her attention to Eleanor, who sat in the passenger seat. "By the way, what did Mrs. Sinclair say to you when you two went upstairs?"

"Nothing," Eleanor replied flatly, her tone dismissive.

Isabella pouted slightly but quickly changed the subject. "Oh, did you hear? Julian is coming back to the country."

Eleanor's composed expression faltered for a brief moment.

Just then, the traffic light ahead turned red. Nathaniel brought the car to a smooth stop. The sudden halt caught Eleanor off guard, and her body jerked forward slightly before the seatbelt pulled her back.

Nathaniel glanced at Eleanor.

"Mom said he's doing really well abroad. It's been years. Haven't you two kept in touch at all?" Isabella pressed.

"No," Eleanor replied, her voice steady, though her hands clenched tightly in her lap.

"What a shame. You two were so close back then," Isabella murmured. She then turned to Nathaniel. "Do you remember him, Nathaniel? Julian was—"

"I know. He's the illegitimate son of the Whitaker family," Nathaniel interjected bluntly.

The words "illegitimate son" rolled off his tongue without hesitation. Eleanor couldn't help but frown, while Isabella seemed momentarily taken aback. She nodded slowly. "Yes... that's him. He was Eleanor's classmate, and we all used to hang out together. It's a shame he went abroad. I always thought he and Eleanor would stay in touch, but I guess not..."

Isabella's voice trailed off, her gaze lingering on Eleanor.

Eleanor found Isabella's behavior absurd. Why bring this up in front of Nathaniel? Was she trying to stir up trouble? Or was she hoping to make Nathaniel jealous?

If that was her plan, she had severely misjudged Nathaniel—he wasn't the type to care about such things. Perhaps realizing this herself, Isabella grew quieter for the rest of the ride.

By the time Nathaniel pulled up to the house, Isabella had fallen asleep.

Despite her dislike for Isabella, Eleanor had to admit she was beautiful. With her eyes closed, Isabella looked serene, her delicate frame evoking a sense of vulnerability that stirred a protective instinct.

As Eleanor debated whether to wake her, Nathaniel walked over and opened the back door. Without hesitation, he lifted Isabella into his arms.

The movement stirred Isabella slightly. She opened her eyes, still half-asleep, and murmured, "Nate." Then, instinctively, she wrapped her arms around his neck, settling comfortably in his embrace before drifting back to sleep.

Their actions were seamless, as if they had done this countless times before.",
###Chapter8

Eleanor sat frozen in the passenger seat. She thought she had built up enough emotional armor, but the sharp pang in her chest told her otherwise. It felt like invisible claws were tearing at her insides.

A memory surfaced - from when she had just returned to the Thompson family. It had been raining that day. Margaret had come to pick her and Isabella up from school personally. But on the way home, their car had skidded while avoiding another vehicle, crashing into a guardrail. Eleanor had hit her head hard against the window, blacking out.

Before losing consciousness, she had seen Margaret rush past her to Isabella's side. The way Margaret had clung to Isabella, sobbing hysterically, was etched in Eleanor's mind. That was the moment she realized - they had only taken her back because of shared blood. But Isabella would always be their true daughter.

Eleanor had tried to bury that memory deep, knowing it only brought pain. But now it resurfaced with a vengeance. Only this time, it wasn't her mother holding Isabella - it was her husband.

She didn't know how long she sat there. Finally, she stepped out of the car. Thunder rumbled ominously overhead, and rain began pouring down in sheets.

Eleanor hurried toward the house, but Nathaniel had parked quite a distance from the entrance. By the time she reached the door, she was soaked to the bone.

Upstairs, lights were on - one in Isabella's room, another in Nathaniel's study. He hadn't even noticed she hadn't come in yet.

Eleanor stood still for a moment, confirming this. Then, with leaden legs, she trudged upstairs. Her phone screen lit up suddenly - an unknown number.

As she stared at the screen, something clicked in her mind. She froze mid-step. Just as she debated answering, the call ended.

Strangely, when the screen went dark, Eleanor felt a wave of relief. But it was short-lived - the phone rang again immediately.

This time, she knew who it was. Without hesitation, she answered.

"Elle."

The nickname caught her off guard. It had been so long since anyone called her that. "It's me," the voice continued. "Julian."

"Oh," Eleanor managed softly. "Are you... back in the country?"

"Not yet," Julian chuckled. "But I will be soon. My flight's the day after tomorrow. Think you could pick me up?"

Eleanor hesitated.

"Too much trouble?" Julian picked up on her pause. "It's fine. I can manage. It's just... after all this time, I'd like you to be the first person I see."

"I'm married," Eleanor blurted out.

"I know," Julian replied smoothly. "To that Carter guy, right? Amity Group's pretty famous. Even overseas, I heard about the CEO's wedding."

Eleanor fell silent.

After a beat, Julian asked softly, "Elle, are you happy?"",
###Chapter9

"Eleanor, are you doing well?" The words lingered in Eleanor's mind like an echo she couldn't shake. It had been so long since anyone had asked her that question—so long that she'd even stopped asking herself. The answer was obvious, yet she replied without hesitation, "I'm doing fine."

"That's good, then," Julian responded, his voice calm but distant. After a brief pause, the line went quiet.

"If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now," Eleanor said, her tone flat.

"Alright," Julian agreed.

Just as her finger hovered over the end call button, his voice cut through the silence again. "I'm sorry for leaving without saying goodbye back then. I've thought about you a lot these past years while I've been abroad." He paused, then added softly, "It's getting late. You should get some rest."

With that, Julian hung up.

Eleanor stood frozen on the stairs, her phone still pressed to her ear. Minutes passed before she finally lowered her hand and turned to head back to her room. That night, Nathaniel didn't come to her. Yet, sleep eluded her. Julian's call had stirred something deep within her, and her dreams were restless.

In her dreams, she was back in the early days after returning to the Harrison family. Edward and Margaret had thrown a lavish welcome party for her, but the guests' smiles were hollow. The whispers and sneers of her so-called peers echoed in her ears. They mocked her for her "country roots," laughing at her supposed ignorance of high society's luxuries.

The memory of the rooftop pool at the banquet hall came flooding back. A group of them had lured her to the edge, pretending to befriend her. Then, with cruel laughter, they pushed her in. The water had swallowed her whole, filling her lungs as she struggled to surface. The suffocation, the panic—it was all too vivid, even now.

Her eyes snapped open, her chest heaving. The unfamiliar yet familiar surroundings of Nivis Villa disoriented her for a moment. She blinked, grounding herself in the present. The dream was gone, but its weight lingered.

Eleanor glanced at the clock. There was still over an hour until her usual wake-up time, but sleep was out of the question. She lay there, staring at the ceiling, lost in thought. Then, the bedroom door swung open.

She turned her head sharply, her heart skipping a beat.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable. For a brief moment, surprise flickered in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by his usual composure. "Ten minutes. I'll be waiting downstairs," he said, his tone cold and commanding.

Then, he turned and left.

Eleanor frowned, confusion knitting her brows. "For what?" she called after him.

"The hospital. Didn't Victoria tell you?" Nathaniel's voice carried a hint of impatience as it drifted back to her.

Her hands clenched into fists. Of course, Victoria knew her well. She knew Eleanor would never willingly agree to a medical check-up, so she'd enlisted Nathaniel to force her hand. But when had they even spoken about this? Eleanor didn't know, and she didn't care to find out.

"Eight minutes," Nathaniel's voice cut through her thoughts again.

This time, Eleanor didn't look at him. She simply lay back down, pulling the covers over her. "I'm not going."

Silence followed. She knew her refusal had displeased him, but she didn't care. Before she could close her eyes and try to drift back to sleep, Nathaniel reappeared in the doorway. He strode over to her bed, his movements sharp and deliberate, and yanked her upright.

"I said I'm not going!" she snapped, pulling away from him. "Stop pretending you care, Nathaniel! You don't even want a child!"

His jaw tightened, but he didn't respond. Instead, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her out of bed, his grip firm and unyielding. Eleanor resisted, but it was no use. Nathaniel's determination was as cold and unrelenting as ever.

Today's Bonus Offer",
###Chapter10

To the outside world, Eleanor Thompson appeared as a stoic and uninteresting individual. Rarely did she show any emotional outbursts. But now, she was like a cornered beast, shedding her usual calm demeanor and revealing her claws.

Yet, this small act of defiance meant nothing to Nathaniel Carter. He didn’t even bother to respond. Instead, he lifted her from the bed and began to dress her himself.

Eleanor tried to push him away, but the disparity in their strength was too great. In the end, he effortlessly dragged her downstairs.

"Mr. and Mrs. Carter..." Grace Harper, who was already downstairs, paused in surprise at the sight of their struggle.

Seeing her, Eleanor quickly composed herself and stopped resisting. She then followed Nathaniel out the door.

After driving for a while, Eleanor gradually calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, she turned to Nathaniel and said, "There's no need for us to go to the hospital. I'll explain everything to Mom myself. I know you're busy with work, so you don’t have to take me back. Just drop me off somewhere convenient for you."

Silence followed her words.

With just the two of them in the car, there was no way Nathaniel could have missed what she said. Yet, he didn’t respond at all. He drove at a steady speed, showing no signs of slowing down.

After more than two years of marriage, Eleanor had come to understand Nathaniel to some extent. His current attitude made one thing clear—he wasn’t having a discussion with her. It was a command. He knew perfectly well why she was so opposed to getting pregnant and why every mention of having a child caused her mood to shift. Yet, that didn’t matter to him.

Why? The reason was simple—he didn’t care.

To him, marriage and having children were just natural steps in life. As his wife, Eleanor was expected to fulfill that duty.

There had been a time when Eleanor had held out hope despite knowing that Nathaniel didn’t love her. She thought a child would be enough—with a child, she could have a family.

But even that simple wish was beyond her reach.

Victoria Sinclair was right. Over a year had passed since the incident. Everyone had moved on, and some had even forgotten about it. However, the same couldn’t be said for Eleanor—she would never forget.

Soon, they arrived at the hospital. Eleanor pushed her emotions aside and got out of the car calmly. Nathaniel had already arranged an appointment in advance, and it wasn’t long before they met with the doctor, Dominic Reeves.

"Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Carter," Dominic greeted them, his tone polite but not overly obsequious. Nathaniel gave a slight nod and looked at Eleanor. However, she didn’t acknowledge him as she sat down.

Dominic took her pulse. Before long, he frowned and asked, "Mrs. Carter, have you been pregnant before?"

"Yes."

"How far along were you when the pregnancy was terminated?"

Eleanor turned to look at Nathaniel as Dominic asked the question. Upon noticing her gaze, Nathaniel pressed his lips together.

It was clear he had forgotten.

Eleanor wasn’t surprised. She even managed a slight smile. Then, she turned back to Dominic and answered, "82 days."

"Hmm... It's not too far along, but still, you aren’t in good shape health-wise. You’ll need proper care and nutrition. Have you been taking any medicine lately?"

"Yes. Birth control pills," Eleanor answered plainly.",
###Chapter11

Even Dominic, with his years of medical expertise, looked momentarily stunned by Eleanor's revelation. Most of his patients were eager to start families, so hearing that Eleanor had been on birth control was unexpected. His eyes flicked to Nathaniel, who stood rigid, his expression darkening. Clearly, Nathaniel hadn’t known about the pills.

Dominic quickly regained his composure. After a brief pause, he advised, "You should stop taking the birth control pills immediately. I’ll prescribe something else for now. Your health needs to be your priority."

Eleanor nodded, accepting the prescription without argument. "Thank you," she said quietly, her voice steady. Without another word, she turned and walked out of the room, not sparing Nathaniel a glance. He followed her, his jaw tight.

Outside the hospital, Eleanor moved to hail a cab, assuming Nathaniel wouldn’t bother with her. But his hand shot out, gripping her arm firmly. "Get in the car," he commanded, his tone icy, his eyes like shards of glass.

"I’ll take a cab," she replied, pulling her arm free.

"Eleanor Thompson," he said, his voice low and dangerous, "I’m not asking. Get in the car." His expression darkened further, and she knew arguing in public would only draw unwanted attention. Reluctantly, she slid into the passenger seat.

Before she could even fasten her seatbelt, Nathaniel hit the gas, the car lurching forward. Eleanor braced herself, her lips pressing into a thin line. Once she secured the belt, she turned to him. "If you’re going to drive like a maniac, I’ll get out."

"Why were you on birth control?" he demanded, ignoring her comment.

"Because I don’t want to get pregnant," she answered bluntly, meeting his gaze head-on.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other, the tension thick. The car came to a stop at a red light, and the silence stretched, broken only by the faint ticking of the clock on the dashboard.

Nathaniel’s hands tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles whitening before he forced himself to relax. When he finally spoke, his voice was eerily calm. "I don’t plan on being childless."

"I know," Eleanor said with a soft, bitter laugh. "And I’m well aware the Carter family wouldn’t accept a daughter-in-law who refuses to have children. But... it’s not like that affects you, does it?"

He frowned, clearly confused by her words. "What are you talking about?"

Eleanor leaned back in her seat, her tone almost casual. "There are plenty of women who’d jump at the chance to carry your child, Nathaniel. If you’re willing, that is."

He let out a short, humorless laugh. "And what? You’d adopt those children and raise them?"

"Sure," she replied, shrugging. "I don’t mind."

His smile vanished, replaced by a cold, calculating expression. When the light turned green, he drove on in silence. For a moment, Eleanor thought he might have accepted her suggestion. But then he spoke, his voice firm and final.

"Let me make this clear, Eleanor. Only my wife will carry my children. A bastard child will never bear the Carter name." He glanced at her, his gaze piercing. "You married into this family. It’s your duty to continue the bloodline. You don’t get a say in this."

His words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding. Eleanor turned to look out the window, her jaw clenched. Nathaniel’s tone left no room for argument, but the fire in her eyes suggested this was far from over.",
###Chapter12

In the end, Nathaniel didn't take Eleanor to the mansion. After making his intentions clear, he left her at a random street corner. Before she could even steady herself, his black Porsche had already disappeared into the distance. This didn’t surprise her, but she couldn’t help clenching her fists, her nails digging into her palms. The sharp pain was a reminder—never to hold onto hope when it came to Nathaniel.

Since she was already out, Eleanor decided to do some shopping. But luck wasn’t on her side. As soon as she stepped into the mall, she ran into someone she despised.

"Well, well, if it isn’t Mrs. Carter!" Olivia sneered, her grin widening. "What a surprise! I didn’t think someone as refined as you would be caught dead in a place like this."

Olivia, Isabella’s best friend, had always been the one to torment Eleanor the most. While others had backed off after Eleanor married Nathaniel, Olivia only grew more vicious. 

Eleanor tried to walk past her, but Olivia blocked her path. "Where are you rushing off to? Why don’t you join me for some shopping? Or are you too good for that?"

Eleanor met her gaze coldly. "I’m afraid I don’t have time for this."

Olivia smirked. "Oh, do you have a secret date? Or is it your lover you’re hiding?"

Eleanor’s voice was calm but sharp. "Ms. Davenport, you’re an educated woman, aren’t you?"

Olivia blinked, caught off guard. "Of course I am! What’s that supposed to mean?"

"Then you should know the consequences of spreading lies. Did your parents and teachers raise you to slander others?" Eleanor’s tone was steady, her eyes locked on Olivia’s.

Olivia’s face flushed with anger. "Eleanor Thompson, you have no right to talk down to me! You’re just a nobody from the countryside!"

"I didn’t start this," Eleanor replied coolly. "But since you’re blocking my way, I’ll finish it. Got it?"

Olivia’s face turned red, but before she could retort, Isabella hurried over from a nearby store. She grabbed Olivia’s arm, her voice trembling. "Olivia, please, don’t fight with Eleanor."

Isabella avoided Eleanor’s gaze, her timid demeanor making it seem like she was the victim of Eleanor’s cruelty. Olivia, however, wasn’t having it. "I can’t stand her! She’s so smug, and she owes everything to you, Isabella! You’re the one who gave up Nathaniel for her!"

"Stop it," Isabella whispered, tugging at Olivia’s arm. She kept her head low as she shuffled toward Eleanor. "I’m sorry, Eleanor. Olivia can be... impulsive. But she’s a good person. Please don’t take it to heart. If it’s not enough, I’ll apologize on her behalf."

This only fueled Olivia’s anger. "Why are you apologizing? She’s the one who started it!"

Isabella’s voice quivered as she continued, "Olivia, please. Eleanor isn’t well. She was at the hospital this morning..."

Eleanor’s eyes widened in surprise. How did Isabella know about her hospital visit? Then it hit her—Nathaniel must have told her.

"The hospital?" Olivia paused, a wicked grin spreading across her face. "Oh, I see. Mrs. Carter must have been at the fertility clinic, right? Poor Nathaniel. Not only did he marry a woman he doesn’t love, but she’s also *barren*!"

Eleanor’s heart sank, but she refused to let it show. She straightened her shoulders, her voice steady. "You’re wrong, Olivia. But even if I were, it’s none of your business. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have better things to do than entertain your petty insults."

With that, Eleanor turned and walked away, leaving Olivia fuming and Isabella staring after her with an unreadable expression.",
###Chapter13

Eleanor let out a sharp laugh at Olivia's snide remark. Olivia's smug expression faltered, her lips curling into a frown. "What's so funny?" she snapped.

"Ms. Davenport, maybe you should pick up a book or two. Being both rude and clueless? That's a dangerous combination for someone who already looks like a villain in a bad soap opera." Eleanor, who had been holding back earlier, now let her sarcasm fly freely.

Olivia's face darkened. As Eleanor tried to step past her, Olivia lunged forward, grabbing a fistful of Eleanor's hair. "How dare you, you backwater nobody! Who do you think you are, marrying into the Carters? You're nothing but a gold digger!"

But before Olivia could finish her tirade, Eleanor's hand shot out, delivering a crisp slap across her face. Olivia staggered back, stunned, then let out a shriek and launched herself at Eleanor.

In the chaos that followed, Isabella stumbled into a glass wall—whether she was accidentally shoved by Olivia or deliberately threw herself into it was unclear. She collapsed to the floor, clutching her arm as blood dripped down her sleeve. Passersby gasped, and Isabella burst into tears, her wide eyes fixed on Eleanor. "Eleanor, it hurts!" she whimpered.

"Eleanor!" A voice rang out from the end of the corridor. Before Isabella could get up, Margaret rushed over, her face pale with worry. "What happened to Isabella? Is she okay?"

"Mom," Isabella called weakly.

Margaret didn't wait for Eleanor's explanation. She immediately knelt beside Isabella, her hands trembling as she inspected the bloodied bandage on her daughter's arm. "How did this happen? Does it hurt?" she cried.

"The doctor stitched it up. It doesn't hurt much," Isabella said, forcing a smile. "Mom, why are you back so early? I thought you weren't coming home until next week. Where's Dad?"

"I came back early because I was worried about you. Your father's still away on business." Margaret's frown deepened as she examined the wound. "I should've come back sooner. You've been in the hospital twice in the past two weeks!"

Then, Margaret turned to Eleanor, her expression hardening. But before she could speak, Isabella cut in. "Mom, it's not Eleanor's fault. I hurt myself because I wasn't paying attention. Really."

"Don't defend her, Isabella. I've heard everything. Eleanor, how could you get into a brawl at the mall? You're Mrs. Carter now! Your behavior reflects on the Carters and the Thompsons. When are you going to shed those country habits?"

Eleanor sat silently through the tirade, her fists clenched at her sides. She was used to Margaret's favoritism, but the constant digs at her upbringing still stung. She knew better than to argue back—Margaret would only accuse her of being rebellious and blame it on her "country roots."

"Since you're here, I'll take my leave," Eleanor said finally, standing up. "I have work to do, and I can't look after Isabella properly. Please take her home today."

Without waiting for a response, Eleanor turned and walked away, her shoulders stiff with suppressed anger.",
###Chapter14

"Isabella!" Margaret rushed up to Eleanor and grabbed her hand. "Eleanor, are you mad at me? I meant well. It was my fault for accidentally hurting myself. Don't worry. I'll move out of your house. I won't be a bother to you and Nathaniel."

"Great," Eleanor agreed without hesitation.

Margaret frowned at her response while Isabella looked surprised.

"I'll leave now." Without a care, Eleanor removed her hand from Isabella's grip to leave.

Isabella's tearful voice could be heard from behind. "Mom, what do I do? Eleanor probably hates me now..."

For a moment, Eleanor had the urge to turn around and admit that she indeed hated Isabella, but she quickly struck down the thought. She didn't want to be slapped by Margaret again.

At first, Eleanor could not believe that her parents would play favorites against their biological daughter. She soon realized that they felt ashamed of her past in the countryside. They refused to accept the rural mindset of their daughter. Isabella was closer to the image of their ideal daughter—highly educated, demure, and lovable. Eleanor was nothing but a failure in the eyes of her parents.

When Eleanor reached home, she saw that the Carter family had sent some staff over to pack up Isabella's belongings before she even had the chance to get Grace to do so. Eleanor allowed them to proceed.

Grace was the one who cried, "What's going on? Why is Ms. Isabella moving out after she's settled down here?"

The movers did not answer her questions, so she helplessly turned to Eleanor for an explanation, but Eleanor had retired to her bedroom.

As Eleanor had missed the draft deadline by a few days, she had no choice but to lock herself in her room for the entire afternoon to work on it. It was past dinner time when she emailed out the draft.

Nathaniel had not come home for dinner, but she wasn't surprised. She was about to have dinner alone when he called.

He announced, "I'll send someone to pick you up."

Confused, she asked, "Where to?"

"We're going to your parents'."

A bad feeling arose within her. She blurted out, "I'm not going."

After a pause, Nathaniel hung up without another word. Clearly, he was giving out an order to Eleanor instead of asking for her opinion.

Eleanor held her fist. She decided against going downstairs for dinner and returned to her bedroom. She stayed there and refused to open up when Nathaniel's assistant, Lucas Grant, arrived.

Lucas could not break down the door. He had no choice but to ask for Nathaniel's instructions.

Eleanor wondered what Nathaniel had said to Lucas, as Lucas left the villa immediately.

She sat in front of her computer. Though she acted tough just now, she could not help but let out a sigh of relief when Lucas's footsteps faded.

Nathaniel came home an hour later, just when Eleanor was ready to wash up and go to bed.

She belatedly realized she had red marks and bruises around her waist when she removed her clothes.

They probably happened during her fight with Olivia earlier that day.

The bedroom door flung open without warning when she was observing the marks across her waist.",
###Chapter15

Eleanor gasped, instinctively pulling the blanket tighter around her. She turned to face Nathaniel with a scowl, but his expression was equally displeased. The tension between them was palpable, more like adversaries than a married couple.

"Leave. I'm going to sleep," she finally said, breaking the silence.

To her surprise, Nathaniel didn't argue. He turned on his heel, but before exiting, he tossed over his shoulder, "Keep your schedule clear tomorrow afternoon."

"Why?" she demanded, her voice sharp.

He didn't answer.

Eleanor's jaw tightened. "If this is about making me apologize to Isabella, forget it."

Nathaniel paused, confirming her suspicion.

Her fists clenched.

"Eleanor, she's your sister," he said flatly.

"I don't have a sister. And she tripped on her own. Why should I apologize for something I didn't do?"

"Did you do anything to help her?" he shot back, a smirk playing on his lips. "With your position, how could you stoop so low?"

"Right, because I'm just some backwater nobody, aren't I?" she sneered. "You're right. Ten years in the countryside made me rough around the edges. I'll never be the refined lady you wanted."

"Mr. Carter, I bet you're regretting this marriage now. After all, who'd want a crude woman to carry their heir?"

His eyes hardened. "What are you implying?"

"Exactly what you think," Eleanor shot back, holding his gaze. "But I won't apologize to Isabella. If you're so ashamed of me, you can—"

"Eleanor Thompson, choose your next words carefully," Nathaniel interrupted, his voice low and dangerous.

She fell silent, her fists trembling.

Nathaniel gave her one last look before storming out, slamming the door so hard the walls shook.

Eleanor unclenched her fists and sank into the chair by her desk. She opened the drawer and pulled out a document—divorce papers, the title glaring back at her. She flipped to the last page, where her signature already sat, waiting. But she couldn't bring herself to hand it over.

She knew Nathaniel despised her. Their marriage was nothing more than a duty to fulfill his late father's wishes. He didn't love Isabella either, but their childhood bond was enough for him to defend her.

As for Eleanor, she had no place in his life—not even as a friend. Yet, despite it all, she still loved him. She couldn't forget the night he'd saved her from drowning at that fateful dinner party.

But now, as she stared at the divorce papers, she wondered if love was enough to keep them together.",
###Chapter16

In the end, Eleanor decided to keep the divorce papers tucked away.

The next morning, she drove herself to the Harrison estate without waiting for Nathaniel. The estate was nestled on the edge of downtown Silvercrest, a luxurious area known for its sprawling villas and manicured gardens.

As soon as Eleanor parked her car, a maid spotted her. Instead of greeting her, the maid hurried back into the house.

Eleanor noticed the maid scurrying inside but paid no mind. She stepped out of the car, carrying a few carefully chosen gifts. After all, she was there to apologize.

The moment Eleanor entered the house, the same maid who had rushed in earlier appeared with a polite smile. "Ms. Eleanor, you're here."

Eleanor nodded in acknowledgment.

"Eleanor!" Isabella's voice rang out as she descended the stairs in a flowing white dress, her curls bouncing over her shoulders. She looked radiant, her innocent demeanor perfectly intact.

Though Isabella called out to Eleanor, her eyes darted behind her, searching. A flicker of surprise crossed her face when she realized Eleanor had come alone. "Eleanor, did you drive here by yourself?"

"Yes," Eleanor replied, her gaze lingering on Isabella's arm. "How's your arm? Feeling better?"

"I'm fine..." Isabella quickly composed herself, then shifted the conversation. "Mom's upstairs. She's... still a bit upset. Do you want to see her?"

"Of course," Eleanor agreed without hesitation, catching Isabella off guard.

Before Isabella could say more, Eleanor had already walked past her.

Margaret was in the second-floor conservatory, arranging a bouquet of roses when Eleanor approached. "Mom." Margaret merely grunted in response.

"I brought you something. It's downstairs," Eleanor said, ignoring Margaret's cold demeanor. "I acted impulsively yesterday. But since I don't know the full story, I had someone retrieve the mall's security footage."

Isabella, who had followed closely behind, overheard Eleanor's words as she entered the conservatory. Her expression shifted, and she rushed to Eleanor's side. "Eleanor, why did you ask for the security footage?"

"You were hurt, weren't you? It's only right we get to the bottom of it."

"But I'm fine now. There's no need to make a big deal out of what happened yesterday," Isabella said, her eyes darting toward Margaret.

This time, Margaret didn't side with Isabella. She turned to Eleanor and asked, "Where's the footage?"

"They'll send it to me soon."

"Mom!" Isabella hurried over to Margaret. "Let's not make this a big thing. Look, I'm perfectly fine. I don't want to cause any trouble."

"It's no trouble at all," Eleanor interjected. "Getting the footage isn't a hassle."

Isabella fell silent, her gaze fixed on Eleanor. "Eleanor, do you suspect me?"

Tears welled up in her eyes as she pressed on. "You think I hurt myself on purpose, don't you?"

"I just want to know the truth. But the way you're reacting makes it seem like you're admitting to something."

Isabella didn't break eye contact. Suddenly, she took a deep breath and confessed, "You're right. I did hurt myself on purpose yesterday."

Her admission caught Eleanor off guard.

But Isabella quickly turned to Margaret, pleading, "Mom, yell at me if you want. I fell on purpose yesterday, but what choice did I have? Eleanor was arguing with Olivia. I couldn't stop either of them, and I was terrified someone would take photos and leak them to the media. That's why I did something so stupid. Mom, I was wrong."",
###Chapter17

"Oh, how could I ever blame you?" Margaret's voice softened as she took in Isabella's tear-streaked face. She pulled her adopted daughter closer. "Why would you do something so reckless? Thank heavens it's just your arm. What if you had damaged your face permanently?"

Isabella shook her head, her voice trembling. "I didn't know what else to do. I couldn't let Eleanor and Olivia come to blows..."

Margaret's gaze snapped to Eleanor, her expression hardening. "Look at what you've caused! You're the elder, yet Isabella had to step in! Have you no shame?"

"I never asked for her intervention."

Margaret's face darkened at Eleanor's calm response. "What did you just say? Do you realize what could have happened if Isabella hadn't stopped you? Fighting in public like some common street brawler! If this gets out, the Carters will be mortified! What will Nathaniel think of you now?"

Eleanor remained silent, her expression unreadable.

Margaret's hands trembled with rage. "What's that look supposed to mean? Are you defying me? Get out this instant and kneel in the living room!"

Eleanor didn't move.

Isabella quickly stepped forward. "Mother, please, I'm sure Eleanor didn't mean to—"

"Stay out of this," Margaret snapped, her eyes never leaving Eleanor. "Do I have no authority over you anymore? Have you forgotten your place? I knew this would happen! We never should have brought you back!"

The greenhouse fell into a heavy silence as Margaret's words hung in the air. She immediately regretted her outburst, realizing she had revealed too much.

Eleanor, however, simply turned and walked out without a word.

Margaret opened her mouth to call her back but stopped short when she saw Eleanor kneel in the center of the grand living room.

Isabella tried again. "Mother, please, don't make her—"

"Don't defend her," Margaret interrupted sharply. "She's grown too comfortable, too arrogant! Unlike you, she was raised in the countryside. She has no manners, no sense of propriety. That's why she needs to be disciplined!"

Isabella fell silent, her eyes darting to Eleanor. After a moment, she moved to Margaret's side, gently massaging her shoulders. "Mother, please calm down. The doctor said your blood pressure—"

Margaret patted Isabella's hand, her expression softening. "I know, dear."

Once Margaret had settled, Isabella approached Eleanor. She crouched beside her, her voice low and sweet. "Eleanor, you don't have to do this. Why don't you just apologize? She'll forgive you. You're her daughter, after all."

Eleanor didn't respond, her gaze fixed on the floor.

Isabella's smile didn't waver. She glanced around the room, then leaned in closer, her whisper barely audible. "Eleanor, if I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face. By the way, I know you've been wondering where Nathaniel was the day you lost the baby."

She paused, savoring the moment. "He was at an auction in Leverton. Remember that necklace I wore on my birthday? He won it for me there."

###Chapter18  
Eleanor clenched her fist, her gaze locking onto Isabella, who offered her a sweet, innocent smile. After a tense moment, Eleanor burst into laughter, her voice sharp as she spat, "You're nothing but a bastard child."  

Everyone had their weakness, and Eleanor had struck a nerve. The word "bastard" was a forbidden topic for Isabella, whose face instantly darkened with rage. Without thinking, she shoved Eleanor to the ground, her anger boiling over. It wasn’t until the act was done that she realized her mistake.  

But it was too late.  

Margaret’s shocked gasp echoed through the room. "What did you just do?"  

Isabella froze, her arms awkwardly outstretched as she tried to explain. But Margaret brushed past her, ignoring her completely.  

Eleanor, however, was quick to recover. She stood up with a chuckle, brushing herself off. "I'm fine," she said, her smile dripping with sarcasm. It was a mirror of Isabella’s usual tactics, but with a sharper edge.  

Margaret missed the sarcasm, her glare fixed on Isabella. "Mom, it wasn’t what it looked like—" Isabella began, but her words were cut off by a maid’s announcement.  

"Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Carter is here."  

Tears immediately welled up in Isabella’s eyes, and as Nathaniel entered the room, he was met with the sight of her sobbing.  

"Enough, wipe your tears," Margaret instructed Isabella before turning to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, you’re here."  

"Hello, Mrs. Bennett," he greeted with a nod, his sharp gaze scanning the room. "What happened?"  

"Oh, it was nothing. Eleanor... she just slipped," Margaret said, clearly covering for Isabella.  

Eleanor raised an eyebrow, her voice calm but laced with irony. "Did I, Mom?"  

"Yes," Margaret insisted, her tone firm.  

The scene reminded Eleanor of the child she had lost, and how her family had dismissed it as an accident. Her smile faltered as she murmured, "If you say so."  

But Isabella, ever the victim, broke down further. "No, Mom, I... I pushed her, but..."  

Margaret moved to comfort her, but Nathaniel’s icy voice cut through the room. "I’m sure Isabella wouldn’t hurt anyone without a good reason."  

His words were firm, his gaze piercing as it landed on Eleanor. The faint smile on her pale face vanished completely. Her blood ran cold, her arms trembling at her sides, but her eyes remained steely as she met his gaze.  

At that moment, a maid stepped forward. "Mrs. Bennett, I heard Ms. Eleanor and Ms. Isabella arguing earlier."  

Margaret turned to the maid. "What did you say?"  

Nathaniel’s harsh gaze shifted to the maid, who kept her head bowed. "I heard Ms. Eleanor call Ms. Isabella a... bastard child."  

The room fell silent, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Eleanor stood tall, her defiance unwavering, while Isabella’s tears continued to flow. Nathaniel’s expression darkened, his loyalty to Isabella clear, but Eleanor’s resolve didn’t waver.  

The game was far from over.",
###Chapter19

Taking into account the maid's testimony and Isabella's hesitation, Margaret weighed her options and made a decision. She turned to Eleanor and snapped, "Eleanor Thompson!"

She would have slapped Eleanor right then if Nathaniel weren't present. She continued to berate Eleanor, "Isabella is your younger sister, and we Thompsons see her as our daughter! Who do you think you are? And what do you take this family for?"

Eleanor didn't respond. After glancing at the tearful Isabella, she turned to Nathaniel, who was staring at her with a grim expression. Naturally, he was upset to hear that his wife had made such crude remarks about others. He must have been appalled that his childhood friend had been insulted in such a manner.

What devastated Eleanor the most was Nathaniel's unwavering trust in Isabella. He believed Isabella had every right to lash out at others. Yet, he never bothered to ask why Eleanor had argued with Olivia at the mall—it simply wasn't worth his time.

Nathaniel would never stand up for her. All he would do was drag her to the Thompson residence and force her to apologize to Isabella.

Eleanor suddenly laughed. Staring at Margaret, she confessed in a calm, clear voice, "Yes, I said that. And I wasn't wrong."

Her words stunned everyone. Margaret was trembling with rage.

Nathaniel warned her, "Eleanor."

Eleanor locked eyes with Isabella. She declared, "Isabella is a bastard child you adopted. I know she fits your idea of the perfect daughter, but I'm sorry to tell you that I'm your flesh and blood. Even if you refuse to acknowledge me, that doesn't change the fact that I'm your daughter. I carry your DNA."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "What nonsense is this?"

"That's not nonsense," she replied, eerily calm. "Am I wrong?"

"Apologize to your mother and Isabella," Nathaniel ordered, avoiding her question.

"Why should I apologize?" she shot back. "And who are you to order me around?"

"Eleanor Thompson!" Nathaniel clenched his jaw, a rare display of fury. He gripped her wrist so tightly it hurt, but the pain in her heart was far worse.

Eleanor had long known that no one in Coppersville would take her side. She might have returned to her biological family, but they never truly accepted her. Nathaniel was no different.

She laughed again and pulled her hand free. Then, without hesitation, she walked away.

"Eleanor Thompson!" Nathaniel called after her, but she didn't look back or stop.

Eleanor drove straight back to the villa she shared with Nathaniel. His car followed closely behind.

Nathaniel arrived at her bedroom door just in time to see her pulling the divorce papers from the drawer.

She handed them to him. "Please sign."

His eyes skimmed the bold header. His expression darkened. "What are you doing?"

"Can't you read?" she chuckled softly. "Should I read it out loud for you?"

Nathaniel didn't respond, and Eleanor's smile faded. She shoved the papers into his hands. "Nathaniel Carter, let's get a divorce."

###Chapter20

Eleanor declared her desire for a divorce, but Nathaniel remained impassive. He glanced at her briefly before taking the documents. As he flipped through the pages, his eyes landed on her signature at the end. A low chuckle escaped his lips.

Before Eleanor could decipher his reaction, Nathaniel tore the papers in half. Her heart skipped a beat, but she quickly composed herself. "Mr. Carter, if you're dissatisfied with that copy, I can easily print another," she said coolly.

Without a word, he tossed the shredded papers into the trash and advanced toward her. Eleanor instinctively stepped back, her retreat halted only when the edge of the table pressed into her bruised waist. She winced but refused to cry out.

Nathaniel seized her wrist, his grip firm. "Eleanor, is this your idea of a threat? Or perhaps a pathetic attempt to manipulate me? Your cheap tactics sicken me."

His words stung more than she cared to admit. She remembered the disdain in his eyes, as if he had uncovered some hidden agenda. It wasn't just about defending Isabella anymore; his disgust seemed rooted in his belief that she was playing games.

Eleanor's heart raced, but she forced a smile. "I'm not threatening you, Nathaniel. I mean it." Her voice was steady, though her chest tightened.

He narrowed his eyes. "And what's the point of ending a marriage that never had love to begin with?"

"Is that all you think matters?" she shot back. "Or are you worried about Julian Whitaker?"

Nathaniel's mention of Julian caught her off guard. Her expression hardened, and she met his gaze head-on. "Is he your next target?" he sneered.

"Of course not," she replied sharply.

A realization dawned on her. "Did you go through my phone?" she demanded.

After their late-night call, Eleanor and Julian had exchanged numbers on WhatsApp. Their conversation had been innocent—just flight details and casual banter. Yet Nathaniel had twisted it into something sordid.

Before she could explain, he gripped her chin, forcing her to look at him. "Eleanor Thompson, I'm not as deceitful as you. You schemed your way into this marriage, and now you think you can just walk away? The Carter family isn't a revolving door."

He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a menacing whisper. "Stay away from Julian. If I catch you cheating, you'll regret it."

Nathaniel released her with a shove, sending her stumbling back into the table. This time, she bit her lip to stifle any sound of pain. Her eyes burned, but she refused to let him see her vulnerability.

Without another word, Nathaniel turned and strode out of the room, leaving Eleanor standing there, her fists clenched and her resolve stronger than ever.",
###Chapter21

Eleanor understood that look from Nathaniel all too well. It was a mixture of warning and contempt. Beneath his composed demeanor and gentle facade, she knew he had a heart as cold as ice.

Her gaze fell to the scattered papers on the floor - the contract he had ripped apart without a second glance. It had taken every ounce of her courage to present that agreement, but he hadn't even bothered to read it. Because to him, it didn't matter.

Her feelings didn't matter. Her decisions didn't matter.

Days passed without seeing Nathaniel. The next time she caught a glimpse of him was in a news article covering a high-profile business meeting in Crestwood City. The photograph showed him in a tailored charcoal suit, his chiseled features as striking as ever, with that faint, practiced smile playing on his lips.

Eleanor quickly closed the article. As she did, a notification popped up - her fans were asking about updates on her latest webcomic.

Being a webtoon artist wasn't exactly prestigious in high society circles. While art appreciation was considered essential among the elite, their tastes leaned heavily toward classical paintings and sculptures. Her romance-themed comics, despite their massive online following, were dismissed as frivolous entertainment.

After responding to some comments, Eleanor pulled out her drawing tablet. Just as she began sketching, her phone buzzed.

Julian's message appeared: "The Whitakers are throwing a welcome party for me tomorrow night. You're coming, right?"

Eleanor frowned. Before she could reply, another text came through: "After waiting five hours for you at the airport the other day, you owe me this much."

She hesitated. She had explicitly told Julian not to expect her at the airport. That was two days ago. Whether he truly waited that long was impossible to verify.

With a sigh, she typed: "Fine. I'll be there."

A digital invitation appeared on her screen. Eleanor noted the time and venue, then returned to her work. She timed her preparations perfectly, but just as she was about to leave, Nathaniel's car pulled into the driveway.

He stepped out, his eyes immediately zeroing in on her evening gown. "Where do you think you're going?"

Eleanor remained silent.

Ethan, her driver, waited by the front door. She reached for the car handle, but Nathaniel slammed it shut before she could open it. Her hand barely escaped being crushed.

"Inside. Now," Nathaniel commanded, his expression unreadable.

"No," Eleanor stood her ground.

Nathaniel produced a newspaper seemingly out of nowhere and flung it at her. It struck her shoulder before falling to the ground. The bold headline screamed alongside a photo of her recent altercation with Olivia.

"No? Do you want to become the city's newest scandal?" His voice was ice cold.

###Chapter22

Eleanor lowered her gaze, staring at the photograph in the magazine. In it, she looked disheveled and utterly humiliated. Yet, she remained calm. Without a word, she picked up the magazine and tossed it into the nearest trash bin. Then, she reopened the car door.

"Let's go," she told Ethan, her voice steady.

Ethan hesitated, glancing nervously at Nathaniel.

Nathaniel stood there, his expression unreadable, his eyes fixed on Eleanor.

Eleanor didn’t look at him. She didn’t even spare him a second glance as she rolled up the window.

As the window closed, Nathaniel turned and walked into the mansion without hesitation.

He wasn’t looking at her, but Eleanor’s eyes followed him, watching his retreating figure. She knew what his silence meant. He wasn’t going to accompany her to the gala. If she faced ridicule, she would face it alone.

But then again, Eleanor was used to being alone. She always had been.

The gala was far more extravagant than Eleanor had anticipated.

The Whitakers had never hidden Julian’s identity. They had simply been indifferent toward him, making it clear who their preferred heir was when they sent him abroad years ago.

Now that he was back, they were throwing this lavish celebration in his honor.

There had to be a reason behind it, but Julian hadn’t shared it with Eleanor. And she hadn’t asked. After all, it had nothing to do with her.

As she scanned the room for Julian, a voice called out, "Well, well, you actually showed up!"

Eleanor didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. She had no intention of engaging, but just as she was about to walk away, someone grabbed her arm.

"Why the rush? Didn’t you hear me?" Olivia’s voice was sharp. She rarely traveled alone, and as she gripped Eleanor’s arm, her two friends stepped forward, blocking Eleanor’s path.

Just like they had in high school.

Eleanor clenched her fists and turned to face Olivia. "Do you need something?" she asked, her tone calm but firm.

Under Eleanor’s gaze, Olivia faltered for a moment.

Eleanor wasn’t as strikingly beautiful as Isabella, but her porcelain skin seemed to glow against the deep crimson of her gown. Her eyes, though not large, were piercingly clear, giving her an air of quiet confidence as she stared down Olivia.

Olivia recovered quickly, scoffing. "What’s with the attitude? Why are you looking at me like that?"

Eleanor smiled faintly. "Are you trying to start something with me here?"

Her voice was calm, but her body was tense, her arms stiff at her sides. She looked ready to defend herself if necessary.

It was exactly what she’d done that day.

Olivia’s expression darkened. Just as she was about to retort, another voice cut through the tension. "Elle, you made it!"

Olivia’s face twisted at the sound of the voice.

At the same time, the coldness in Eleanor’s eyes softened.

"I was thinking of picking you up," Julian said, ignoring everyone else as he approached Eleanor.

"It’s a grand event," Eleanor replied. "I can manage on my own."",
###Chapter23

Eleanor looked serious, her expression suggesting she wasn't joking, but Julian chuckled.

"Come on. I brought back a pastry chef from Paris. I think you'll love his creations," he said, guiding Eleanor forward.

As the center of attention, most eyes at the gala were on Julian. He seemed unfazed, leading Eleanor to the dessert table and handing her a delicate mini cake. He looked like a child proudly showing off his favorite treat.

While Julian ignored the stares, Eleanor couldn't. She hesitated, then took the cake. "You're being too obvious," she murmured.

Julian raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"You're using me as a shield, aren't you?" Eleanor said, taking a small bite.

It had been a while since she last had cake. At Carter Manor, they had personal chefs, but cakes were rarely made. Among the elite, cakes were more for show than taste, a symbol of status rather than enjoyment.

For Eleanor, who had her first taste of cake at thirteen, it was a simple pleasure. The cream melted in her mouth, sweet with a hint of citrus. Her mood lifted slightly. Julian noticed her expression soften and smiled. "You haven't changed."

"So, you're bribing me with cake?" Eleanor asked, swallowing another bite.

Julian sighed. "As expected, I can't fool you."

Eleanor glanced at Olivia, who was glaring at her with clenched teeth. Ignoring her, Eleanor turned back to Julian. "The Davenports are trying to set you up with Olivia?"

"Yeah. She's one of the options."

Eleanor focused on her cake. "She seems interested in you."

"How so?"

"Our argument made headlines today. I'm not the only one being talked about. The fact that she still came shows she's clearly interested," Eleanor said calmly.

Julian laughed. "Is that so? Then, what about you? Why are you here?"

"My friend invited me," Eleanor replied, emphasizing the word "friend."

Julian understood her implication. He handed her another cake. "I know you're married," he said. "If you're happy, I'll support you. But Eleanor, you're not happy."

His words were firm, stripping away the facade Eleanor had built. She was at a loss for words. Just then, Julian glanced over her shoulder. "Your husband is here."

Eleanor's expression shifted. She turned quickly.

Julian was right. Nathaniel had arrived, Isabella on his arm.

Today's Bonus Offer",
###Chapter24

Eleanor's arm was linked with Nathaniel. They were both dressed in matching navy suits. At first glance, they appeared to be the ideal couple.

Eleanor felt as though she had been slapped by her own husband. Bitterness surged within her. Not even the cake could mask the bitter taste.

She didn't continue her conversation with Julian. Instead, she placed her cake on the table. Just as she turned to leave, Isabella spotted her.

"Eleanor!"

Her voice was loud and clear. It was impossible for Eleanor not to hear her. At the same time, Julian stepped in front of her, blocking her escape route.

Eleanor frowned at him.

Julian didn't look at her. He looked straight ahead and smiled, extending his hand. "Mr. Carter. I've heard a lot about you."

Nathaniel ignored Eleanor, who had turned her back to him, and shook Julian's hand. "Pleasure to meet you."

"Julian, long time no see!" Isabella greeted Julian excitedly. Her eyes were large and bright, shining almost as bright as the stars.

Julian just smiled at her politely.

Isabella didn't seem to mind his lackluster reaction. She turned her smile onto Eleanor. "Eleanor, why didn't you tell me you were coming here?

"I left late, so I thought I'd be the last one to arrive. I didn't expect to see Nathaniel at the door! Actually, why didn't you come with him?"

Isabella managed to explain why she had turned up with Nathaniel, but the main point was her last question.

Eleanor turned. "No particular reason," she replied simply, not inviting an answer.

Not even Isabella knew how to continue the conversation. But she brightened all the same and changed the subject. "Julian, you must have prepared all these cakes for Eleanor, didn't you? But I don't think she likes cake now. I've never seen Nathaniel get her any cake."

Isabella's acting was horrible. Eleanor could puke at the sight.

She had no intention of playing along with her act. "Sorry," she said. "I need to go to the bathroom." With that, she turned away.

Isabella was about to offer to accompany her, but Eleanor wasn't about to give her the chance. As soon as she finished speaking, she walked away.

Just then, someone grabbed her hand. Before she could react, the hand made its way around her shoulder.

"I'll go with you," Nathaniel said, calm yet firm.

Eleanor frowned.

However, Nathaniel's grip was tight. She had no way of freeing herself.

Before she was led away, Eleanor saw Julian scowling. In the end, she let herself be pulled away without a fight.",
    "When they reached the deserted hallway, Eleanor spoke firmly, "We're alone now. You can release me, Mr. Carter."

Nathaniel remained silent, his grip unyielding. His silence spoke volumes, but Eleanor had reached her limit. She wasn't going to endure this any longer.

When Nathaniel showed no signs of letting go, Eleanor dug her nails into his hand, pulling with all her strength. For a moment, she thought she might actually break his fingers.

The tension between them was palpable, each second stretching into an eternity. Eleanor's heart pounded as she struggled against his iron hold, her determination unwavering. She wasn't the same woman who had once silently endured his control.

Nathaniel's expression remained stoic, but a flicker of something—perhaps surprise or frustration—crossed his features. He had underestimated her resolve, and now he was paying the price.

Eleanor's breath came in short, sharp gasps as she continued to fight against his grip. She wasn't going to back down, not this time. The past was behind her, and she was determined to forge a new path, one where she was in control of her own destiny.

The hallway seemed to close in around them, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved emotions. Eleanor's mind raced, searching for a way out, a way to break free from the chains of her past and the man who still held so much power over her.

But even as she struggled, a part of her knew that this was just the beginning. The battle for her independence was far from over, and Nathaniel Carter was not a man who would easily let go.",
###Chapter25

Eleanor was struggling to break free from Nathaniel's grasp when he suddenly wrapped his other arm around her waist. With a firm pull, he yanked her closer, causing her to stumble into his chest. To anyone watching, it looked as though Eleanor had willingly thrown herself into his arms.

Her expression darkened instantly.

Before she could react, Nathaniel reached up and brushed his thumb lightly across her lips. Eleanor had just eaten a slice of cake, but she was certain there was nothing left on her lips. His gesture, however, made her feel uneasy.

Her frown deepened, and she opened her mouth to demand he release her, but Nathaniel spoke first. "Did you enjoy the cake?" he asked, his tone casual yet laced with something darker.

The question caught her off guard. Before she could respond, Nathaniel leaned down and captured her lips in a searing kiss.

The kiss was as commanding and possessive as the man himself. The faint sweetness of the cake lingered between them, but Nathaniel seemed to dislike it. His kiss grew more aggressive, his grip tightening around her waist until Eleanor was sure bruises were forming.

She pressed her palms against his chest, trying to push him away, but Nathaniel didn’t budge. To an outsider, it might have looked like a passionate embrace, but Eleanor knew better. Nathaniel wasn’t kissing her out of love or desire—he was using her to vent his frustration.

He was like a dog guarding its food. He could discard her, but no one else was allowed to take her away.

Eleanor remembered their last encounter vividly, the way they had fought, the way he had tried to control her. Realizing that struggling was futile, she stopped resisting and let her arms fall to her sides, her gaze cold and unwavering.

Just then, Nathaniel bit down hard on her lower lip.

Pain shot through her, and she felt the metallic tang of blood. A small gasp escaped her lips, and only then did Nathaniel release her.

Eleanor stepped back, one hand covering her mouth. She could feel the blood welling up from the wound. Her frown deepened, but before she could say anything, Nathaniel grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him.

His expression was as arrogant and disdainful as ever. "This is your final warning," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "Stay away from Julian Whitaker. Do you understand?"

Eleanor didn’t respond.

Nathaniel didn’t wait for an answer. He released her and walked away, leaving her standing there, her lip still bleeding.

After a moment, Eleanor wiped the blood from her lips, reapplied her lipstick, and returned to the party. Nathaniel was already mingling with the crowd, the center of attention as always. It didn’t surprise her. She didn’t bother approaching him. Instead, she turned and headed toward the exit.

Just as she was about to leave, she heard laughter coming from the side of the room. She glanced over and saw Olivia and her friends huddled together, laughing at something they were holding.

Eleanor was about to ignore them when she realized what they were holding—it was her sketchbook.

Her heart sank. She had left it in the lounge earlier, and now it was in the hands of the last people she wanted to see it.

Olivia looked up and caught Eleanor’s eye, a smug smile spreading across her face. "Oh, Eleanor," she called out, holding up the sketchbook. "We were just admiring your... *artwork*. It’s quite... *interesting*."

Eleanor’s jaw tightened, but she said nothing. She turned and walked away, her mind racing. She needed to get that sketchbook back before they could do any more damage.

But as she left the hall, she couldn’t shake the feeling that things were about to get much worse.",
###Chapter26

Eleanor stood frozen in place, her heart pounding. After a moment, she wiped the blood from her lips, reapplied her lipstick, and forced herself to return to the party.

Nathaniel was already surrounded by a group of admirers, his charismatic presence drawing everyone in. As always, he was the center of attention. Eleanor wasn't surprised. She didn't bother approaching him. Instead, she turned on her heel and made her way toward the exit.

Just as she was about to leave, a burst of laughter caught her attention. She glanced to the side and saw Olivia and her clique huddled together, giggling over something they were holding. Eleanor's stomach dropped. She recognized the object in their hands immediately—it was her sketchbook.

She hesitated, torn between confronting them and walking away. But before she could decide, Nathaniel appeared beside her. His hand reached out, gripping her arm firmly.

"Let's go," he said, his voice low and commanding.

Julian, who had been approaching Eleanor, froze mid-step. Nathaniel's sharp gaze flicked toward him, and Julian slowly withdrew, his expression unreadable.

Eleanor's heart raced as Nathaniel led her away, the sound of Olivia's laughter fading behind them. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. The sketchbook in Olivia's hands wasn't just a collection of drawings—it was a piece of her soul, and now it was in the hands of her enemies.

As they stepped into the cool night air, Eleanor glanced back at the party, her mind racing. She knew this wasn't over. The sketchbook was just the beginning.",
###Chapter27

Before Julian went abroad, he hadn't interacted much with Nathaniel. Therefore, he didn't know Nathaniel well at all. However, he could tell that Nathaniel's look was a warning.

Julian just laughed.

Nathaniel ignored him. After the glance, he left, pulling Eleanor along with him.

He slammed the car door shut loudly.

Eleanor could sense his anger. She didn't want to get into trouble, so she scooted away from him, still holding her sketchbook tightly.

However, Nathaniel reached out and snatched it out of her hold.

Eleanor's eyes widened in shock. "Give it back!" she said immediately.

This was the most animated Nathaniel had ever seen her in their two years of marriage. Eleanor pounced on him like an angry cat, trying to snatch the book away from him.

Nathaniel had only intended to take a look, but Eleanor's attitude made him frown. He grabbed both of her hands, trapping them so that she did not get a chance to snatch the sketchbook back.

"Let me go! That is mine!" Eleanor cried, even more agitated.

Nathaniel did not look at her. He lifted up the sketches to look at them.

Ethan had already started driving at this point. The lighting was dim in the car. Just as Nathaniel was about to turn on the lights, Eleanor suddenly leaned over and kissed him on the mouth.

This made Nathaniel pause. In his memory, this was the first time that Eleanor had initiated a kiss.

Because of her childhood, she'd always been dull and boring. She never initiated intimacy.

This was why Nathaniel was surprised when Eleanor kissed him suddenly.

While he was in a daze, Eleanor successfully grabbed the sketchbook. Then, she shoved it behind her, hiding it from him.

Nathaniel realized what she was trying to do. He looked at her darkly. "Give it back."

"It's mine," Eleanor replied.

Nathaniel did not have the patience to argue with her. Just as he was about to take the sketchbook forcefully, his phone rang.

Eleanor knew she wouldn't be able to resist him. She was already thinking about throwing the entire book out of the window when Nathaniel's call saved her.

She couldn't hear what was being said on the other end, but she saw Nathaniel's expression fall.

"I'll head over at once," he said before hanging up.

Then, he looked over at Ethan. "Stop the car."

The car stopped.

Without any explanation to Eleanor, Nathaniel opened the door and got out of the car.",

Eleanor only regained her composure when the car began moving again. She glanced out the window, but Nathaniel had already vanished from sight. Slowly, she lowered her gaze, her thoughts swirling.

Nathaniel didn't return home that night.

At dawn, Eleanor crept out of her room and switched off the stairway light before retreating to bed. An idea struck her, and she quickly pulled up Isabella's social media page. As expected, Isabella had posted a new update—a photo of herself at the hospital, accompanied by several praying emojis as the caption.

In the comments section, a few of their mutual friends inquired if she was alright. Isabella replied, "It's not me. Mrs. Montgomery Senior is hospitalized."

Clara?

It took Eleanor a moment to process that it was Clara Montgomery.

Today's Bonus Offer",
###Chapter28

Eleanor hesitated at the door, her hand poised to knock. She wasn't eager to please Clara, but she couldn't bear to disappoint Victoria either. Just as her knuckles were about to meet the wood, Clara's voice drifted through, sharp and cutting.

"You're such a delight, my dear. Far superior to your sister."

"Please, Grandma Clara, Eleanor has her qualities too."

"Qualities? She's nothing but a reckless, uncultured girl. Her recent actions have tarnished our family's name!" Eleanor's hand dropped to her side.

"If it weren't for Victoria's insistence, I would never have allowed Nathaniel to marry her in the first place!" Clara's voice rose. "Victoria must have done this deliberately. She knew I favored you, yet she pushed for Nathaniel to marry Eleanor. It's all just to vex me!"

Eleanor's heart sank. She turned away, her steps heavy as she retreated down the hallway. The weight of Clara's words pressed on her chest, making it hard to breathe. She had always known Clara's disdain, but hearing it so plainly was a different kind of pain.

As she reached the grand staircase, she paused, gripping the banister tightly. The opulent chandelier above cast a cold, glittering light, reflecting the icy atmosphere of the house. Eleanor's mind raced, torn between her duty to Victoria and her own self-respect.

She descended the stairs slowly, each step echoing in the vast emptiness of the mansion. The sound of her heels clicking against the marble floor seemed to mock her, a reminder of the gilded cage she found herself in.

Reaching the bottom, Eleanor glanced at the grand clock in the foyer. Time seemed to stretch endlessly in this house, each minute a test of her endurance. She squared her shoulders, determined not to let Clara's words break her. She had faced worse, and she would face this too.

As she walked towards the garden, the fresh air offered a brief respite. The scent of blooming roses filled her lungs, a stark contrast to the stifling atmosphere inside. Eleanor found a secluded bench and sat down, her thoughts swirling like the autumn leaves around her.

She knew she had to find a way to navigate this treacherous terrain, to protect herself while still honoring her commitments. But for now, she allowed herself a moment of quiet, a small rebellion against the chaos that surrounded her.",
###Chapter29

"Did you hear what I said, Nathaniel?" Clara's sharp tone cut through the sterile hospital air.

Eleanor froze at the door, her grip tightening on the lunchbox. So Nathaniel was here too.

His voice was calm, almost detached. "Grandma, we agreed not to discuss this."

"Agreements change when promises are broken!" Clara's voice rose, then broke into a fit of coughing.

"Grandma Clara!" Isabella rushed to her side, her movements graceful even in panic.

"I'm fine," Clara waved her off. "Nathaniel, you're my only grandson. I only want what's best for you. Your mother used the Amity Group shares to force your hand before, but now you're free. You should consider ending this farce with Eleanor."

Silence.

Eleanor didn't wait for Nathaniel's response. She pushed the door open, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. The room's occupants turned in unison.

Isabella had been gazing at Nathaniel with that familiar, adoring look. At Eleanor's entrance, her expression shifted to one of feigned concern. "Eleanor!" she exclaimed, rising gracefully.

Ignoring her, Eleanor placed the lunchbox on the table. "Victoria sent this. It's soup."

Clara's eyes narrowed. "What's with that attitude?"

Eleanor looked up, a tight smile on her lips. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me. If you're so reluctant, don't bother coming. I've never seen such disrespect—"

"Fine."

Before Clara could finish, Eleanor turned on her heel.

The room froze.

Nathaniel moved first, his hand closing around her wrist. "Eleanor," his voice was low, dangerous.

She met his gaze, unflinching. "What? I'm clearly not wanted here."

"Apologize to Grandma," he commanded, ignoring her words.

Eleanor's fists clenched at her sides. The air between them crackled with tension.

Isabella approached, her voice trembling with false concern. "Eleanor, please. Grandma Clara is in the hospital because of you. She's still your elder. You shouldn't—" Her voice broke, tears welling up in her eyes.

The contrast was stark - Isabella, the picture of delicate concern; Eleanor, cold and unyielding.

Clara scoffed. "Don't bother! I don't need her apologies. I just need her out of my sight!"

Eleanor's lips curved into a bitter smile. "Gladly." She turned to Nathaniel, her voice steady. "Let go of me."

For a moment, his grip tightened. Then, with a sharp exhale, he released her. Eleanor walked out, her head held high, the echo of her heels fading down the corridor.

Behind her, Clara's voice carried through the open door. "You see, Nathaniel? This is exactly why you need to end this marriage. That woman is nothing but trouble!"

The door swung shut, cutting off the rest. Eleanor didn't look back.",

Eleanor stood frozen, her heart pounding. Nathaniel's grip on her arm tightened, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Eleanor," he repeated, his tone laced with warning.

She closed her eyes briefly, then turned to face Clara Montgomery. The room fell silent as Eleanor spoke, her voice steady but laced with resignation. "I apologize, Mrs. Montgomery."

The formal address sent a ripple of shock through the room. Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his fingers digging into her arm, but Eleanor didn't flinch. She continued, her words cutting through the tension like a knife. "You were right. I'm not fit to be your grandson's wife. There's nothing holding him to me now, and I won't force myself on someone who clearly doesn't want me."

Clara blinked, momentarily stunned. "Are you saying...?"

Eleanor met her gaze head-on, her voice firm. "I'm willing to divorce Nathaniel."

The declaration hung in the air, heavy and final. Nathaniel's grip on her arm loosened, his expression unreadable. Eleanor stepped back, her heart aching but her resolve unshaken. She had made her choice, and there was no turning back.",
###Chapter30

As soon as Eleanor finished speaking, Nathaniel released her arm.  
He had dismissed her first mention of divorce as a moment of frustration, but this was the second time.  
It no longer felt like a joke.  

"Eleanor, what are you saying?" Isabella struggled to suppress her smile, though she managed to feign shock. "How can you talk about divorce so casually? You and Nathaniel..."  

Eleanor ignored her, her gaze fixed on Clara.  
Clara recovered quickly. "Are you threatening me, Eleanor?" Her reaction mirrored Nathaniel's from days ago.  

Eleanor laughed softly and shook her head. "No, I'm not. I'm serious."  
She turned to Nathaniel. "We don't love each other. There's nothing binding us together. There's no point in prolonging this marriage. We should just end it."  

Before Clara could respond, Victoria interjected, "No! I won't allow this!"  
She had hoped Eleanor would show some respect to Clara. She hadn't expected to walk into this scene.  

Victoria stepped forward. "Marriage is sacred. You can't make such decisions lightly. Your union was arranged two decades ago. You can't just—"  

"Are you sure?" Nathaniel interrupted, his question directed at Eleanor.  
"Yes, I'm sure," Eleanor replied calmly.  
"Fine. Don't regret this."  
"When are we going to the courthouse?"  
Both spoke with unsettling composure.  

Victoria's expression darkened. "Nathaniel Carter!"  
"Mom." Before Nathaniel could respond, Eleanor turned to Victoria. "Thank you for your care and kindness over the past two years. Truthfully... I've been considering this for a while now."  

"You once told me that love and marriage require long-term effort, but I think I've given it everything I have. Maybe we're just not meant to be."  

"I'm sorry to disappoint you, but as Nathaniel's mother, you'd want him to be happy, wouldn't you? You should be happy for him now."  

Victoria was at a loss for words.  
Eleanor stepped back. "I'll take my leave now. Goodbye."  
With that, she turned and walked away. Her composure suggested she had been contemplating this decision for some time, making it easier to sever ties today.  

Victoria pursed her lips.  
"I'll... I'll go check on Eleanor. Goodbye, Grandma Clara."  
Realizing she shouldn't linger, Isabella quickly excused herself.  

Victoria turned to Nathaniel. "Are you satisfied now?"  
"You heard her. This was her decision," Nathaniel replied.  
Victoria laughed bitterly. "Yes, she made the decision. And what about you? What have you done for your marriage? Or does it have nothing to do with you?"  

She didn't wait for his response. "I know you don't love Eleanor, but I thought you'd at least have some sense of responsibility. You disappoint me, Nathaniel Carter."  

Nathaniel chuckled dryly. "Is there anything I've done that hasn't disappointed you, Mom?"  

Eleanor walked out of the hospital swiftly.  
Isabella was quick to spread the news."
###Chapter 31
As soon as Eleanor stepped into the cab, Margaret's call came through. "Get home immediately." The line went dead before Eleanor could respond.
She had no intention of arguing. Her plan was to return to the Harrison residence anyway. Clearly, Margaret was at her wit's end. The moment Eleanor crossed the threshold, Margaret delivered a stinging slap.
The force of the blow sent Eleanor's hair, previously tucked neatly behind her ear, flying. Her ears rang from the impact.
"Do you have any idea what you've done?" Margaret hissed, her hand raised for another strike.
But a deep voice interrupted her. "Enough."
Margaret's hand froze mid-air. She looked up to see Edward descending the stairs.
He was impeccably dressed in a crisp shirt and gray waistcoat, his hair streaked with silver. Yet, his posture was straight, and his face showed no signs of aging.
Eleanor watched as Edward gently pulled Margaret aside. "She's not a child anymore. What good will hitting her do?"
"Do you think I want to? Look at what she's done!" Margaret glared at Eleanor, her teeth clenched. "You were against me when I said Isabella should've married Nathaniel back then. Now, you're divorcing him? Are you trying to make our family a laughingstock?"
"Enough. Take a deep breath," Edward said, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to Margaret's hysteria.
After calming Margaret, he turned to Eleanor. "Come with me to meet the Carters now. Once you apologize to them, we can forget this ever happened—"
"I'm not going with you," Eleanor said firmly.
Edward's eyes darkened. "What do you think you're doing, Eleanor?"
"This isn't a rash decision. The divorce is something I've been considering for a long time."
"Have you tried discussing this with us? Do you think your marriage only concerns the two of you? You should know your limits, Eleanor!"
Edward's tone grew stern, his commanding presence making it hard to argue.
Yet, Eleanor stood her ground, staring him down. "I've made up my mind. As for salvaging the family interests... Well, that's your problem to solve. If it comes to the worst-case scenario, remember that you still have another daughter."
Isabella happened to walk in at that moment. Eleanor's words made her heart race with excitement, but she feigned shock. "What are you saying, Eleanor?"
Eleanor gave her a faint smile. "Shouldn't you be thrilled that you can marry Nathaniel?"
Margaret interjected, "Never! Are you out of your mind, Eleanor? Nathaniel is her brother-in-law! You honestly want our family to be a joke, don't you?"
Her words made Isabella pale slightly. She muttered, "Mom..."
"Stay out of this!" Margaret snapped, then turned back to Eleanor. "So, did you do all this today to vent your frustration? Is it because you think we're biased toward Isabella?"
"In that case, you should reflect on yourself. Try thinking about why everyone adores her and not you."

###Chapter 32
Eleanor often wondered why. Why did her family treat her this way? The question haunted her ever since she was reunited with them as a teenager.
Back then, she had tried everything to win their affection, mimicking every sweet gesture Isabella used to charm their parents. But what did it get her? Nothing but cold indifference.
The truth hit her one day when she made a cup of coffee for Margaret. Her mother thanked her, only to pour it into a flowerpot the moment Eleanor turned her back.
That night, she overheard a conversation between her parents. Margaret was considering taking Eleanor for an HIV test. At the time, Eleanor was too young to understand what that meant. It wasn’t until years later that she realized it was a test for AIDS.
All because her adoptive father had almost assaulted her. To her parents, that incident was an indelible stain on her name. Even though nothing had actually happened, in their eyes, she was no longer pure. She had lost the right to be their daughter.
At the thought, Eleanor clenched her eyes shut. When she opened them again, her gaze was calm, almost detached. "It doesn’t matter anymore," she said quietly. "I don’t need your approval."
"What are you saying?" Margaret’s voice trembled, a mix of anger and disbelief.
Eleanor smiled faintly. "I thought you regretted bringing me back. Well, you won’t have to feel that way anymore. I’ll leave. From now on, Isabella can be your only daughter—the one you love and are proud of."
"Eleanor, do you even hear yourself?" Margaret’s voice shook, but Eleanor didn’t care.
"Of course, I do," Eleanor replied, her tone steady. "To be honest, I regret it too. Maybe I should’ve just stayed in that village. At least then, I could’ve kept the illusion that my parents loved me."
Margaret fell silent, but her trembling hands betrayed her emotions.
Eleanor turned her gaze to Edward. "I’ve said what I needed to say. Take care. Goodbye."
She turned to leave, her steps firm and resolute.
"Wait!" Edward finally spoke, stepping in front of her. "You’re being ridiculous. You’re a Harrison. You share our blood. Do you really think you can just walk away like this?"
"What do you want me to do?" Eleanor asked, her voice cold. "Sell my soul to you? My body?"
Edward was speechless, his mouth opening and closing without a sound.
"That’s what I thought," Eleanor said, turning away again. This time, her steps didn’t falter.
Behind her, Margaret’s voice rose in protest, but Eleanor didn’t look back. She walked out of the Harrison mansion and headed straight to Nivis Villa.
Once inside, she began packing her things. This place had been her home for the past two years, ever since she married Nathaniel. She had attended countless business parties as his plus-one, and Victoria had gifted her countless expensive gowns and jewelry. But Eleanor left it all behind.
She only took what she had brought with her. In the end, everything fit into a single suitcase and a backpack.
Grace, the housekeeper, watched in shock. "Mrs. Carter, what’s going on?"
Eleanor didn’t answer. She simply grabbed her belongings and walked out the door.

###Chapter 33
Victoria's face darkened as she caught Ryan's lecherous gaze, a wave of revulsion washing over her. That scoundrel Ethan! He had left her to deal with Ryan, a notoriously slippery man, all because he had to chase after Lily! Was Lily that important?
Victoria coldly grabbed her purse, but Ryan seized her delicate wrist the next moment.
Smelling the faint perfume on Victoria, greed shone undisguised in Ryan's eyes. "What's this, Mrs. Bennett? Planning on grabbing your bag and leaving? Mr. Bennett has entrusted you to sign the contract." Feeling the warmth of Ryan's hand on her wrist, Victoria quickly shook it off in disgust.
Her face soured. "Mr. Miller, have you had too much to drink? Or do you need me to call Ethan so he can come and sign this contract himself?"
She was, after all, Ethan's wife in name. And this man dared to lay a hand on her!
Seeing Victoria's anger, Ryan wasn't flustered. Instead, he flashed a yellow-toothed grin. "Do you think you can even reach Mr. Bennett? He's off with his little mistress now."
Victoria's gaze faltered. How did Ryan know about this?
Seeing Victoria's shocked face, Ryan sneered even more. "Mr. Bennett has brought Lily to business gatherings before. Everyone knows she's Mr. Bennett's girl. It seems you're the only wife out of the loop." Victoria felt like a bucket of cold water poured over her head, mockery the only thing left in her eyes. No wonder Ryan knew about Lily. It turned out all business partners were aware except her! Ethan treated her like a fool!
Looking at Victoria's pale face, Ryan felt an indescribable sense of shatter. Perhaps from the alcohol or some other reason, a violent desire to possess Victoria surged within him.
Unable to help himself, Ryan swallowed hard. "Victoria, you're so beautiful. Ethan doesn't know what he's got. Come to me, and I'll treat you right, not to mention... in the world of the rich and the common, once you're halfway through life, isn't it all about playing your own game..."
He lunged at Victoria after his words.
Victoria, her face filled with disgust and anger, watched Ryan approach.
And then, she slapped him hard. The sound echoed. Snap!
Ryan was stunned, his right cheek swelling up, with disbelief in his eyes. "You... you dare hit me! Bitch, believe it or not, I won't sign the contract. Let's see how Mr. Bennett will kick you out then!"
"You think being a housewife can keep a man's heart? Lily's pregnant with Mr. Bennett's child. She'll kick you out of the Bennett family sooner or later. Victoria, if you had any sense, you'd sign this contract. Maybe Mr. Bennett will give you some money. Otherwise, even if you beg me, I won't give you the time of day!"
Victoria looked at Ryan coldly. "Have some self-awareness. Just the sight of your vile face disgusts me." Ryan's face fell, but before he could continue, Victoria cut him off, "As for what you just said, I'll be sure to relay every word to Ethan. So, he has a mistress, and she's even pregnant."
With that, Victoria grabbed her purse and turned to leave, her heart filled with nothing but loathing for Ethan.
Victoria could come to terms with Ethan having someone else and even having a child with them, and that he made her feel like a fool. But she would never stand for Ethan degrading her like this, leaving her to fend off harassment while he lived a sweet life with his mistress!
Why had she ever agreed to marry a beast like Ethan?
Watching Victoria walk away, Ryan panicked. Ethan had cleared that bringing Lily's issue to Victoria was off-limits, and he wouldn't let it slide!
Ryan regretted spilling the beans. Why had he mentioned it?
With that, Ryan hurried after Victoria, catching up in a moment, his hands reaching to tear at Victoria's clothes.
"If you tear these clothes, you won't be able to leave!"
"Victoria, who permitted you to tell Mr. Bennett? If you tell Ethan, you'll get yourself kicked out faster. If you are with me, even if Ethan divorces you, I can still look out for you outside!"
Upon hearing her clothes ripping, Victoria's expression changed dramatically. Her fingers clenched into a fist, and as she was about to strike...
Bang! Someone had the tightly shut door kicked open.
Interrupted, Victoria and Ryan instinctively looked up, especially Victoria, who hadn't reacted yet when she suddenly got pulled into a warm embrace.

###Chapter 34
Eleanor Thompson vividly recalled the day she married Nathaniel Carter. Though she never gained the affection of her own family, she was still the eldest daughter of the Thompsons. As such, her wedding had been a grand affair.
Six months before the ceremony, they had gotten engaged, chosen a wedding gown, taken photos, selected a marriage registration date, and eventually prepared for the big day. During that time, Eleanor had put everything else in her life on hold, dedicating herself entirely to the wedding preparations. Yet today, their marriage ended with just a few words in less than thirty minutes of legal proceedings. Nathaniel's lawyer worked with ruthless efficiency, and there was no waiting period before the divorce was finalized. Soon enough, the couple received their divorce decrees.
Nathaniel seemed overwhelmed with work. Incoming calls kept him occupied from the moment he entered the courthouse, and after receiving the decree, he left while still on the phone. Eleanor had planned to say goodbye, but by the time she stepped outside, he was already gone. He hadn't even bothered to bid her farewell.
She stood still for a moment, then slowly lowered her gaze to the divorce decree in her hand. "Two years of marriage," she thought. "It began with anxiety and ended in a frantic rush. All this time, I was the only one running around in panic."
Her phone suddenly rang, jolting her out of her thoughts. "What the hell?" Eleanor had just answered when a hysterical voice erupted from the speaker. "Are you kidding me? What was that update you sent me this morning? Why did the male lead die? Wasn't I clear in my drawing? Death by car accident."
"Are you insane? The male lead gets run over by a car on the day of his proposal? Aren't you afraid your readers will come after you instead?"
The editor's words drew a chuckle from Eleanor. "They won't. They don't even know who I am."
"But I do! Babe, don't mess with me like this. If I upload this version, I'll be bombarded with curses and threats and—"
"Relax. I'll bring it full circle later."
"For real? Will the male lead be reborn? Or is it time travel? Come on! Give me a spoiler!"
"Nope! The female lead gets a rebirth." Eleanor looked up at the sky and continued, "Isn't it much cooler that she'll leave the man and start a new life?"
She didn't fully convince her editor, Caroline Wright. Since they lived in the same city, Caroline came to confront her in person.
Meanwhile, Eleanor was unpacking her belongings at her new rental apartment. When Caroline arrived, she was stunned by the scene. "Are you running away or something?"
Eleanor glanced at her. "Can't you tell this is a new place I've rented?"
"Nope! I can't tell. I thought this was where you were having your little affair with some young, handsome man." Eleanor paused briefly at her words, then came clean. "I got a divorce."
"D-Divorce?" Caroline's eyes widened in disbelief. "Say that again?"
Eleanor smiled. "You heard me."
In this city, Caroline was one of the few friends Eleanor had. However, they rarely interacted in person. Caroline was her editor, so most of their communication happened online. She knew Eleanor's identity, as well as Nathaniel's—the CEO of Amity Group in Coppersville.
The two women locked eyes for a moment. After ensuring Eleanor was serious, Caroline asked, "So, what now? Is this your way of seeking revenge? By hurting all your readers?"
"No... Actually, I find the plotline quite nice."

###Chapter 35
"Get real, Eleanor," Caroline sighed, tapping her pen against the desk. "This is supposed to be a heartwarming romance—sweet, tender, and healing! If we publish this version, our readers will have our heads on a platter."
She leaned back in her chair, studying Eleanor's troubled expression. "You know what? Take a break. Clear your head. I'm giving you two weeks off. Come back when you're ready to redraw this with the right tone."
Eleanor nodded, sensing Caroline's resolve. Arguing further would be pointless.
Caroline tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "So, what happened with Nathaniel? Weren't things perfect? You had a life most women dream of—meals prepared, unlimited credit cards, and a husband who gave you freedom. What went wrong?"
Eleanor avoided the question, stacking her sketchbooks neatly on the shelf. "You haven't eaten yet, have you? Let me treat you to dinner."

---
Lavender Grove was Coppersville's most exclusive restaurant, a place where only the elite could gain entry. Membership was a prerequisite, and the clientele consisted of the city's most influential figures.
Isabella rarely frequented such establishments. It didn't align with her carefully curated public image. But tonight, she made an exception, drawn by the man seated at the center of the private room.
The news of Nathaniel and Eleanor's divorce had spread like wildfire through their social circle. Tonight's gathering was ostensibly to "celebrate" Nathaniel's return to bachelorhood.
Though Nathaniel was known for his reserved demeanor, he wasn't unapproachable. When his friends suggested the outing, he didn't refuse.
As soon as Isabella entered the room, she was bombarded with questions. "Is it true? Did your sister really divorce Nathaniel?"
They wouldn't dare pester him directly, so they turned to her for answers.
Isabella nodded slowly, her expression carefully neutral.
The group erupted into laughter. "After all the trouble she went through to marry him, she just lets him go like that?"
"I was shocked too," Isabella said, feigning innocence. "They seemed fine just the other day..."
"Bet she messed up," someone interjected with a smirk. "Probably threw a tantrum, thinking Nathaniel would cave. But he didn't, did he? He just let her go."
Another voice chimed in, "Tell us, Isabella. Is she holed up at home, crying her eyes out?"
"I don't know," Isabella replied, shaking her head. "Eleanor came home, had a huge fight with our parents, and then... she just left. She hasn't been back since."
"Wait, what? Where is she now?"
"I have no idea," Isabella said, her voice tinged with concern. She glanced at Nathaniel, who sat silently, swirling a glass of wine. "Nathaniel, do you know where Eleanor is? My parents are worried sick. She hasn't been in touch with anyone."
Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. He took a slow sip of his drink, his gaze distant. The room fell silent, waiting for his response. But he said nothing, his silence speaking volumes.
Isabella's lips curved into a faint smile, though her eyes betrayed a flicker of unease. The game was far from over, and she intended to play her cards carefully.

###Chapter 36
No one responded to Isabella's question. Instead, the person who had mentioned Julian swiftly changed the subject. "Who knows? They're just a bunch of nobodies. Anyway, cheers to you, Nathaniel!"
In truth, he was apologizing for his earlier slip-up. After all, no matter how much Nathaniel disliked Eleanor, the entire dynamic of the divorce shifted if Julian was involved.
Fortunately, Nathaniel didn't hold it against him. He raised his wine glass and clinked it with the man's.
After downing his drink, the man was about to say more when Nathaniel suddenly stood up. "I have somewhere else to be, so I'll see you all later. Enjoy yourselves, and put it on my tab."
"Huh? Wait..."
Nathaniel was out the door before anyone could react.
Isabella, however, quickly followed him. "Nate!"
"What do you need?" He turned his head, his voice calm but with a hint of coldness.
She bit her lip. "I... I took a cab to get here. Could you drive me home?"
"Sure," he replied without hesitation, his attitude toward her unchanged.
At that, Isabella let out a breath of relief and flashed him a sweet smile. They walked side by side and exited the club.
Thanks to the success of Lavender Grove, the businesses along the street had flourished. At a glance, a dozen bars and clubs lined the way.
Against the backdrop of the night, the colorful lights resembled spilled cocktails, and even the air seemed thick with the intoxicating scent of decadence.
However, none of that mattered to Nathaniel. His footsteps didn't falter.
Isabella followed him closely, and just as she was about to seize the opportunity to speak with him, he suddenly stopped. Before she could ask what was wrong, she caught sight of a figure in a blue blouse and black pencil skirt.
What was different tonight was that Eleanor wore bold makeup. The winged eyeliner accentuated her eyes, making them appear even more vibrant, while a playful smile danced at the corners of her lips, giving her an air of carefree confidence.
This version of Eleanor was unfamiliar to Isabella. She had never seen her like this before.
Meanwhile, standing beside Eleanor was another unfamiliar woman. They stood by the roadside, seemingly having just exited a bar and waiting for a cab.
The woman wrapped her arm around Eleanor's shoulders and said solemnly, "I know you think of the male lead as your husband—I mean, ex-husband—and fantasize about him dying in a car crash, but that doesn't mean you should act impulsively."
"Come on. This is work. We need to approach it professionally and leave our personal feelings out of it."
Car crash? Death?
At that, Isabella quickly glanced at Nathaniel. As expected, his brow was furrowed. Without hesitation, she called out, "Eleanor!"
Her voice made the women, who had been facing away from them, visibly stiffen.
Naturally, Isabella didn't care about that. She approached them and grabbed Eleanor's hand.
"You're here, Eleanor! Where have you been? I've been calling you, but you never picked up. Mom and Dad are worried sick about you!" She sounded genuinely concerned.
However, Eleanor quickly pulled her hand away. Then, her eyes briefly flicked over Nathaniel, who stood across from her.

###Chapter 37
Nathaniel's gaze swept past Eleanor without a second glance, as if her presence held no significance. He remained rooted in place, his attention fixed on... Isabella.
After a brief glance, Eleanor averted her eyes and addressed Isabella directly. "What do you want?"
Isabella's voice trembled with desperation. "Please, Eleanor, come home with me. Stop fighting with Mom and Dad, okay?"
"Sorry, but I'm not going back," Eleanor replied firmly, her tone leaving no room for negotiation.
Undeterred, Isabella turned to Caroline. "You're Eleanor's friend, right? Can you please convince her to come home?"
Caroline chuckled lightly before responding, "She's an adult. She doesn't need you worrying about her decisions, alright?"
Isabella's eyes welled up with tears. "But Mom and Dad are heartbroken! Eleanor, can you really stand by and watch them lose sleep and appetite over you? How can you be so heartless?"
Tears streamed down her face, and Caroline couldn't help but be impressed. "You've got quite the acting talent. Ever thought about joining the entertainment industry?"
Her sarcastic remark left Isabella momentarily speechless.
Before Isabella could respond, Eleanor grabbed Caroline's arm. "Let's go."
"Eleanor!" Isabella cried out, reaching out to stop her. But Eleanor had already anticipated the move, sidestepping her grasp. To everyone's surprise, Isabella stumbled and fell to the ground.
This time, Nathaniel finally intervened. He hurried over and helped Isabella to her feet.
"I'm fine, Nate. Don't be mad at Eleanor," Isabella said softly, her voice trembling.
"Nate... As in Nathaniel?" Caroline's eyes darted between them, quickly piecing things together. "You're Eleanor's ex-husband?"
"Let's just go," Eleanor urged, pulling at Caroline's hand. But Caroline stood her ground, her gaze fixed on Nathaniel, who was still holding Isabella's hand.
"What's going on here? Some kind of twisted drama? An affair between the in-laws, huh?" Caroline's voice dripped with sarcasm.
"That's ridiculous!" Isabella shot back, her face flushing. "Nate and I... there's nothing going on!"
"A man and a woman, out on the street at this hour. Nothing going on, you say? The ink on your divorce papers is barely dry!" Caroline retorted, her tone sharp.
She turned to Eleanor, her voice filled with resentment. "I don't blame you for fantasizing about his death anymore. Who would want a man like this?"
Eleanor tried to stop her, but Nathaniel's cold voice cut through the tension. "Ms. Wright."
His tone was so icy that it sent a shiver down Eleanor's spine. When she looked up, she met his emotionless gaze.
"I'd appreciate it if your friend could watch her words," he stated flatly. "Also, Isabella is only concerned about you. This isn't about your upbringing, but you should at least have some decency."
"Decency, huh?" Caroline was ready to lunge at Nathaniel, but he ignored her, turning away with Isabella in tow.
Eleanor stood frozen, her fists clenched tightly. She couldn't help but marvel at Nathaniel's ability to wound her so deeply, even after everything they'd been through.
She had thought she had built an impenetrable wall around her heart, but with just a few words, he had shattered it. His words struck at the very core of her being, leaving her raw and vulnerable.


###Chapter 38
Finally, Eleanor returned to her rented apartment. She was about to remove her makeup when her editor-in-chief from the online publishing platform called.
They informed her that her work violated the site's regulations and had decided to terminate their collaboration with her unilaterally.
Eleanor frowned and asked, "Which rules did I break?"
"Our legal department received a complaint stating that the male lead in your comic... infringes on someone's publicity rights."
Instantly, she knew who was behind this—Nathaniel. Although he never paid much attention to her activities, he wasn't entirely unaware of her life.
He must have heard what Caroline told her earlier and made a simple phone call, costing her her job!
"I understand." Eleanor took a deep breath and hung up.
She initially planned to call and confront Nathaniel but changed her mind at the last second. It wasn't because she was in the wrong. She simply knew better than to challenge him, as it would only bring her more trouble.
Take her current situation, for example—a comic character somehow violated his publicity rights. Clearly, the absurdity of the accusation wouldn't stop him.
At that moment, she received a call from the hospital, instructing her to settle the medical fees for the last period. "We've just contacted Mr. Carter, and he informed us that you will be responsible for Ms. Moore's expenses from now on."
"Alright, I'll be at the hospital tomorrow." Eleanor's response was calm, but her grip on the phone tightened reflexively as she ended the call.
She had no choice but to check her bank account.
Despite having worked for years, she rarely used the credit card Nathaniel gave her, leaving her with modest savings. At this point, her savings were only enough to cover one cycle of medical expenses.
Eleanor turned off her phone and leaned back on the couch, slowly closing her eyes. For a moment, she felt as though she was standing on the edge of a cliff, with everyone around her eager to push her off.
The Carters had timed their move perfectly, hadn't they?
The next day, Eleanor went to the hospital and settled the medical bill. Thomas Bennett, the butler at the Carter residence, called and informed her that Margaret wanted to see her at home.
In response, Eleanor decisively replied, "I won't be coming back."
Thomas sighed. "Ms. Thompson, what's the point of this? No matter what, you're Mr. and Mrs. Carter's daughter. If you continue holding a grudge against them—"
"I'm not holding a grudge against them," Eleanor interrupted him. "And my mind is clear."
"But—"
"If that's all, goodbye." She hung up immediately.
Her gaze slowly shifted to the patient in the ward, who had been in a deep sleep for eight years. Even though the doctors said her condition was permanent, Eleanor refused to give up on her.
She gently caressed the woman's cheek and whispered softly, "Hi, Mom."
But Diana Moore, her adoptive mother, could no longer respond or protect her. The last time she had protected Eleanor was when she stopped that brute eight years ago.
That... was also the last time Eleanor had felt a mother's love.
A caregiver entered the room, surprised to see Eleanor. "Ms. Thompson? It's been a while."
"Hey. Thank you for all your hard work."

###Chapter 39
"Oh, it's nothing. What have you been up to lately? I haven't seen you in months," Eleanor said, forcing a smile.
"Nothing much. I'll be around more often from now on," she replied, her tone light but her eyes betraying a hint of exhaustion.
The caregiver, a kind woman in her late fifties, casually began chatting with her. At noon, Eleanor finally left the hospital, her mind heavy with thoughts she couldn't quite shake.
To make her trips to the hospital easier, she had deliberately rented a small apartment nearby. The distance was short enough that she could effortlessly walk home with a parasol, shielding herself from the harsh midday sun.
Surprisingly, Margaret was waiting at her door. Her mother stood there, her face filled with contempt as she scrutinized the modest surroundings. With furrowed brows, she covered her nose and mouth with a handkerchief, as if the very air around her was tainted.
When she saw Eleanor, she blurted, "About time you're back."
Despite saying she would sever ties with the Bennetts, Eleanor couldn't help but ask, "Why are you here?"
"You think I'd be here if you didn't refuse to come home?" Margaret glanced at the rusted door on the side, her disdain palpable. "I see you've moved to a place like this after the divorce. You've gone nuts, Eleanor!"
"This is my choice, and you shouldn't have to get worked up about it," Eleanor replied, her voice steady. She was well aware of Margaret's disdain toward the place. Thus, she didn't bother to unlock the door or invite her in.
Margaret drew a long breath, her patience clearly wearing thin. "Did you just come from the hospital? You went to see her, didn't you?"
"Yeah," Eleanor admitted, her tone flat.
"Get this into your head, Eleanor—without the Bennetts, you can't afford to pay her medical bills!" Margaret's voice was sharp, cutting through the tension like a knife.
"I'm aware," Eleanor replied, her voice barely above a whisper.
"Why are you still—"
"Why don't you just state your purpose here?" Eleanor interrupted, her patience wearing thin. She was unconvinced that Margaret had come out of pure worry for her.
Since the phone call from Thomas, she knew the family had something to ask of her. To save time and effort, she decided to be straightforward.
Margaret was about to answer her, but someone came up from the staircase. Eleanor's unit happened to be on the third floor, right around the stairs. When the person passed by, they casually glanced in their direction. Though it was merely a passing look, Margaret found it all too revolting.
Her face scrunched in disdain as she questioned, "Are you not planning to invite me in at all?"
Indeed, that was Eleanor's plan. However, in the end, she pursed her lips and unlocked the door.
The room was in better shape than Margaret had imagined. It was cramped and crowded, but at least it was clean.
After sweeping the room with her critical gaze, Margaret sat on the couch and placed a tablet before Eleanor. "Take a look."
"What's this?" Eleanor asked, her brow furrowing in confusion.
"Just take a look," Margaret urged, her tone impatient.
Albeit confused, Eleanor took the tablet and subsequently saw a photo.
"What's the meaning of this?" She placed the tablet back onto the table, her voice cold.
"This is the son of the Hughes family. He's 30—"
"You're the one who's gone nuts. I'm fresh out of a divorce," Eleanor said in a strained voice. "If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Hughes is disabled."
"And? Are you finally aware of how good you had it with Nathaniel? Why did you even divorce him? Do you know how many people were looking forward to this day so they could make fun of you?" Margaret's words were sharp, each one cutting deeper than the last.
"Now that you're a divorcee, this is the only kind of man you're entitled to."
Eleanor's hands clenched into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. "I don't need your help, Margaret. I can take care of myself."
Margaret's eyes narrowed, her lips pressing into a thin line. "You think you can survive on your own? You're delusional, Eleanor. Without the family, you're nothing."
Eleanor met her mother's gaze, her own eyes blazing with defiance. "I'd rather be nothing than be a pawn in your games. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do."
Margaret stood, her expression a mix of anger and disbelief. "You'll regret this, Eleanor. Mark my words."
As the door slammed shut behind her mother, Eleanor let out a shaky breath. She sank onto the couch, her head in her hands. The weight of her decisions pressed down on her, but she knew she couldn't go back. Not now. Not ever.

###Chapter 40
Margaret's words plunged Eleanor into a heavy silence. The already cramped room felt even more suffocating with her quiet presence. Margaret's heart raced as Eleanor's calm gaze fixed on her.
She furrowed her brows and began, "E..."
"Please leave," Eleanor stated firmly.
Her request left Margaret stunned. After a moment, she asked in disbelief, "What did you say?"
"Please leave and never come here again," Eleanor repeated with confidence. "If I wasn't clear enough, I'll inform the media and make a public statement that I'll sever ties with the Thompsons. Therefore, you don't have to worry about me humiliating your family."
Margaret sprang up at her words and delivered a harsh slap across Eleanor's face. She had recently done a new set of manicures, with diamonds inlaid on her nails. When her long nails slashed across Eleanor's cheek, they tore her flesh, and blood slowly emerged from the wound.
However, Eleanor barely flinched from the pain. Instead, she stared as calmly as always at Margaret. "You... You think you're all tough now, don't you? You're my daughter, Eleanor. How dare you be so defiant?"
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're making me marry the Hughes family for your benefit, aren't you?" Eleanor interrupted her. "Otherwise, you guys wouldn't be so eager to see me."
She asked, "Did something happen to the company? Never mind. I don't care. It's not like I want anything from the Thompsons, anyway."
"How mighty of you! Let me remind you that we were the ones who raised and nurtured you. Where did you think that money came from?" Margaret became bold. "And that woman lying in the hospital? If it weren't for us, she would've died a long time ago!"
She continued, "I know you never see me as your mother. Instead, you've long regarded that woman as your family. I bet you would've lived at the hospital if we hadn't stopped you from seeing her."
"What can she even offer you? She's nothing but an illiterate country bumpkin."
"She gave me love. A lot of it," Eleanor interjected. "If she hadn't protected me with her life, I would've been assaulted by that bastard. Now, my biological mother, what did you do at that time?"
"You can argue that we were separated. I don't blame you for that. But all I ever did upon returning was try to please you and mend our relationship. What about you?"
Eleanor chuckled. "What you did was suspect that I carried HIV. You were damn scared to be infected, weren't you?"
Her voice was as calm as the sea, yet her fists were clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. The sharp pain served as a constant reminder not to back down or yield.
At this point, it was better to tear open the wound than to let it fester and rot.
Her words clearly hit a nerve with Margaret, leaving her momentarily frozen.
"Please leave. I know you don't love me." Eleanor smiled wryly. "They say blood is thicker than water, but some bonds are gone for good once broken. That... is something you and I know."

###Chapter 41
Eleanor took a deep breath and tried once more to reason with Margaret. "Have you considered your future? Forget everything else—the medical expenses alone will be enough to crush you! Your father..." "No matter what, I won't starve to death," Eleanor interrupted bluntly. "This isn't something you should worry about. From now on, just pretend I was never found. Your daughter, Eleanor Thompson, died when she got lost at five years old."
In the end, Margaret left.
Eleanor sat on the couch in silence for a while before quietly picking up her racket and walking out the door.
At the gym near the high school, Eleanor swung her racket with all her might. The gym had air conditioning, but after such intense exercise, sweat was dripping down her face, soaking her hair. Her vision was starting to blur from the sweat in her eyes.
Just as she was waiting for her opponent to serve, a familiar voice broke through the air, "Let me play for a while."
Her temporary partner, a college student by the looks of him, didn't refuse. He simply nodded and tossed the ball to the newcomer before heading to the side to take a water break.
"I knew you'd be here," Julian said as he looked at Eleanor.
She didn't respond, focusing intently on the ball in his hand.
"Look at you, all sweaty. Take a break," Julian added.
Eleanor stared at him for a moment. When she realized he wasn't planning on playing with her, she turned around and went to find another partner.
But Julian quickly caught up and grabbed her hand.
"Let go of me."
Julian didn't answer. He simply pulled her in the opposite direction.
"Julian Whitaker, let go of me!"
Eleanor pushed and shoved at him repeatedly, but Julian's strength was too much for her. She couldn't break free.
Finally, with a sudden pull, he yanked her into his arms.
She tried to struggle, but Julian tightened his hold around her. "If it hurts, just cry it out. Don't worry. No one's watching."
His words froze Eleanor in place. The hand she had raised finally dropped, and even the racket fell to the ground.
She gritted her teeth, her heart pounding from the exertion. Something quickly slid down her cheeks, but she convinced herself it was just blood from the wound, not tears.
She hadn't cried in years.
She had long known they didn't love her—her father, her mother, even Nathaniel.
Her tears had dried up a long time ago.
But right now, she still felt pain. Even though she knew it was like rotten flesh, it still tore at her heart when that piece of flesh was finally cut away.
"Mr. Carter?" a voice suddenly interrupted from nearby.
Nathaniel finally shifted his gaze away and turned his head.
The person followed his gaze and looked over, but Nathaniel stepped in front to block their view before they could spot anything. "It's a bit crowded today."
"Yes, but I've already arranged for the court. Please come this way."
"Alright."
Nathaniel followed the man without hesitation. But as he lifted his foot to step forward, he couldn't stop himself from glancing back.
Eleanor and Julian were still wrapped in each other's arms.
He could see Eleanor's trembling shoulders and the firm grip Julian had around her waist.
Nathaniel's brows furrowed tightly.

###Chapter 42
Though their marriage had only lasted two years, Nathaniel had known Eleanor for several years prior. In his memory, Eleanor was always composed and steady. The only time he had ever seen her cry was when she suffered a miscarriage.
When he arrived at the hospital that day, the surgery had already been performed. It was late, and both families had gone home. The nurse had dozed off by her side, while Eleanor sat quietly on the bed, her face turned toward the window. She didn’t sob or break down—she simply let the tears fall silently, one by one.
And what had Nathaniel done in that moment? He couldn’t even remember. The life that had lasted less than three months—his mind barely held any memories or emotions about it. Yet, the image of Eleanor crying suddenly flooded back to him now, vivid and clear. It was one of the few times he had seen her so emotionally vulnerable, apart from... those other intimate moments.
But just moments ago, she had cried in front of Julian. She had even trembled.
"Mr. Carter?"
The voice from across the tennis court snapped Nathaniel out of his thoughts. He shook his head slightly, refocusing on the game. He hummed in acknowledgment and served the ball again.
An hour later, Nathaniel changed out of his tennis clothes and left the VIP room. When he returned to the first-floor court, Eleanor and the others were gone. But on a nearby chair, a green hair tie lay abandoned.
Nathaniel recognized it immediately—it was Eleanor’s.
Yet, he didn’t approach it. He simply glanced at it before turning and walking away.
Ethan had received the message in advance. When he saw Nathaniel emerge, he immediately opened the car door for him.
"Back to the office, Mr. Carter?"
"Yes."
Nathaniel got into the car and immediately opened his tablet. Emails awaited his attention. But as soon as Ethan pulled out of the parking lot, Nathaniel suddenly said, "Turn around."
"What?"
Ethan was taken aback. For a moment, he wondered if he had misheard.
"Turn around," Nathaniel repeated, his tone firm.
Ethan quickly flicked on the turn signal and drove the car back toward the gym. As they approached, he asked, "Did you forget something? I can go inside and grab it for you."
"No need."
By the time Nathaniel returned to the court, the hair tie was gone. The seat was now occupied by a young couple. The woman was holding her phone, smiling brightly as she took selfies.
Noticing Nathaniel’s gaze, the woman looked up. When she saw his face, her eyes lit up with interest.
But Nathaniel didn’t pause. He simply turned and walked away.
Ethan was still waiting outside. When he noticed Nathaniel’s empty hands, he hesitated for a moment before suggesting, "Mr. Carter, did you lose something? Should I contact the gym and have them help—"
"No need."
Nathaniel got into the car, his expression unreadable. "Just some trash."
Trash?
If it was just trash, why had he gone out of his way to retrieve it? Ethan found it odd but didn’t dare press further. He silently closed the door for Nathaniel.
Meanwhile, Eleanor had returned home, showered, and collapsed onto her bed. The physical exertion had left her exhausted, and she fell into a deep sleep.
When she woke up, it was already dark outside. Her phone, which had been on silent, buzzed with several new messages.
Two of them were from Julian.

###Chapter 43
"Are you asleep?"
"I got you something. I left it by the door. Remember to grab it."
The other messages were from Caroline. She had an argument with the editor-in-chief that day. She still couldn't secure the rights to continue the serialization and was apologizing for not being able to help.
Eleanor replied to the messages as she walked over to the door.
When she opened it, she saw the cake hanging there. It was covered in chocolate—her favorite flavor.
As she stood staring at the cake in a daze, Julian called.
"Are you awake?"
"Yeah."
"Did you get the cake?"
"I got it."
"Put it in the fridge. I'm on my way over now. We can..."
"Julian," Eleanor interrupted him. "Thanks for today, but I'm fine now. You don't have to do these things for me anymore."
After she finished speaking, she heard a laugh on the other end of the line. "What's this? Are you trying to distance yourself from me? You told me before that you were married and didn't want me near you, but now..."
"I've already left the Harrison family," Eleanor continued. "Right now, I'm not even the so-called 'young lady' of the Harrison family anymore. Do you think your family would accept us being together? It wasn't easy for you to come back this time, and I know you have your ambitions, so... don't waste your time on me."
Julian didn't respond.
After a long silence, he finally said, "Elle, you haven't changed. You're still as calm as always. But do you know what I really want?"
Eleanor stared at the cake. "If it's something else you want, then I can't give you that."
Those words from Eleanor left Julian utterly speechless.
Finally, he said, "So, you still love Nathaniel."
Without waiting for Eleanor to respond, he ended the call.
Eleanor stood frozen in place for a long time, holding her phone. When she snapped back to reality, she opened the chat with Julian, wanting to tell him that she had stopped loving Nathaniel.
But no matter how she typed it out, the words seemed insincere and forced. In the end, she gave up and set her phone back to silent.
Perhaps it was because she had a good sleep in the afternoon, but Eleanor found herself wide awake that night. She had planned to use the time to sketch some designs.
But no matter how hard she tried, her mind couldn't focus. Even though she felt a blank emptiness, it was as if something was growing rapidly inside her. Eventually, she shut her laptop and crawled back into bed. She spent the night in a restless haze, and the next morning, she was woken by a knock on her door.
"Ms. Eleanor." Thomas stood outside, looking at her respectfully. "Mr. Harrison sent me to bring you to him."
Eleanor pressed her lips together. "I already made myself clear yesterday."
"Don't worry, Ms. Eleanor. Mr. Harrison understands your feelings. He didn't ask me to bring you back by force. He just mentioned he would like to have a meal with you and have a proper conversation."
"I have nothing to discuss with him."
She was about to close the door when Thomas quickly pressed his hand against it.
"Ms. Eleanor, you know Mr. Harrison's temperament. Please don't make this harder for me."
There was a hint of pleading in his voice.
After a moment of silence, Eleanor finally relaxed her grip on the door.
Thomas's face brightened, but before he could say anything more, Eleanor said, "Where are we eating? I'll go myself."

###Chapter 44
Eleanor's relationship with Margaret was strained, but it was even worse with Edward. The distance between them was so vast that calling it "distant" felt like an understatement.
As the head of the family and chairman of the company, Edward naturally carried his work habits into his personal life—authoritative, commanding, and never to be questioned.
If Margaret made Eleanor feel like she was endlessly favoring Isabella, Edward made her feel nothing at all—just cold indifference.
He was rarely home, and in Eleanor's memories, he had never once fulfilled his role as a father. But what he did do was maintain the authority of "the head of the family," and no one was allowed to challenge it. Despite having been back for years, this was Eleanor's first time eating alone with him.
When she arrived, he was already waiting in the private room. He was looking at his wrist impatiently to check the time.
"Sorry that I'm late," Eleanor said.
Edward didn't seem angry. He just gave her a brief glance and then gestured to the seat next to him. "Have a seat."
Eleanor didn't move. Her eyes drifted to the other settings on the table—including hers and Edward's, there were five sets of utensils.
"Someone else will be joining us soon," Edward remarked, noticing her hesitation.
Eleanor's mind quickly raced, and her voice tightened. "People from the Hughes family?"
"Oh, you know about them?" Edward replied, remarkably calm. "Did your mother tell you? That's even better. Mr. Hughes has some free time these days, so you and his son can meet first..."
"I don't want to meet him," Eleanor interrupted firmly. "I'm here today to make something clear—please stop interfering in my life. I have nothing to do with any of you anymore. So, please don't do such ridiculous things again."
Eleanor was about to turn and leave when Edward suddenly let out a soft laugh. "Eleanor, the one being ridiculous here is you.
"Do you really think you can sever ties with the Harrison family just because you want to? Don't kid yourself into thinking paying those medical bills is enough.
"The moment I speak up, that woman will be transferred to another hospital. And I can guarantee you, there won't be another hospital in all of Coppersville willing to take her."
A weakness—everyone had one.
Love, family, friendship, or any number of other ties.
But Eleanor never imagined that her own father would use her weakness as leverage against her one day. Her hands clenched involuntarily, and she ground her teeth together in frustration.
"If you don't want to watch that woman die, then sit down and behave," Edward said. "Besides, it's just a meal. You're divorced. The man might not even be interested in you."
"And if he's not?" Eleanor shot back, her voice sharp. "You plan to keep setting me up with men, finding someone who'll buy into me, bleed me dry of whatever little value I have left?"
By now, Eleanor didn't bother speaking respectfully. She knew full well that the Harrison family had never cared about her happiness when they refused to let her divorce Nathaniel.
It was all about... benefits.
After all, the Carter family was wealthy and influential. The Harrison family only needed to cling to that one family connection. Her own well-being? That wasn't even on their radar.
"Eleanor, watch your tone," Edward warned, his brows furrowing. "You chose this path for yourself. Look around at all of Coppersville—who could possibly compare to Nathaniel? You gave up the best option available to you!"
Edward was about to say more, but before he could, the door to the private room opened again.
Upon seeing who had entered, he immediately swallowed his words, and a smile quickly spread across his face. "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes."

###Chapter 45
"Mr. Harrison, it's been a while," Gregory Hughes and his wife, Caroline Wright, exchanged polite handshakes with Edward. Then, almost simultaneously, their gazes shifted to Eleanor.
Edward glanced at Eleanor. After a brief moment of hesitation, she managed to force a smile.
"Let me introduce you to my daughter, Eleanor," Edward said.
"She's quite stunning," Gregory responded first, then gestured to his son.
The man across from Eleanor extended his hand. "Hello. I'm Benjamin Hughes."
He was dressed in a sharp suit, with black-framed glasses perched on his nose. His features weren't striking, but they were well-balanced, and he wore a friendly smile.
Eleanor kept her strained smile in place and slowly reached out her hand. "Hello."
"Let's all sit down!" Edward called out.
Everyone settled into their seats, and Edward seamlessly started discussing business matters with Gregory.
If Eleanor hadn't been so acutely aware of their intentions, she might have thought this was just a normal dinner gathering.
Benjamin sat directly across from her, but aside from their brief greeting, he didn't seem to focus much on Eleanor. Instead, he naturally joined in on the adults' conversation, his voice calm and steady.
After a few more glances at Eleanor, Caroline spoke up, "Ms. Thompson, you're 24 this year, right?"
"Yes."
"We've actually met before," Caroline continued. "About this time last year at Rosewood Hotel." Her words caught Eleanor off guard.
She immediately remembered that event—it was her and Nathaniel's first anniversary celebration. That evening, she had dressed to the nines and was the center of everyone's attention. She was the envy of every unmarried woman in Coppersville.
But Nathaniel hadn't shown up. His absence had turned Eleanor into the laughingstock of the night. Although Victoria had explained the situation to everyone at the time, it still couldn't hide the fact that Nathaniel simply didn't care about her. Even until today, Eleanor still didn't know what Nathaniel had been doing that night. He had never explained it to her.
Eleanor had thought she'd completely forgotten about it. But when Caroline brought it up again, she felt a dull ache in her chest, like an old wound being torn open.
"I never expected that we'd have the chance to meet like this today," Caroline continued.
Her tone was light, but the disdain and mockery in her eyes as she looked at Eleanor couldn't be hidden. Gregory glanced over and was about to reprimand Caroline, but Benjamin interrupted, saying, "By the way, I realize I don't have your contact information, Ms. Thompson. Would it be alright if we added each other as friends?"
His voice was calm but firm, effectively silencing Caroline.
Before Eleanor could answer, Edward spoke for her, "Of course."
"Eleanor isn't much of a talker, and she's a little reserved. But you have such a pleasant personality, Mr. Benjamin. You should take her out more and let her get some air. She tends to stay in too much."
Benjamin only smiled and turned his attention back to Eleanor.
She didn't respond to Edward's words, instead quietly placing her phone in front of Benjamin.
As Benjamin input her contact information, he took a quick glance at her.
Eleanor was quietly sipping her coffee, her gaze cast downward.
To others, her silence might have seemed like she was shy, but Benjamin could see it clearly—there was no emotion in her eyes.
To her, this social exchange was nothing more than a routine task.

###Chapter 46
The dinner concluded in an uneasy silence.
Eleanor didn’t return with Edward. Instead, she instructed the driver to take her back to her apartment.
The driver glanced at Edward for confirmation. When Edward remained silent, he signaled and took a different route.
Eleanor wasn’t in the mood to speak to Edward. She turned her head, gazing out the car window.
A moment later, her phone buzzed. She didn’t check it immediately.
However, Edward broke the silence. "That’s Benjamin, isn’t it?"
His words sounded casual, but the underlying tone carried a clear warning.
Eleanor finally unlocked her phone. Sure enough, the message was from Benjamin.
"It was a pleasure meeting you. I have two tickets to a concert tomorrow. I was wondering if you’d like to join me? Of course, I completely understand if you’re busy."
Benjamin’s invitation wasn’t abrupt, but his intentions were unmistakable.
Eleanor pursed her lips and replied, "Sure."
After sending the message, she turned her phone toward Edward. "Satisfied?"
Edward didn’t respond.
Eleanor didn’t want to look at him anymore. She said flatly, "Pull over here. I’ll walk the rest of the way."
The driver didn’t answer, nor did he dare to stop.
Eleanor glanced at Edward.
His brows were furrowed, but he finally said, "Pull over."
Only then did Eleanor turn away from him.
Before she could even push open the car door, Edward’s voice came from behind her. "Benjamin’s a good match. Though there are some issues with his leg, his overall prospects are promising. Do you understand?"
Eleanor chuckled. "If he’s so great, why don’t you have Isabella marry him instead?"
Her words left Edward speechless.
Without waiting for a reply, Eleanor closed the car door firmly and began walking away.
It was nearly 9:00 pm, but in this bustling city, the nightlife was just beginning. Neon lights flickered, and the streets buzzed with an endless stream of cars. Everything about it spoke to the city’s boundless energy.
Yet, Eleanor felt like a detached observer—someone who didn’t belong. She knew all too well that none of this belonged to her. In this vast city, there wasn’t a single place she could call home.
The next day, she arrived on time for Benjamin’s invitation. The concert he’d mentioned wasn’t by any famous orchestra. Probably because it was a workday, it wasn’t very crowded.
Benjamin had arrived early and was waiting for her at the entrance.
Eleanor approached him. "Sorry. I’m late."
"It’s fine. I just got here myself." Benjamin smiled at her.
Eleanor avoided his gaze. "Shall we go in?"
"Sure."
She wasn’t in the mood to talk, so Benjamin kept a respectful distance.
As they entered, Benjamin’s leg issue became more apparent. His uneven gait made Eleanor unconsciously adjust her pace to match his.
Just as they were about to take their seats, a surprised voice called out, "Eleanor?"
The familiar voice made Eleanor’s body stiffen for a moment. She spun around, only to see Victoria standing a few feet away.
Victoria was holding a concert ticket, her gaze first sweeping over Benjamin, then slowly turning to Eleanor.
Eleanor took a deep breath and gave her a small smile. "Hello, Victoria."
That evening, Nathaniel received a call from Victoria, asking him to come to Carter Manor for dinner. The meeting ran later than expected, and by the time he arrived at the house, Clara had already finished eating and retired upstairs.

###Chapter 47
The dining room was now quiet, with only Victoria and Nathaniel remaining at the table.
"When are you planning to move back home?" Victoria asked, her tone calm as she sipped her soup.
Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly.
"I asked you to move out before because it was inconvenient for you to live here with Eleanor. Now that you're divorced, you might as well come back," Victoria continued, her voice steady.
"No need," Nathaniel replied curtly. "It's more convenient where I am now."
"What's so convenient about it? Bringing a new girlfriend over?" Victoria's words were calm, but to Nathaniel, they carried a subtle edge of mockery.
He set his fork down and looked at her with an impassive expression.
Victoria, however, seemed unfazed and continued, "I'm serious. If you think your father's matchmaking was a mistake, then go ahead and make your own choices. I won't stop you."
She paused, then added, "There's only one condition—Isabella. I will never allow her in this house."
"Why?" Nathaniel asked, his tone neutral.
Victoria's expression darkened. "Are you seriously considering marrying her?"
"I'm just curious—why do you hate Isabella so much?"
Victoria let out a cold laugh. "Do I need a reason to hate someone?"
Nathaniel was silent, unsure how to respond.
Victoria picked up where she left off. "As long as it's not Isabella, I won't oppose you being with anyone."
"I thought you could only see..." Nathaniel hesitated for a moment before finishing his sentence, "the one my father chose for me."
It seemed he didn't even want to mention Eleanor's name.
"Eleanor?" Victoria continued to smile. "That's right. I do like her, but so what? You're divorced now, and she's already moved on, going out on blind dates with other people. Am I supposed to hold onto her and not let go?"
Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Blind dates?"
"Yes. I ran into her today at the concert hall. She was with him."
"Oh?" Nathaniel chuckled. "The cripple from the Hughes family?"
"Yes."
"The Thompsons really are desperate, aren't they?"
Victoria laughed too. "Nathaniel, if I were you, I'd take a hard look at why Eleanor would rather choose a cripple over staying married to you."
With that, she stood up and left the table.
Nathaniel remained seated, his expression unreadable.
It was a long while before he finally grabbed his coat and walked toward the door. Ethan hadn't arrived yet, but Nathaniel didn't wait. Instead, he got into the driver's seat and drove off.
Halfway down the road, Isabella's call came through.
"Nathaniel," she called his name first, her voice soft. "Are you... still busy?"
"What is it?" Nathaniel asked bluntly.
"I... I'm out having dinner with some friends, and I drank a little. I'm feeling dizzy. Can you come pick me up?"
Nathaniel frowned. "What friends?"
"Just Olivia and a few guys I don't know..."
Isabella said something else, but Nathaniel didn't catch it. At that moment, he caught sight of a familiar figure.
It was Eleanor, and she was coming out of a nearby restaurant. She was walking next to a limping man, who could only be Benjamin.
"Call Lucas and have him pick you up," Nathaniel said curtly, then hung up the phone.

---
The night air was cool as Eleanor stepped out of the restaurant, her arm lightly linked with Benjamin's. They had just finished dinner, and the conversation had been surprisingly pleasant. Benjamin, despite his physical limitations, had a sharp wit and a kind heart. Eleanor found herself enjoying his company more than she had expected.
As they walked toward the waiting car, Eleanor couldn't help but glance around the bustling street. The city lights sparkled, casting a warm glow over the evening. She felt a sense of calm she hadn't experienced in a long time.
Benjamin noticed her gaze and smiled. "Beautiful night, isn't it?"
Eleanor nodded. "It is. I haven't been out like this in a while."
"Well, I'm glad I could be the one to accompany you," Benjamin said, his tone light but sincere.
Eleanor smiled back, feeling a flicker of something she hadn't felt in years—hope.
Meanwhile, Nathaniel watched from his car, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. He couldn't quite place the emotion bubbling up inside him, but it wasn't pleasant. Seeing Eleanor with someone else, especially someone like Benjamin, stirred something deep within him—something he had tried to bury.
He drove off into the night, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn't quite articulate. The city lights blurred as he sped through the streets, the weight of his mother's words and the image of Eleanor's smile with Benjamin lingering in his mind.
The night was far from over, and Nathaniel knew one thing for certain—things were about to change.

###Chapter 48
Eleanor was dressed in a sleek black gown, her hair cascading softly over her shoulders with delicate curls at the ends. A gentle smile played on her lips, radiating an aura of tranquility.
Benjamin must have whispered something amusing, for her smile deepened, and she lifted her gaze to meet his. Her eyes sparkled like sunlight dancing on a serene lake.
Nathaniel realized he had never seen her smile like that before. In his memories, Eleanor had always been reserved, almost subdued.
But as that thought crossed his mind, another memory surfaced—a vivid one. It was from their last encounter in the car, when she had suddenly kissed him. It had been impulsive, their lips brushing as they wrestled over the sketchbook. That had been Eleanor's first kiss with him. And now, it seemed, it would also be the last.
As Nathaniel lingered on that memory, Benjamin took a few steps forward. He turned and said something else to Eleanor, who smiled and shook her head. Benjamin didn’t press further. He simply opened the car door and slid inside.
Eleanor remained standing, unmoving. The night breeze tousled her hair, and she reached up to tuck a strand behind her ear. Then, she waved goodbye to Benjamin as the car slowly pulled away. Her smile faded, her eyes downcast, lost in thought.
Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. He pressed the accelerator and pulled up beside her. The black Maserati was a car Eleanor knew all too well. At first, she thought her eyes were deceiving her. It wasn’t until he rolled down the window that she realized it was real.
"Get in," Nathaniel's voice was as cool and composed as ever.
"No, thank you," Eleanor replied, momentarily stunned but quickly regaining her composure. "I’ll take the subway."
She started to walk around his car, but Nathaniel swiftly reversed, blocking her path. He didn’t say a word, but his message was clear.
Eleanor pressed her lips together, her hand briefly clutching the fabric of her dress before she finally opened the car door. She didn’t sit in the passenger seat.
Once inside, she asked directly, "What do you want to say, Mr. Carter?"
Nathaniel didn’t respond immediately. His expression remained impassive as he started the car. He accelerated abruptly, causing Eleanor to lurch forward, nearly hitting her head on the seat in front of her. She grabbed the handrail, frowning at him.
Nathaniel seemed oblivious to her discomfort, continuing to drive without a change in demeanor.
"Nathaniel," Eleanor couldn’t hold back. "What do you want from me?"
He eased off the accelerator, slowing the car before speaking. "The Hughes family is heavily invested in new energy. They’ve made significant progress, but the future is uncertain. You’re all rushing into this. Be careful, or you might capsize."
Eleanor hadn’t expected him to bring this up. After a brief pause, she replied, "This has nothing to do with you, does it?"
Nathaniel chuckled softly. "Eleanor, it’s been less than half a month since our divorce. Don’t you think you’re moving on a little too quickly?"
Eleanor met his gaze through the rearview mirror. After a moment, she smiled faintly. "Oh, are you jealous, Mr. Carter?"
As soon as the words left her lips, Nathaniel’s brows furrowed deeply.
"Do you think that’s possible?" he retorted, his voice icy and sharp.
Clearly, he didn’t appreciate the joke. There was unmistakable disdain in his tone.
Eleanor knew it was impossible for him to be jealous. He simply didn’t want to be tied to her anymore. He didn’t want anyone talking about how quickly she had moved on after their divorce.

###Chapter 49
Eleanor knew it all, but she still found herself instinctively speaking the words aloud. Then, in his response, she heard the answer she had already anticipated, and it felt like a self-inflicted wound.
"I understand," Eleanor said. "Have you said everything you wanted to say, Mr. Carter? Can I leave now?"
Nathaniel didn't say another word, but the car slowed down slightly. Finally, he pulled over to the side of the road.
Eleanor didn't hesitate. She turned and reached for the door.
"Eleanor," he called out suddenly from behind her.
She paused while opening the door, but she didn't turn around.
Nathaniel gripped the steering wheel, carefully choosing his words. "For the sake of our time as a married couple, you... can come to me if the Morgans are facing any difficulties."
"Don't try to disgust me like this."
Eleanor slowly tightened her grip on the door handle.
After a long pause, she said, "Well, thank you, Mr. Carter."
With that, she opened the door. She didn't look at him again. After closing the door behind her, she turned and walked in the direction of the subway station.
Nathaniel sat in the car, his gaze following her figure as it grew smaller in the distance. His lips pressed into a tight line.
Of course, he knew there was no subway station anywhere near the Morgan family residence. So, where exactly was she going to take the subway now?
But the thought barely lingered in Nathaniel's mind before it vanished, as fleeting as the moment. From her response earlier, he already knew what she was doing—she was being deliberate.
Making such a show of being close to Julian and then going on a blind date with Benjamin—it was all just a ploy to get Nathaniel to speak up and help the Morgan family.
Eleanor was well aware that the thing Nathaniel disliked most was being drawn into gossip and entangled in drama.
She really would stop at nothing, wouldn't she?
Eleanor quickly returned to her rental apartment. A few minutes ago, Benjamin had sent her a message letting her know he had made it home.
"It was a pleasure talking to you today. Will we get another chance to meet up and chat over a meal sometime?"
Benjamin's words were kind, but the question was direct.
Of course, they were both adults, and it was a blind date. Subtlety didn't really seem necessary.
To be honest, Eleanor didn't dislike him. At another time, maybe she would have considered being friends with him. But now... with the reputation she had, there was no reason to drag him into the mess with her. She was about to text him a polite refusal when a call from an unfamiliar number came through. Without hesitating, she answered it.
"Luna," a raspy voice came through the phone, as though it were a sharp needle piercing into Eleanor's body.
Her face instantly drained of color, and she threw the phone to the ground.
"It's been eight years. Have you missed your father?"
The voice on the other end seemed completely unaffected by the situation. It continued, "I really missed you. See, the first thing I do when I get out is contact you."
"You're in Coppersville now, huh? Wow! An international metropolis, right? I'll come right over..."
Before he could finish, Eleanor ended the call abruptly.
To make sure he wouldn't call back, she quickly turned off the phone. Her fingers were trembling, and she struggled for a long time before finally managing to turn it off.
As the screen went dark, Eleanor threw the phone aside.

###Chapter 50
Eleanor Thompson spent the entire night wide awake. Each time she tried to close her eyes, the nightmares would come rushing back.
A damp, dark room. A door that never fully closed. Clothes mysteriously soiled. Drawers rifled through. And then, that man's repulsive, leering face.
Eight years had passed, yet Eleanor couldn't escape the haunting memories. And now, her adoptive father, Samuel Nelson, was out of prison.
He was free!
Eleanor didn't know how Samuel had gotten her number, but the suffocating feeling it brought—the sense that she could never outrun him—was all too familiar.
Even this apartment, the one she had only recently rented, no longer felt safe. She couldn't shake the sensation of unseen eyes watching her, waiting to strike.
Eleanor couldn't stay here anymore.
But where could she go?
In the end, she went to the hospital.
Eleanor knew there wasn't much Diana Moore could do for her, nor could she tell her anything. But being there and seeing her gave Eleanor a small measure of comfort.
Diana was the only person who could make her feel even a little bit safe.
But Eleanor didn't dare stay long.
She knew if Samuel really had come to Coppersville, the first place he would go would be the Harrison family residence. And given how strained her relationship with them was now, she couldn't rule out the possibility that they might give him the hospital's address.
After giving a few instructions to the nurse, Eleanor left the hospital.
Then, she turned on her phone and booked a ticket to leave Coppersville. She didn't tell anyone she was leaving. She didn't even cancel her lease. Packing only the essentials, she quietly made her way to the airport.
She booked the earliest flight she could find, not caring about the destination. It wasn't until the plane landed in an unfamiliar city that she finally began to feel a sense of clarity.
When Eleanor turned her phone back on, a string of missed calls from the Harrison family filled her screen.
Hailing a cab, she gave the driver the address of the hotel she had just booked. Once she had settled into her room, Eleanor finally returned Edward Harrison's call.
"Where are you?" His voice was sharp and cold.
"Is something wrong?" Eleanor countered.
"Someone said they saw you at the airport. Where are you going?"
She hadn't expected him to have people keep an eye on her. The realization hit like a punch to the gut, momentarily stealing her breath.
"I'm on a business trip," she answered carefully.
"Your job requires you to travel now?"
"Don't worry," Eleanor said, clutching the phone tightly to steady her voice. "I'll come back. But as for the Hughes family's matter... Let's drop it."
"Nathaniel already reached out to me. He doesn't want the rumors affecting him and even said if the Thompson family is in trouble, he's willing to help. So—"
Edward cut her off with a harsh laugh. "He's not our son-in-law anymore. What help could he possibly give us? The Thompson family needs a partner, someone who can grow with us. Nathaniel isn't a philanthropist, Eleanor. Do you really think he's acting out of kindness?"
He paused for a moment, his tone hardening. "Don't think I don't know what you're trying to do. Even if you sabotage the Hughes family arrangement, I'll find you a second, a third, however many suitors it takes. It's your responsibility as a daughter of the Thompson family!"
"You have three days to come back. If you don't, prepare to take that woman to the crematorium!" Then, the line went dead.
Eleanor gripped her phone tightly. Her throat constricted as if someone was choking her, and she was unable to make a sound. The weight of her father's words pressed down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. She glanced around the room, her mind racing with thoughts of escape, but she knew there was no way out. The walls seemed to close in on her, and she felt trapped in a web of familial obligations and expectations.
Her thoughts drifted to Nathaniel, the man she once loved, the man who had promised to stand by her side no matter what. But now, he was just another pawn in her father's game, a tool to secure the family's future. She wondered if he truly cared about her or if he was just playing along to maintain appearances.
Eleanor's heart ached as she thought about her mother, lying in a hospital bed, unaware of the turmoil surrounding her. She had always been the one person Eleanor could count on, the one who understood her struggles and supported her dreams. But now, even she was being used as leverage against her.
Tears welled up in Eleanor's eyes as she realized the gravity of her situation. She was caught between a rock and a hard place, forced to choose between her family and her own happiness. The thought of returning to the life she had fought so hard to escape filled her with dread, but the alternative was unthinkable.
She took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. She knew she had to be strong, for herself and for her mother. She couldn't let her father's threats break her. She had to find a way out, a way to protect the people she loved without sacrificing her own freedom.
Eleanor's mind raced as she considered her options. She needed a plan, a way to outmaneuver her father and secure her future. She thought about reaching out to Julian, her old friend, but she wasn't sure if she could trust him. He had always been kind to her, but she knew he had his own agenda.
She also thought about Benjamin Hughes, the man her father wanted her to marry. He was kind and gentle, but she couldn't see herself spending the rest of her life with him. She needed someone who understood her, someone who would stand by her side no matter what.
As the minutes ticked by, Eleanor's resolve hardened. She knew she couldn't let her father control her life any longer. She had to take a stand, no matter the cost. She would find a way to protect her mother and secure her own future, even if it meant going against her family.
With a determined look in her eyes, Eleanor picked up her phone and dialed a number. She knew it was a risk, but she had to try. She had to fight for her freedom, for her happiness, and for the life she deserved.
The phone rang once, twice, and then a familiar voice answered. "Hello?"
"Julian," Eleanor said, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside her. "I need your help."
There was a pause on the other end of the line, and then Julian replied, "What's going on, Eleanor?"
She took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. "I need to get out of here. I need to escape my father's control. Can you help me?"
There was another pause, and then Julian said, "I'll do whatever I can. But you need to be careful. Your father is a powerful man."
"I know," Eleanor replied, her voice trembling. "But I can't do this anymore. I can't let him control my life."
"Alright," Julian said. "Meet me at the usual place in an hour. We'll figure something out."
Eleanor nodded, even though Julian couldn't see her. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice barely audible.
She hung up the phone and took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart. She knew this was just the beginning, but she also knew she couldn't back down now. She had to fight for her freedom, no matter what it took.
As she gathered her things and prepared to leave, Eleanor felt a sense of determination wash over her. She was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, ready to fight for the life she deserved. And no matter what happened, she knew she would never let her father control her again.

###Chapter 51
Finally, Eleanor collapsed onto the couch, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. The weight of the day pressed down on her, making it hard to breathe. Just then, her phone buzzed again, the same unknown number flashing on the screen. She hadn’t saved it, but after seeing it once the previous night, it was already etched into her memory. Without a second thought, she grabbed the phone and hurled it across the room, watching it shatter against the wall.
At Carter Manor, Grace stood on the other side of the grand iron gate, her sharp eyes narrowing as she took in the disheveled man before her. "And who might you be?" she asked, her tone dripping with disdain.
"I'm Samuel Nelson, Eleanor's... I mean, Eleanor's father," the man said, flashing a grin that revealed yellowed teeth. "I know she's staying here. Tell her to come out and see me."
It was common knowledge in Coppersville that Eleanor had been missing as a child and had spent over a decade in the countryside. One look at the man, and Grace instantly recognized who he was. Her lips curled in disgust as her gaze swept over him.
"Ms. Thompson has moved out," Grace said coldly.
"Moved out? How is that possible? Isn't she—"
"She and Mr. Carter are divorced," Grace interrupted, her voice laced with irritation. "If you're looking for her, go bother the Harrison family. Now, get lost!"
"Divorced?" Samuel's face fell. He had only recently learned from the news that Eleanor had married Nathaniel, the wealthiest man in Coppersville. Just the thought of having a connection to someone so powerful had sent him into a frenzy of excitement. He never expected Eleanor and Nathaniel to be divorced!
"That's right. They've been divorced for a while now. So scram before I call security!" Grace couldn't hide her disgust. She didn't even want to look at Samuel again. Rolling her eyes, she turned and walked away.
When Grace returned inside, she found Nathaniel coming down the stairs. He was adjusting the cuffs of his shirt as he asked, "Who was outside?"
"Just someone at the wrong door," Grace replied quickly.
But Nathaniel lifted his gaze, his sharp eyes locking onto hers. Even though Grace had practically raised him and was a good 20 years his senior, that look sent a jolt through her.
She hesitated for only a moment before confessing, "That man said he was Mrs. Carter's... I mean, Ms. Thompson's father. He wanted to see her."
"Her father?" Nathaniel's brows furrowed slightly.
"It wasn't Mr. Harrison," Grace added hurriedly, immediately sensing Nathaniel's misunderstanding. "It's probably her adoptive father. You could tell just by looking at him that he's from some rural area. Strange, though... why didn't he come looking for her before?"
Nathaniel gave no response, his expression unreadable as he took a seat at the dining table.
"Should we... do something?" Grace ventured cautiously.
"If he's gone, leave it," Nathaniel said flatly, as if the man had just been an unrelated stranger to him. And in fact, Samuel was a complete stranger to Nathaniel.
Grace exhaled in relief and nodded. Changing the subject, she added, "By the way, do you have any free evenings this week, Mr. Carter?"
Nathaniel glanced up, his brow arched.
"Well, your birthday is coming up," Grace said, forcing a bright tone. "Ms. Morgan called earlier—she would like to throw you a small celebration. She was wondering when you might be available—"
"You're overstepping," Nathaniel interrupted, his voice light but pointed.
That single comment made Grace's face pale.
For a moment, she could only fumble for a response, but Nathaniel didn't wait for one. He calmly set his newspaper down, dabbed the corner of his mouth with a napkin, and stood to leave.

###Chapter 52
Thanks to Grace's reminder, Nathaniel remembered that his birthday was approaching. Once he got into the car, he instinctively pulled out the lighter he always carried. It was black and gold, unadorned except for his initials engraved in the lower corner. It was a simple, unremarkable gift. However, it was the only gift Eleanor had ever given him.
The second year... Because he hadn't bothered to show up at their anniversary party, Eleanor hadn't even sent him a perfunctory gift for his birthday last year. And this year... Nathaniel cut the thought short, slipping the lighter back into his pocket before opening the tablet in front of him.
But before he could focus, the car lurched to a sudden stop. The jarring motion made his brows furrow sharply, and his eyes were stern. Ethan hurriedly explained, "Apologies, Mr. Carter, but up ahead..." Before the man could finish, someone who had been blocking the car moved to Nathaniel's window and began banging on it. The man appeared to be in his 50s, with his hair cropped short and a grin revealing yellowed teeth as he peered in.
Nathaniel's first instinct was to ignore him, but then Grace's earlier words surfaced in his mind. Pursing his lips, he rolled down the window. "Mr. Carter, right? Hello! Wow, Mr. Carter, you're even more striking in person than in the newspapers! Truly impressive!" Nathaniel remained calm. "And you are?" "Me? Oh, I'm Eleanor-uh, no, I mean Eleanor's father! I just arrived in Coppersville. I was actually looking for her, but I couldn't find her. I never expected to run into you! What a coincidence!"
"Is there something you need?" Nathaniel asked directly. "No, nothing at all!" Samuel quickly waved his hands. "It's just that I haven't seen her in such a long time. I've been worried about how she's doing, but that br-I mean, that child won't even answer my calls. So, I had no choice but to come look for you. Do you know—" "I don't know where she is right now, either," Nathaniel cut him off. "You two really divorced?" "Yes." "But... how could you just divorce like that? Did you two have an argument? Come on. Don't be so hasty with this. Marriage is a big deal..."
Nathaniel wasn't interested in entertaining Samuel's ramblings. He glanced at Ethan, who immediately got the message and pulled the man away. Nathaniel rolled the window up and turned back to the table in his hands. Even as Ethan started the car again, Samuel's voice could still be heard, mumbling and grumbling in the background.
Nathaniel furrowed his brow slightly, then looked over at the spot beside him where Samuel had touched. He turned to Ethan. "Take the car to get washed later." "Yes, sir," Ethan replied immediately. Nathaniel hesitated for a moment before asking, "Where's Eleanor now?" Ethan was caught off guard by the question. But with only the two of them in the car, it was clear Nathaniel was speaking to him. Though Ethan didn't know, he could only respond as best he could. "I'm not really sure, sir." Nathaniel didn't say anything further. After a beat, Ethan ventured, "Should I have someone check?" "No need," Nathaniel said, his voice dropping a little. Ethan fell silent, not daring to speak further.
Nathaniel turned his attention to the tablet, pushing the encounter with Samuel from his mind. He didn't expect to see Samuel that same evening. But this time, Samuel clearly wasn't looking for him.

###Chapter 53
At the entrance of the restaurant, it was Ethan's reminder that finally drew Nathaniel's attention to the man speaking with Edward.
Looking visibly annoyed, Edward stepped around the man and walked away. However, the persistent man wasn't ready to let him go and followed closely behind. Seeing that Edward was about to get into his car, he raised his voice. "Mr. Harrison, if you don't agree, I'll have no choice but to go back to Mr. Carter and tell him everything about Eleanor."
Nathaniel had been ready to leave. After all, neither Eleanor nor the Harrison family had anything to do with him anymore. But upon hearing Samuel's words, he suddenly froze mid-step.
"Mr. Carter?" Lucas called out, but Nathaniel ignored him, turning his head to the side to see that the previously indifferent Edward had already let Samuel into his car.
Nathaniel narrowed his eyes slightly.
"Mr. Carter, the 'Eleanor' that he mentioned..." Lucas spoke with confusion. But before he could ask, Nathaniel had already climbed into his car.
Lucas exchanged confused looks with Ethan before following suit.
Nathaniel, who had drunk a few glasses of wine earlier, closed his eyes as soon as he got inside the vehicle. Meanwhile, Lucas sat in the passenger seat, not even daring to look back at him.
A short while into the drive, Nathaniel suddenly said, "Look into it."
Taken aback, Lucas asked reflexively, "Look into what?"
Nathaniel turned to look out the window. "Eleanor's adoptive father."
Eleanor was sick. After spending a sleepless night, she arrived in this unfamiliar city, only to collapse into bed, unable to get up again.
If the hotel staff hadn't noticed that she hadn't left her room all day, and if the cleaning crew hadn't repeatedly knocked on her door, she might've remained unconscious in bed for who knew how long.
"Do you have any friends or family here?" a hotel employee asked her.
"No."
"Then... should we contact your colleague for you?"
"I'm fine," Eleanor replied as she swallowed a fever pill. "It's just a cold and fever."
"But..." The staff hesitated.
Eleanor knew what she was thinking and gave her a smile. "Don't worry. I won't die in your hotel. I'll... leave tomorrow."
"It's not that. I'm just worried about you," the young woman said quickly while setting a bowl of soup on the bedside table. "Try to eat something. Just call the front desk if you need anything."
Eleanor glanced at the bowl of soup and gently thanked her.
After the woman left, Eleanor's gaze lingered on the bowl of soup for a long time before she finally forced herself to get up from the bed.
Her phone screen displayed countless missed calls—some from Samuel and some from Edward.
After failing to reach her, Edward even left her a text message which read, "Samuel found his way here. Stay away from the Harrison residence for now. Don't contact him."
Eleanor stared at the words, feeling nothing. She knew he wasn't trying to protect her. He just wanted to avoid a scandal.
After all, her divorce had already been a public embarrassment. If events from her past were exposed... Eleanor suddenly recalled something.
Just then, her phone vibrated with Samuel's incoming call.

###Chapter 54
Eleanor returned to Coppersville. She wasn’t sure if Edward still had people watching her, but she made no effort to avoid meeting Samuel. They met at Quivo, a famous restaurant in Coppersville. When Eleanor arrived, Samuel was already there, sitting in a chair with one leg crossed over the other, shamelessly flirting with a waitress.
His gaze was predatory, and his words were crude. The young waitress, visibly uncomfortable, kept her head down while clutching the menu tightly. Even though Eleanor had mentally prepared herself for this encounter, the sight of Samuel still made her stomach churn. At that moment, Samuel noticed her. He immediately stood up and waved eagerly. "Eleanor!"
With clenched fists, Eleanor approached the table. The waitress, seeing her arrival, quickly set down the menu and fled as if she’d been granted a reprieve. Samuel’s gaze lingered on the waitress’ retreating figure for a moment before turning his attention back to Eleanor. "Long time no see, Eleanor! You’ve grown even more stunning!"
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her hand, but Eleanor instantly pulled back and glared at him coldly. Samuel chuckled and said, "What’s with the attitude? I’m your father!"
"What do you want?" Eleanor asked bluntly.
"Oh, don’t be so cold, Eleanor. Regardless of what happened, I raised you for ten years. Now that you’ve hit the jackpot and become a Thompson, you’re just going to forget about me?"
Eleanor’s face remained impassive, but under the table, her hands were clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. This was the only way she could keep herself grounded, preventing herself from walking away on the spot.
Samuel continued, "Ah, you know I’m not good for much. And after being locked up for so many years, this world feels like a completely different place. I have no other children. I only have you to rely on to take care of me in my old age."
When he finished, Eleanor couldn’t help but let out a bitter laugh. "Are you asking me to give you money?"
"A little bit of money is nothing for you, right? Especially now that you’re..."
"Didn’t you already go to Edward? Didn’t he give you money?"
Samuel was caught off guard by the mention of Edward, her biological father. His lips curled in dissatisfaction. "That father of yours is a miser. I had to practically beg just to get a measly few hundred thousand dollars from him. That’s barely enough to buy a house!"
"I don’t have money," Eleanor said flatly.
Samuel’s eyes narrowed. "You’re lying."
"I came here today to tell you that we have no ties anymore. Don’t interfere in my life again from now on," Eleanor said, then stood up, ready to leave.
But Samuel let out a cold laugh. "You’re joking, right? Now that you’re all rich and fancy, you’re going to just abandon your father?"
"Eleanor... That’s your name now, isn’t it? Let me tell you something. To me, you’ll always be Eleanor Nelson. And if you don’t give me money, I’ll expose every dirty secret from back then. Let’s see how those people will treat the precious Thompson heiress after that."
Samuel’s voice was loud, causing other diners to look over curiously. Some seemed to recognize Eleanor, their gazes shifting between her and Samuel as they whispered among themselves.
Eleanor stood rooted to the spot, her heart pounding. She knew Samuel was capable of anything, and the thought of him revealing her past filled her with dread. But she also knew she couldn’t let him control her life anymore.
"Fine," she said through gritted teeth. "I’ll give you what you want. But this is the last time. After this, you stay out of my life. Forever."
Samuel smirked, clearly pleased with himself. "That’s more like it. I knew you’d come around."
Eleanor didn’t respond. She simply turned and walked out of the restaurant, her mind racing with thoughts of how to handle this situation without letting Samuel destroy everything she had worked so hard to build.

###Chapter 55
After a brief pause, Eleanor turned back and said, "Go ahead and tell them."
Her response left Samuel stunned. Before he could react, Eleanor had already walked away.
Furious, Samuel slammed his hand on the table and got up to follow her, only to be stopped by a waiter. "Sir, you haven't settled your bill yet."
"What bill? I didn't even order anything!"
"Sir, even without ordering, we still charge a seating fee," said the waiter, his eyes scanning Samuel with unconcealed disdain.
Samuel trembled with anger. He was about to slap his bank card—which held his last 50 thousand dollars—onto the waiter's face when another voice interjected, "I'll take care of it."
Hearing the voice, Samuel's expression shifted abruptly. He turned around to see Isabella handing her card to the waiter.
She then turned and smiled at him. "You must be Mr. Nelson, right?"
"And you are?"
"I'm Eleanor's sister, Isabella."
"Ah, the little orphan the Thompsons picked up." Samuel sneered, his gaze roaming over Isabella. "What? You got something to say to me?"
Samuel's gaze and tone made Isabella's skin crawl, but she kept her composure, smiling faintly as she said, "Mr. Nelson, I overheard your conversation with Eleanor just now."
"Oh? And?"
"You're in need of money now, aren't you?" Isabella grinned before continuing, "I have an idea to make Eleanor willingly support you. Would you like to hear it?"
Eleanor walked out of the restaurant with hurried footsteps, as if she were running from something terrifying.
In reality, she knew that Samuel could no longer truly hurt her. She wasn't the powerless little girl who didn't know how to fight back anymore.
Yet, seeing him again still instilled fear in her. Like a young elephant tied to a stake, she felt like she would never be able to escape that stake for the rest of her life.
Her anxiety caused her to dash across the street without checking for traffic. A car screeched to a halt, nearly knocking into her.
"Are you crazy?" the driver shouted at her.
Eleanor didn't respond and simply kept walking forward. The driver continued cursing, but she didn't hear a word.
It wasn't until much later, when she finally calmed down, that she noticed her phone ringing. She stared at the name on the screen for a long time before deciding to answer the call.
"You finally picked up," came a relieved voice. "Where have you been these past two days? I kept calling, but your phone was off. I even asked your father, and he said you were sick."
"I'm... fine."
"I wanted to visit, but your father refused. Is it... because you don't want to see me?" Benjamin asked.
"No," Eleanor answered briskly.
Benjamin didn't press further, though his displeasure at her sudden disappearance was clearly reflected in his voice.
Eleanor decided to take this opportunity to clear things up, but before she could begin, Benjamin spoke again, "Are you free tomorrow? Let's have dinner. I have something to tell you."
His tone was serious, and Eleanor knew that she owed him an explanation. So, she agreed, "Okay."

###Chapter 56
Eleanor and Benjamin met at an exclusive dining spot. Despite having lived in Coppersville for several years, Eleanor would never have discovered this hidden gem if Benjamin hadn't brought her there that evening.
The restaurant was nestled on the outskirts of Coppersville, where the urban landscape gradually gave way to rural tranquility. It boasted pristine white walls, sleek black tiles, serene lotus ponds, and lush bamboo groves. At first glance, Eleanor mistook it for a picturesque garden rather than a dining establishment.
The proprietor was a young woman whose appearance was understated, yet she carried herself with an air of grace and spoke with refined elegance.
It appeared that Benjamin had made all the necessary arrangements in advance. Without even taking their order, the woman simply served them coffee and discreetly exited the room.
"Their ingredients are sourced fresh daily. So, I had to pre-order the dishes yesterday. I hope that's alright," Benjamin explained with a gentle smile.
One wouldn't be able to discern from his expression that he had been irked by Eleanor's two-day radio silence.
Eleanor shook her head. "It's fine."
Benjamin poured her a cup of coffee. "This coffee is their house specialty. The beans were cultivated on a plantation owned by the owner's grandfather. You can't find this blend anywhere else."
"I see," Eleanor replied absent-mindedly. She sipped the coffee, unable to fully appreciate its exquisite flavor.
Benjamin continued to engage her in light-hearted conversation—ranging from movies to music and cuisine. His tone was steady, and the dialogue was sufficiently engaging to keep Eleanor's mind occupied.
In truth, she enjoyed his company, and she couldn't fathom why he remained single. Despite his imperfections, he hailed from a prominent background, and marriage wouldn't pose a challenge if he desired it.
"Actually, I've seen you before," Benjamin suddenly revealed.
Eleanor blinked in surprise.
"I think it was about two years ago. I visited Coppersville University, and you were performing in a play with your classmates. I was in the audience."
"Romeo and Juliet?"
"Yes." Benjamin smiled. "You still remember?"
"I've only performed on stage in university that one time." Eleanor's brows furrowed slightly. "But that time, I... didn't even have any lines, did I?"
"You didn't, but I still noticed you. You were stunning," Benjamin said with a bright smile.
His unexpected compliment caught Eleanor off guard. She had assumed their relationship was merely a matter of family alliance. But now, it seemed there might be more to it than she had anticipated.
Benjamin was about to elaborate when the restaurant owner's voice suddenly rang out from the entrance, "Mr. Carter, welcome!"
Eleanor immediately turned her head toward the door, only to see the cheerful owner leading a man over. He was dressed in a black suit paired with a white shirt—a simple yet classic combination of colors. The outfit amplified his dignified presence, and combined with his strikingly handsome face, he drew the attention of everyone around.
Soon, his gaze landed on Eleanor. She froze, quickly averting her eyes and lowering her gaze.
Across from her, Benjamin promptly stood up and greeted him, "Mr. Carter."
Nathaniel stopped beside their table.
"What a coincidence," Benjamin remarked as he extended a hand.
Nathaniel's somber eyes lingered on Benjamin's extended hand for a moment before he reached out and shook it. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hughes."

###Chapter 57
"I didn't expect to see you here tonight, Mr. Carter. Had I known, I would've invited you to join us," Benjamin said with a smile, his tone calm and composed, showing no signs of awkwardness.
Nathaniel released his grip and glanced at Eleanor, who kept her head down, clearly unwilling to acknowledge him.
Withdrawing his gaze, Nathaniel replied to Benjamin, "Since you're on a date, I won't disturb you. Goodbye."
"Alright. See you."
After the brief exchange, the restaurant owner continued to escort Nathaniel inside, while Benjamin returned to his seat across from Eleanor.
"I didn't know he'd be here tonight," Benjamin explained.
"It's fine," Eleanor responded with a smile, her expression quickly returning to normal.
Benjamin didn't press further, though the atmosphere now felt tense and awkward. With him no longer driving the conversation, an uncomfortable silence settled between them.
Eleanor hesitated for a moment.
As she prepared to tell Benjamin her decision, a voice suddenly interrupted them, "Well, well, Eleanor!"
Eleanor's body tensed instinctively upon hearing the voice. Looking up, she saw Samuel grinning as he approached their table. "Having dinner, huh?"
"And you are?" Benjamin asked, confused.
"Why, hello! You must be Mr. Hughes," Samuel exclaimed while shaking Benjamin's hand. "What an impressive man you are! I'm Eleanor's father—well, her adoptive father from the countryside."
Samuel's loud voice cut through the quiet ambiance of the restaurant, drawing the attention of nearby diners.
Feeling a little uncomfortable, Benjamin turned to glance at Eleanor. "Eleanor, this is your adoptive father?"
"That's right! I was away for a few years and couldn't visit her, but when I heard about your plans to get married, I rushed over to meet you. After all, her last marriage ended badly, and I need to make sure she's in good hands this time..."
"Samuel," a cold, crisp voice interrupted him.
Samuel paused mid-sentence, shifting his gaze toward Eleanor. Her head was now raised, and she said resolutely, "Get out."
Her commanding tone left Benjamin stunned. The Eleanor he knew was always soft-spoken and gentle. But in this moment, she resembled a porcupine with its quills raised, like a fierce wild animal protecting its territory.
But in the face of her demand, Samuel simply laughed it off, pulled out a chair, and sat down. "What's with the hostility? Since I'm here, aren't you going to invite me to join you for dinner?"
Then, turning to Benjamin, he continued, "Don't be surprised. I'm just a country bumpkin, after all. Ever since reconnecting with her rich city dad, she's looked down on me. You saw it yourself—she won't even acknowledge me!"
Benjamin didn't respond, glancing at Eleanor with furrowed brows. The latter stood up abruptly.
"What? Am I wrong?" Samuel wore a smug expression on his face as he spoke. "Don't let your current status as the esteemed Ms. Thompson fool you. Back in the countryside..."
Samuel deliberately trailed off, his words suggestive as he smiled at Eleanor.
The implied threat in his tone was clear, but Eleanor challenged his warning and asked, "What about back in the countryside?"

###Chapter 58
Samuel remained silent, narrowing his eyes at Eleanor.
Eleanor chuckled. "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?"
"Eleanor," Benjamin interjected. Sensing the rising tension, he stood up and tugged on her hand.
But Eleanor stood firm. "You're not leaving, huh? Fine, then I'll go."
With that, she turned to leave. Benjamin started to follow, but he heard Samuel say mockingly, "Ah, living as a rich heiress for a few years really boosts your confidence! But Eleanor, don't forget your roots. If it weren't for me, you'd have starved to death ages ago. Then, where would you get the strength to boss people around like this? And now, you've turned your back on me because I'm of no use to you? Let me tell you, Eleanor. I've been holding back out of respect for the fact that you're my daughter. But if you keep being so heartless, don't blame me for spilling all your dirty secrets!"
As Samuel finished speaking, Eleanor's footsteps slowly came to a stop. She turned to look back, only to see him smirking confidently, as if certain that he had already won.
Eleanor knew exactly why he was so confident. He believed he held a trump card—her dark, shameful past that she couldn't allow to surface. Hence, he expected Eleanor to bow her head to him.
But to his shock, Eleanor looked straight at him and broke into laughter.
Samuel's heart jolted upon seeing her reaction, and before he could respond, Eleanor asked, "What secrets? Are you talking about the time you almost took advantage of me?"
Though her tone was calm, her hands were clenched by her sides so tightly that her nails dug into her palms, breaking the skin. The sharp, shooting pain coursed through her body, like a sharp blade gouging out the festering wound she had buried deep within herself and exposing it to the whole world.
Benjamin immediately turned to look at her, his eyes wide in shock. His already unstable frame staggered. Though the restaurant wasn't very busy, there were still quite a number of people. Eleanor's words were like a bomb exploding and sending shockwaves throughout the room.
Eleanor could already foresee that by the next day—no, later that night—this news would spread like wildfire throughout their social circles.
The restaurant was in an uproar, while Samuel remained silent, his face distorting with anger.
"Now, this matter is no longer news." Enduring the pain in her heart, Eleanor took a deep breath and then continued, "So, don't even think about using it to threaten me again."
She finished her sentence in one breath.
She had thought that she would feel liberated after letting it out. But in reality, she had overestimated herself. As soon as the words left her mouth, it felt as though she was living that day over again.
A man reeking of alcohol, and his expression menacing. The sound of clothes being ripped.
It all happened in that damp and dark room.
Thinking about it now, it felt like she was an elephant tied to a post. With every pull, it tore at her flesh and caused her agonizing pain.
Benjamin looked at her with shock and a trace of disgust, and Eleanor felt her chest tighten, making it hard for her to breathe.
But it wasn't because of Benjamin. It was simply because... she had seen that look too many times before. When she returned to the Thompson family, wasn't that how they all had looked at her?
And now, Eleanor knew that soon, everyone would be looking at her the same way again.

###Chapter 59
Everyone in the world... was the same.
Even if she spoke the truth, and everyone knew she was the victim, so what? Even her own biological mother couldn't accept her and treated her with disdain. What more could she expect from others?
Eleanor didn't stay any longer to be made a fool of. After casting a glance at Benjamin, she turned to leave. "Eleanor! Stop it right there, you bitch!" Samuel's voice roared from behind, but Eleanor didn't even flinch. Instead, she quickened her pace.
She had planned to hail a taxi and leave immediately. But upon leaving the restaurant, she realized there was still a considerable distance to the main road. Plus, this area was catered to the wealthy, meaning there was no use for taxis here.
So now, she was the only person on this empty road.
Eleanor pulled out her phone to call for an e-hailing ride. But as she held her phone, she found her fingers trembling uncontrollably.
It took her several minutes just to unlock the device, and when she finally did, she couldn't locate the e-hailing app.
Her mind went blank, her fingers still trembling violently.
At this moment, a beam of car headlights shone brightly onto Eleanor, startling her and causing her to retreat several steps back.
The car's back window rolled down swiftly, and the person inside ordered her to get in, his voice devoid of any emotion.
But Eleanor knew that after the scene she had just caused in the restaurant, there was no way he didn't know. He must've heard... every word.
Eleanor stared at him, searching his eyes for a hint of surprise, disgust, or judgment. But there was none.
His deep gaze was fixed on her, showing no sign of extra emotion.
Eleanor wasn't sure if it was because he had already processed his reaction or... he genuinely didn't care. She stood still, not moving.
Nathaniel's gaze lingered on her pale face for a moment before slowly lowering to her hand, which was still clutching her phone so tightly that even the veins on the back of her hand were bulging.
His lips pressed into a tight line. Finally, he got down from the car and grabbed her wrist.
Eleanor didn't resist. Even when he guided her into the car, she showed no signs of defiance. Her earlier hesitation seemed to have just been her not knowing what to do.
As the car door closed again, Nathaniel released his grip on her wrist. It was only then that Eleanor seemed to finally regain her composure.
She leaned against the opposite car door, turning her head to look out the window.
Nathaniel's hand, which was gripping hers earlier, slowly balled into a fist.
Eleanor had done her makeup that night. Her hair was tied back in her usual low ponytail, but it was now slightly disheveled, with loose strands falling around her ears. Motionless, she stared out the window like a cold, unyielding statue.
However, the redness at the corners of her eyes could not fool anyone.
Yet, even at a time like this, she hadn't shed a single tear in front of him.
Remembering how she had cried uncontrollably in Julian's arms before, Nathaniel's gaze darkened.
Just as he was about to say something, Eleanor spoke first. "Thank you, Mr. Carter. You can drop me off at the nearest subway station. I'll make my own way home."

###Chapter 60
Nathaniel remained silent, his stoic expression giving nothing away. Without his explicit command, Ethan naturally ignored Eleanor's request to stop the car.
Eleanor's fists clenched tighter, her nails digging into her palms. She knew Nathaniel didn't care about her. To him, she was likely nothing more than a pawn, a woman with no dignity left to preserve. Yet, despite everything, she still wanted to hold onto the last shred of pride she had left.
It didn't matter if he looked down on her, mocked her, or despised her like everyone else. She just wanted to step out of that car with her head held high, even if it was for the last time.
But even this small request seemed too much to ask. Without Nathaniel's word, Ethan continued driving, the car moving steadily toward an unknown destination.
Eleanor wanted to say something, to plead with him, but her phone rang, cutting through the tense silence. The name on the screen was exactly who she had expected.
"Eleanor, get back here right now!" Edward's furious voice exploded through the phone, shattering the fragile calm in the car.
Eleanor wasn't surprised. She simply ended the call and turned her gaze back to Nathaniel, her eyes pleading silently.
Before she could speak, Nathaniel's voice cut through the air, cold and commanding. "To the Harrison residence."
Her heart sank, but she quickly masked her emotions. She lowered her gaze and let out a soft, bitter laugh. Of course. He wouldn't even grant her the smallest mercy.
Back when they were married, the Harrisons had hidden the truth from him. Though they were divorced now, once the rumors started spreading, his name would inevitably be dragged through the mud. And Nathaniel Carter despised nothing more than being associated with scandal.
"Eleanor!"
The moment she stepped out of the car, Isabella rushed toward her, her expression a mix of concern and thinly veiled hostility. Her sharp eyes immediately landed on Nathaniel, and she quickly adjusted her tone.
"Nathaniel, why are you here? Did you... bring Eleanor here?" Her gaze flicked toward Eleanor as she spoke, a hint of something darker lurking beneath her polite facade.
But Eleanor didn't even spare Isabella a glance. She brushed past her and headed inside, her steps steady despite the storm brewing within.
Isabella reached for Nathaniel's hand, her voice softening. "Nathaniel, don't go in yet. Daddy is furious tonight. I've never seen him this angry before."
Eleanor wasn't walking particularly fast, so she naturally overheard Isabella's words. But even then, her footsteps didn't falter. She moved toward the light, her silhouette unwavering, as if she were unafraid of whatever awaited her.
Nathaniel's brows furrowed slightly as he watched her, a flicker of something unreadable crossing his features.
Isabella continued, her voice trembling with feigned guilt. "I'm sorry, Nathaniel. We all knew we shouldn't have kept this from you. We should have told you before you and Eleanor got married, but she begged us not to say a word. As her sister, I had no choice."
She looked up at him, her eyes red and pleading. "Nathaniel, you... don't blame me, do you?"
He lowered his gaze, his expression unreadable as he briefly met her tearful eyes. "No," he said simply.
"You ungrateful wretch!"
The moment Eleanor stepped into the house, Edward's hand came down hard across her face. The force of the slap sent her reeling, her ears ringing and the metallic taste of blood filling her mouth. But Edward wasn't done.
He grabbed a nearby vase and hurled it at her, his rage unchecked. The porcelain shattered against the wall, missing her by inches, but the message was clear.
Eleanor stood her ground, her chin lifted defiantly, even as the world around her seemed to crumble.

###Chapter 61
Eleanor managed to dodge just in time. The vase crashed onto the floor, shattering into countless pieces. Sharp shards sliced into her calves, causing blood to seep through her stockings. Yet, in that chaotic moment, no one seemed to notice.
Edward pointed an accusatory finger at her, his voice trembling with rage. "You did this on purpose, didn't you? Making a scene in front of everyone, just to ruin yourself completely! You wanted all of Coppersville to know you're damaged goods, didn't you? How did I end up with such a disgraceful daughter? If I had known, I would've strangled you the moment you were born! I never should have brought you back into this family. All you've done is tarnish the Harrison name!"
The room fell silent, the weight of Edward's words hanging heavily in the air. His voice echoed through the high-ceilinged living room, each word cutting into Eleanor like a blade. Yet, she felt no pain. She didn't flinch or avert her gaze. Instead, she stood tall, her eyes locked onto Edward's, unyielding.
"You still dare to look at me like that? Fine! If I don't beat you to death today, my name isn't Edward Harrison!" he roared, unbuckling his belt with trembling hands. Just as he raised it, ready to strike, a voice cut through the tension from the doorway.
"Mr. Harrison!"
Edward froze mid-action, his arm suspended in the air. Isabella gasped dramatically, her hand flying to her chest. "Eleanor!" she cried, rushing forward and throwing her arms around her sister. "Eleanor, are you okay? Daddy, how could you...?" Tears streamed down Isabella's face, her expression one of heartbreak and concern. But Eleanor remained unmoved, her lips pressed into a thin line as she turned her gaze toward the door.
Nathaniel stood there, his expression unreadable. His eyes briefly met Eleanor's before shifting to Edward. "We need to talk," he said, his voice calm but firm.
Edward hadn't expected Nathaniel to show up at this moment. The rumors must have already spread. By morning, Eleanor's scandal would be the talk of the town. His expression darkened, but he couldn't refuse Nathaniel. After a tense pause, he took a deep breath and turned around. "This way," he muttered, leading Nathaniel upstairs.
Margaret had been standing quietly on the sidelines, her face pale and conflicted. Perhaps shaken by Edward's earlier outburst, she hesitated before approaching Eleanor. "Eleanor... Why must you do this? Your father already told you to stay away for now, to keep your distance from Benjamin. But you... Do you realize everything you said tonight has been recorded? The entire social circle is talking about it! What do you gain from this?"
Eleanor suddenly laughed, a bitter, hollow sound that caught Margaret off guard. "Well..." she began, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "After all... Benjamin has already decided to call off our relationship, hasn't he? If I'm not mistaken, the real reason Edward is furious is because of that. Am I right? With this scandal spreading, not only will Benjamin refuse to continue with me, but I'll also be deemed worthless in the marriage market. That's why he's so angry, isn't it?"
"You..." Margaret's eyes widened in shock and anger. She stammered for a moment before snapping, "How could you think of your father like that?!"
Eleanor chuckled softly, her gaze cold and unyielding. "Am I wrong?" she asked, her voice steady. The question hung in the air, unanswered, as the tension in the room thickened.

###Chapter 62
"Eleanor, how could you speak to Mom like that?"
Before Margaret could say anything, Isabella had already rushed over, her eyes brimming with tears as she looked at Eleanor. "She genuinely cares about you. You can't misunderstand her like this!"
Eleanor no longer wanted to engage with them. She felt nothing but disgust when she looked at them now. Without responding to Isabella, she turned to leave.
"Eleanor!"
Isabella wanted to chase after her, but Margaret stopped her and shouted at Eleanor, "Fine! Eleanor, once you walk out that door, don't even think about coming back. You can starve out there for all I care."
Hearing this, Eleanor paused for a moment.
Margaret thought she had reconsidered her actions, but to her surprise, Eleanor turned around and said, "Then, I thank you for that."
Her voice was calm, but to Margaret, it felt like a venomous snake watching its prey, flicking its tongue ominously.
Margaret couldn't help but take two steps back, her face turning pale.
Isabella quickly reached out to steady her. "Mom, are you okay? Do you want to go to the hospital?" Margaret shook her head repeatedly, unable to speak. She pushed Isabella's hand aside and stumbled forward on her own.
Isabella stood rooted to the spot, her worried expression quickly fading. Just then, her phone rang. "I've done everything you asked. When will I get the money?" The man on the other end demanded rudely.
Isabella rolled her eyes and answered, "Don't worry. I'll transfer the money to you tomorrow. But remember, you've never seen me, and don't ever call me again. Got it?"
By the time Nathaniel left the Thompson residence, it was nearing midnight. Ethan was waiting outside and immediately opened the car door upon seeing him approach.
To his surprise, Eleanor was still in the car.
She was leaning against the car window with her eyes closed. However, as soon as Nathaniel entered, she instantly woke up and smoothed her messy hair.
Although she knew it couldn't hide her swollen cheek, she hoped that Nathaniel, sitting on the other side, wouldn't be able to see it. She then straightened her posture and asked, "What did you talk about with Edward?"
"Business matters," Nathaniel replied curtly, clearly not intending to elaborate.
Eleanor found it amusing. It was almost midnight. Why would they discuss business at this time?
However, she chose not to expose his lie. Instead, she said, "It was wrong of me to keep that secret from you earlier."
She turned toward him and added seriously, "You might not care, but I was wrong to hide it from you. I owe you an apology. I'm sorry."
"But in our two years of marriage... aside from that one secret, I don't believe I've ever wronged you. As for the child... I resented you for a while, but it's in the past. Now, we're even."
"I don't know what you and Edward talked about, and it might not have anything to do with me. But since you won't tell me, then it's between the two of you. Don't involve me in it any further."
Eleanor had already drafted this speech beforehand, so her words were calm and composed as she spoke to Nathaniel. Nathaniel turned his head and fixed his gaze on her intently before suddenly asking, "Why did you want a divorce?"

###Chapter 63
Nathaniel's question caught Eleanor off guard. For a moment, she thought she had misheard him. It took her several seconds to regain her composure. A faint smile curled at the corners of her lips. "Mr. Carter, don't you think it's a bit late to ask that now?"
Nathaniel's eyes narrowed slightly. He had assumed her first mention of divorce was just a tantrum, something he could tolerate once. So when she brought it up again, he agreed without hesitation. Was it out of spite? Perhaps. He had been certain she would regret it. But now, it seemed he was wrong.
Just two days ago, he had learned about her past. Her adoptive father, Samuel, was in prison, and her adoptive mother, Diana, lay in a coma in the hospital. She had never shared any of this with him. Only then did he realize how little he truly knew her.
"But whatever the reason, it doesn't matter now," Eleanor's voice broke the silence. "You can rest assured that Benjamin won't be seeing me anymore after tonight. The things you were worried about won't happen, and we probably won't cross paths again."
She paused, her gaze steady. "We were once husband and wife, no matter what. I wish you all the best, Mr. Carter. May you achieve everything you desire."
Her words were sincere, her tone calm. Nathaniel stared at her for a long moment before he suddenly laughed. "Pull over," he said.
Eleanor understood his intention and turned decisively, not looking back at him. As she opened the car door, he spoke again, his voice low. "What happened back then wasn't your fault."
The words were casual, almost dismissive, like tossing a crumb of sympathy to a stray animal. She knew he wasn't a kind man. But as she had said, they were once husband and wife. This was the first time he had offered her any form of comfort. It turned out he did understand. He just never cared to say it.
How could he not understand? She had seen his gentleness before—just never directed at her.
If she had heard those words before their divorce, she might have been deeply moved. She might have fallen back into that abyss without hesitation. But it was too late now. She would never let herself be consumed by that dream again.
She closed her eyes tightly, forcing back the tears that threatened to fall. Then she turned to look at him one last time. "Thank you."
With that, she stepped out of the car and closed the door firmly behind her. The car pulled away, leaving her standing alone on the quiet street. The night air was cool, and she took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the past finally begin to lift.
Eleanor walked away, her steps steady and determined. She had awakened from the dream that had held her captive for years. And this time, she wouldn't look back.
After driving for some time, the driver couldn't help but speak up, "Mr. Carter, it's getting late. Wouldn't it be unsafe to leave Ms. Thompson alone?"
Nathaniel's gaze lifted, his icy stare sending a chill down the driver's spine. Just as the driver was about to apologize for overstepping, Nathaniel spoke, his voice cold and detached, "She doesn't seem to care about her own safety. Why should you?"
Ethan, the driver, caught the underlying tone in Nathaniel's words. It was clear that Nathaniel had been waiting for Eleanor to ask him to take her home. But she hadn't. And that silence spoke volumes.
The car continued to glide through the dimly lit streets, the tension palpable. Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he stared out the window, his mind undoubtedly replaying the events of the evening. Eleanor's stubborn independence was both a source of frustration and admiration for him. She had always been this way, even when they were married. She never asked for help, never leaned on anyone, not even him.
Ethan glanced at Nathaniel through the rearview mirror, sensing the storm brewing within the man. He knew better than to say anything more. Nathaniel Carter was not a man who appreciated unsolicited advice or concern, especially when it came to Eleanor Thompson.
As the car turned onto the quiet street where Eleanor's apartment was located, Nathaniel's expression darkened. He had hoped, perhaps foolishly, that she would have reached out by now. But she hadn't. And that only fueled his frustration.
The car came to a stop in front of her building. Nathaniel hesitated for a moment, his hand resting on the door handle. He could go up, demand an explanation, or at least make sure she was safe. But he knew better. Eleanor would see it as an intrusion, another attempt to control her life.
With a sigh, he leaned back in his seat, his resolve hardening. "Drive on," he said, his voice low and firm.
Ethan nodded, pulling away from the curb. The silence in the car was deafening, the weight of unspoken words hanging heavy in the air. Nathaniel's mind raced, his thoughts a tangled web of anger, concern, and something else he couldn't quite name.
As the car disappeared into the night, Eleanor stood by her window, watching the taillights fade into the distance. She had seen the car stop, had seen Nathaniel hesitate. Part of her had wanted him to come up, to demand an explanation, to fight for her. But another part of her, the part that had been hurt too many times, was relieved when he drove away.
She turned away from the window, her heart heavy. The night stretched out before her, long and lonely. But she was used to it. She had always been alone, even when she wasn't. And maybe, just maybe, that was how it was meant to be.

###Chapter 64
Eleanor collapsed onto her bed, exhaustion pulling her into a deep sleep almost instantly. Unsurprisingly, she was soon trapped in a nightmare, her mind replaying the chaos of the past few days.
When she woke, half of her pillow was damp with tears. The first light of dawn was breaking through the curtains, casting a soft glow across the room. She sat up, her mind still foggy, and reached for her phone.
She had expected a flood of messages and missed calls, but to her surprise, there were none. Not a single notification. She quickly checked the news and social media, but there was no trace of the scandal she had feared. Even within their social circle, there wasn’t a whisper of what had happened.
Olivia, Isabella’s best friend, would have been the first to gloat if she had caught wind of it. But Olivia had been silent. This could only mean one thing: someone had suppressed the news. And the only person with the power to do that was Nathaniel.
Eleanor shook her head, dismissing the thought as soon as it crossed her mind. Nathaniel? No, that couldn’t be possible. He had no reason to protect her, not after everything that had happened between them.
For the next few days, she kept an eye out for any rumors, but nothing surfaced. Instead, she stumbled upon another piece of news: Julian and Isabella were getting engaged.
The headline caught her off guard, and she stared at her phone for a moment, processing the information. But it didn’t take long for it to make sense. With Eleanor out of the picture, Isabella was the Swanson family’s only option for a marriage alliance. And the Whitaker family had been hinting at a union for months, so the engagement wasn’t entirely unexpected.
Still, Eleanor couldn’t help but feel a pang of something—disappointment? Resentment? She wasn’t sure. She had learned about the engagement online, so she wasn’t entirely convinced it was true. But before she could dwell on it, her editor, Caroline, messaged her. The printing house had finished her books.
Even though her latest project had been discontinued, the publication plans for her previous two works were still on track. She would need to sign the copies once they arrived, which meant she had no time to waste on distractions.
Just as she was about to order takeout, her phone buzzed. Julian’s name flashed on the screen.
Her hand froze. They hadn’t spoken since she had bluntly rejected him. In truth, Eleanor would have liked to remain friends with him, but it was clear Julian didn’t share the sentiment.
The call ended while she hesitated over whether to answer. She let out a sigh of relief, but it was short-lived. Julian called again almost immediately.
“Do you have time? I’d like to take you out for a meal,” he said without preamble when she answered.
Eleanor couldn’t tell if it was her imagination, but there was a coldness in his voice that reminded her of Nathaniel. It sent a shiver down her spine.
“Sure,” she agreed after a moment’s hesitation.
They arranged to meet at a high-end restaurant in Coppersville. Julian had reserved a private room, and by the time Eleanor arrived, the dishes were already laid out. There were a few homestyle dishes and, to her surprise, a dessert. She paused at the sight, her mind racing.
“You’re here,” Julian greeted her casually. “Have a seat.”
The table was large, easily five feet in diameter. Sitting directly across from him felt too formal, so she chose a seat two spots away. Julian’s lips twitched slightly, but he didn’t comment. Instead, he rotated the dessert toward her.
“This is one of their signature dishes. Try it,” he said, his tone light but with an edge she couldn’t quite place.
“Okay. Thank you,” she replied politely, picking up her fork.
Julian watched her for a moment before forcing a smile. “What’s with you? Since when have we become so distant?”
His attempt at levity fell flat, and even without Eleanor pointing it out, he knew how strained it sounded.

###Chapter 65
Julian spoke abruptly, not waiting for Eleanor to respond. "Have you heard the news? I'm getting engaged to the Morgan family."
Eleanor had just picked up her fork and taken a bite of her dessert. At his words, she slowly set the fork down and nodded. "To Isabella," she replied. "I know."
"I heard you've cut ties with the Morgans," Julian said, lowering his gaze. "We would have been engaged by now if that hadn't happened."
He laughed, though the smile never reached his eyes, no matter how hard he tried. The corners of his lips carried an endless bitterness.
Eleanor paused for a moment before speaking. "You can talk to them if you don't want to..."
He shook his head. "They brought me back just to squeeze every ounce of value out of me. I've met over a dozen people in just twenty days."
"Value?" She frowned. "Wouldn't a successful marriage alliance be a threat to them? Why would they..." He cut her off. "You don't know, do you? Gabriel's crippled after the last car accident. It means he can't have children of his own. Do you understand the value I was talking about now?"
She was at a loss for words.
The private room slowly fell into a heavy silence.
"This will probably be the last time we can have a meal together," Julian said, raising his wineglass. "I want to congratulate you, though it's a bit late. You're finally free from them and no longer under their control." Eleanor said nothing more. She simply raised her glass and clinked it against his. "Thank you."
Meanwhile, Isabella was also at a restaurant. It was already 8:30 pm, but the seat across from her remained empty.
Isabella could no longer contain her unease when the waiter came in for the third time to reheat the dishes. She intended to call Nathaniel again.
However, the door to the private room opened once more before she could dial.
Her eyes immediately lit up when she saw Nathaniel. "Nate!"
Nathaniel responded faintly, sidestepping her attempt to take his hand as he pulled out a chair and sat down.
"What do you need?" His tone was rather indifferent.
Isabella was momentarily stunned before she quickly said, "I just thought it had been a while since we last met. I wanted to have dinner with you..."
He didn't reply and merely lifted his head to look at her.
She thought he must have just come from a business negotiation. Otherwise, why would he look at her with such intensity?
"I..." Isabella suddenly felt diffident and tightened her grip on the coffee cup before continuing, "Actually, there's something I wanted to ask your opinion on."
"What is it?"
"It's about my... engagement with Julian." Her voice faltered. "You probably already know about it, don't you? Honestly, I don't want to get married so soon. I'm only 22 years old!"
Her words brought a memory to his mind. Eleanor was also at that age when she married him.
Isabella lowered her gaze before she continued, "And I know... Julian doesn't love me."
"Oh?" Nathaniel remained unfazed. "Then, who does he love?"

###Chapter 66
Nathaniel's direct question left Isabella hesitant. She lowered her head, nervously fidgeting with the hem of her dress before softly replying, "I'm not entirely sure. But Julian and Eleanor were very close back when we were in school." Nathaniel remained silent.
Isabella, worried he might misunderstand, quickly added, "But Julian went abroad to study not long after. I'm sure there's nothing between them. Even if there were, I feel like I shouldn't be engaged to him. Nate, do you think I'm being selfish? Am I a terrible person? My family needs me now more than ever, but I..."
Her eyes reddened as she spoke. Nathaniel stayed quiet, his gaze lowered in deep thought.
Isabella bit her lip and continued, "Nate, what did you talk to my dad about last time? I... I really don't want to get married now. Can you help me?"
She reached out, about to tug at his sleeve, when her phone suddenly rang. Startled, she quickly retracted her hand and answered the call.
"What did you say?" Her voice rose sharply as she snapped her gaze toward Nathaniel. "I... I'll head over right now."
She glanced at him after hanging up. "I'm sorry, Nate. I... I have to go."
"What's going on?" Nathaniel finally asked, his voice calm but laced with an imperceptible tension.
Isabella gritted her teeth, wrestling with an internal struggle before finally saying, "Olivia told me she saw Julian entering a hotel with a woman. I need to check it out."
"Who was he with?" Nathaniel pressed, his tone casual but his eyes sharp.
"I..." Isabella lowered her gaze, struggling to find the words. After a moment of hesitation, she spoke softly, "Olivia said... it looked like my sister."

---
"Isabella, over here!" Olivia grabbed Isabella's arm as soon as she entered the hotel.
"I knew that woman couldn't be trusted! Julian and Eleanor must have been involved long ago! They were sneaking around even when she was still married to Nathaniel! How could there be someone as shameless as her in this world? You'll see. I'm going to expose her true nature today!"
Olivia gritted her teeth and yanked Isabella forward with determination.
The elevator stopped on the 11th floor. Olivia seemed familiar with the place. She walked straight ahead as soon as she stepped out of the elevator and pressed the doorbell of a room. "Open the door!"
When there was no response, she pounded on the door without hesitation, the noise echoing down the hallway.
Isabella watched silently, her phone camera aimed at the door. "Eleanor! Open the door! I know you're in there! You shameless woman! All you know is seducing men! Open the door!"
Still, there was no response from inside the room, but the commotion had drawn the attention of the hotel staff. One of them quickly stepped forward to stop Olivia. "Ma'am, please calm down—"
"Don't touch me! Do you know who my father is? There's a shameless woman in there seducing my friend's fiancé! Open this door for me right now!"

###Chapter 67
"Madam, please calm down. Let's find a quiet place to discuss this..." The hotel staff desperately tried to restrain Olivia when the door in front of them suddenly swung open.
Eleanor stood there, her hair slightly tousled, cheeks flushed with an unnatural hue, yet her gaze was as cold as ice.
"Well, well! So you're here! Where's your lover? Is Julian hiding inside? Let me..." Olivia's voice was shrill, her eyes darting past Eleanor into the room.
Eleanor ignored Olivia entirely and strode over to Isabella in just a few quick steps. Her movement was so swift that Isabella barely had time to react before Eleanor snatched the phone from her hand.
"Eleanor..." Isabella began, but her words were cut short as Eleanor deleted the video she had recorded and smashed the phone against the wall without hesitation.
"What are you doing?" Olivia, who had intended to barge in to find Julian, was startled by the commotion. She immediately rushed forward to shield Isabella.
However, Eleanor didn't give them a chance to recover. She raised her hand and delivered a crisp slap across Isabella's face.
"Isabella!" Olivia shouted, her voice trembling with rage. "Eleanor, you wretched lunatic! How dare you hit her? You're the one who—"
"Are you an idiot?" Eleanor turned to look at Olivia, her voice icy. "Are you completely unaware that you're being used as a pawn?"
"What are you talking about?" Olivia froze, her mind struggling to process Eleanor's words.
But Eleanor didn't spare her another glance. She turned on her heel and walked away, her steps steady despite the turmoil raging within her.
"Stop right there! Eleanor, I demand you explain yourself!" Olivia tried to chase after her, but someone behind her blocked her path. "Madam, please stay calm..."
Eleanor had no intention of engaging with her further. Her mind was already slipping into a haze. She wouldn't have had the strength to confront Isabella and Olivia if she hadn't steeled herself earlier, making a deep cut on her forearm to keep her focus.
But the clarity brought by the pain was fleeting.
Her body was burning with heat, as if something was gnawing at her bones. Her legs started to tremble, forcing her to clench her fists tightly as her body slowly bent under the strain.
"Madam, do you need help?" Someone in the lobby approached her with concern.
Eleanor didn't respond. She gritted her teeth and forced herself to take each step forward, her vision blurring at the edges.
She didn't hesitate when she spotted a familiar car parked at the entrance. She charged toward it like a drowning person grasping for a life raft.
She grabbed Nathaniel's hand without hesitation when the car window rolled down. "Nathaniel, help me."
Ethan quickly opened the car door, and Eleanor slid inside, her grip on Nathaniel's hand unyielding.
Her logic told her she should let go, but her body betrayed her. She found herself leaning closer to him, her fingers tightening around his.
Nathaniel caught her wrist and held it firmly, his gaze dropping to the wound on her hand as he lifted it.
Only then did Eleanor slightly regain her senses. She shook her head forcefully and tried to free her hand, but Nathaniel's grip tightened as he glanced at her.
The car was shrouded in dim light, while the outside world glittered with decadence and revelry.
Eleanor was suddenly reminded of the past two years when his gaze landed on her—those tangled and hazy nights they had shared.
Then, Eleanor seemed to hear a sharp echo in her mind.
It was the sound of her last shred of reason shattering.

###Chapter 68

Eleanor arched her spine, lips seeking Nathaniel's in desperate entreaty.

The heir shifted his face away, leaving her trembling mouth hovering in empty air. Her frame froze momentarily before she ducked her head, tracing the angular contours of his throat with a fevered tongue.

Nathaniel's muscles coiled like springs beneath tailored fabric. Steel fingers gripped her chin, forcing her storm-cloud gaze upward. Damp tendrils of chestnut hair framed features flushed with unnatural heat - a drenched stray kitten pleading shelter from monsoon rains.

His aristocratic brow furrowed.

Undeterred, Eleanor's shaking hands fumbled at his leather belt. The sudden shrill of her mobile intervened, Julian Whitaker's name flashing like accusation across the darkened screen.

The electronic trill sliced through her chemical haze. She stiffened, fingers rising to dislodge Nathaniel's grip. But his palm cradled her skull with unexpected tenderness, crashing their mouths together in a collision of teeth and pent-up fury.

His kiss became both torment and salvation - icy springwater meeting forest fire. The insistent phone faded as partition glass ascended, sealing them in their humid cocoon. World dissolved into shared breath and thunderous pulse, her editor's warnings about "professional boundaries" evaporating like morning mist.

Yet the pharmaceutical flames raged higher. Eleanor guided Nathaniel's hand beneath silk blouse, craving the glacier cool of his signet ring against burning flesh. Two years of matrimony had schooled him in her body's secret language, yet tonight he played dissonant chords.

"Na-than-iel..." His name fractured into breathless syllables as tears carved paths through her rouge. The broken cadence echoed memories of stolen nights, when whispered confessions still held meaning.

The Amity heir remained marble-carved observer, pupils dilated yet demeanor detached - gallery patron studying erotic fresco. Only the telltale flush creeping past his collar betrayed humanity.

Her final gambit found purchase as she straddled power-woven thighs. "Please... beloved..." The forbidden endearment hung between them like shattered crystal.

Darkness ignited in Nathaniel's gaze. "Clarify your address," he demanded, silk tie unspooling as he anchored her hips. "Who claims your delirium?"

"Only you..." Her throat convulsed around the half-truth.

"Liar." The accusation melted into renewed onslaught, a conqueror breaching castle walls.

When Nathaniel finally surrendered restraint, Eleanor's cry mingled anguish and euphoria - parched wanderer stumbling upon poisoned oasis. Each touch both quenched and inflamed, ice transforming to steam in their combustible alchemy.

The limousine became tempest-tossed vessel, carrying them far from corporate dynasties and arranged obligations into primal seas where only skin whispers held meaning.

###Chapter 69
Eleanor had no recollection of where she had ended up afterward. It felt as though her entire world had narrowed down to Nathaniel. She clung to him as if she couldn't stand on her own, surrendering completely to his every demand.
The unrestrained indulgence took a toll on Eleanor's body, leaving her feeling as though she had been run over by a truck when she woke up the next day. Her throat was parched and burning. A sharp pain shot through her calf as soon as she tried to move. She couldn't help but let out a soft groan, lying still on the bed for a moment before slowly lifting her head.
The room looked unfamiliar to her. It wasn't her tiny rental apartment, nor was it Carter Manor. However, Nathaniel owned numerous properties in Coppersille, so it didn't surprise her that he owned a place like this.
Eleanor didn't have the time to dwell on it at the moment. She bent down to pick up her clothes from the floor before putting them on slowly and carefully. Her phone had finally powered back on when she stepped out of the room. There were countless messages and missed calls.
A voice suddenly sounded as she lowered her head and scrolled through them, "You're up."
Eleanor immediately stopped in her tracks. She felt as if her blood had frozen before it slowly began to flow backward at that moment. She didn't know how long it took before she regained her composure and turned her head slowly.
Nathaniel was standing at the doorway of another room. He narrowed his eyes and looked at her. "You... haven't left yet?" It wasn't until she spoke that she realized how hoarse her voice was.
The memories of the previous night immediately surged into her mind.
"Let's talk," Nathaniel said, striding past her toward the living room.
Eleanor had no choice but to follow.
She had simply drunk something she shouldn't have last night. She wasn't drunk. The things that happened between them afterward had unfolded clearly in her head. That clarity was precisely why she had no idea how to face him now.
She lowered her gaze and sat across from him without making eye contact.
"Did you have dinner with Julian last night?"
His demeanor was much more calm and casual than hers. However, his question caught her off guard. She paused for a moment and nodded.
"So, he's the one who drugged you?" Nathaniel sounded like he was asking a question, but the certainty in his tone made it clear that he already knew the answer.
Eleanor said nothing. She couldn't help but tighten her hands on her lap.
Nathaniel chuckled. "What? Are you still going to defend him now?"
She lifted her head. "What exactly are you trying to say?"
"So you've grown a spine now, haven't you? You're no longer the person you were last night when you were crying and begging me, are you?"
"I..." His words made Eleanor's eyes widen instantly. Her voice caught in her throat, and a blush quickly crept up to the tips of her ears.
Nathaniel seemed amused by her reaction. His lips curled into a faint smile.
"I... You... Is this what you wanted to talk about?" she finally asked.
"No." He stopped teasing her and said, "I'm just curious. Why didn't you just sleep with Julian since you and he were in the same room last night?"
"We're just friends!"
"He apparently doesn't think so."
"Yes." She forced a smile, her previous defiance fading as her voice grew quieter. "That's why we're not even friends anymore. Does that make you happy now, Mr. Carter?"

###Chapter 70
"Yes. I'm happy," Nathaniel replied without hesitation.
"I can leave now, right?" Eleanor said as she stood up to leave, but his voice rang out again the next moment.
"Eleanor, do you think being drugged absolves you of the responsibility for what happened last night?" His words left her stunned.
Eleanor slowly turned to look at him, her mind racing with different thoughts in the brief following seconds. What kind of price was he expecting her to pay? Was he planning to use this as leverage against her? Or was it only an excuse because he couldn't let her go?
She instinctively tried to suppress the last thought that surfaced in her mind before he spoke again, asking, "Your adoptive mother is still in the hospital, isn't she?"
"What are you trying to do?" Eleanor's expression immediately shifted, and her eyes filled with vigilance and anger.
Nathaniel merely glanced at her. "I can arrange for her to be transferred to a better hospital. You won't have to worry about the medical expenses. I'll take care of it."
"You... What's the meaning of this?"
"What do you think?"
"I think someone of your stature wouldn't need anything from someone like me, Mr. Carter." Her voice was strained.
Nathaniel laughed and swirled the coffee in his cup before replying, "I think we're quite compatible in certain ways."
Eleanor was stunned at his words.
It took her a moment to realize exactly what he was referring to.
Her grip immediately tightened. "You're the CEO of Amity Group. You're a man of prestige and admiration in Coppersville. Countless women would line up for you. Why bother entangling yourself with someone like me?"
"Oh, so you do know that."
She was stunned at his response.
Nathaniel laughed before Eleanor could figure out what he meant. "I thought I was no different from Benjamin the cripple or Julian that bastard in your eyes."
She couldn't tell if it was her imagination. She thought she detected a hint of bitterness in his voice for a moment.
Nathaniel continued before she could grasp that fleeting emotion, "I have no plans to date anyone at the moment, nor do I intend to sink into self-indulgence."
"So..."
"Eleanor, I'm a normal man."
Her expression turned blank as his words fell. She would truly be a fool if she still didn't understand.
He merely wanted a physical relationship. He chose her because he wasn't ready for a serious relationship or marriage and didn't want to get entangled with other women.
Eleanor might not even qualify as a sex partner. She was probably nothing more than a tool for him to vent his desires.
"In exchange, I'll ensure your mother receives the best care with the best doctors and hospital arrangements." Nathaniel continued, "I know you're working, but you can't afford those medical costs with your current income."
"What if I refuse?" Eleanor asked.
Her refusal was almost inconceivable in his mind.
Therefore, Nathaniel was slightly surprised at her words. He frowned and asked, "Why?"
"Why? Nathaniel, am I truly that pathetic in your eyes?"

###Chapter 71
Eleanor clenched her jaw, her voice already hoarse from the tension. She had believed she had moved on from her relationship with Nathaniel, but now she realized she had overestimated her own strength. The actions of the Carters no longer affected her, but a few words from Nathaniel cut deeper than any knife, piercing her heart with precision.
Nathaniel sat across from her, his gaze unwavering. After a moment, he let out a low, mocking laugh. "Do you feel wronged? Then tell me, do you think it's honorable to go on a blind date less than a week after our divorce?"
Eleanor remained silent, her lips pressed into a thin line.
Reaching out, Nathaniel gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. "And let's not forget, you were the one who crawled into my bed last night. Did you think about how cheap that made you look then?"
His eyes turned icy, filled with such disdain that it felt like a slap across her face. Eleanor's fists clenched tightly, but slowly, her fingers uncurled, her resolve wavering.
Nathaniel, however, had no patience to continue this conversation. He stood abruptly, his voice cold and final. "Eleanor, you don't have a choice," he stated, turning to leave.
But Eleanor's voice stopped him in his tracks. "How long?" she asked, her voice trembling.
Nathaniel paused, turning back to face her. Tears welled in her eyes, and she had bitten her lip so hard it was bleeding. She was struggling to maintain her composure, her pride hanging by a thread.
For a moment, Nathaniel was reminded of the way she had looked at him the night before, her eyes filled with vulnerability. He swallowed hard, his voice softening slightly. "Two years, maybe."
Eleanor's jaw tightened, but after a moment, she nodded. "Fine," she said, standing as well.
Nathaniel watched as she moved toward the door. "Where are you going?" he asked, his tone sharp.
"Home," she replied, not looking back. "I assume you don't need me today. When you do... I'll come."
Her tone was detached, almost businesslike, as if she were treating this as nothing more than a transaction. Nathaniel frowned, but before he could respond, she was already walking away.
"I'll take you," he said finally, his voice firm.
Eleanor hesitated, then nodded silently. She no longer had the energy to argue.
As they descended to the parking garage, Nathaniel gave her the address. "Level 23, Block A, Percy Gardens. The door code is the same as the one at Nivis Villa."
Eleanor knew this would be their meeting place, the setting for their... arrangement. She said nothing, merely nodding in acknowledgment.
When the elevator doors opened, Ethan was waiting with the car. Seeing the tension between them, he quickly spoke up. "Don't worry, Ms. Thompson. The car's been cleaned this morning."
Eleanor's breath hitched, and Nathaniel couldn't help but chuckle at her discomfort. He slid into the car, then glanced back at her. "Are you getting in, or do you plan to stand there all day?"
Eleanor hesitated, then finally climbed into the car, her heart heavy with the weight of what was to come.

###Chapter 72
Eleanor's current residence was at No. 37, Tranquil Lane, and it was Nathaniel's first time visiting the area. Despite being a titan in the real estate industry, Nathaniel would never have known such a neighborhood existed in Coppersville if Eleanor hadn't guided him there.
Eleanor didn't bid him farewell, merely thanking Ethan before stepping out of the car. To her surprise, Nathaniel followed her out.
She turned to him, puzzled. "What are you doing?"
"I'm coming up to take a look," he replied casually.
Eleanor had no idea what he was up to and took a deep breath. "It's not a good time."
"Why not?" Nathaniel glanced at the various flyers plastered on the wall beside them and asked, "Is there someone else in your apartment?"
"Of course not," she replied quickly.
"Then, why not?" he pressed.
In a tense tone, she responded, "I just don't see the point of you coming upstairs."
"I want to make sure there's no one else in your place. That's the point," he said, his gaze slowly shifting back to her. "During this period, I expect our relationship to be... straightforward."
"If you don't trust me, why are you even doing this with me?" she shot back.
"How many times do I need to remind you about last night?" he countered.
Eleanor was left speechless, realizing she was at a disadvantage after what had transpired between them the previous night. He had effectively pinned her to the wall of shame. Since she had been the one to initiate things, she had to face the consequences.
Without another word, she turned on her heel and headed inside, with Nathaniel following closely behind. As they climbed the narrow staircase, his frown deepened with each step.
The walls were damp and dark, and the corners were littered with uncollected trash, emitting a foul odor. Nathaniel couldn't fathom why Eleanor would choose to live in such a place. What was even more baffling was that she preferred this over the accommodations he had offered.
Eleanor stopped on the third floor and bent down to unlock her door. When Nathaniel saw the interior, his stoic expression softened slightly.
"Should I change into slippers?" he asked.
"No," she mumbled, quickly grabbing a towel to cover the comic she needed to sign.
Though Nathaniel noticed her action, he chose not to comment.
"That's the bedroom," Eleanor pointed out.
Raising an eyebrow, Nathaniel walked over instinctively. The bed was dressed in soft yellow sheets, and the curtains were made of light, airy chiffon. A vase of fresh flowers sat by the window. The decor was cozy, but the space was undeniably cramped. With both of them standing there, it felt like there wasn't even enough room to turn around.
Nathaniel estimated that he might not even be able to stretch out on her bed. Even during his early days, when he was just starting out, he had never lived in a place like this.
"Are you done?" Eleanor asked, looking up at him.
"Yeah."
"You can leave now," she said, effectively issuing an eviction notice. "As you can see, there's no one else here, right?"
Nathaniel chuckled softly, and Eleanor couldn't help but frown at his smirk. He wasn't the type to smile often, and when they were married, he had rarely shown her even a pleasant expression, let alone a genuine smile.
At the same time, she knew his smile was nothing more than a mockery directed at her.

###Chapter 73
Nathaniel was mocking Eleanor. After all, after giving her all to leave him, she ended up in a place no bigger than a pigeon hole.
Eleanor wanted to say something, but he didn't give her the chance, turning to leave after a curt answer. At the door, he came to a sudden stop and said, "You should change the lock on your door. The people hanging around here are rather dodgy. It's for your safety."
Without waiting for a reply, he continued forward, as stoic as he had always been.
Eleanor glanced at the door lock and shut the door with a bang; in a swift move.
Nathaniel couldn't help but pause for a split second while going down the staircase, but he didn't turn back and continued downstairs.
Ethan was waiting for him by the side of the road. The luxurious car and number plate immediately attracted quite a few spectators. Nevertheless, they seemed invisible to Nathaniel as he climbed into the car expressionlessly.
After closing the door for him, Ethan went around to the driver's seat in the front. He was driving for a while until an electric scooter suddenly appeared in front of him, and both of them almost crashed.
With lingering fear, the scooter driver jumped off and kept apologizing.
"Let's go if everything's fine," Nathaniel instructed impatiently with a frown. He couldn't be bothered to waste his time on this.
The next second, Ethan said, "Mr. Carter, isn't that Ms. Thompson? Where is she going?"
Upon hearing this, Nathaniel twirled his head around quickly.
Eleanor had changed into a simple T-shirt and shorts. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and she was driving further and further away with her back to them. Before her figure disappeared, she stopped and walked into a pharmacy at the side of the road.
Nathaniel's fingers balled up a little, and the edges of his lips tightened.
"Mr. Carter, is Ms. Thompson unwell? Should I—"
"Drive," Nathaniel interjected in an icy tone.
Eleanor popped the pill right after buying it. She was already familiar with the taste of this white pill. Despite that, the bitterness lingered in her mouth, unable to disperse.
Just when she was about to head home, she heard someone calling from behind.
"Elle."
Eleanor stopped for a moment, but she didn't turn back and continued walking. Without hesitation, Julian marched to her and grabbed her hand.
Eleanor frowned. "Let go."
"I will after I finish speaking," he said and tightened his grip.
Eleanor could feel the pain in her bones, and her frown deepened.
"What happened last night was a misunderstanding," Julian said.
Eleanor couldn't stop herself from chuckling. "Misunderstanding? Are you saying that you were framed as well?" Julian stared at her for a while. "No, but I did that because I like you. I just wanted to fight for—"
"I'm sorry. I can't handle your affection," she interrupted sarcastically.
Julian slowly released his grip. Then, he chuckled. "So, you'd rather choose Nathaniel Carter, a man who has no feelings for you?"
All of a sudden, Eleanor was at a loss for words, and Julian clenched his jaw little by little.
"I saw it earlier. He dropped you home, didn't he? Were you together last night?"

###Chapter 74
"Yes," Eleanor replied tersely.
"So, what gives you the right to judge me, Eleanor? Didn't you also use underhanded methods to be with Nathaniel?" Julian's words cut through the air like a knife.
Eleanor's expression hardened at his accusations. Before she could respond, Julian pressed on, "You're over him, aren't you? So why did you get into his car last night? Why not go straight to the hospital? Wasn't this... your plan all along?"
"Eleanor, what happened last night... I was wrong. You said you couldn't handle my feelings, but deep down, we're not so different, are we?" Julian's voice softened, but his eyes remained sharp.
"You chose to get into his car because you knew he wouldn't ignore you. Am I right?"
The midday sun blazed overhead, casting harsh shadows. Despite the heat, Eleanor felt a cold shiver run down her spine. Her clenched fists slowly relaxed as she stared at Julian, her face pale.
Seeing her reaction, Julian smirked, his expression darkening. "Does Nathaniel know?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous.
Eleanor's head snapped up, and Julian pulled out his phone, which was in the middle of a call.
"That you used him and set him up like this," Julian finished, ending the call and locking eyes with Eleanor.
Biting her lip, Eleanor held his gaze for a moment before finally speaking. "Are you done?" she asked, her voice steady.
When Julian didn't respond, she took it as a sign and turned to leave, giving him a curt nod.
"Eleanor," Julian called after her, his voice echoing in the quiet street. "You, too, no longer have the chance... to be with the one you love."
His words made Eleanor pause for a split second, but she didn't turn around. She continued walking as if she hadn't heard him.
Soon, she arrived home. As she reached for her door, her neighbor across the hall called out, "Hey!"
At first, Eleanor didn't think the woman was speaking to her. She had lived there for a while but had never introduced herself to her neighbors. She ignored the call and began to unlock her door.
The woman, however, wasn't having it. "Hey, I'm talking to you! Are you deaf or something?" she snapped, slamming her hand on Eleanor's door to stop her from closing it.
Eleanor turned, her expression cold. "What do you want?" she asked.
The woman, with her long, wavy, bleached blonde hair, gave Eleanor a once-over. "A Maserati was parked downstairs earlier. Is that your friend?" she asked, her tone dripping with curiosity.
"Do you have a problem?" Eleanor countered, her voice icy.
"No. I just thought... since we're neighbors, maybe we could be friends," the woman said, forcing a smile.
Eleanor wasn't interested. "The owner of that car isn't my friend," she said flatly before closing the door.
She could hear the woman shouting from outside, but she ignored it, tossing her leftover prescription on the table.
As she sat down, Julian's words echoed in her mind. She didn't know how Nathaniel had reacted to the call, but she knew one thing for certain: Julian had spoken the truth.

###Chapter 75
Eleanor Thompson no longer had the chance to be with the one she loved either.
To begin with, she barely slept a wink last night, leaving her utterly exhausted. Now, lying in bed, she tossed and turned restlessly, unable to find any semblance of peace.
Eventually, she gave up and sat by the window, staring blankly outside. The view from her apartment was far from spectacular—just rows of tightly packed buildings and the occasional laundry fluttering on the neighboring balcony.
Eleanor sighed and returned to bed, closing her eyes once more. Just as she began to drift into a light slumber, her phone buzzed insistently beside her.
She ignored it at first, but the sender was relentless, bombarding her with a flurry of messages that kept her phone vibrating incessantly.
When Eleanor finally reached for her phone to check the messages, Isabella Morgan called. Every time Eleanor rejected the call, Isabella would immediately dial again. Frustrated, Eleanor blocked her number.
It didn’t take long for Isabella to call back using a different number.
Tired of the endless back-and-forth, Eleanor finally answered. "What do you want?"
"Eleanor Thompson, you conniving witch!" Isabella screeched without preamble. "Did you spend the night with Nathaniel last night? How dare you show your face to him? Why don’t you just disappear forever?"
"It’s all your fault! If you hadn’t manipulated Nathaniel into negotiating with Dad on your behalf, I wouldn’t be the one forced into this marriage!
"You’re doing this to keep me away from Nathaniel, aren’t you? You’re a vile, scheming woman. Nathaniel was supposed to marry me!
"I’m the one who grew up with him, and you stole him from me. This is all your doing! Why don’t you just drop dead?"
Isabella’s venomous tirade continued unabated, her voice cracking with hysteria. Eleanor could hear her sniffling, clearly on the verge of a complete meltdown.
Amid the barrage of insults, Eleanor caught a crucial detail. "Wait, did you say Nathaniel negotiated with Edward? What exactly did they discuss?"
"Stop playing dumb! If you hadn’t put Nathaniel up to it, he wouldn’t have given up the profits from a major project just to stop Dad from forcing you into a marriage of convenience.
"You’re nothing but a curse! Wasn’t it enough that you ruined Nathaniel’s life for two years? Why can’t you just leave him alone?"
Eleanor didn’t wait to hear more. She hung up, her mind racing.
The tangled web of her relationship with the Thompsons was becoming increasingly convoluted. Her actions the other day had effectively severed any remaining ties with Benjamin Hughes, and he hadn’t reached out to her since.
What surprised her most was that the incident hadn’t made waves in their social circle. Initially, she had assumed Edward had suppressed the news, biding his time before arranging another match for her. But days had passed with no word from him.
Now, thanks to Isabella’s outburst, Eleanor finally understood why. Yet, she couldn’t comprehend Nathaniel’s motives. Why would he go to such lengths for her?
More importantly, she couldn’t decipher her own feelings. Was she happy? Not exactly. If anything, she felt... conflicted.
Eleanor's mind was in turmoil. They were already divorced. Even during their marriage, Nathaniel had never gone out of his way for her. So, why was he doing all these things now? What did they signify?
As she sat there, lost in thought, her phone buzzed again. It was a message from Nathaniel. "Come over."
The simplicity of the command left her even more perplexed. She stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. Should she reply? Should she go? The questions swirled in her mind, each one more confusing than the last.
Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her hair. She knew she couldn't ignore him. Despite everything, there was still a part of her that couldn't resist his pull. She grabbed her coat and headed out the door, her heart pounding with a mix of apprehension and something she couldn't quite name.
The drive to Nathaniel's place was a blur. She barely registered the streets passing by, her mind preoccupied with what awaited her. When she arrived, she took a deep breath before stepping out of the car. The familiar sight of his mansion loomed before her, its grandeur as imposing as ever.
She rang the doorbell, and within moments, the door swung open. Nathaniel stood there, his expression unreadable. "You came," he said simply, stepping aside to let her in.
Eleanor nodded, stepping inside. The air between them was thick with tension, and she could feel his eyes on her as she walked past him. She turned to face him, her arms crossed over her chest. "What do you want, Nathaniel?"
He didn't answer immediately, his gaze lingering on her face as if searching for something. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and steady. "I need to talk to you."
Eleanor raised an eyebrow. "About what?"
Nathaniel hesitated, a rare moment of uncertainty crossing his features. "About us."
The words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning. Eleanor felt her breath catch in her throat. "There is no 'us,' Nathaniel. Not anymore."
He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "Maybe not. But there could be."
Eleanor shook her head, taking a step back. "You can't just waltz back into my life and expect things to go back to the way they were."
"I don't expect that," Nathaniel said, his voice firm. "But I do expect you to hear me out."
Eleanor stared at him, her heart racing. She wanted to turn and walk away, to leave all of this behind. But something in his eyes held her in place, something that made her want to stay, to listen.
"Fine," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "Talk."
Nathaniel took a deep breath, his gaze never leaving hers. "I made a mistake, Eleanor. A big one. I let you go, and I shouldn't have. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I was wrong."
Eleanor felt a lump form in her throat. She wanted to believe him, but the wounds of the past were still fresh. "It's not that simple, Nathaniel."
"I know," he said, his voice softening. "But I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it right. To make us right."
Eleanor looked away, her mind a whirlwind of emotions. She didn't know what to say, what to feel. All she knew was that standing there, in the presence of the man who had once been her everything, she felt more vulnerable than ever.
"Give me time," she said finally, her voice trembling. "I need time to think."
Nathaniel nodded, his expression unreadable. "Take all the time you need. But know this, Eleanor—I'm not giving up on us. Not this time."
Eleanor met his gaze, her heart pounding in her chest. She didn't know what the future held, but for the first time in a long time, she felt a glimmer of hope. And that scared her more than anything.
Without another word, she turned and walked out the door, leaving Nathaniel standing there, his eyes following her every move. As she drove away, she couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to change in ways she couldn't even begin to imagine.

###Chapter 76
The two words weren't unfamiliar to Eleanor.
Back when she had been living at Nivis Villa, Nathaniel would send her just those two words every time he needed something.
As Eleanor stared at the words now, her eyes stung unexpectedly.
She was still staring at the screen when Ethan suddenly called her. "Mrs. Carter, I'm over on Serene Street. The alley's too narrow to drive in. Could you step out and meet me here?"
Eleanor pressed her lips together, staying silent.
"Mrs. Carter?" Ethan called again from the other end.
"Fine," Eleanor finally responded. Then, she changed her clothes and headed out.
"Mrs. Carter!"
Ethan had switched to another car—a sleek, silver Porsche Panamera. It looked glaringly out of place in the cramped, shadowy urban village.
As Eleanor climbed into the car, she noticed her neighbor.
The blonde woman was standing there, biting into a popsicle, her gaze lingering on Eleanor with a cryptic expression.
Eleanor ignored her.
After Ethan shut the car door for her, he walked around to the driver's seat.
"Apologies, Mrs. Carter. I didn't mean to trouble you. I just heard there might be a route up ahead that the car can get through. Next time, I'll—"
"Nathaniel and I are divorced," Eleanor interrupted, correcting him. "You can just call me Eleanor."
"It was Mr. Carter who asked me to pick you up," Ethan replied, sidestepping her statement. "And honestly, I think Mr. Carter still cares about you. Otherwise, why would he have sent me?"
He added sincerely, "And he was genuinely worried last night. If you hadn't come out when you did, he probably would've gone upstairs to find you himself."
Eleanor suddenly sensed something was off. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at Ethan.
"What do you mean? Nathaniel being near the hotel last night wasn't a coincidence?"
"Of course not. Mr. Carter was having dinner with Ms. Isabella last night. I'm guessing she mentioned something about what happened to you. You might not know this, but at that time..."
Ethan kept talking, but Eleanor couldn't hear a word he said.
She didn't even remember how the journey to Percy Gardens went. It wasn't until the elevator doors opened and she punched in the code Nathaniel had given her to unlock the door that she realized he wasn't home.
Eleanor walked around the place to confirm he wasn't there. Once she was certain, she didn't bother calling him. Instead, she found a spot on the couch and sat down.
Her mind was tangled with all kinds of thoughts—like invisible ropes tightening around her neck, choking her. Just as she was struggling to unravel those ropes, Nathaniel returned.
Eleanor looked up at him.
Her being here, "waiting" for him, seemed to please Nathaniel quite a bit. He even took the initiative to ask, "Have you eaten yet?"
Eleanor didn't respond.
Nathaniel loosened his tie and tossed it aside, then said, "Let's go. I'll take you out to get something."
His tone was calm, but there was an unmistakable arrogance in his attitude—like he was bestowing some kind of favor on her.
But Eleanor just stared at him without moving.
Nathaniel waited for a moment, and his brows furrowed when it became clear she wasn't going to budge.
"I have something to ask you," Eleanor finally said.
Nathaniel didn't reply. He simply stood there, waiting for her to continue.
"Did Julian call you this afternoon?"
"Yeah."
"Don't you have anything you want to ask me? Like whether I set you up on purpose?"
"I know you didn't."
Nathaniel's response came without a moment's hesitation.
Eleanor froze for a beat. Then, unexpectedly, she laughed.
In the past, she would have felt deeply moved if he had answered her so decisively. But now, the sound of her laughter echoed hollowly in the room, a stark contrast to the tension that hung in the air.

###Chapter 77
A bone-chilling coldness seeped into Eleanor's heart as she faced Nathaniel. "Why?" she demanded, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion.
Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his eyes flashing with irritation at being cornered. He wasn't accustomed to being questioned, especially not by Eleanor.
She didn't wait for his response. "Is it because we were married for two years, and you think you understand me enough to trust me? Or is it because... you had something to do with what happened last night?"
Nathaniel remained stoic during the first part of her accusation, but his expression darkened at the mention of last night. "What are you implying?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous.
"No, you probably didn't orchestrate it," Eleanor continued, more to herself than to him. "After all, you're Nathaniel Carter, the untouchable heir of the Carter empire. You wouldn't stoop to such petty schemes. But you knew about it, didn't you?"
Her voice grew colder, more resolute. "That includes the time Samuel showed up at that restaurant. It wasn't a coincidence, was it?"
Until now, Eleanor hadn't considered the possibility. But Isabella's phone call earlier had planted a seed of doubt in her mind.
The restaurant was tucked away in a secluded location. If Benjamin hadn't taken her there before, even she wouldn't have known it existed. So, how could Samuel have found it?
The only person who knew her past and would be so eager to ruin her was Isabella.
But what about Nathaniel? What role had he played in all of this? Was he merely a bystander, watching as she was pushed to the brink?
Was he waiting for her to hit rock bottom so he could extend a hand and make her grateful to him—like training a dog?
When Eleanor finished speaking, Nathaniel suddenly chuckled, a cold, humorless sound. "So what? Are you questioning me now?"
"Do I not even have the right to know the truth?" Eleanor shot back.
"What truth? What do you think I would gain from any of this?" Nathaniel countered, his tone icy.
"You didn't do it," Eleanor replied. "But you're aware of it. You knew everything and let it happen, didn't you?"
Nathaniel didn't deny it.
Eleanor laughed bitterly, the sound hollow and devoid of joy. Then, without hesitation, she stood up, ready to leave.
But just as she turned to go, Nathaniel's voice stopped her in her tracks. "And why should I have stopped it? Or rather, who am I to step in? Don't forget. We're already divorced."
Then, he added, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "If you were still my wife, perhaps I would've—"
"Would you? Really?" Eleanor spun around, cutting him off mid-sentence. Her eyes burned with anger and betrayal.
"Isabella is the one behind all of this. Between the two of us, would you really take my side?"
Without waiting for his answer, Eleanor scoffed and answered her own question. "You wouldn't. If you had taken my side, we wouldn't have gotten divorced in the first place. So, don't bring up this nonsense about how things would be different if we were still married."
She took a deep breath, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion. "Let me tell you plainly. The reason I divorced you was because of Isabella!"
The words spilled out of Eleanor in a rush, as if she couldn't hold them back any longer.
She hadn't planned to say it. After all, she had always thought it was pointless. Besides, she hadn't said anything about it when they were still married. So, what was the point of bringing it up now?
But in the end, she couldn't hold it in any longer. If she didn't let it out, she felt like it would suffocate her.
Nathaniel stood there, staring at her for a long moment before finally saying, "Isabella and I are just friends."
"Yes. Just friends," Eleanor said with a bitter laugh. "But even as just a friend, she's more important to you than I ever was."
The moment the words left her mouth, her tears began to fall, hot and unstoppable.

###Chapter 78
Eleanor refused to let the tears fall.
From a young age, she had learned that tears only moved those who cared for her, and Nathaniel certainly didn't fit that description. At this moment, her tears would only repel him.
Swiftly, Eleanor raised her hand and wiped them away.
Nathaniel stood across from her, observing her every move. His brows knitted slightly, but she didn't notice.
Instead, she pressed on, "Where were you that night?"
"What?"
"The night I lost the baby. Where were you?"
Nathaniel remained silent.
Eleanor's voice softened further, almost a whisper, as she asked, "Isabella told me you were at an auction. Buying her a birthday gift. Is that true?"
"She had mentioned wanting it before. As for what happened to you... It was an accident," Nathaniel explained.
He said it as if that could even be considered an explanation.
Eleanor couldn't help but laugh. It was as if she had just heard the punchline to the cruelest joke. Her body trembled with laughter, and her eyes were red-rimmed. Yet, not a single tear fell.
"Nathaniel, it wasn't an accident," she said. "Isabella pushed me down the stairs."
His brows furrowed deeply. The moment the words left her lips, he instinctively opened his mouth to deny it. But when his eyes met hers, the protest died on his lips.
"You don't believe she would, do you?" Eleanor asked.
"It's in the past," Nathaniel finally said.
"In the past?" Eleanor looked up. "Nathaniel, that was just a lifeless piece of flesh to you, right? But to me... that was my child.
"And when you came back, you didn't even ask me if it hurt.
"Also, where were you on our wedding anniversary? What about on my birthday? Where were you then?" She unloaded all the questions she had been holding in for two years—questions that had circled endlessly in her mind. Now, she finally found the chance to voice them.
Even though... they didn't matter anymore.
Nathaniel stared at her for a long moment before letting out a low laugh. "Are you interrogating me now? If you had so many questions, why didn't you ask before? Don't you think it's a little pointless to dig up old grievances now?"
Eleanor nodded. "You're right. It is."
Before today, Eleanor had never even considered asking these questions aloud. Just as Nathaniel said, these things were already in the past. Bringing them up now was pointless.
She didn't want to lose her last shred of dignity by breaking down and questioning him hysterically. But she couldn't hold back anymore.
The questions had been circling in her mind endlessly. If she didn't ask them, she felt like she might suffocate under the weight of them.
And now, Nathaniel's response told her everything she needed to know.
He hadn't explained anything back then, and he wouldn't do it now. He would only say it was all pointless. "Since it's pointless, I'm leaving," Eleanor finally said.
After saying that, she turned on her heel and walked forward. She had wiped her tears away, but her eyes were still red-rimmed. She couldn't stand to look at him anymore, and she kept her head down as she made her way to the door.
However, Nathaniel grabbed her arm.
She tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened.
"This is the real reason you brought up the past, isn't it?" he asked with a low chuckle. "You think dredging all this up will change what we talked about this morning? That it won't count anymore?"

###Chapter 79
"Eleanor, let me remind you," Nathaniel said, his voice icy and unyielding. "The power to decide whether our relationship continues or ends has always been in my hands. Even back then, if I hadn't agreed, do you really think you could've divorced me so easily?"
Eleanor's hand, which had been poised to push him away, slowly fell to her side.
Her eyes, which had flickered with traces of anger and sadness, went completely blank as she stared at him.
He wasn't wrong. What power did she ever have? In his eyes, she was nothing more than an object. Once, she had been his wife and was expected to bear his children. Now, she was just a tool for his gratification.
Her quiet, detached demeanor was something Nathaniel knew all too well. His brows furrowed again as he watched her. After a pause, he gripped her chin and abruptly leaned down, capturing her lips in a forceful kiss.
The moment their lips met, tears slipped down Eleanor's cheek.
The cold touch of her tears sent a shiver through Nathaniel's body, but he quickly brushed it off and deepened the kiss. He forced her lips apart and plunged his tongue in, claiming her in a deep, relentless hunger.
This kiss was suffocating—more overwhelming than any they had shared before.
Eleanor felt her chest tighten, her breath hitching. Her hands instinctively pushed against his chest, trying to shove him away.
But at the next moment, Nathaniel caught her wrist with one hand, while the other moved downward. Eleanor felt like a soldier in a battlefield against him, but the difference in strength between the two of them was too great. She wasn't even given a chance to fight back before he found her weakness, leaving her armor shattered and her defenses stripped away.
Nathaniel's jawline was taut with tension, and it finally eased when he felt her body surrender beneath him. A faint, mocking laugh escaped his lips as her body went limp against him.
The sound of his laughter sent a surge of frustration through Eleanor. She clenched her teeth and bit down hard on his shoulder without hesitation.
Nathaniel let out a muffled groan, but he didn't stop her.
Eleanor didn't hold back. It was as if every ounce of frustration and pain she had endured over the past two years had finally found an outlet. Her teeth dug into his skin, and she refused to let go.
But Eleanor soon faced Nathaniel's retaliation.
She had always known that the view in Coppersville was breathtaking at night.
That night, she watched as the city's lights gradually came to life. The neon signs shimmered in the dark, looking like a cascade of spilled cocktails. They looked dazzling and almost unreal.
After that, she couldn't remember exactly when she drifted off to sleep.
However, she remembered that Nathaniel said something to her. But she didn't hear clearly what exactly he said, nor could she recall the words.
When Eleanor woke up, it was the middle of the night. She was a little dizzy, and her legs nearly gave out beneath her when she tried to sit up. She had to steady herself by gripping the bedside table, sinking down on the floor, and resting her head against the bed.
Nathaniel wasn't in the bedroom at the time. However, the noise soon caught his attention, and he walked in from the study next door.
When he saw Eleanor's state, he didn't rush over. He simply stood there, watching her. It was as if he was waiting to see if she was taking it.
Eleanor ignored him. After sitting on the floor for a while, she slowly stood up.
"Where are you going?" Nathaniel asked.
Eleanor didn't answer him and simply walked around him.
But Nathaniel reached out and grabbed her. He yanked her backward, then lifted her into his arms.
"What are you doing? Let go!" Eleanor immediately started struggling.
Nathaniel didn't pay her any attention.
When she realized he was planning to push her onto the bed, Eleanor opened her mouth to protest. But before she could say anything, her stomach growled loudly.

###Chapter 80
The silence in the room was deafening, broken only by the loud growl of Eleanor's stomach. Even Nathaniel paused, his steps faltering as he turned to look at her. For the first time, Eleanor caught a flicker of something unexpected in his gaze—surprise. Her jaw tightened, and she turned her face away, refusing to meet his eyes.
Nathaniel didn’t move. Instead, he released her arm and stood still for a moment. "What do you want to eat?" he asked, his voice calm but firm.
Eleanor didn’t respond. She kept her gaze fixed on the wall, her pride refusing to let her answer. Nathaniel waited for a beat, then shrugged and left the room without another word.
Eleanor remained on the bed, her body stiff and unyielding. It wasn’t until his footsteps faded completely that she finally let out a shaky breath and covered her face with her hands. She wasn’t sure how much time passed, but eventually, Nathaniel returned.
"Come and eat," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.
Eleanor had no intention of indulging him, but her body had other plans. She hadn’t eaten in nearly a full day, and the dizziness was becoming unbearable. Reluctantly, she gave in and walked over to the table.
Nathaniel had brought back an array of dishes—light, carefully chosen meals, similar to what they had eaten at Nivis Villa before. But what caught Eleanor’s attention wasn’t the food itself. It was the cake placed on the side of the table. A dark chocolate cake, topped with bright red cherries.
Her hands clenched into fists at her sides, her gaze snapping to him. Nathaniel met her stare with his usual calm indifference. He sat across from her, leaving the seat with the cake untouched—as if it had been reserved just for her.
He really knew how to train a pet. A punishment, followed by a treat, all delivered with such calculated precision.
Eleanor walked over but didn’t touch the cake. Instead, she picked up her fork and began eating quietly. Neither of them spoke, the silence between them heavy and unyielding.
She could feel Nathaniel’s gaze drifting to the cake a few times, but he said nothing. Despite her hunger, Eleanor’s appetite was faint at best. After forcing herself to eat less than half of what was on her plate, she set her fork down.
"Wait," Nathaniel said abruptly.
Eleanor turned to look at him, her expression guarded. He pressed his lips together, his gaze lingering on her for a moment. Whatever he intended to say, he ultimately kept to himself.
Eleanor didn’t press him. Without another word, she got up and returned to the bedroom. She had slept enough earlier, and she didn’t plan on sleeping anymore. But she didn’t want to stay outside, so she sat by the window, staring out into the night.
When footsteps approached outside the door, she closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep. She wasn’t sure if her act was convincing, but in the darkness, she could feel Nathaniel’s gaze lingering on her for a long moment.
Then, the mattress dipped as he lay down beside her.
Her entire body stiffened. They had been husband and wife once, and they had shared countless moments far more intimate than this. But this was the first time they simply lay beside each other in the same bed, not touching, not speaking.
As her mind spiraled with thoughts, she suddenly felt his arm wrap around her, pulling her into his chest. Eleanor couldn’t keep up the act any longer. She opened her eyes, shoved him away, and sat up in one swift motion.
Nathaniel let out a low chuckle. "Why stop pretending?"
He had done it on purpose.
Eleanor clenched her teeth, her frustration boiling over. Just as she was about to snap at him, Nathaniel got up and said, "Get some rest."
With that, he left the room.
Eleanor sat frozen on the bed, caught off guard. Was all of that just to call her out for faking sleep? What the hell was wrong with him?
She didn’t have an answer, and Nathaniel didn’t return to the room for the rest of the night.
The night passed like that, and Eleanor returned to Serene Street the following day on her own.

###Chapter 81
For the next few days, Nathaniel didn't reach out to her, but Eleanor kept receiving cakes from different dessert shops every day. And not just one cake at a time.
At first, Eleanor tried to refuse them, but the delivery people wouldn't even give her the chance. They would simply tell her their task was to deliver the cake, and whatever she chose to do with it was up to her. With no other choice, Eleanor reluctantly accepted the cakes.
After days of eating them, she finally couldn't take it anymore. She called Nathaniel. "Stop sending me cakes."
"Why? I thought you liked them." Nathaniel sounded unusually cheerful, with a laugh barely contained in his voice.
Eleanor felt like he was doing it on purpose. She liked them, right? So, he would just keep sending them until she threw up.
Eleanor didn't respond and just hung up the phone.
Nathaniel had intended to say more, but he was taken aback for a moment when he heard the click of the call ending. He checked the phone, confirming she had actually hung up. And then, he couldn't help but laugh. This time, it was laughter out of frustration.
He thought Eleanor's temper was really starting to show, or maybe it had always been like this, and she had just stopped pretending around him. But in a way, he supposed it was a good thing. It was better than how lifeless she used to be.
Just as Nathaniel was reflecting on this, there was a knock at the door.
"Mr. Carter, you mentioned wanting me to keep an eye on the auction for Mr. Hughes's painting. It's scheduled for the end of the month in the city of Zenvora," Lucas said, placing an invitation on Nathaniel's desk.
Nathaniel hummed in response.
Lucas wasn't in a hurry to leave. He simply stood there, staring at Nathaniel.
Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "Is there something else?"
"Someone from Carter Manor called. They said they couldn't reach you on your phone. They want you to come for dinner tomorrow night."
"I got it."
After getting a reply from Nathaniel, Lucas seemed to finally relax and turned to leave.
Once the door closed behind him, Nathaniel quickly sent Eleanor a message. Originally, he had planned to ask her to meet at Percy Gardens tonight. But before he hit send, he changed his mind. Instead, he grabbed his keys and stood up.
This was Nathaniel's second time coming to Serene Street. This time, he didn't have to navigate through the winding roads. As soon as he parked his car, he spotted Eleanor at the street corner.
She was sitting on the curb, across from a chubby little girl with braided hair. There was a cake in front of the girl.
A voice from nearby laughed, probably the little girl's mother. "Eleanor, don't give her any more. Didn't you see that her face has gotten even rounder?"
Nathaniel realized then that all the cakes he had delivered were being eaten by that little girl. He didn't say anything. Instead, he honked the horn.
Eleanor turned to look at him, and her brows furrowed slightly.
Nathaniel sat in the car, waiting for her to approach.
Without any other choice, Eleanor exchanged a few words with the mother-and-daughter pair in front of her, then approached the car and got in.
Neither of them spoke at first. But after they had driven some distance, Eleanor couldn't hold back any longer.
"Where are you taking me?" she asked.
"To eat."
Eleanor glanced at the place where Nathaniel had parked, her face blank. "I'm dressed like this. Are you planning to take me to a fancy restaurant?"
Only then did Nathaniel realize what she meant.
He didn't get angry. Instead, he turned to her and asked, "What do you want to eat?"

###Chapter 82
In the end, Eleanor chose a local hotpot restaurant. The steaming, spicy broth and the array of fresh ingredients seemed out of place with Nathaniel in his tailored suit, but she didn’t care.
Truthfully, she wasn’t sure what Nathaniel was trying to achieve. Was he still treating her as a pawn in his game? But his recent actions didn’t quite align with that. Even during their marriage, they rarely dined out alone. He would gift her expensive jewelry, but never something as personal as a cake. Now, his behavior felt almost... like he was trying to win her over.
The thought flickered in her mind, but she quickly dismissed it.
"Do you like this place?" Nathaniel asked, unfazed as he took the seat across from her.
"Yes," Eleanor replied, nodding. "I grew up in Creston City. Spicy food is in my blood."
But after returning to the Harrison family, she was forbidden from indulging in such meals. In their world, food had a hierarchy—spicy dishes were at the bottom. They caused flushed lips, teary eyes, and lingering tastes, all of which were deemed unacceptable at the Harrison dinner table. The same rules applied in the Carter household.
Honestly, Eleanor wasn’t particularly passionate about food. Right now, she was more curious about Nathaniel’s reaction. But he remained stoic, his calm demeanor leaving her slightly disappointed.
She didn’t press further, focusing instead on her meal.
"Here," Nathaniel said suddenly, sliding an invitation across the table.
Eleanor froze when she saw the name on the card. "What’s this?" she asked, her voice steady but her heart racing.
"It’s a charity auction," he replied. "Would you like to attend?"
Eleanor pursed her lips, her silence speaking volumes. Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. "We’ll go together next month."
Her fists clenched under the table. "Why?" she asked, unable to hold back.
"Why what?"
"Why take me?" Eleanor’s voice was sharp. "Mr. Carter, don’t you think you’re crossing a line?"
As soon as the words left her mouth, she noticed the subtle shift in his gaze.
She pushed the invitation back toward him. "Even if I did go, it wouldn’t matter. I don’t have the means to bid on anything."
Nathaniel fell silent, his expression unreadable.
Eleanor didn’t look at him again, focusing on her food.
Then, out of nowhere, Nathaniel chuckled. "Do whatever you want," he said, standing up and walking away.
The invitation remained on the table, a silent reminder of his presence.
It wasn’t until he was out of sight that Eleanor slowly lifted her head, her eyes fixed on the card. It was just a piece of paper, but at that moment, it felt unbearably heavy.
The waiter approached with another dish, about to place it on top of the invitation. Eleanor quickly reached out and grabbed it.
"Sorry, I didn’t see it," the waiter apologized.
Eleanor shook her head. "It’s fine."
"Actually, ma’am, we have a birthday month promotion. If it’s your birthday this month, showing your ID will get you a complimentary dessert."
"It’s not..." Eleanor started to decline, but then she remembered.
In a few days, it would be Nathaniel’s birthday.
The next day, Nathaniel drove himself to Carter Manor. Victoria had gone abroad for a jewelry exhibition, leaving only Clara at the estate.

###Chapter 83
Clara seemed to be in high spirits. When Nathaniel walked in, he overheard her excitedly chatting with someone, her hearty laughter filling the room.
Arthur was the first to notice him. He smiled and said, "Mr. Carter is back."
Nathaniel gave a brief nod in acknowledgment, then turned his attention to Clara, who waved enthusiastically at him. "Come and take a look at this."
"What is it?" Nathaniel asked, his smile lingering for a moment before it faded slightly when his eyes landed on the tablet screen.
"What do you think of this one? She's the Johnson family's daughter. Last time, she was at..."
"Why are you looking at these things?" Nathaniel asked as he straightened up, clearly uninterested.
"What are you saying? Naturally, I'm looking for a potential granddaughter-in-law. Look, I was saying—"
"I'm not thinking about that for now," Nathaniel cut her off.
"I didn't say you had to get married now! I'm just asking you to take a look. And if there's someone suitable, you can get to know them first before getting engaged," Clara protested.
"This time, we need to be more careful. We can't end up with someone like Eleanor again. That was truly a mistake."
Nathaniel's brows furrowed involuntarily. "Why are you suddenly bringing up Eleanor again?"
"Am I wrong? I heard she had an improper relationship with that adoptive father of hers. It makes sense now why she so easily agreed to divorce—she must've been guilty."
Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Who told you this?"
Clara picked up on the shift immediately, and she narrowed her eyes. "What's wrong? You seem upset."
"I'm not upset, but that's already a matter concerning someone who's no longer part of our lives. There's no need to listen to those kinds of stories anymore. And you shouldn't bother with the people who bring them up in front of you, either," Nathaniel said.
"Well... I suppose you're right. But Isabella means well. She comes by every day to chat with me, just trying to keep me company. She must've let something slip, that's all. Don't misinterpret her intentions," Clara explained.
Nathaniel furrowed his brow but merely nodded.
"Don't change the subject. I'm talking about finding a potential granddaughter-in-law," Clara continued, handing the tablet back to him. "Take a look. Don't worry. Caroline picked women of good character this time. What happened with Eleanor won't happen again."
"I already said I'm not thinking about this for now."
"You're just..." Clara seemed ready to say more, but a maid entered with a food container before she could.
"Mrs. Montgomery Senior, Ms. Isabella dropped by and left this for you," the maid said.
"Where is she?"
"She already left."
"Why did she leave? Go and bring her back immediately!"
Clara suddenly became anxious. Not only did she instruct the maid, but she also gave Nathaniel a shove for good measure.
Left with no choice, Nathaniel stepped outside. He spotted Isabella just as she was about to get into her car. "Isabella."
When Isabella heard his voice, she quickly stopped. Then, she slowly looked up with red-rimmed eyes. "Nathaniel..."
Nathaniel stood at the top of the stairs. "Grandma wants you to come in."
"I... It's fine. I just wanted to bring something for her. I probably won't be able to come by as often anymore."
When Isabella finished speaking, Nathaniel didn't respond immediately.
Isabella bit her lip and couldn't hold back any longer. "Nathaniel, I'm getting engaged. Did you know that?"

###Chapter 84
Two days later, it was Nathaniel's birthday.
He had never been one to make a big deal out of birthdays, but when his family insisted on throwing him a party this year, he didn't object.
Eleanor, of course, wasn't going to attend. Instead, Nathaniel sent her a message in the evening, asking her to wait for him at Willow Park.
The party was a grand affair. Nearly everyone who mattered in the social circles had shown up. While the event wasn't open to the public, a few minor celebrities had managed to sneak in.
Since Nathaniel's divorce had become public knowledge, more people seemed eager to get close to him. Their motives were more obvious now—straightforward, even.
Over the course of the night, Nathaniel had his suit ruined three times. By the time the last person spilled a drink on him, he didn't even bother to change. He simply pushed away the hand that tried to touch him.
"Mr. Carter, why don't you let me clean that up for you?" The woman, wearing a strapless gown, looked at him with eyes full of soft, seductive longing.
But Nathaniel wasn't moved. He glanced at her without any change in expression and said flatly, "No need."
Then, he turned to Lucas.
Lucas immediately stepped forward, clearing the woman away. Afterward, Nathaniel gave a quick order, saying, "I'm leaving. See to the guests and make sure they get home safely."
"You're leaving now? Should I have the driver..." Lucas started to ask.
"No. I'll take a cab."
Nathaniel knew that leaving with his car would only attract more attention. At that moment, all he wanted was to slip away quietly and alone.
Before Lucas could say another word, Nathaniel had already made his way toward the exit.
Outside, the neon lights still glittered in the bustling city. Nathaniel turned his head and suddenly thought of his birthday last year.
Back then, Victoria had also insisted on organizing a party for him. But that year, he had just missed his first wedding anniversary with Eleanor. She hadn't taken the initiative to speak to him in days.
On top of that, he had been quite busy during that period. So, he refused Victoria's suggestion. He had thought that the day would pass without any real significance, and he didn't care about the gifts or the well-wishes.
But that night, he received a gift from Eleanor—that lighter. Along with the gift, there was a plate of homemade spaghetti she had made herself.
Maybe it was the alcohol he had drunk that night, but Nathaniel suddenly found himself missing... the taste of that spaghetti.
Eleanor wasn't sure how long she had been waiting at Willow Park.
She had come right after receiving Nathaniel's message. But when she opened her phone, she saw that he was hosting a party. There were even photos of him with celebrities posted on Twitter. Clearly, Nathaniel didn't need her.
Eleanor had initially planned to leave, but then she remembered what the doctor had said to her earlier that day.
Nathaniel had arranged for Diana to be transferred to a new hospital. The doctor there had told her that they had observed some reactions during today's tests, and there might be a chance for her to wake up. Eleanor had waited for eight years.
During that long stretch of time, she had long given up hope. She was convinced it was just her obsession and that she would never see Diana open her eyes again.
But now, they were telling her that Diana might really wake up.
Thinking of this, Eleanor suddenly felt that waiting for a few hours for Nathaniel wasn't so difficult after all. After all... he had done what he promised. So, she would do her best to fulfill what he wanted her to do.

###Chapter 85
The crisp autumn air carried a hint of nostalgia as Eleanor Thompson strolled through the bustling streets of downtown. The city was alive with the hum of activity, yet her mind was elsewhere, lost in the labyrinth of her thoughts. The recent events had left her in a state of emotional turmoil, and she needed a moment of solitude to gather her scattered thoughts.
As she turned the corner, her eyes caught sight of a quaint little bookstore nestled between two towering buildings. The sign above the door read "Whispering Pages," and something about it drew her in. The bell above the door chimed softly as she stepped inside, the scent of old books and freshly brewed coffee enveloping her senses.
Eleanor wandered through the aisles, her fingers brushing against the spines of countless books. Each one seemed to hold a story, a world waiting to be discovered. She paused at a shelf filled with graphic novels, her heart skipping a beat as she recognized the cover of her own work. It was a surreal feeling, seeing her art and words printed and bound, a testament to her journey as a creator.
"Eleanor Thompson, right?" a voice interrupted her reverie. She turned to see a young woman with bright eyes and a warm smile. "I'm a huge fan of your work. Your latest series has been such an inspiration to me."
Eleanor felt a flush of pride and gratitude. "Thank you," she replied, her voice soft but sincere. "It means a lot to hear that."
The young woman hesitated for a moment before continuing. "I was wondering... would you consider signing my copy? It would mean the world to me."
Eleanor nodded, her heart swelling with a sense of accomplishment. She took the proffered book and pen, her hand moving swiftly across the page as she inscribed a personal message. As she handed the book back, she couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. This was why she had poured her heart and soul into her work—to touch lives, to inspire, to connect.
Leaving the bookstore, Eleanor felt a lightness in her step that had been absent for weeks. The encounter had reminded her of the power of her art, the impact it could have on others. She knew the road ahead would be fraught with challenges, but she was determined to face them head-on.
As she walked, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out to see a message from Nathaniel Carter. Her heart skipped a beat as she read his words, a mix of apprehension and hope swirling within her. She knew their relationship was complicated, fraught with past hurts and unspoken truths, but she couldn't deny the pull she felt towards him.
Taking a deep breath, she typed out a reply, her fingers trembling slightly. Whatever lay ahead, she was ready to confront it, to fight for the life and love she deserved. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the city, and Eleanor felt a sense of peace settle over her. The future was uncertain, but for the first time in a long while, she felt ready to embrace it.
Eventually, Eleanor couldn't hold out any longer. Since she couldn't go to the room directly, she collapsed onto the couch to catch a brief nap.
When she woke up, the first thing she felt was the weight of a figure pressing down on her. Eleanor gasped in shock and instinctively opened her mouth to scream, but Nathaniel quickly covered her mouth with his hand.
It was only when his palm pressed down on her that Eleanor realized who it was. Her body, which had been rigid with tension, relaxed at once.
Nathaniel noticed the change and pressed his weight into her even more without hesitation, lowering his head to kiss her lips.
Eleanor could smell the alcohol on him. Just as she was about to pull away, he gripped her chin firmly and bit her lip.
The taste of champagne mingled with the kiss.
Combined with the overzealous energy Nathaniel was showing, Eleanor couldn't help but make a soft protest. She instinctively pushed against his chest, trying to create some distance.
But Nathaniel quickly seized her hand, his movements rough. His eyes locked onto hers, intense and unrelenting.
That look reminded Eleanor of a beast lying in wait in the darkness, and her heart skipped a beat.
However, she didn't choose to fight him head-on. Instead, she arched her body and kissed the corner of his mouth gently. Her soft, tender gesture was like a warm spring breeze, instantly dissolving the aggression in Nathaniel's demeanor.
Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on her, but his movements slowed noticeably.
Eleanor took the initiative and wrapped her arms around his neck, letting out a soft hum as she did.
It was just like Nathaniel had said before—they were from different worlds and had never understood each other completely. But in some ways, they had always been perfectly in sync.
In the end, they ended up in bed.
Nathaniel gripped her waist, pressing his back against her chest, and asked, "Have you forgotten something?"
Eleanor felt like she was about to pass out from sheer exhaustion. Her head was spinning as she asked, "What?"
"You tell me."
Eleanor bit her lip and stayed silent.
Nathaniel waited for a while, but when she didn't make a move, he suddenly let go of her.
Eleanor's legs had lost all strength. She collapsed forward, her body still trembling slightly.
Nathaniel didn't say anything more. After staring at her for a moment, he turned and walked away.
Soon, Eleanor heard the sound of water running from the bathroom. Her eyes were already starting to close. But after a moment of pondering, she pushed herself up from the bed. Then, she opened the drawer of the nightstand.
Inside was the gift she had prepared for him.
It was a pair of delicate black and gold cufflinks. She had bought it the day before at the mall.
Eleanor's fingers lingered on the item, tracing its smooth edges as she hesitated. Finally, she made up her mind and turned toward the bathroom.
But just as she took a step, Nathaniel's phone, which was nearby, lit up.
Eleanor's steps slowed.
Back when she was still his wife, she had never once checked his phone. But now, seeing the screen flash briefly before dimming again, a surge of conflicting thoughts flooded her mind.
In the end, she walked over to it slowly.
She knew his password. As she entered the familiar string of numbers, a photo from an unknown number appeared on the screen.
It was a photo taken outside Carter Manor, and Nathaniel was tightly embracing a woman.
Even though Eleanor could only see the woman's back, she immediately recognized her.
It was Isabella.

###Chapter 86
By the time Nathaniel stepped out of the bathroom, Eleanor was no longer in the bedroom. He paused, momentarily stunned, before exiting the room.
Eleanor was slipping into her shoes by the door.
Nathaniel's expression darkened as he looked at her. "Where are you going?"
"Home," Eleanor replied without even turning to face him.
Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, and the coldness in his eyes intensified. But Eleanor ignored him and opened the door.
The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Nathaniel alone in the spacious house. He turned around, frustration boiling over, and kicked the trash can, sending it toppling over.
Eleanor didn't notice Nathaniel's outburst. She kept the cufflinks in her bag, contemplating tossing them into a trash can as she walked past one. But her hand hovered in midair for a long time, and she couldn't bring herself to let them go.
Just then, her phone rang.
"You're not asleep yet, are you, Elle?" Caroline's voice was brimming with excitement. "I've got some great news for you."
"I'm wide awake. Go on," Eleanor replied, slipping the cufflinks back into her handbag as she spoke. "The television drama rights to your latest comic have been secured. Are you familiar with Magnolia Pictures? It's a major production company!"
Eleanor nodded, though Caroline couldn't see her. "Yeah. That is good news. And?"
Caroline clicked her tongue. "I know you used to be a wealthy man's wife, and this sort of money might not mean much to you. But you can't deny that this is a major collaboration. Plus, once this deal goes through, the rights to your comics will be selling like hotcakes! That's why we have to give it our all this time!"
"Great. Do your best," Eleanor said, her tone casual.
"Wait a minute. Why am I the one who's doing my best? What about you?" Caroline protested.
"Haven't I given you full authority to represent me?" Eleanor countered.
"Well, yes, but we could close the deal much faster if you were directly involved in the negotiations," Caroline argued.
Eleanor stopped in her tracks. "I'm not going."
"Why not?"
"No reason. If you can secure it, great. If not, then forget it."
Eleanor's resolute and carefree attitude left Caroline momentarily speechless.
"Is that all?" Eleanor asked.
"No, wait!" Caroline hurriedly interjected. "How about we meet with the collaborator just once, Elle? I told the editor-in-chief that you'd be there. I won't be able to explain myself if you don't show up."
Eleanor sighed, her resolve wavering. "Fine. Just once."
"Great! I'll set it up and let you know the details," Caroline said, relief evident in her voice.
Eleanor ended the call and continued walking, her thoughts a tangled mess. She knew this collaboration could be a turning point for her career, but the thought of facing Nathaniel again, even indirectly, made her stomach churn.
As she walked, she couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to take another dramatic turn—one she wasn't sure she was ready for.

###Chapter 87
Caroline Wright was a natural at socializing. Though she might have been a bit reserved initially, she quickly found her footing and began to shine. Before long, she was exchanging business cards with nearly everyone in the room.
"Hi, Mr. Moore!" she greeted warmly.
Finally, she spotted the man she had been hoping to meet tonight. She extended her hand with a confident smile. "I'm Caroline from Galaxy Comics. We spoke on the phone earlier."
"Oh, it's you," Derek Moore replied, shaking her hand before his gaze shifted to Eleanor Thompson. He took a moment to scan her from head to toe. "You're the artist behind 'Crabapple Haven,' aren't you?"
Eleanor offered a polite smile. "Yes, that's me."
Derek raised an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity in his expression. "Have we met before? You look... familiar."
"I don't think so," Eleanor replied smoothly. "I don't usually go out much."
Derek still seemed a bit skeptical but quickly moved on. "I've read your comics, and they're perfect for an adaptation. Mr. Knight was particularly impressed after reading them. He even mentioned wanting to meet you both in person."
Eleanor had sensed something was off when Derek extended the invitation to this party. Now, hearing his words, her suspicions were confirmed. Something wasn't right.
Caroline, however, was thrilled. "Really? Where is Mr. Knight now?"
"Speak of the devil," Derek chuckled as he gestured toward a man approaching them. "Mr. Knight, this is the artist behind the comic that caught your attention. She's..."
He paused, turning to Eleanor. "Actually, how should I address you, miss?"
"I'm Caroline Wright," Caroline interjected, stepping slightly in front of Eleanor, shielding her from view.
"No, I mean..." Derek began, but before he could finish, a voice cut in.
"You're Eleanor, aren't you?" The man standing beside Derek spoke up.
Eleanor had been facing away, but now she had no choice but to turn around. Magnolia Pictures was owned by the Knight Group. Julian Whitaker had just returned to the country and hadn't yet taken an official position in the company, which meant the man Derek had mentioned had to be Julian's older brother, Sebastian Knight.
Eleanor forced a smile. "Hi, Sebastian."
Sebastian was dressed in a deep-colored suit, his features sharp and refined. His smile was charming, almost too perfect. "It really is you! I thought you looked familiar from behind. I wasn't sure at first."
Eleanor chuckled lightly, avoiding a direct response.
"How have you been lately?" Sebastian continued, his tone casual. "Are you aware that Julian is getting engaged?"
"Yes," Eleanor replied, her voice steady.
"That makes sense. You'd know, of course. After all, he's getting engaged to Isabella."
Eleanor's expression faltered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure.
Sebastian glanced around the room before continuing. "There's a balcony upstairs with a fantastic view. How about we enjoy some fresh air and a bit of scenery?"
The invitation was unexpected. Eleanor hadn't interacted much with Sebastian, either before or after her marriage to Nathaniel. But with so many eyes on them, she couldn't refuse. She nodded reluctantly.
As the elevator ascended, Sebastian broke the silence. "I seem to recall that you and Julian used to be quite close," he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. "Forgive me for saying this, but I always thought you divorced Nathaniel for Julian's sake."
Eleanor's eyes widened in surprise.
"You might think I'm exaggerating," Sebastian continued, "but you divorced Nathaniel out of the blue not long after Julian returned to the country. People in our circles have been speculating about it ever since."
Eleanor's face remained impassive. "As you said, it's just speculation, Mr. Knight. And speculation, by its very nature, is baseless. Surely, someone as wise as you wouldn't put stock in unfounded rumors, would you?"
Sebastian chuckled, but his eyes held a glint of something unreadable. "Touché, Eleanor. Touché."

###Chapter 88
Eleanor appeared solemn, but Sebastian merely chuckled. "I suppose you're right. My apologies. That was thoughtless of me."
His apology was sincere, making her seem somewhat overbearing in comparison.
Realizing this, Eleanor also apologized, "I got carried away just now."
"It's fine. Your reputation is on the line, after all. It's only natural that you reacted that way. The fault lies with me to begin with."
As Sebastian spoke, the elevator doors slid open. He was absolutely correct about the breathtaking view from the balcony. The distant neon lights flickered gently, and the cool breeze lifted Eleanor's spirits.
Sebastian glanced at Eleanor's reaction, confirming her satisfaction with the spot before continuing, "Actually, I'm quite opposed to the idea of Julian and Isabella being together."
"Julian is my younger brother. Although I wasn't initially willing to accept that fact, blood is thicker than water. As far as I'm concerned, Isabella isn't a suitable choice for a wife."
Sebastian's words took Eleanor by surprise. She had assumed everyone in their circle adored Isabella. Otherwise, her return wouldn't have been met with such widespread rejection.
Needless to say, Isabella had orchestrated much of this. After all, not everyone could maintain such a facade for so long.
"Isabella is far too scheming. The Knight family is complicated enough as it is. If she marries into the family, she's bound to stir up trouble. That's something I don't want to see at all."
"I'm sorry, Eleanor. I know Isabella is your younger sister, but I don't mean to speak ill of her. I'm merely discussing this with you."
Sebastian gave Eleanor an apologetic look and added, "I hope you don't mind."
Eleanor shook her head. Truth be told, it felt like she had gained an ally after hearing Sebastian's words. What struck her as even more bizarre was that Sebastian had confided all of this in her.
"I've read your comic, and I was captivated. I'll have my team offer you the highest possible price for the rights. If you have the time, I hope you'll participate in the scriptwriting."
Eleanor shook her head. "I don't know how to do that."
"It's okay. There's a dedicated development studio at Knight Group. You're a smart woman. I'm sure you'll excel once you spend some time learning the ropes," Sebastian said earnestly.
Eleanor didn't avoid his gaze. "What do you want, Mr. Knight? Why don't you just say it outright?"
Her boldness and straightforwardness made Sebastian raise an eyebrow. However, he quickly smiled again and asked, "What's the matter? Do I have to have ulterior motives to make this offer?"
"It'd be best if you don't, but even if you do, it won't do you any good," Eleanor turned her gaze away and said, "I'm no longer connected to the Harrison family. So, I'm probably of no use to you, Mr. Knight."
"The view here is splendid. Perhaps you should've invited someone more suitable to appreciate it with you. I'll be taking my leave now. Farewell."
With that, Eleanor turned around decisively.
However, at the next moment, Sebastian spoke up again, "How do you know that you don't possess something I desire?"
By the time Eleanor returned to Serene Street, she noticed the Maserati parked by the road. Fortunately, it was very late at night, so it didn't draw any attention.
Eleanor hesitated for a moment before walking over and approaching the car. There wasn't anyone in the backseats, but Ethan was leaning on the steering wheel, asleep.

###Chapter 89
Eleanor tapped lightly on the car window.
"Mrs. Carter!"
Ethan had corrected her multiple times, but Nathaniel still insisted on addressing her this way. By now, Eleanor had given up on correcting him. She nodded slightly. "What are you doing here?"
"Mr. Carter is on a business trip," Ethan explained. "He’s overseas and won’t be back for at least a week. He asked me to give you this invitation and plane ticket."
Eleanor froze. When she looked down, she found the audition invitation Nathaniel had given her already in her hands.
She had left it at Percy Gardens, never expecting him to send it back to her. Not only that, but he had also bought her a plane ticket to Leverton.
As Eleanor stared at the ticket, lost in thought, Ethan spoke up again, "Mrs. Carter?" His tone was hesitant, and he gave her a puzzled look.
Eleanor snapped out of her daze and shook her head firmly. "I’m not taking them."
"But... Mr. Carter prepared these specifically for you. Besides, many people from high society will be there. If you don’t show up, he’ll have to explain your absence, and that could cause unnecessary trouble."
Eleanor remained resolute. Ethan looked at her, clearly at a loss for words.
"I’m sorry you had to come all this way. If that’s all, you can go now. Goodbye." With that, Eleanor turned and walked away.
Ethan opened his mouth as if to say something more, but after a brief pause, he closed it and stayed silent.
Eleanor had just returned to her room when Nathaniel called. The call lasted only two seconds before it abruptly ended, as if it had been a mistake. She didn’t bother calling him back.
However, Sebastian was quick to send her a text. He needed her to do something simple—attend a banquet with him this weekend. But he seemed to anticipate her concerns and sent a follow-up message.
"Don’t worry. It’s a masquerade ball. No one will recognize you."
At first, Eleanor intended to reply to Sebastian’s text, but her fingers hovered over the screen. After a moment of hesitation, she typed, "I can’t think of a reason to help you."
This time, Sebastian sent her a voice message. His voice was warm and deep, with a hint of amusement. "Why not? Think of it as me owing you a favor. You might not need it now, but it could come in handy later."
Sebastian’s words struck a chord with Eleanor. Still, she couldn’t quite understand why he would make such an offer.
Sebastian might not be as prominent as Nathaniel in Coppersville, but he certainly didn’t lack for companions to social events. Yet, he had chosen her and even offered to owe her a favor.
Naturally, Eleanor didn’t think it was because she was particularly charming or that Sebastian had any romantic interest in her. His gaze held no longing, even though he had always been kind and warm toward her.
This meant the offer was purely transactional, and it didn’t seem like she had anything to lose.
With that thought, Eleanor stopped resisting. She replied to his text, "Okay."

###Chapter 90
"Mr. Carter," Lucas greeted when he saw Nathaniel.
Lucas was at Coppersville Airport, and he could tell at first glance that Nathaniel was displeased. He still handed the latter the file in his hand. "This is the data report from Zenvora. They have just sent it earlier. Please have a look at it."
Nathaniel cast a glance at it and asked, "And?"
"Huh?"
"What comes after the market valuation? How are they going to attract the investors? What about the relevant analysis report and media outreach plans?"
Aside from that, Nathaniel asked Lucas a barrage of questions so overwhelming that the latter was stumped. Initially, he was walking, but he suddenly stopped in his tracks. Then, he turned around and looked at Lucas, and his expression was as dark as coal.
"I can look past it if they didn't know me well enough, but you've been working for me a long time now, Lucas. How could you not have figured out something this simple?"
Initially, Lucas thought Nathaniel would take a look at this report and determine if it was worth it to acquire that company. They had been doing things this way the whole time, and Nathaniel had never had any complaints.
Today, however, it was obvious that Nathaniel woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Lucas had no idea why Nathaniel was in such a foul mood, either.
This time, Nathaniel's work trip wrapped up beautifully. That was why he could come back to Coppersville earlier than scheduled.
With that said, Lucas didn't dare to ask Nathaniel about it. He could only apologize over and over.
However, Nathaniel didn't even bat an eye at Lucas. He merely tossed the file back to Lucas before he stormed out of there.
Ethan was already waiting for Nathaniel at the parking lot. When he saw the look on Nathaniel's face, he immediately turned around and swapped glances with Lucas, who shook his head gently.
"Drive," Nathaniel said with a blank face. For a moment there, no one in the car dared say anything.
Lucas sat in the passenger seat. He hesitated for a while before he said, "You also received an invitation today, Mr. Carter. It's from Mr. Chavez. Here's the list of attending guests."
Nathaniel didn't say anything. He merely took the tablet Lucas gave him. It just so happened that a notification popped up at that moment, and it was a video clip.
Nathaniel wanted to ignore it initially, but he instinctively clicked on it when he saw the cover image. A lady wearing a red dress had long and flowing black hair. A golden mask covered most of her face, but he could still see her slightly upturned delicate eyes and the rosy lips below.
A graceful and romantic waltz could be heard as the hems of her skirt swayed gently, giving her a sense of enchanting radiance. It was a look Nathaniel had never seen before.
So, she rejected going to an auction with him because she wanted to go dancing with another man? A masquerade ball, really?
Great. That was just great.
Nathaniel pressed his tongue against the roof of his mouth. After a while, he finally found his voice. He enunciated each word as he spoke, "Take me to Riverscape Hotel."
Isabella was at the masquerade ball as well. Right now, she was gnashing her teeth as she stared daggers at the figure in red.
It wasn't just Isabella. Most of the party guests were attracted by the same figure as well. Isabella couldn't help but grit her teeth harder.
She had a goal when she came to the ball tonight. She didn't want to marry Julian, not even one bit. However, Nathaniel wasn't willing to help her. So, she had no choice but to get a shot at another man. Given Isabella's character, she would never have thought about taking the initiative and approaching a man. However, it was a masquerade ball.
Isabella didn't care about the reason the party host wanted everyone to wear a mask, but she did know that tonight was the best chance for her to put her moves on.
All Isabella had to do was stand out in the ball and "accidentally" reveal her actual identity. Afterward, plenty of men would be after her.

###Chapter 91
Isabella had meticulously planned every detail for tonight, even choreographing a special dance to further her personal agenda. But all her efforts were thwarted by Eleanor.
Eleanor wore a mask, her appearance completely transformed from her usual self. Yet, Isabella recognized her instantly.
At that moment, Isabella's fingers twitched with the urge to rip off Eleanor's mask or push her to the ground. But she restrained herself. After all, she couldn't risk destroying the carefully cultivated image she had maintained for years.
Isabella stood frozen, her teeth grinding in frustration. There was nothing else she could do.
This moment transported Isabella back to when she was fourteen, the day she learned Eleanor would return to the Harrison family.
For the past decade, Isabella had basked in the attention and affection of the Harrisons. She had believed this would be her life forever.
Then Eleanor returned, the biological daughter of Edward and Margaret. Isabella was expected to relinquish everything to Eleanor. The Harrisons might even cast her out. Naturally, Isabella wasn't about to let that happen. She began treating Edward and Margaret with even more care. She noticed the growing rift between Eleanor and her parents and seized the opportunity to widen it.
Isabella deliberately showcased her closeness to Edward and Margaret in front of Eleanor. She made herself appear more thoughtful and affectionate in their eyes.
Having spent ten years with the Harrisons, Isabella knew their habits better than Eleanor ever could. In high society, all her peers were her friends. She had effectively replaced Eleanor as the Harrison heiress.
Yet, when Victoria Sinclair mentioned that Nathaniel would only marry someone with Harrison blood, Isabella felt utterly powerless. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't change this fact.
The same feeling surged within her now. Eleanor effortlessly stole the spotlight and everything Isabella desired.
Isabella realized that what she had taken from Eleanor were things Eleanor never truly cared about. But the things Isabella truly wanted always remained out of reach.
Isabella's glare bore into Eleanor, her eyes filled with venomous hatred.
Eleanor, however, seemed oblivious. She was thoroughly enjoying herself, the mask granting her a rare sense of freedom.
Since that terrifying gaze at twelve, Eleanor had been cautious about revealing herself. But tonight, she didn't have to worry.
After the dance ended, Sebastian invited Eleanor for another. This time, she accepted. The band played a more upbeat tune, energizing the atmosphere.
Sebastian held Eleanor's hand gently. "Do you know how to tango?"
Eleanor giggled, placing her hand on Sebastian's shoulder. "I've learned a bit. Let's hope I don't embarrass myself."
Her smile was radiant, her feet moving gracefully to the rhythm. Her skirt swayed as she danced with bold, fiery steps, captivating everyone, including Sebastian.
As fate would have it, Nathaniel arrived just in time to witness this scene.

###Chapter 92
"Six o'clock. Do you see the man standing there?" Sebastian asked.
He and Eleanor were dancing, their bodies pressed close together. It had been a while since Eleanor had done something this enjoyable, and her breathing became slightly uneven. A thin layer of sweat glistened on her nose.
When she heard Sebastian's question, she glanced over. "Yeah. So?"
"That's Dylan Stewart, the son of Ethan Stewart, CEO of Tidalwaye Holdings. He's been watching you for a while now. I'll introduce you two later, and you'll dance with him for a bit. How does that sound?" Eleanor chuckled. "Why should I?"
"I'm planning to collaborate with Ethan," Sebastian said, not hiding anything from her. He continued, "If you help me this once, I'll give you direct shares in the production of your comic adaptation. If the TV series becomes a hit, you'll get your fair share of the profits too." Eleanor merely chuckled again, seemingly uninterested in Sebastian's offer. He wasn't surprised by her reaction and pressed on, "Of course, money alone won't tempt you. But isn't this a chance to boost your confidence?"
Eleanor didn't retort this time. After a few seconds of thought, she asked, "When you said you needed my help, did you mean just dancing with him?"
"Of course not," Sebastian chuckled. "Tidalwaye Holdings is gaining traction, and many people want to talk to Ethan's son tonight. If you dance with him, I need you to put in a good word for me."
"I don't even know him. What makes you think he'll listen to me?"
"Afterward, I need you to find out if Ethan would be willing to have a private meal with me," Sebastian said casually, making it clear that their deal hinged on her successfully arranging the meeting.
Eleanor fell silent briefly before nodding. "Okay."
Sebastian smiled, satisfied. Just then, their dance ended. Eleanor let go of his hand, gracefully spinning several times before landing with a perfect bow. Applause echoed through the party hall.
Sebastian chuckled and led Eleanor over to Dylan Stewart. "Hi, Mr. Stewart."
Dylan nodded at Sebastian before glancing at Eleanor. After scanning her from head to toe, he asked, "You danced wonderfully. Are you a professional dancer?"
There were many guests at the party, and Sebastian, as the owner of Magnolia Pictures, held a prestigious position in the entertainment industry. It wasn't unusual for him to bring a professional dancer.
"Not at all. I'm just dancing casually," Eleanor replied.
"It doesn't look casual to me," Dylan said.
"I'm just familiar with the previous songs. I might be out of my depth with the next one," Eleanor said, raising her eyes to meet Dylan's gaze with a grin.
"Then would it be inappropriate for me to invite you to dance a third time?" Dylan asked.
Sebastian had intended to introduce Eleanor to Dylan, but it seemed unnecessary now.
Just as Eleanor was about to nod and agree to dance with Dylan, someone appeared beside her and extended a hand. "May I have this dance?" The man's voice was crisp and deep.
It felt like a rock had been thrown into a tranquil lake, disturbing its peace and sending ripples across the surface.
Eleanor couldn't help but tremble. She thought she had misheard. After all, Nathaniel had never liked attending events like these. Besides, wasn't he overseas right now?
But her fleeting hope vanished quickly. He might have been wearing a mask, but she could never mistake those eyes for anyone else's.

###Chapter 93
"You'll have to wait your turn, sir," Dylan said with a smirk as he turned around. Sebastian replied coolly, "I beg to differ. I believe the lady should choose her dance partner." His words left Dylan momentarily speechless.
Sebastian's gaze shifted from Dylan to Eleanor. His eyes, usually calm, now seemed to conceal a storm of suppressed emotions.
Eleanor's hands hung by her sides, her fists clenched tightly. After a brief pause, she suddenly laughed and placed her hand in Dylan's palm, agreeing to dance with him.
Sebastian's expression darkened instantly, his hand clenching into a fist. He wanted to look at Eleanor again, but she had already turned away with Dylan. He gritted his teeth as he watched them walk away.
At that moment, Julian stepped forward and said, "Good evening, Mr. Carter."
Sebastian glanced at him with a blank expression.
Julian continued with a smile, "I didn't expect to see you here tonight. Congratulations on your successful business deal in Gerlandia."
"Thank you," Sebastian replied, his tone dismissive. He didn't even bother to turn and face Julian.
"Did you come here because of Eleanor, Mr. Carter?" Julian asked again.
Only then did Sebastian turn his head slightly to look at Julian. "What are you implying?"
"Nothing. It's just a shame that you two are divorced. She's quite the charming lady, isn't she?" Julian's gaze lingered on Eleanor as he spoke.
At that moment, she and Dylan were already halfway through their dance. Though not overly intimate, their movements were perfectly synchronized, their graceful steps drawing the attention of many in the room.
"What's the matter? Are you interested in her?" Sebastian asked, following Julian's gaze.
"I'd wager no one could remain indifferent to a lady like her."
"Is that so? I seem to recall a rumor about you, Mr. Knight. Since your accident, you've been unable to perform certain... acts. How do you expect to satisfy a lady and make her happy in your condition?" Sebastian retorted.
Julian's smile faltered for a moment, the veins in his neck bulging. But he quickly regained his composure.
"You're well-informed, Mr. Carter. But what gives you the right to say such things? After all, Eleanor didn't seem particularly satisfied during your marriage. Why else would she have divorced you?"
Sebastian fell silent. It had been a long time since he'd been stumped. He rarely engaged in such petty arguments, especially over Eleanor. It was beneath him.
He cast one last glance at Eleanor before turning to leave without hesitation. Just then, someone stepped in front of him.
"May I have this dance?" The woman wore a sleek black gown, her hair elegantly tied up. She looked at him boldly, her intentions clear.
Sebastian initially wanted to refuse, but then something seemed to occur to him. He extended his hand, palm open.
"It would be my honor."

###Chapter 94
Eleanor and Dylan's negotiation went smoothly. In fact, they continued with their second dance instead of leaving, the dance floor still lively even after the first song had ended.
"I don't think I've got your name yet," Dylan couldn't resist asking her.
Raising an eyebrow, she replied, "It's a masquerade ball, I don't see a need for us to exchange names."
"But you already know who I am. Isn't that a little unfair for me?"
"There are plenty of people who are aware of your identity here. There's nothing I can do about it when you're so famous." There was a tinge of resignation in her tone.
However, Dylan didn't appear the slightest bit angry. Instead, he simply asked, "Does that mean that I won't get the chance to take you out for a meal after tonight?"
"Oh, you can still take me out." Eleanor nodded earnestly as she continued, "When the time comes, you can bring your father along, and I'll come with Mr. Knight. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a meal together?"
"So, it turns out you're Sebastian's subordinate all this time. Are you his secretary? Or perhaps his assistant? Could you be one of the talents under his company?" He made his guesses one after another.
But instead of giving him an answer, Eleanor simply asked, "So, what do you say about the meal, Mr. Stewart?"
"Well, I'll definitely accept it if you'll be there."
"Alright," Eleanor agreed without hesitation.
Dylan stared at her for a while before he spoke up, "You're not pulling any tricks, are you? I've remembered you tonight. All it takes is a glance, and I'll know if Sebastian finds someone else to replace you."
Eleanor only smiled in response.
"What, don't you believe me?" he asked.
"I do," she replied with a serious nod. "Thank you for your favor, Mr. Stewart. Rest assured, I'll be there as promised. As for whether you can recognize me... well, that depends on how sharp your eyes are."
"I'm starting to get more curious about your identity." Using the dance steps to his advantage, Dylan took a long stride toward Eleanor as he spoke.
Startled, she was just about to step back when someone suddenly reached their leg out and stepped on Dylan's foot. Infuriated, Dylan immediately raised his head and snapped, "Who—"
The chandelier overhead suddenly flickered just as his words fell. The next moment, all the lights in the banquet hall went out. A few startled screams instantly rang out in the venue.
A frown crossed Dylan's face. He was just about to grab Eleanor's hand when someone suddenly bumped into him from behind. In the end, he only managed to grasp at thin air.
It didn't take long for the lights in the banquet hall to come back on. The incident only happened within a span of several seconds. But by the time Dylan looked over, he realized that the person before him had changed.
At the same time, a woman who was dressed in a black gown stared back at him in shock.
Eleanor had no idea who had dragged her away. She wanted to struggle, but the person quickly covered her mouth with his hand.
The fear of the unknown only caused her panic to grow amid the darkness. Her mask fell to the ground when she struggled to break free.
The man slid his hand down her waist as his palm pressed against her bare skin. Memories of that haunting nightmare instantly resurfaced in her mind as her struggles to break free grew even more intense.
She was just about to scream when the man grabbed her chin and moved in to kiss her.
Seizing the opportunity, Eleanor immediately landed a kick at his crotch.
The man let out a groan and released his grip on her hands.
Just then, the lights overhead came back on.
"Eleanor," the man gritted out coldly.

###Chapter 95
The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the sprawling gardens of the Carter estate. Eleanor Thompson stood by the window, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns of the lace curtains. The room was silent, save for the soft ticking of the antique clock on the mantelpiece. Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, each one more tumultuous than the last.
Nathaniel Carter had been distant lately, his usual composed demeanor replaced by a cold, almost mechanical efficiency. It was as if the man she had once known had been replaced by a stranger. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, something that went beyond the usual strains of their complicated relationship.
The sound of footsteps in the hallway pulled her from her reverie. She turned just as the door creaked open, revealing Nathaniel's tall, imposing figure. His expression was unreadable, his eyes dark and inscrutable.
"Eleanor," he began, his voice low and measured. "We need to talk."
Her heart skipped a beat. Those words never boded well. She nodded, gesturing for him to take a seat. He remained standing, his hands clasped behind his back.
"I've been thinking about our situation," he continued, his gaze fixed on a point just beyond her shoulder. "It's clear that things between us have become... untenable."
Eleanor's breath caught in her throat. She had expected many things, but not this. Not now. "Nathaniel, what are you saying?"
He finally met her eyes, and for a brief moment, she thought she saw a flicker of emotion. But it was gone as quickly as it appeared. "I'm saying that perhaps it's time we consider... ending this marriage."
The words hung in the air like a death sentence. Eleanor felt as though the ground had been ripped out from under her. She had always known that their marriage was built on shaky foundations, but she had never imagined it would come to this.
"Ending it?" she echoed, her voice barely above a whisper. "Just like that?"
Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "It's not as simple as that, Eleanor. You know that. But we can't continue like this. It's not fair to either of us."
She wanted to argue, to plead, to do anything to change his mind. But deep down, she knew he was right. Their marriage had been a facade from the beginning, a union born out of duty rather than love. And yet, the thought of letting go was almost too much to bear.
"Is there someone else?" she asked, the question slipping out before she could stop it.
Nathaniel's expression hardened. "That's not what this is about."
"But is there?" she pressed, her voice rising. "Is there someone else, Nathaniel?"
He didn't answer immediately, and that silence spoke volumes. Eleanor felt a surge of anger, of betrayal, but also of something else—something that felt dangerously like relief.
"Eleanor," he said finally, his tone softening. "This isn't about anyone else. It's about us. About what we've become."
She turned away, unable to look at him any longer. The tears that had been threatening to fall finally did, streaming down her cheeks in silent rivers. She felt his hand on her shoulder, but she shrugged it off.
"Please," she whispered. "Just... go."
For a moment, he hesitated, as if he wanted to say more. But in the end, he simply nodded and left the room, closing the door softly behind him.
Eleanor sank to the floor, her body trembling with the weight of everything she had just lost. The future she had once imagined was now nothing more than a distant memory, shattered beyond repair.
But even as she grieved, a small, stubborn part of her refused to give up. She had survived worse, and she would survive this too. Whatever came next, she would face it head-on, just as she always had.
And as the first stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Eleanor Thompson made a silent vow to herself: she would not let this be the end. Not for her. Not ever.
Only then did Eleanor realize something was amiss. She slowly withdrew her foot, which had been poised to deliver another kick to Nathaniel's crotch.
His gaze was icy, even behind the mask. It felt as though he wanted to tear her apart, piece by piece.
Eleanor held his gaze for a long moment before finally breaking the silence. "Why... Why did you bring me here?"
"What's the matter? Are you upset that I've ruined your plans?" he sneered.
Nathaniel's expression darkened as his grip on her chin tightened. Clearly, he was still holding a grudge over her earlier rejection of his dance invitation. The kick she had just delivered only added fuel to the fire.
His grip was so strong it felt as though he might crush her bones.
Eleanor winced in pain, her brows furrowing. She tried to push his hand away, but Nathaniel pinned her hands down. Then, he pressed his knee between her legs, trapping her.
"You're certainly quite popular, Ms. Thompson," he said, his gaze fixed on her. "I never realized you had the talent to be a socialite."
In the past, Eleanor had always been quiet and reserved. She only revealed a different side of herself on rare occasions.
Initially, Nathaniel had thought he was the only one who could see that side of her. But now, it seemed he was wrong.
He felt deceived—no, played with.
Eleanor's expression shifted slightly at his words, but she quickly masked it with a smile. "So, in your eyes, does dancing two songs with someone make me a socialite?"
"It wouldn't be the same for others. But you're different. Don't you think it's inappropriate for you to smile like that at a man?" he questioned.
"What's different about me?" she shot back instinctively.
As soon as the words left her mouth, realization dawned on her. She turned her gaze toward him slowly. "What do you mean by that?"
Nathaniel didn't answer. Instead, he merely narrowed his eyes at her.
His silence confirmed her suspicions. It was exactly as Eleanor had thought.
The only thing that set her apart from others was the fact that she had nearly been assaulted.
After Samuel had been arrested, Eleanor had overheard people saying that the reason she had almost been assaulted was because she had been promiscuous.
But what had stayed with her the most was that Nathaniel had once told her she wasn't at fault.
They had already been divorced by then, and she no longer had any feelings for him. But his words had given her immense courage. For once, she had felt as though she wasn't alone.
But now, he was reprimanding her for smiling at a man. It turned out that the words he had spoken back then were just a means to placate her.
Deep down, he also believed she was at fault for the incident. That was why he told her not to smile at others like that.
Eleanor's eyes reddened as she stared at Nathaniel. Her hands went slack under his grip.
His hold on her loosened as he realized what he had just said. But before he could react, she pulled her hand free and slapped him. The sound echoed sharply in the air.
Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. He pinned her hands down again, his lips pursed, his gaze icy.
Eleanor didn't back down. She stood her ground, chin held high, meeting his gaze defiantly.
Her makeup gave her a daring edge that night, and her slightly reddened eyes added a delicate charm to her appearance.
Something stirred in Nathaniel's heart. Suddenly, he let out a cold scoff before bending to lift her into his arms.

###Chapter 96
Before Alexander could fully grasp the situation, the small table was already laden with an array of dishes.
"You made so much," Alexander remarked with a gentle smile. "What's this?"
"Pumpkin soup," Clara replied.
She picked up the bowl, scooped a spoonful, blew on it to cool it, and brought it to Alexander's lips. "Try it."
Alexander smiled and lowered his gaze, but his smile faltered as he noticed something. "What happened to your hand?"
There was a blister on Clara's right index finger.
Clara tried to hide it, but it was too late. She sighed and admitted, "I... accidentally scalded myself in the kitchen earlier. It's nothing serious, just a small blister."
Alexander's eyes softened, tinged with concern. "Does it hurt?"
Clara shook her head. "Not at all."
Alexander took a sip of the soup, then gently held Clara's wrist, lowering his head to blow softly on the blister. After a few gentle breaths, he looked up at her, his eyes filled with worry. "Don't lie to me. Burns always hurt."
Clara's eyes glistened slightly. "It really doesn't hurt. Compared to your injuries, this is nothing." Alexander reached out to pinch her cheek. "Clara, if you get hurt, I feel the pain. Even the smallest injury isn't okay."
Clara bit her bottom lip lightly, her eyelashes fluttering as she instinctively acted coy. "Alexander..."
Her soft, delicate voice was too much for Alexander to resist.
He pulled her closer, kissing her smooth forehead, her flushed cheeks, and finally her tender lips.
Clara's ears burned, her heart melting with sweetness.
After a moment, she pressed her hand against Alexander's chest, creating some distance between them. "Alexander, eat first, or it will get cold."
Alexander's eyes glinted playfully as he teased, "Alright. We'll kiss again after eating?"
Clara let out a small hum, lowering her gaze and ignoring his mischief.
Alexander took a bite of the carrots.
Clara watched him nervously. "How is it? Does it taste okay?"
Alexander's eyes sparkled with amusement as he teased, "It's delicious. They say the way to a person's heart is through the stomach. Is my Clara here trying to win my heart with food?"
Clara puffed up her cheeks, pretending to glare at him. "If I can't win over your stomach, I can't have your heart?"
Alexander chuckled, pinching her cheeks again. "How could that be? Just by standing there, you already have my heart."
Clara let out a soft huff, but her eyes shone with sudden joy.
Alexander finished every bite of the meal Clara had prepared, not leaving behind even a drop of soup.
After the meal, he leaned against the headboard to rest.
Clara carefully collected the dishes, preparing to wash them.
Alexander said, "Let the nurse or housekeeper handle it."
Clara shook her head. "It's fine. Not a big deal."
Alexander's voice was low, carrying a hint of tenderness that was difficult to detect. "By the way, when did you learn to cook?"
Clara was a pampered young lady who had never needed to lift a finger. Cooking and washing dishes were tasks far from her everyday life.
Clara replied, "Just in the past couple of days."
Before Alexander could press further, the room door was pushed open, and a group of people entered. Amelia was in the front, carrying a food container. "Alexander, I brought you some food." Behind her were Ryan, Charlotte, and the hired caregiver.
Amelia's gaze swept over Clara, and she smiled. "Clara, you're here too. Have you eaten? Would you like to join us? The housekeeper just prepared it."
Clara smiled and declined. "Thanks for the offer, but I just ate." Alexander followed suit. "I also just had my meal."

###Chapter 97
Clara froze for a moment before noticing the thermal container in Charlotte's hand. "Charlotte, you brought food for Alexander?"
"Yes."
Clara looked at Alexander. "Are you full? Do you want to eat more? I brought all your favorites."
Alexander replied, "There's no need. Charlotte's homemade food suits my taste perfectly. I finished it all." Hearing this, Clara flashed a smile. "Alright. It's fine as long as you've eaten."
Ryan gave the couple a mischievous look. "Oh? Charlotte made it herself?"
He set down the fruit basket and supplements he was carrying, looking at Alexander with a teasing grin. "Lucky bastard."
Alexander replied, "Yeah, it's a joy that you single folk wouldn't understand."
Ryan's smile froze. "Alright, fine. One of these days, I will find myself a girlfriend too, just so I can flaunt our love in front of you every day and drive you crazy."
Amelia widened her eyes in surprise. "Charlotte, you know how to cook?"
Charlotte smiled. "I just learned it."
"Love is truly magical," Amelia exclaimed in disbelief as she circled Charlotte teasingly.
"I still recall that time back in college when you fried an egg for me. When I took a bite, it was crunchy.
You said that eggshells were a good source of calcium. And now you've learned to cook? Incredible."
Charlotte awkwardly touched her nose. "Eggshells do have calcium in them, though."
Amelia laughed in exasperation. "Fine, fine. You serve eggs with shells to your best friend but whip up fancy meals for your fiancé?"
Charlotte's eyes crinkled with a smile. "I will make you a fancy meal next time."
Amelia grinned. "I will hold you to that."
Ryan gave her a sideways glance. "Charlotte is cooking for her romantic fantasies. What are you butting in for?"
Amelia lifted her chin haughtily. "Mind your own business."
The group bantered for a while, and the atmosphere grew lively.
Clara chuckled along, her gaze landing on the thermal container in Charlotte's hand. "Charlotte, are you going to wash this?"
"Yes," Charlotte responded.
"Give it to the caregiver," Clara said, signaling to the caregiver nearby.
The caregiver quickly stepped forward. "Ms. Bennett, let me take care of this."
Charlotte passed the thermal container to the caregiver.
Clara didn't stay long. She happened to receive a phone call and left in a hurry.
Charlotte also had some work to deal with in the afternoon, so she left after spending some time with Alexander.
Just as she exited the hospital, she met someone she didn't want to see.
Julianna walked toward her. "Charlotte, I finally get to see you. Why haven't you been home the past few days?"
The "home" she mentioned was Marina Apartment. That was the only address Julianna knew of.
Charlotte looked at her warily. "What are you doing here?"
Excitement gleamed in Julianna's eyes as she stared at her. "I heard that your engagement ceremony was canceled?"
Charlotte responded coldly, "What does that have to do with you? Move."
Julianna blocked her path. "Charlotte, do you believe in fate? The engagement ceremony being disrupted shows that God forbids this engagement."
Charlotte sneered. "It's the 21st century. How have superstitions like yours not been eradicated?" Julianna didn't feel offended. No one was happier than her to see the engagement ceremony get disrupted.
And to top it off, Alexander had been stabbed and nearly died. Even fate seemed to be on her side!
A smile surfaced in her eyes. "Charlotte, you know who the attacker was? She's a crazed admirer of Alexander's, and she has been pursuing him for ten years. Many people saw her at the engagement banquet that day. The news is spreading across Rivertown as we speak."
She leaned closer. "Tell me, how could any man remain indifferent to a woman chasing him so passionately for a decade?"

###Chapter 98
Alexander's words echoed in Clara's mind like a haunting melody, leaving her restless and uneasy. Even the next day, when she visited Ethan, her thoughts were still clouded with worry.
"Clara, what's troubling you?" Ethan asked, his voice gentle yet probing.
She blinked rapidly, turning her face away. "What... What's the deal with Vanessa?"
He smirked, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "Are you jealous?"
She puffed out her cheeks, feigning indifference. "Of course not. You've never mentioned her before, so I was just curious."
Remembering how Vanessa had kidnapped Amelia and even tried to stab her, Clara's anger flared on top of her jealousy. "How did you attract such a crazy admirer? She's completely out of her mind!"
Ethan gestured for her to come closer. "Clara, come here."
She obeyed, moving closer and sitting by his bedside.
Taking her hand, Ethan looked at her seriously. "She was my high school classmate. She pursued me relentlessly back then, but I rejected her clearly. Later, she attended the same university as me and continued chasing me, but I never gave her any hope."
She lowered her eyes and pouted. "That's it?"
Ethan pinched her cheeks playfully. "That's really it. I hardly spoke to her, and we never even exchanged contact information."
Clara remained silent for a moment before asking, "Then why did she persist for so long? Ten years isn't short, after all. It's not mere days or months."
He chuckled helplessly. "How would I know? Everyone around me knows how indifferent I have been to her. We barely spoke a few sentences in ten years."
She leaned closer and huffed. "How many sentences are 'barely'?"
He laughed softly. "Maybe five or six sentences..."
"What could you possibly have to say in so many sentences?" Her tone turned unreasonable.
Seeing her jealous expression, Ethan found her utterly adorable.
His gaze softened, overflowing with affection. "Nothing much. She confessed a few times in high school, and I rejected her twice. After that, we rarely spoke."
"You really didn't feel anything for her?" Clara asked skeptically. "She's pretty, after all."
"Nope," Ethan said firmly, gazing at her intently. "There's already someone in my heart. There's no room for anyone else."
She feigned ignorance. "Someone else? Who's that?"
He gleamed with amusement. "Who do you think?"
She mumbled vaguely, "How would I know if you don't tell me?"
In Ethan's eyes, her sulking was pure coquettishness, melting his heart entirely. He couldn't resist. With a smile, he said, "There's no one else but you."
Clara turned her face away, avoiding his gaze. "She confessed to you in high school. I was so young back then."
He couldn't have liked her at that age, could he?
Ethan explained, "I didn't think about dating in high school."
Hearing that, Clara grew curious. She looked into Ethan's eyes, her almond-shaped eyes sparkling. "When did you start liking me?"
He said, "At first, I only saw you as a little sister. I'm not sure when it changed."
She pressed on. "Not even an approximate time?"
"If I had to guess, it was when you were in high school. When Dylan Carter harassed you, I realized something was different after I hit him."
She pursed her lips. "You hid it well."
Ethan ruffled her soft hair. "I had to wait for you to grow up."
His eyes revealed a hint of sorrow.
"When you graduated from college, I went to your father to propose a marriage alliance. But you didn't agree and ran away from home."
Feeling guilty, she looked away. "I thought my dad was sacrificing me for the company's benefit. How would I know you had this planned all along? You didn't tell me, and I felt so wronged..."
He suddenly put on a pitiful expression. "Ouch, my wound hurts."
Panicked, Clara immediately leaned over his waist. "What's wrong? Did you accidentally touch it? I'll call the nurse."
He pulled her into his arms just like that, resting his chin on the top of her head. His voice was low and gentle. "Just hold me and it won't hurt anymore."
She chuckled. "You're teasing me?"
"No," Ethan murmured, stroking her hair gently. "It really hurts, so be good. Let me hold you and the pain will go away."
Clara nuzzled her face against him, taking in his presence.
...
When Julianna returned from dinner, she was stopped in the hotel lobby.
"Julianna."
She turned toward the voice and saw a young woman she didn't recognize.
The woman was dressed in luxury brands from head to toe.
"You are?" Her eyes were full of confusion as she walked toward her.
The woman leaned against the couch, tilting her head slightly to look at her. "You will know soon enough."
Julianna sat in front of her and asked again, "Who are you?"
She replied, "The Reed family's adopted daughter, Valerie."
"The Reed family?" She frowned and continued, "Ethan's sister?"
"That's right." She smiled. "How about considering a partnership with me?"
Julianna looked puzzled. "What kind of partnership?"
She smirked. "One that will break Ethan and Clara up."
Julianna eyed her suspiciously. "Why should I trust you?"
She let out a soft laugh. "Because I love Ethan. No one wants to break them up more than I do."
Valerie handed her a business card. "I know you've been looking for investments recently. Contact this number, and they will invest in the Lopez Group."
She added, "But if you want the Lopez Group to be invested in, you have to work with me to break them up."
Julianna glanced at the card. "Even without the investment, I will find a way to break them up. Clara can only ever be mine."
She curled her lips into a smile. "Then, Ms. Lopez, I hope we get along."
Julianna looked thoughtful. "I will verify your identity before contacting you."
"No worries." She offered her contact information. "We'll stay in touch."

###Chapter 99
Lately, Julianna had been tirelessly seeking investments. The companies in Rivertown were unlikely to invest in Lopez Group, so she had to look elsewhere. Most of her time recently was spent in hotels and on airplanes.
That day, she had just returned to Rivertown, and Ethan came to pick her up.
It was early evening, and they were on their way to dinner.
At a red light, Ethan glanced at Julianna, who was flipping through old photos of her and Clara.
Ethan's lips parted as if he wanted to say something, but he hesitated.
Before he could speak, Julianna leaned over and showed him her phone, her expression soft and full of emotion. "Look at how happy we were back then."
Ethan's expression grew complicated.
Last time, Julianna had asked him to buy a ring, saying she intended to win Clara back.
At the time, Julianna mentioned that Clara was about to get engaged. She had also said it would be immoral to go after someone else's fiancée.
Since returning to Rivertown, he didn't dare ask Julianna about Clara.
Ever since Clara left Haverford, Ethan had never seen her, nor did he know anything about her fiancé. However, during his time spent with Julianna recently, he could sense that his friend smiled far less often. In the past, Julianna had always been the life of the party at gatherings. But now, she would drink alone in silence more often than not. When drunk, she would call out Clara's name and be filled with sorrow.
At that moment, Julianna was looking at their old photos with a rare smile, seemingly lost in her memories, deceiving herself to no end.
Ethan felt like Julianna was losing herself. He wanted to ask if she'd given her the ring but couldn't bring himself to say it.
In the end, Ethan could only let out a deep sigh.
The red light turned green just like that.
The driver stepped on the gas, and the car moved forward.
Finally, Ethan couldn't hold back any longer and said, "Julianna, as your friend, I have to advise you. You had a great relationship with Clara, but she has a fiancé now, so don't do anything immoral."
"Immoral?" Julianna scoffed dismissively. "I've told you before. I don't care about morality. I just want her by my side."
Ethan frowned in displeasure and continued to advise, "She's about to get married, so how could you—"
Julianna remained indifferent. "Ethan, don't you know how things are in our circle? How many married couples do you know play around outside? Isn't that pretty common?"
Ethan was silent for a moment before replying, "Common doesn't make it right."
Julianna's face darkened, and she didn't respond.
Ethan said nothing more. He realized that someone without a sense of morality couldn't be restrained by it.
To him, Julianna was pathetic. She didn't cherish Clara when she had her, and only regretted it after losing her.
The car soon entered the bustling Rivertown area. It was rush hour, and traffic was heavy with a long line of cars.
Julianna casually leaned back, staring idly out of the window, lost in her thoughts.
Suddenly, she spotted a familiar figure.
"Stop the car!" Julianna shouted.
Ethan was confused as he asked, "What?"
Seeing Julianna stare out of the window, Ethan followed her gaze and froze.
In an instant, he understood why Julianna demanded the car to stop.
On the sidewalk, Clara was walking with a man.
Both of them were walking in their direction, close enough for their faces to be clearly seen.
The man was handsome, exuding an air of refinement. His attire was impeccable, clearly indicating he wasn't an ordinary person.
They were talking and laughing, their demeanor intimate.

###Chapter 100
Julianna muttered softly, "Discharged so soon? Tough life, indeed."
Ethan guessed that man was probably Clara's fiancé.
Julianna opened the car door and got out, walking toward Clara.
...
Alexander was discharged after a week.
During the week in the hospital, he had been under Clara's strict supervision, eating light and bland meals every day.
Initially, he didn't mind, but having to eat those plain dishes at every meal was wearing him out. After much persuasion and pleading, Clara finally agreed to improve their meal by eating out.
Thus, Clara brought him to a restaurant in the bustling heart of the city.
It was a well-known establishment in Rivertown, a place where both Alexander and Clara had grown up eating.
It was peak dining hour, and the hall was packed to full capacity. A long line of people waited outside for their turn.
Clara had made a reservation in advance. She scanned a code at the entrance and was about to follow the server inside when somebody called out to her.
"Clara!" Ethan called.
She turned her head, and the first person she saw was Ethan.
Then, she saw Julianna, and her brows furrowed.
Why was she there? She couldn't help but think she was stalking her.
Julianna and Ethan walked toward them.
Ethan greeted her first. "Long time no see, Clara. You're from Rivertown too? Why haven't you mentioned it before?"
Ethan had only just heard from Julianna that Clara was from Rivertown and getting engaged, just a few days ago. He knew nothing else.
He didn't know Clara was from the Bennett family, and that the man beside her was the CEO of Reed Corporation.
The incident at the Somerton family banquet was disgraceful. Wendy and Yanis had accused Clara of stealing, offended the Somerton family and were thrown out by security. It was an event that would never be spoken of.
As a result, no one in their circle was yet to know of Clara's family background.
Ethan was one of the few in Julianna's circle with proper values, someone who didn't look down on "poor and shabby Clara".
Sometimes, he even lent Clara a hand. Because of that, Clara held a favorable impression of him. When they met, she was polite and cordial.
Clara nodded slightly at Ethan and replied, "Long time no see."
"And this is?" Ethan asked knowingly.
Clara smiled and introduced, "This is my fiancé, Alexander."
"Alexander!" Ethan exclaimed in shock, his eyes wide like saucers. "You're... You're Alexander Reed?"
He had never seen Alexander in person, nor were there interviews and reports about him online. But his name was legendary.
Almost everyone in their social class knew of him.
He was Rivertown's finest.
Alexander's face was cold, and his jaw tight. His gaze was sharp like an unsheathed blade locking onto Julianna, as if ready to tear her apart. "Can I help you?"
Ethan involuntarily shivered.
The air Alexander exuded was overwhelming. It was no wonder he was Rivertown's most elite.
His natural dominance and air of authority were qualities other pampered young men could never emulate.
Ethan scratched his head awkwardly and asked, "Could I be fortunate enough to join you for a meal?"
Clara was starving, having been too busy at noon to eat properly, managing only a piece of bread. She just wanted to go inside and order quickly.
"You can. She can't," Clara said, pointing at Julianna. Julianna's expression turned complicated.
